none	none	 There would have been no rest for me 
4172-23246-0002	train-other-500	Claire Beecher Kummer It takes much longer to write a Geography than according to Moses
4172-23246-0003	train-other-500	it took to create the World which it is the Geographer s business to describe and since the Critic has been added to the list of created beings it is no longer the fashion for the Author to pass judgment on his own work
4172-23246-0004	train-other-500	Let us imagine however that concealed in the cargo of Hypothetic Nebula destined for the construction of the Terrestrial Globe was a Protoplasmic Stowaway
4172-23246-0005	train-other-500	that sprang to being in the shape of a Critic just as the work of Creation was finished Would it not be interesting to speculate upon that Critic s reception of the freshly made World
4172-23246-0006	train-other-500	We may be sure that he would have found many things not to his liking technical defects such as the treatment of grass and foliage in green instead of the proper purple
4172-23246-0007	train-other-500	the tinting of the sky which any landscape painter will tell you would be more decorative done in turquoise green than cobalt blue Like the foolish Butterfly in the Talmud who
4172-23246-0008	train-other-500	to impress missus Butterfly stamped his tiny foot upon the dome of King Solomon s Temple our Critic might have declared the World Too flimsy in construction He would certainly have found fault with the Solar System and the Plumbing
4172-23246-0009	train-other-500	the absence of heat in Winter when there is the greater need of it and the paucity of moisture in the desert places where it never rains The comicality of the Ape family might have provoked
none	none	 a reluctant smile but much more likely a lecture on the impropriety of descending to caricature in a serious work Illustration THE FIRST CALENDAR The Creation of Heaven Earth in Six dayes Gen I THE YEAR I first Sunday first Wednesday first Monday first Thursday first Tuesday first Friday At best our Critic would have pronounced the freshly made World the work of a beginner conceding perhaps that he showed promise and might go far 
4172-23246-0010	train-other-500	and if he wished to be very impressive indeed he would pretend that he had penetrated the veil of Anonymity and hint darkly that he detected evident traces of a Feminine Touch
4172-23246-0011	train-other-500	In that however our Critic would only have been anticipating for is there not at this very moment on the press a Suffrage edition for women only of the Rubaiyat
none	none	 in which one verse is amended to read thus The ball no question makes of Ayes or Nos But right or left as strikes the Player goes And SHE who tossed it down into the field SHE knows about it all 
4172-23246-0013	train-other-500	SHE knows SHE knows PREFACE STRICTLY PRIVATE For the Reader Only DEAR READER This is for you and you only
none	none	 We have concealed it between chapters one and two so that it will not meet any eye but yours 
4172-23246-0014	train-other-500	We have a confession to make it would be useless to attempt concealment we have the Digression habit
none	none	 We have tried every known remedy but we fear it is incurable All we ask Gentle Reader is that when we stray too far you will favour us with a gentle reminder CHAPTER II A LONG JUMP Illustration It is a long jump from Moses the author of the first work on Geography to Peter Simple 
4172-23246-0016	train-other-500	When the acrobatic reader has fetched his breath and looks back at the fearsome list of Geographers he has skipped Strabo Anaximander Hecatoeus

none	none	 he may well be thankful to find he has fallen upon his feet 
4172-23246-0019	train-other-500	The Geographer s task is endless
none	none	 The Planet he endeavours to portray is perpetually changing its appearance After thousands and thousands of years it is no nearer completion than it was in the beginning Illustration The Sea with its white teeth bites the edges of the continents into new shapes as a child bites the edges of a biscuit 
4172-23246-0020	train-other-500	The glaciers file away the mountains into valleys and plains Beneath the ocean busy insects are building the foundations of new continents
none	none	 and 
4172-23246-0021	train-other-500	under the earth Fiery Demons are ready at all times to burst forth and help to destroy the old ones It really begins to look as if this Planet would never be finished
4172-23246-0022	train-other-500	In the first chapter of his geography Moses tells us there were only two people in the world Today we are preparing to put up the standing room only notice
4172-23246-0023	train-other-500	In another thousand years for aught we know the earth may be going round dark and tenantless and bearing the sign To Let
none	none	 What does it matter to us What are we but microscopic weevils in the mouldy crust of earth Sufficient unto the day is the weevil thereof CHAPTER III THE GIDDY GLOBE Men of Science who delight in applying harsh terms to things that cannot talk back have called this Giddy Globe an Oblate Spheroid 
4172-23246-0025	train-other-500	Francis Bacon called it a Bubble Shakespeare an Oyster Rossetti a Midge and W S Gilbert addresses it familiarly as a Ball
4172-23246-0026	train-other-500	Roll on thou ball roll on Through pathless realms of Space Roll on What though I m in a sorry case What though I cannot meet my bills
none	none	 What though I suffer toothache s ills 
4172-23246-0027	train-other-500	What though I swallow countless pills Never you mind Roll on It rolls on But these people belong to a privileged class that is encouraged even paid
4172-23246-0028	train-other-500	to distort the language and they must not be taken too literally The Giddy Globe is really quite large not to say obese
4172-23246-0029	train-other-500	Her waist measurement is no less than twenty five thousand miles In the hope of reducing it the earth takes unceasing and violent exercise
4172-23246-0030	train-other-500	but though she spins round on one toe at the rate of a thousand miles an hour every day and round the sun once a year she does not succeed in taking off a single mile
4172-23246-0031	train-other-500	or keeping even comfortably warm all over No wonder the globe is giddy QUESTIONS Explain the Nebular Hypothesis
none	none	 State briefly the electromagnetical constituents of the Aurora Borealis and explain their relation to the Hertzian Waves Define the difference between the Hertzian Wave and the Marcel Wave CHAPTER IV THE USE OF THE GLOBE What is the Earth for Nobody knows Some say the Earth was made to supply the wants of Man but as Man is part and parcel of the Earth herself dust of her dust mould of her mould it does not answer the question Illustration THE FRIENDLY COW From an instantaneous photograph of animal cracker Owing to the high price of living the cow was partially eaten by the author before the photograph could be taken To be sure the Earth produces the Tobacco Plant and many other things that we classify among the needs of Man including the Friendly Cow She walks among the flowers sweet And chews and chews and chews And turns them into friendly meat And pleasant boots and shoes But the Friendly Cow may in her secret heart regard the classification as anything but friendly For all we know in the hidden scheme of Creation the Cow may herself be the subject for ultimate evolution into the Perfect Being and Man to reverse Darwin descending through the Ape to ever lower planes only a discarded experiment And the Tobacco Plant In the course of time there may be no Tobacco Plant Should the American People be again tempted to wage a World War for Freedom they may find on their return that the Tobacco Plants have gone to join the Grape Vines of California Our only hope will then be that smoking is permitted in Hea The Author is digressing The Reader QUESTIONS What is Friendship Why is the Cow friendly Is the Oyster friendly When Prohibition is applied to tobacco will cigars containing less than one half of one per cent tobacco be permitted CHAPTER V THE EQUATOR Illustration The Earth is self centred Poised on an imaginary toe she pirouettes round her self centre at the rate of over a thousand miles an hour We say imaginary toe because the Earth owing to the enormous size of her waist has never been able to see it To anyone with a waist measurement of twenty five thousand miles the very existence of toes is purely problematical To wear an actual belt round a waist of such dimensions would be impossible even if it could be of any use Instead therefore the Earth wears round her middle an imaginary line called the Equator To give this imaginary belt some excuse for existence we have depicted the Earth in an imaginary ballet skirt which without in any way hampering her movements complies with the strict regulations pertaining to feminine attire Being self centred the Earth has naturally an exaggerated sense of self esteem Other Spheres of equal or greater importance are referred to as Luminaries and supposed to exist chiefly for the purpose of furnishing light when the Sun and Moon are otherwise engaged Oh would some Power the giftie gie her To see as other Planets see her QUESTIONS Can an imaginary line be said to exist If not why does it need an excuse for existence CHAPTER VI THE EARTH S CRUST Matter of fact Geologists speak of the Earth s Crust as if there were only one Crust Thoughtful people like ourselves who can read between imaginary lines know that there are as in a pie two Crusts the Upper Crust and the Under Crust The Upper Crust is pleasantly situated on the top and is rich and agreeable and much sought after The Under Crust is soggy and disagreeable The only apparent reason for its existence is to hold up the Upper Crust To quote the eminent Nonsensologist Gelett Burgess The Upper Crust is light as snow And gay with sugar rime The Under Crust must stay below It has a horrid time When in the course of time the Upper Crust becomes too rich and heavy for the popular taste the Social Pie flops over and the Under Crust becomes the Upper Crust These periodic flip flops of the Social Pie are called Revolutions You would think that a Revolving Pie would be a disturbing thing to have in one s system but the Giddy Globe doesn t seem to mind it in the least Balanced on an imaginary toe she continues to pirouette at the rate of a thousand miles an hour just as if nothing were the matter The latest specimen of Acrobatic Pastry is after a Russian recipe The Bolshevik Pie has no Upper Crust at all and is declared by the leading Chefs of Europe to be unfit for human consumption but the proof of the Pie is in the eating how would you like to try just a Take it away or we won t read another word The Reader Oh very well We never did care much for pie anyway not even for breakfast Illustration CHAPTER VII THE TEMPERATURE OF THE GLOBE Illustration In spite of incessant and violent exercise the Giddy Globe as we have remarked before is unable to keep comfortably warm all over Her Temperature varies from intense cold at her upper and lower extremities to fever heat in the region of her equatorial diaphragm Ancient Geographers indicated these variations of temperature by means of Zones The Term Zone is derived from the Greek word Greek zone a Belt or Girdle and a Girdle in the days of the First Geography Book was the principal if not the only garment of a well dressed person Today however the Girdle is no longer accepted as a complete costume No modern Costumer would countenance such a model it would be too easy to copy and consequently unprofitable Even the Knee plus ultra of Newport or Palm Beach Society would hesitate to pose for the Sunday Supplement Photographer in a one piece Bathing Girdle You might explore the World of Dress from the Land of the Midnight Follies to the Uttermost parts of Greenwich Village and find nothing exactly like it It is on its way to be sure but it will never be fashionable until The two extremes of decollete Of Ballroom and of Bathing Beach Here meet in a bewildering way And mingle all the charms of each Why then in this up to date Geography Book should we depict the Giddy Globe in an obsolete hoop skirt of imaginary Zones In striving to answer the question we have hit upon a pleasing compromise Illustration A E C D markers At least it is up to date A and E are the two extremities of the Giddy Globe which are quite bare They correspond to the Frigid Zones C is the Corset which being hot and uncomfortable corresponds to the Torrid D is that is to say are Pardon us for interrupting but we thought this was to be a geography book The Reader CHAPTER VIII THE AGE OF THE GLOBE Illustration THE NEW WORLD THE OLD WORLD Some people are sensitive about their ages The Giddy Globe has never told us hers Rude men of science after careful examination declare she can t be a day under five billion years old Theologians ever tactful in feminine matters set her down as a shrinking young thing of barely four thousand summers Real delicacy of feeling goes with the bulging tum rather than with the bulging forehead who ever saw a thin Bishop or a fat man of science Happy the man with the bulging Tum Who smiles and smiles and is never glum But alas for the man with the bulging brow If he wanted to smile he wouldn t know how If the Giddy Globe asked us to guess her age we should say without a moment s hesitation Whatever it is you certainly don t look it Astronomers may say what they like a Planet is as old as it looks especially if it is a Lady Planet and we have seen ours when she didn t look a June day over sixteen and not having a bulging forehead we told her so Astronomers think themselves so wise but what do they know about the sex of the Planets With the exception of Mother Earth and old Sol Phoebus nothing If you asked an Astronomer whether the Pleiad girls were really the daughters of Atlas or what Jupiter was doing with eight Moons if they were Moons he would think you were trifling with him But is it not possible that the old Greek tales were the garbled gossip of an age forgotten science of which we have only the A B C If it is Love that makes the world go round and who can prove that it isn t what makes the other Planets go round How about the movements of the Heavenly Bodies How about This is all very interesting but don t you think perhaps it is The Reader Quite right Quite right how we do run on Illustration CHAPTER IX THE FACE OF THE GLOBE There are no good photographs of the Giddy Globe she refuses to sit Imagine attempting to photograph an obese and flighty Spheroid who spends her time pirouetting round in a circle with all her might and main Perhaps it is to avoid the photographer that the Earth spins and not merely to reduce her girth as we hinted elsewhere In these days such a strenuous evasion of publicity is suspicious Where does she come from Where is she going She refuses to answer she will not even state her business or tell her real name For aeons quite a number of aeons this Giddy one has been going round under various male and female aliases such as Cosmos Mother Earth The World missus Grundy the Footstool the Terrestrial Globe If you look up her record you will find the following press notices The Earth s a thief Timon of Athens Earth s bitter Wordsworth This distracted Globe Hamlet This tough World King Lear Naughty World Merchant of Venice This World is given to Lying Henry IV The World is too much with us Wordsworth The World is grown so bad Richard III The narrow World Julius Caesar The World is not thy friend Romeo and Juliet The World s a bubble Bacon This World is all a fleeting show Moore The World was not worthy saint Paul The World s a tragedy Horace Walpole This bleak World Moore The weary weight of all this unintelligible World Wordsworth A World of vile ill favoured faults Merry Wives of Windsor Stale flat and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this World Hamlet This dim spot that men call Earth Milton The wicked World W S Gilbert It is possible that the Giddy Globe has read the above clippings and realizing that she has been discovered spins round with all her might to avoid being photographed for the Rogues Gallery of the Universe Appearances are certainly against her When I am moved to contemplate The rude and unregenerate state Of that rampageous reprobate The World at large And as I mark its stony phiz And see it whoop and whirl and whiz I can but cry O Lord why is The World at large Illustration A PERFECT DAY IN LONDON Illustration A PERFECT DAY IN CHICAGO CHAPTER X CLIMATE AND WEATHER Climate is a Theory Weather is a condition Or to make it clearer to the reader Climate is a Hypothesis and Weather is a Reductio ad Absurdum This explains why it invariably snows for the first time in years whenever one goes to California Illustration A TREE What is the Weather for Everything in Nature is designed to contribute to the needs or pleasures of Mankind From the tree of the forest we get the wood from which the nutmeg is made the wood alcohol for our Scotch high ball and the pulp for our newspaper which in turn is transmuted to leather for the soles of our soldiers boots From the sands of the sea we make sugar for sweetening our coffee that mysterious beverage the secret of whose manufacture has never been revealed From the cotton plant comes the woolen under garment and the soldier s blanket From the lowly cabbage springs the Havana Perfecto with its gold and crimson band and from the simple turnip is distilled the golden champagne without which so many lives will now be empty Even the humble straw has its uses to indicate the trend of the air current and for the stuffing of the life preserver What then is the use of the Weather Supposing you have made a globe and put some people upon it to live What would you do to make them feel at home You would give them something to talk about Just so the Weather was designed to furnish a universal topic of conversation for Man Without the Weather nine hundred ninety nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine out of one million conversations would die in their infancy In the first geography book we learn from Moses how and of what the Weather was made Since then nothing has been so much talked about as the Weather and in nothing has so little advance been made QUESTIONS Is it notoriety that makes the Weather Vane Where does the Winter Resort in Summer And why How many litres of champagne can be extracted from the cube root of one turnip What did the Weather do to get herself so talked about CHAPTER XI LAND AND WATER Illustration STEAMSHIP BATTLING WITH THE MARCEL WAVES The terrestrial Globe is pleasingly tinted in blue pink yellow and green The blue portion is called Water and is inhabited by oysters clams submarines lobsters and turtles besides delightful schools of fishes and whales The pink yellow and green portions are called Land and are alive with human beings and other animals and vegetables Illustration THE COLLEGE YELL OF A SCHOOL OF WHALES Besides the animals and vegetables there are mountains table lands rivers forests and lakes Illustration THE PRESIDENTIAL RANGE Showing comparative height of principal peaks Reading from left to right Mt Washington Jefferson Lincoln Cleveland Roosevelt Wilson Note At the moment this picture was taken a war cloud drifted over the last two peaks Until the cloud passes it will be impossible to ascertain their altitudes In former times mountains were used as protective barriers Today they serve as monuments to Public Men for whom they are named See Presidential Range and country seats for retired Grocers and Fishmongers Rivers are the most curious and interesting form of Water Though seldom as shallow they are as lengthy and involved as Congressional speeches and have to be curled into the most ludicrous shapes to get them into the countries where they belong Illustration A RIVER BED The first thing a river does after rising is to betake itself as fast as it can to the nearest River Bed in which it remains for the rest of its days The largest river in the world is the Amazon named after the single breasted suffragette of ancient times QUESTIONS How many rivers can get into one river bed Why is a Congressman Illustration NOAH SIGHTING ARARAT When Noah saw the flood subside The world is going dry he cried So let us all without delay Fill up against a drouthy day CHAPTER XII THE DISCOVERY OF THE WORLD In the first geography we are told of a young married couple who were cast into the world for a pomological error on their part about four thousand B C Some seventeen centuries later the world was lost sight of in a deluge Illustration NOAH It was re discovered by a navigator named Noah who though barely six hundred years old was the commander of a sea going menagerie Commander Noah after cruising about for twelve months and ten days landed from his zooelogical water wagon upon a precipitous Asiatic Jag called Ararat on the twenty seventh of February twenty three hundred B C CHAPTER XIII THE HABITABLE GLOBE The term Habitable Globe was doubtless invented by some Celestial Humorist who had never visited this planet People live on it to be sure but they have no choice There is nowhere else to live The Giddy Globe Isn t it about time to drop this personal simile The Reader Quite so Suppose we consider the Globe as an Apartment House We are told it was finished in six days No wonder it is faultily constructed The Heating Apparatus is out of date The apartments nearest to the Radiator are insufferably hot those farthest away unbearably cold and those between too changeable for comfort The Water Supply is unreliable In some apartments great numbers perish every year from thirst In the cellar there is a munition factory where in defiance of regulations there are stored High Explosives These blow up from time to time causing great damage and loss of life among the tenants The janitor is a disobliging old person who has been there since the house was started and holds his job in spite of incessant complaints When asked to hurry he fairly crawls and when people want him most to stay nothing can stop him His name is Tempus CHAPTER XIV THE TENANTS The first tenants as before stated were a young couple who had been compelled to leave a more luxurious apartment because children were not allowed though animals of all kinds even snakes were tolerated Illustration POST IMPRESSIONIST SAVAGE On the whole the Globe is anything but a model Apartment House Each family considers itself the only respectable one in the building and they are constantly squabbling for the possession of the most desirable rooms The tenants of the different stories originally of one colour have been tanned according to their proximity to the Solar Stove They come in five shades of fast colours Black Brown Yellow Red and White the White being farthest away from the Stove There are also some brighter colours which are not guaranteed varying from the chromatic discord of the post impressionist Savage to the delicate rose pink of the Perfect Lady This last is the most delectable of all but alas it is the one that fades most quickly Illustration PERFECT LADY CHAPTER XV RACE All the Families agree that the tenants of the Globe should be of one uniform shade Illustration MILL RACE Each Family however thinks that his own particular shade is the only fitting one for the Perfect Human Being To that end he spends a large part of his time in scheming how to get rid of all the other tints All of which is a great waste of centuries Old Tempus the Janitor has always settled the Tint question with his Solar Stove and always will A week at the seashore in August ought to convince anyone of the efficiency of the Solar Tint Factory In the tan of the surf bather is locked up the secret of Race Colouration Illustration BLACK RACE And yet there are some Great and Wise Ones who believe that Civilization with the assistance of mister Marconi and mister Rolls H Royce and a few others will bring the Race Families into such close relationship that they will eventually be all blended into one harmonious Neutral Tint A pale mauve World One tint one religion one food one dress one Drink one everything How appalling And think of the moment when it is to be decided once and forever which it is to be Blonde or Brunette Oh those Wise and Great Ones Illustration CHAPTER XVI GOVERNMENTS OF THE GLOBE The best definition of Government may be found in Wordsworth s lines The simple plan That they should take who have the power And they should keep who can In every community on Earth the strongest the craftiest or the wealthiest of the male inhabitants conspire to compel their weaker stupider or poorer brothers and sisters to pay them for the privilege of remaining on earth Government by the Strongest is called an Absolute Monarchy Government by the Craftiest a Limited Monarchy Government by the Wealthiest a Republic In an Absolute Monarchy the People are Controlled In a Limited Monarchy they are Cajoled In a Republic they are Sold For the successful operation of Limited Monarchies and Republics it is necessary to delude the Common People into the belief that they are managing their own affairs Illustration This is accomplished by means of a House of Lords Congress Chamber of Deputies Diet Cortes Assembly Soviet et cetera These merry contrivances are designed on the principle of the revolving squirrel cage furnishing harmless exercise without progression QUESTIONS Q What is a Constitution A A concession to Liberty enabling her to talk herself to death Q What is the essential difference between one government and another A The price of life CHAPTER XVII THE MORALS OF THE GIDDY GLOBE According to Moses the First Geographer Immorality is an heirloom handed down to us by our First Parents Men of Science on the other hand declare it to be merely the psycho neurotic reaction of climatic environment on the celliferous organism In other words Vice is nothing more than Virtue outside of its natural geographical latitude This is clearly set forth in the accompanying Moral Map of the World in which the familiar idiosyncrasies of Mankind which we are wont to differentiate as Virtues or Vices are shown for the first time in their proper geographical environment See Moral Map of the World PART II THE COUNTRIES OF THE EARTH The Countries of the Earth may be divided into two Groups the English speaking countries and the Foreign Countries The English Speaking Countries which comprise the United States and the British Empire occupy one fourth of the entire surface of the Globe The rest are just Foreign Countries CHAPTER XVIII THE POLES The Earth has three kinds of Poles the Frigid Poles in the North and South and the very hot Poles in the centre of Europe This chapter is about the North Pole The North Pole is the Geographical interrogation point of the Earth It is probably the only absolutely moral spot in the World Scientists declare it to be the site of the Garden of Eden thus giving colour to the popular notion that Eden was the original Roof Garden The only language that has ever been spoken at the North Pole is English The language that Lieutenant Peary used when he found the footprint of Doctor Cook on the Pole whatever else it might be was English and the language of the next discoverer when he finds or does not find the footprint of Lieutenant Peary will probably be English too Illustration Map of THE ARCTIC OCEAN OR THE WHITE SEA Whatever use may be ultimately found for the North Pole up to the present time it has only been used for advertising purposes The frozen tracts that surround it bear the names of Adventurers Princes and Editors and the very topmost tip out of compliment to a well known pianist and politician has been called the Magnetic Pole Illustration THE MAGNETIC POLE So far as we know all the disadvantages of the North Pole are shared by the South Pole but for some reason the South Pole has never been so successful as an advertising medium Illustration A PERFECT DAY IN NEW YORK Illustration A PERFECT DAY IN PHILADELPHIA CHAPTER XIX AMERICA Illustration Let us see America first On a modern map of the Western Hemisphere America is as easy to see as the Decorations on the breast of a Rear Admiral of a Dry Dock One wonders how it escaped being discovered so long But when you look at this map of the Western Hemisphere as it appeared about a thousand years ago when Lief Ericsen discovered New England you will understand that discovering America in those days was no child s play Nevertheless Lief the son of Eric did not think much of his find How could a lowbrowed viking be expected to understand Boston much less what was going to be Boston in a thousand years Illustration EARLY MAP OF THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE After writing his Impressions of America in obscure Runes on a conspicuous rock Lief pulled up his anchor and sailed home to Norway No one could decipher the Runes but everybody suspected what they meant And Lief was justly punished for his rudeness his statue stands so runs the tale in the Fenway of Boston to this day America was not discovered again for nearly five hundred years Then Christopher Columbus took a hand but though he made four trips to the New World Columbus carelessly neglected to write a book or even a magazine article on his Impressions of America Illustration A new path in Navigation just as in Art or Literature once shown is easy to follow and seven years later an Italian plagiarist named Amerigo discovered America all over again and copyrighted the whole continent in his own name By this time as the accompanying map will show the continent of America had gained considerably in bulk and offered an easy mark to the horde of discoverers who came in the wake of Amerigo And still they come and though it is too late to secure a copyright on the continent they never fail to copyright their impressions of America Illustration THE MAYFLOWER CHAPTER XX BOSTON Illustration BOSTON And Vicinity In spite of many laudable attempts America was never seriously discovered until the year sixteen twenty when the Mayflower landed in Massachusetts a cargo of Heirlooms Boston Terriers Beans and Ancestors Thus were established the three leading industries of Massachusetts the manufacture of genuine antique furniture and Pedigrees Human and canine BOSTON is a centre of Gravity completely surrounded by Newtons BOSTON is also the centre of the Universe Illustration A PERFECT DAY IN BOSTON The great poet Anonymous has immortalized Boston as The home of the Bean and the Cod Where Lowells speak only to Cabots And Cabots speak only to God Some say the lines were not written by Anonymous but by a later poet named Ibid but what does a poet s name matter except to his creditors Boston is famous for its historic associations and landmarks which well repay a visit Even the quaint and curious Pullmans that convey the traveller thither are relics of a bygone day and a joy to the heart of the antiquarian CHAPTER XXI THE UNITED STATES The United States is a large body of laughter loving people completely surrounded by Trusts It is the richest country in the world Nowhere is food so plentiful nowhere are the Cows so friendly the Hens so industrious Illustration When the American Hens die they go to join their unhatched children in a cold storage Heaven where they live forever So too the Cows so too the Fish if there is room for them if not they are turned into fertilizer to keep them from scaling down the market price To add to the merriment of the People the Sovereign Farmers and Financiers passed an amendment to the Constitution and Holy Writ See I Timothy V twenty three abolishing Temperance the sin of resisting temptation At their bidding thousands of acres of deadly grape vines have been destroyed and if these great and good men fulfil their promise ere long the nation will be saved also from the ravages of the vicious Tobac We fail to see what this has to do with Geography The Reader Illustration A PILGRIM LANDING Well to return to the United States The United States is a large dry country bounded on the north by Canadian Club Whisky on the south by Mexican Pulque and on the East and West by Salt Water The Population consists of one hundred million thirsty souls some of whom are Americans Illustration THE ORIGINAL STRAPHANGERS Illustration Religious to a fault and ambidexterously prodigal they nevertheless show signs of reverting to the condition of the Arboreal Anthropoids A race of Straphangers is developing At certain hours of the day they may be seen seeking their habitations in great flocks swinging from strap to strap with loud cries and a peculiar whirling motion The Original inhabitants were Red Indians these were supplanted by Pale Pilgrims who first settled the country and then settled the Indians Illustration The Indian practice of painting and wearing feathers shocked the Pilgrim Fathers and Pilgrim Mothers but the Pilgrim Daughters made a note of the fashions for future use The climate of the United States is bracing and stimulating travellers have even been known to compare the air to champagne but though highly exhilarating it is absolutely non intoxicating Illustration Prohibition Chemists after a careful analysis having discovered no perceptible trace of Alcohol The Anti Saloon League has decided that the use of the atmosphere shall be in no way restricted In large cities the sky is kept clean by means of tall Sky Scrapers Nowhere is there a more impressive example of American inventive Genius than the array of Sky Scrapers seen from New York Harbour day and night year in year out scraping away the germ laden dust and refuse and imparting a bright and cheerful gloss to the surface of the sky Illustration Another object of interest in the harbour is the statue of a once popular favourite People who remember her say it is far from a flattering

apparel oft proclaims the man HAMLET In former days it was a popular Health Resort for frenzied financiers who wished to retire from private life It is now a still more popular resort for Americans suffering from thirst Though next door neighbours and rivals in business and what is still more trying near relatives Canada and the United States are the best of friends For over a hundred years there has not been so much as a picket fence or a policeman much less a patrol or a fortification on the border line between the two countries Canada has not like her sister Columbia severed home ties she is perfectly happy under the parental roof earns her own living has a latch key and stays out as late as she pleases and has never been able to understand why girls leave home Though differing in

being for the most part molten and somewhat spotty This little Pink Island is Great Britain the little mother of one fourth of all the countries of the Globe including the United States Illustration THE ENGLISH SPEAKING UNION From poster by James Montgomery Flagg The English People or if one must be accurate the British are the most to and fro ward people in the world like the bear in the fable

PRUDENTIAL HAS THE STRENGTH OF GIBRALTAR In every quarter of the globe they have planted seeds of self government which today are blossoming into an English Speaking Union under the British and American Flags that embrace one fourth of the surface of the earth The climate of England is temperate Its air is not like that of the United States compared to champagne London the capital is famous for its fogs this is due to the absence of Sky Scrapers London is also the centre of that vicious heritage of the Victorian Era Respectability For any enjoyable degree of latitude the Londoner must go to Paris Vienna or Buda Pesth and other capitals which in return take their degrees of longitude from London or Greenwich This picture shows the famous Rock of Gibraltar inscribed with the French motto of British respectability Honi soit qui mal y pense done into English The principal products of Great Britain are Beef Bishops Banks and Barometers The inhabitants of England are the most Moral and Patriotic people in the World and their army is second to none in bravery and won the World War Illustration CHAPTER XXIV SCOTLAND A mountainous peaty region in the northern part of Great Britain Illustration The apparel oft proclaims the man HAMLET The Dew distilled from the Scotch mountains flavoured with the peat of the valleys is highly prized by the natives not only of Scotland but of all the English speaking countries of this Giddy Globe The inhabitants are a tall barb wiry music loving pious and joke fearing race fond of loud plaids and still Lauder songs Their tall spare frames have

Scotland are the most Moral and Patriotic people in the World and their army is second to none in bravery and won the World War Illustration CHAPTER XXV IRELAND Illustration The apparel oft proclaims the man HAMLET Illustration Ireland is the land of the Irish Bull a paradoxical Bovine whose cross eyed horns can toss a British commonplace in two directions at once The population of Ireland consists chiefly of Absentee landlords and Emigrants to the United States They are ruled by two Absentee governments a Parliament at Westminster and an Itinerant President Illustration SCENE IN IRISH HOUSE OF PARLIAMENT The country is infested with Absentee Snakes It is believed that the Serpent who tempted Eve from the way he had with the women was one of these Absentee snakes Strabo the Greek Geographer who visited Ireland long before saint Patrick describes the inhabitants as more savage than the Britons feeding on human flesh and enormous eaters deeming it commendable to devour their deceased fathers Strabo evidently attended a wake and miscalculated the strength of the national beverage The principal products of Ireland are Potatoes Pugilists Patriots A Poteen and Bernard Shaw A The term Patriot is derived from two Greek words Pat a patronymic and Riot a national pastime The inhabitants of Ireland are the most Moral and Patriotic people in the World and their army is second to none in bravery and won the World War Illustration THE GIDDY GLOBE CONSOLING IRELAND CHAPTER XXVI WALES Illustration See the Welsh Rabbit he is bred on cheese Or cheese on bread whichever way you please Although he s tough he looks so mild who d think That a strong man from this small beast would shrink Carolyn Wells Wales is the home of the Welsh bards so called because the language in which they are written which resembles a mixture of Chech Chinese Celtic and Chocktaw is barred from the concert and operatic stage The most famous products of Wales are the Welsh Rabbit the Prince of Wales and Lloyd George The Welsh Rabbit born in a chafing dish and prolific as his namesake of Australia has spread all over the Giddy Globe and been a potent factor in keeping the world awake Lloyd George too strange parallel was born in a political chafing dish and has been an even more powerful factor in keeping the world awake Let us hope that the Prince of Wales Bless him will follow in the footsteps of this illustrious pair and live to keep the world awake long after this Geography has gone into its hundred thousandth edition The Prince has been immortalized in the following lines Hurray cried the Kitten Hurray As he merrily set the sails I sail o er the ocean today today To look at the Prince of Wales Oh Kitten pause at the brink And think of the angry gales Ah yes cried the Kitten but think Oh think of the Prince of Wales But Kitten I cried dismayed If you live through the angry gales You know you will be afraid To look at the Prince of Wales Said the Kitten No such thing Why should he make me wince If a Cat may look at a King A Kitten may look at a Prince PART III FOREIGN COUNTRIES CHAPTER XXVII SOUTH AMERICA From the beginning of time up to the present century the continents of North and South America were joined together in terrestrial bonds of matrimony Illustration SOUTH AMERICAN WILD HORSE From an instantaneous photograph of an animal cracker They were seemingly inseparable The first indication that everything was not as it should be with this long united couple was in the year eighteen eighty when a Frenchman named De Lesseps who had already succeeded in divorcing Asia and Africa attempted to bring about a separation The attempt however was a failure and after dragging on for eight years proceedings were dropped for want of funds Fourteen years later President Roosevelt desiring to remove all obstacles to a much desired union of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans started a new action for divorce on the same grounds as that of De Lesseps and in August nineteen oh two the divorce of North and South America and the wedding of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans were simultaneously celebrated The Northern and Southern continents are now better friends than ever and the Atlantic Ocean no longer has to sneak round by the back door to spend an evening with the Pacific CHAPTER XXVIII HOLLAND Illustration The Dutch are the cleanest people in the world So deep seated is Dutch cleanliness that Godliness in the next seat must get up and cling to a strap In Holland they run cleanliness into the ground the heads of the cabbages are inspected every day and the ears of the corn and the necks of the bottles scrubbed regularly every Saturday night The Sky alone escapes the mop of the Dutch housewife but the clouds are kept busy posing for the landscape painters Even the Wind is not allowed to be idle wind mills are posted everywhere and not a breath of air can stir without performing some useful task And the Sea The majestic Sea that has always boasted of its freedom is locked up in Dykes and forced to do the work of highways and railroads The capital of Holland is the Hague and here was held the first Peace Conference in eighteen ninety eight a gathering of Autocrats and Plutocrats to discuss the Economics of War Firstly to make rules by which war may be conducted with the least possible damage to Vested Interests Secondly to reduce the cost of war by the use of methods which while putting a soldier out of action will not injure him beyond the possibility of repair for use in another War Today the Peace Palace is to let and Andrew Carnegie who built it is dead but another Conference called by Woodrow Wilson is to be held in Geneva which Peter Simple hopes will abolish War forever The inhabitants of Holland are the most Moral and Patriotic people in the World and their army is second to none in bravery and won the World War CHAPTER XXIX BELGIUM Belgium may be compared to a Hollandaise Sauce with a piquant Gallic flavour Belgium is the Bridgeway from Prussia to France and King Albert of Belgium is the modern Horatius who facing fearful odds For the ashes of his fathers And the temples of his Gods kept the bridge in the brave days of nineteen fourteen Crowns are not as fashionable today as they were in nineteen fourteen but the Crown of King Albert is of the sort that will never be out of style and besides being a perfect fit is strikingly becoming to him When Julius Caesar described the Belgians as the Bravest of all the Gauls he was a Prophet as well as a Historian The inhabitants of Belgium are the most Moral and Patriotic people in the World and if they hadn t kept the bridge the World War could never have been won Illustration A PERFECT DAY IN PARIS CHAPTER XXX FRANCE

Reader The Reader is for once mistaken Paris as everyone knows is France and Strasburg thanks to Haig Foch Albert Pershing and company is now French Paris is divided into two parts I Paris Proper Famous for The Eiffel tower a sky scraper that contains no offices and the Magasin de Louvre which is visited by thousands of Americans daily There is also another Louvre containing some pictures hand painted and statues II Paris Improper See Appendix The inhabitants of France are the most Moral and Patriotic people in the World and their army is second to none in bravery and won the World War

Clocks Yodelers and Heroes The Swiss are an Artless people What more worthy people Whose every Alpine gap yawns with tradition and is stocked with noble story yet the perverse and scornful one Art

the burning no one questions what will be the last scene of all That ends this strange eventful history All he wants to know is whether he will get the particular slice he has mentally reserved for himself Just so that other Turkey that sits on the fence between Europe and Asia and gobbles defiance at an avenging world The avenging Powers sit round as they have sat round before waiting each one for the slice he has mentally reserved for himself But there won t be any slices You may burn you may shatter The Turk if you will He will rise from his ashes And roost with you still He is the modern incarnation of the indestructible Phoenix Bird Nevertheless we must give the Devil his due the Turks are a fearless people they have many wives The inhabitants of Turkey are the most Moral and Patriotic people in the World and their army is second to none in bravery and they won the World War Illustration A PERFECT DAY IN PETROGRAD CHAPTER XXXV RUSSIA Russia comprises one sixth of the landscape and snowscape of the Globe Formerly the property of a Czar named Nicholas it is now owned by a Superczar named Lenine The principal objects of interest are Samovars Soviets Sables and the Steppes The Steppes of Russia though vast and quite bare have nothing to do with those of the Russian Dancers At the present stage of Russian Affairs they may better be compared to the well known Steps to Avernus which are for descent only and easy at that Today almost the only articles of Russian Manufacture are Natural Ice and Press Dispatches Of manufacture of the latter as regards volume at least there has never been such an enorm Why go on about Russia The Reader Quite right Russia is too large for such a little Geography as this Illustration Map of THE BLACK SEA We will leave Russia as quickly as possible Watch your Steppe CHAPTER XXXVI NORWAY AND SWEDEN It is all very sad about Norway and Sweden A handsomer country couple or couple of countries it would be hard to meet anywhere and so propinquous Have they not been next door neighbours from the infancy of the world And everybody knows what Propinquity does It is Cupid s middle name what more natural than that they should get married Haven t you heard Well it all happened so quickly they were married in Vienna in eighteen fifteen and well you know Propinquity is the Devil s middle name too they were divorced in nineteen oh five after a brief married life of only ninety years What could have been the trouble Some say the food others attribute it to the Domestic Drama Perhaps it was both Here is a typical Scandinavian Menu Pjkled Ojsters Bjsque of Snajls Frjed Fjsh Natjve Wjne Qujnce Jce cream Onjons and Bjsqujts It might almost pass for an Ibsen Play with the average theatre goer it has what the average theatre goer calls atmosphere Illustration I once drew Ibsen looking bored Across a deep Norwegian Fjord And very nearly everyone Mistook him for the Midnight Sun Norway is the home of the Ibsenian or stodgy as distinguished from the stagey Drama James Huneker the eminent Lexicographer as a compliment to that great and hirsutiferous playwright has re christened Norway The Land of the Midnight Whiskers The inhabitants of Norway and Sweden are the most Moral and Patriotic People in the World and they won the World War CHAPTER XXXVII AFRICA The apparel oft proclaims the man HAMLET Africa is the richest jack pot in the game of territorial freeze out played by the European Powers The stakes represent diamonds gold ivory rubber and slaves though the latter are nominally outside the limit Illustration AN ELEPHANT From an instantaneous photograph of an animal cracker The game began nearly three centuries ago and now in the early morning of the twentieth century such a fascinating game is Poker it is still in progress though Germany who staked all her pile and lost has dropped out Illustration A LION From an instantaneous photograph of an animal cracker The ancient Greek Geographer Strabo sixty four B C describes Africa as the fruitful nurse of large serpents elephants antelopes and similar animals of lions also and panthers He does not mention the Chimpanzees who are the most remarkable of all the aboriginal inhabitants a gentle and peace loving race abstemious without being bigoted and patriotic to a high degree very few surviving transportation from their native jungle Illustration Children behold the Chimpanzee He sits on the ancestral tree From which we sprang in ages gone I m glad we sprang had we held on We might for all that I can say Be horrid Chimpanzees to day The inhabitants of Africa are the most Moral and Patriotic in the World and their army is second to none in bravery and won the World War CHAPTER XXXVIII ARABIA Illustration A Camel From an instantaneous photograph of an animal cracker Arabia is the home of the Camel and the Bedouin The Camel may be likened to A desert ship This is not new He is a most ungainly craft With frowning turrets fore and aft We little realize on earth How much we owe to his great girth For should he ever shrink so small As through the needle s eye to crawl Rich men might climb the golden stairs And so leave nothing to their heirs The Camel is called the ship of the desert because its gait is said to resemble the motion of a ship Illustration A BEDOUIN A FOLDING BEDOUIN To be strictly accurate it is a hundred times worse than a ship but not quite so bad as a motor bus The Bedouin makes his bed in the sand or bed rock avoiding river beds or water in any form He must not be confounded with the Folding Bedouins of North America The Folding Bedouins are a semi nomadic tribe supposed by some to be related to the Hall Roomanians and the Red Inkas of Bohemia The inhabitants of Arabia are the most Moral and Patriotic in the World and their army is second to none in bravery and won the World War CHAPTER XXXIX AUSTRALIA Anyone desiring a change from the wearisome rotation of our seasons should go to Australia where Spring commences on September the twenty third Summer on December the twenty second Autumn on March the twenty first and Winter on June the twenty first Illustration The Fauna of Australia as if determined not to be outdone in eccentricity by the Seasons is represented by the Ornithorynchus Paradoxus which Peter Simple has described in the following lines My child the Duck billed Platypus A sad example sets for us From him we learn how indecision Of character provokes derision This vacillating beast you see Could not decide which he would be Fish flesh or fowl and chose all three The scientists were sorely vexed To classify him so perplexed Their brains that they with rage at bay Called him a horrid name one day A name that baffles frights and shocks us Ornithorynchus Paradoxus The inhabitants of Australia are the most Moral and Patriotic people in the World and their army is second to none in bravery and won the World War Illustration CHAPTER XL CHINA Illustration China is known as the Flowery Kingdom It is the most exclusive flower garden in the world and is surrounded by a high wall The only Flower that succeeds in climbing the high wall is the little flower of Pekoe and her sisters who leave their Porcelain Paradise to cheer without inebriating the dull people of the outside world The country of China too may be likened to a Flower her treasure is the envy of the world and flower like she must remain rooted to the ground while the Busy Bees from other lands relieve her of everything she possesses Everyone agrees that China should have an Open Door but the Busy Bee Nations want a Door that opens only inwards while the Flower Nation wants a door that opens only outwards At a recent conference of Bees and Flowers Peter Simple suggested a Revolving Door as a compromise A commission was at once appointed by President Chu Chin Chow to report on Revolving Doors The matter is still being revolved It may end in a Revolution The inhabitants of China are the most Moral and Patriotic people in the World and their army is second to none in bravery and won the World War CHAPTER XLI JAPAN Illustration Japanese text TRANSLATION The inhabitants of Japan are the most Moral and Patriotic people in the World and their army is second to none in bravery and won the World War CHAPTER XLII EGYPT INDIA ITALY SPAIN GREECE et cetera Illustration No work on Geography could be called complete without a description of these six counting et cetera countries If the Reader should ask me how I came to leave six such important countries to the last page I should be compelled to change the subject Writing a little Geography Book is like packing a very small bag for a journey round the world only instead of cramming it with shirts and shoes and collars and handkerchiefs and brushes you stuff it full of countries and when you try to close it as with the bag you always find that you have left out at least several of the most important things No amount of squeezing or sitting on the lid will make room for six such big countries in a little book that is already as full as it can be The only thing to do is to take out all the countries and lay them in a row and see which you can get along best without you can t possibly spare any of the large countries the question is how many of the little countries together would You are digressing again worse than ever This thing has got to stop The Reader Oh very well If that s the way the Reader feels about it it shall stop right here Illustration THE END EPILOGUE If this little world to night Suddenly should fall thro space In a hissing headlong flight Shrivelling from off its face As it falls into the sun In an instant every trace Of the little crawling things Ants philosophers and lice Cattle cockroaches and kings Beggars millionaires and mice Men and maggots all as one As it falls into the sun Who can say but at the same Instant from some planet far A child may watch us and exclaim See the pretty shooting star APPENDIX See next page THE APPENDIX has been removed End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of This Giddy Globe by Oliver Herford END OF THIS PROJECT
