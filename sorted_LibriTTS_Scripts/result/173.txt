INSIDIOUS doctor FU MANCHU This etext was updated by Stewart A Levin of Englewood company The Insidious doctor Fu Manchu by Sax Rohmer CHAPTER I A GENTLEMAN to see you Doctor From across the common a clock sounded the half hour Ten thirty I said A late visitor Show him up if you please I pushed my writing aside and tilted the lamp shade as footsteps sounded on the landing The next moment I had jumped to my feet for a tall lean man with his square cut clean shaven face sun baked to the hue of coffee entered and extended both hands with a cry Good old Petrie Didn t expect me I ll swear It was Nayland Smith whom I had thought to be in Burma Smith I said and gripped his hands hard this is a delightful surprise Whatever however Excuse me Petrie he broke in Don t put it down to the sun And he put out the lamp plunging the room into darkness I was too surprised to speak No doubt you will think me mad he continued and dimly I could see him at the window peering out into the road but before you are many hours older you will know that I have good reason to be cautious Ah nothing suspicious Perhaps I am first this time And stepping back to the writing table he relighted the lamp Mysterious enough for you he laughed and glanced at my unfinished MS A story eh From which I gather that the district is beastly healthy what Petrie Well I can put some material in your way that if sheer uncanny mystery is a marketable commodity ought to make you independent of influenza and broken legs and shattered nerves and all the rest I surveyed him doubtfully but there was nothing in his appearance to justify me in supposing him to suffer from delusions His eyes were too bright certainly and a hardness now had crept over his face I got out the whisky and siphon saying You have taken your leave early I am not on leave he replied and slowly filled his pipe I am on duty On duty I exclaimed What are you moved to London or something I have got a roving commission Petrie and it doesn t rest with me where I am to day nor where I shall be to morrow There was something ominous in the words and putting down my glass its contents untasted I faced round and looked him squarely in the eyes Out with it I said What is it all about Smith suddenly stood up and stripped off his coat Rolling back his left shirt sleeve he revealed a wicked looking wound in the fleshy part of the forearm It was quite healed but curiously striated for an inch or so around Ever seen one like it he asked Not exactly I confessed It appears to have been deeply cauterized Right Very deeply he rapped A barb steeped in the venom of a hamadryad went in there A shudder I could not repress ran coldly through me at mention of that most deadly of all the reptiles of the East There s only one treatment he continued rolling his sleeve down again and that s with a sharp knife a match and a broken cartridge I lay on my back raving for three days afterwards in a forest that stank with malaria but I should have been lying there now if I had hesitated Here s the point It was not an accident What do you mean I mean that it was a deliberate attempt on my life and I am hard upon the tracks of the man who extracted that venom patiently drop by drop from the poison glands of the snake who prepared that arrow and who caused it to be shot at me What fiend is this A fiend who unless my calculations are at fault is now in London and who regularly wars with pleasant weapons of that kind Petrie I have traveled from Burma not in the interests of the British Government merely but in the interests of the entire white race and I honestly believe though I pray I may be wrong that its survival depends largely upon the success of my mission To say that I was perplexed conveys no idea of the mental chaos created by these extraordinary statements for into my humdrum suburban life Nayland Smith had brought fantasy of the wildest I did not know what to think what to believe I am wasting precious time he rapped decisively and draining his glass he stood up I came straight to you because you are the only man I dare to trust Except the big chief at headquarters you are the only person in England I hope who knows that Nayland Smith has quitted Burma I must have someone with me Petrie all the time it s imperative Can you put me up here and spare a few days to the strangest business I promise you that ever was recorded in fact or fiction I agreed readily enough for unfortunately my professional duties were not onerous Good man he cried wringing my hand in his impetuous way We start now What to night To night I had thought of turning in I must admit I have not dared to sleep for forty eight hours except in fifteen minute stretches But there is one move that must be made to night and immediately I must warn Sir Crichton Davey Sir Crichton Davey of the India Petrie he is a doomed man Unless he follows my instructions without question without hesitation before Heaven nothing can save him I do not know when the blow will fall how it will fall nor from whence but I know that my first duty is to warn him Let us walk down to the corner of the common and get a taxi How strangely does the adventurous intrude upon the humdrum for when it intrudes at all more often than not its intrusion is sudden and unlooked for To day we may seek for romance and fail to find it unsought it lies in wait for us at most prosaic corners of life s highway The drive that night though it divided the drably commonplace from the wildly bizarre though it was the bridge between the ordinary and the outre has left no impression upon my mind Into the heart of a weird mystery the cab bore me and in reviewing my memories of those days I wonder that the busy thoroughfares through which we passed did not display before my eyes signs and portents warnings It was not so I recall nothing of the route and little of import that passed between us we both were strangely silent I think until we were come to our journey s end Then What s this muttered my friend hoarsely Constables were moving on a little crowd of curious idlers who pressed about the steps of Sir Crichton Davey s house and sought to peer in at the open door Without waiting for the cab to draw up to the curb Nayland Smith recklessly leaped out and I followed close at his heels What has happened he demanded breathlessly of a constable The latter glanced at him doubtfully but something in his voice and bearing commanded respect Sir Crichton Davey has been killed sir Smith lurched back as though he had received a physical blow and clutched my shoulder convulsively Beneath the heavy tan his face had blanched and his eyes were set in a stare of horror My God he whispered I am too late With clenched fists he turned and pressing through the group of loungers bounded up the steps In the hall a man who unmistakably was a Scotland Yard official stood talking to a footman Other members of the household were moving about more or less aimlessly and the chilly hand of King Fear had touched one and all for as they came and went they glanced ever over their shoulders as if each shadow cloaked a menace and listened as it seemed for some sound which they dreaded to hear Smith strode up to the detective and showed him a card upon glancing at which the Scotland Yard man said something in a low voice and nodding touched his hat to Smith in a respectful manner A few brief questions and answers and in gloomy silence we followed the detective up the heavily carpeted stair along a corridor lined with pictures and busts and into a large library A group of people were in this room and one in whom I recognized Chalmers Cleeve of Harley Street was bending over a motionless form stretched upon a couch Another door communicated with a small study and through the opening I could see a man on all fours examining the carpet The uncomfortable sense of hush the group about the physician the bizarre figure crawling beetle like across the inner room and the grim hub around which all this ominous activity turned made up a scene that etched itself indelibly on my mind As we entered doctor Cleeve straightened himself frowning thoughtfully Frankly I do not care to venture any opinion at present regarding the immediate cause of death he said Sir Crichton was addicted to cocaine but there are indications which are not in accordance with cocaine poisoning I fear that only a post mortem can establish the facts if he added we ever arrive at them A most mysterious case Smith stepping forward and engaging the famous pathologist in conversation I seized the opportunity to examine Sir Crichton s body The dead man was in evening dress but wore an old smoking jacket He had been of spare but hardy build with thin aquiline features which now were oddly puffy as were his clenched hands I pushed back his sleeve and saw the marks of the hypodermic syringe upon his left arm Quite mechanically I turned my attention to the right arm It was unscarred but on the back of the hand was a faint red mark not unlike the imprint of painted lips I examined it closely and even tried to rub it off but it evidently was caused by some morbid process of local inflammation if it were not a birthmark Turning to a pale young man whom I had understood to be Sir Crichton s private secretary I drew his attention to this mark and inquired if it were constitutional It is not sir answered doctor Cleeve overhearing my question I have already made that inquiry Does it suggest anything to your mind I must confess that it affords me no assistance Nothing I replied It is most curious Excuse me mister Burboyne said Smith now turning to the secretary but Inspector Weymouth will tell you that I act with authority I understand that Sir Crichton was seized with illness in his study Yes at half past ten I was working here in the library and he inside as was our custom The communicating door was kept closed Yes always It was open for a minute or less about ten twenty five when a message came for Sir Crichton I took it in to him and he then seemed in his usual health What was the message I could not say It was brought by a district messenger and he placed it beside him on the table It is there now no doubt And at half past ten Sir Crichton suddenly burst open the door and threw himself with a scream into the library I ran to him but he waved me back His eyes were glaring horribly I had just reached his side when he fell writhing upon the floor He seemed past speech but as I raised him and laid him upon the couch he gasped something that sounded like The red hand Before I could get to bell or telephone he was dead mister Burboyne s voice shook as he spoke the words and Smith seemed to find this evidence confusing You do not think he referred to the mark on his own hand I think not From the direction of his last glance I feel sure he referred to something in the study What did you do Having summoned the servants I ran into the study But there was absolutely nothing unusual to be seen The windows were closed and fastened He worked with closed windows in the hottest weather There is no other door for the study occupies the end of a narrow wing so that no one could possibly have gained access to it whilst I was in the library unseen by me Had someone concealed himself in the study earlier in the evening and I am convinced that it offers no hiding place he could only have come out again by passing through here Nayland Smith tugged at the lobe of his left ear as was his habit when meditating You had been at work here in this way for some time Yes Sir Crichton was preparing an important book Had anything unusual occurred prior to this evening Yes said mister Burboyne with evident perplexity though I attached no importance to it at the time Three nights ago Sir Crichton came out to me and appeared very nervous but at times his nerves you know Well on this occasion he asked me to search the study He had an idea that something was concealed there Some THING or someone Something was the word he used I searched but fruitlessly and he seemed quite satisfied and returned to his work Thank you mister Burboyne My friend and I would like a few minutes private investigation in the study CHAPTER II SIR CRICHTON DAVEY S study was a small one and a glance sufficed to show that as the secretary had said it offered no hiding place It was heavily carpeted and over full of Burmese and Chinese ornaments and curios and upon the mantelpiece stood several framed photographs which showed this to be the sanctum of a wealthy bachelor who was no misogynist A map of the Indian Empire occupied the larger part of one wall The grate was empty for the weather was extremely warm and a green shaded lamp on the littered writing table afforded the only light The air was stale for both windows were closed and fastened Smith immediately pounced upon a large square envelope that lay beside the blotting pad Sir Crichton had not even troubled to open it but my friend did so It contained a blank sheet of paper Smell he directed handing the letter to me I raised it to my nostrils It was scented with some pungent perfume What is it I asked It is a rather rare essential oil was the reply which I have met with before though never in Europe I begin to understand Petrie He tilted the lamp shade and made a close examination of the scraps of paper matches and other debris that lay in the grate and on the hearth I took up a copper vase from the mantelpiece and was examining it curiously when he turned a strange expression upon his face Put that back old man he said quietly Much surprised I did as he directed Don t touch anything in the room It may be dangerous Something in the tone of his voice chilled me and I hastily replaced the vase and stood by the door of the study watching him search methodically every inch of the room behind the books in all the ornaments in table drawers in cupboards on shelves That will do he said at last There is nothing here and I have no time to search farther We returned to the library Inspector Weymouth said my friend I have a particular reason for asking that Sir Crichton s body be removed from this room at once and the library locked Let no one be admitted on any pretense whatever until you hear from me It spoke volumes for the mysterious credentials borne by my friend that the man from Scotland Yard accepted his orders without demur and after a brief chat with mister Burboyne Smith passed briskly downstairs In the hall a man who looked like a groom out of livery was waiting Are you Wills asked Smith Yes sir It was you who heard a cry of some kind at the rear of the house about the time of Sir Crichton s death Yes sir I was locking the garage door and happening to look up at the window of Sir Crichton s study I saw him jump out of his chair Where he used to sit at his writing sir you could see his shadow on the blind Next minute I heard a call out in the lane What kind of call The man whom the uncanny happening clearly had frightened seemed puzzled for a suitable description A sort of wail sir he said at last I never heard anything like it before and don t want to again Like this inquired Smith and he uttered a low wailing cry impossible to describe Wills perceptibly shuddered and indeed it was an eerie sound The same sir I think he said but much louder That will do said Smith and I thought I detected a note of triumph in his voice But stay Take us through to the back of the house The man bowed and led the way so that shortly we found ourselves in a small paved courtyard It was a perfect summer s night and the deep blue vault above was jeweled with myriads of starry points How impossible it seemed to reconcile that vast eternal calm with the hideous passions and fiendish agencies which that night had loosed a soul upon the infinite Up yonder are the study windows sir Over that wall on your left is the back lane from which the cry came and beyond is Regent s Park Are the study windows visible from there Oh yes sir Who occupies the adjoining house Major General Platt Houston sir but the family is out of town Those iron stairs are a means of communication between the domestic offices and the servants quarters I take it Yes sir Then send someone to make my business known to the Major General s housekeeper I want to examine those stairs Singular though my friend s proceedings appeared to me I had ceased to wonder at anything Since Nayland Smith s arrival at my rooms I seemed to have been moving through the fitful phases of a nightmare My friend s account of how he came by the wound in his arm the scene on our arrival at the house of Sir Crichton Davey the secretary s story of the dying man s cry The red hand the hidden perils of the study the wail in the lane all were fitter incidents of delirium than of sane reality So when a white faced butler made us known to a nervous old lady who proved to be the housekeeper of the next door residence I was not surprised at Smith s saying Lounge up and down outside Petrie Everyone has cleared off now It is getting late Keep your eyes open and be on your guard I thought I had the start but he is here before me and what is worse he probably knows by now that I am here too With which he entered the house and left me out in the square with leisure to think to try to understand The crowd which usually haunts the scene of a sensational crime had been cleared away and it had been circulated that Sir Crichton had died from natural causes The intense heat having driven most of the residents out of town practically I had the square to myself and I gave myself up to a brief consideration of the mystery in which I so suddenly had found myself involved By what agency had Sir Crichton met his death Did Nayland Smith know I rather suspected that he did What was the hidden significance of the perfumed envelope Who was that mysterious personage whom Smith so evidently dreaded who had attempted his life who presumably had murdered Sir Crichton Sir Crichton Davey during the time that he had held office in India and during his long term of service at home had earned the good will of all British and native alike Who was his secret enemy Something touched me lightly on the shoulder I turned with my heart fluttering like a child s This night s work had imposed a severe strain even upon my callous nerves A girl wrapped in a hooded opera cloak stood at my elbow and as she glanced up at me I thought that I never had seen a face so seductively lovely nor of so unusual a type With the skin of a perfect blonde she had eyes and lashes as black as a Creole s which together with her full red lips told me that this beautiful stranger whose touch had so startled me was not a child of our northern shores Forgive me she said speaking with an odd pretty accent and laying a slim hand with jeweled fingers confidingly upon my arm if I startled you But is it true that Sir Crichton Davey has been murdered I looked into her big questioning eyes a harsh suspicion laboring in my mind but could read nothing in their mysterious depths only I wondered anew at my questioner s beauty The grotesque idea momentarily possessed me that were the bloom of her red lips due to art and not to nature their kiss would leave though not indelibly just such a mark as I had seen upon the dead man s hand But I dismissed the fantastic notion as bred of the night s horrors and worthy only of a mediaeval legend No doubt she was some friend or acquaintance of Sir Crichton who lived close by I cannot say that he has been murdered I replied acting upon the latter supposition and seeking to tell her what she asked as gently as possible But he is Dead I nodded She closed her eyes and uttered a low moaning sound swaying dizzily Thinking she was about to swoon I threw my arm round her shoulder to support her but she smiled sadly and pushed me gently away I am quite well thank you she said You are certain Let me walk with you until you feel quite sure of yourself She shook her head flashed a rapid glance at me with her beautiful eyes and looked away in a sort of sorrowful embarrassment for which I was entirely at a loss to account Suddenly she resumed I cannot let my name be mentioned in this dreadful matter but I think I have some information for the police Will you give this to whomever you think proper She handed me a sealed envelope again met my eyes with one of her dazzling glances and hurried away She had gone no more than ten or twelve yards and I still was standing bewildered watching her graceful retreating figure when she turned abruptly and came back Without looking directly at me but alternately glancing towards a distant corner of the square and towards the house of Major General Platt Houston she made the following extraordinary request If you would do me a very great service for which I always would be grateful she glanced at me with passionate intentness when you have given my message to the proper person leave him and do not go near him any more to night Before I could find words to reply she gathered up her cloak and ran Before I could determine whether or not to follow her for her words had aroused anew all my worst suspicions she had disappeared I heard the whir of a restarted motor at no great distance and in the instant that Nayland Smith came running down the steps I knew that I had nodded at my post Smith I cried as he joined me tell me what we must do And rapidly I acquainted him with the incident My friend looked very grave then a grim smile crept round his lips She was a big card to play he said but he did not know that I held one to beat it What You know this girl Who is she She is one of the finest weapons in the enemy s armory Petrie But a woman is a two edged sword and treacherous To our great good fortune she has formed a sudden predilection characteristically Oriental for yourself Oh you may scoff but it is evident She was employed to get this letter placed in my hands Give it to me I did so She has succeeded Smell He held the envelope under my nose and with a sudden sense of nausea I recognized the strange perfume You know what this presaged in Sir Crichton s case Can you doubt any longer She did not want you to share my fate Petrie Smith I said unsteadily I have followed your lead blindly in this horrible business and have not pressed for an explanation but I must insist before I go one step farther upon knowing what it all means Just a few steps farther he rejoined as far as a cab We are hardly safe here Oh you need not fear shots or knives The man whose servants are watching us now scorns to employ such clumsy tell tale weapons Only three cabs were on the rank and as we entered the first something hissed past my ear missed both Smith and me by a miracle and passing over the roof of the taxi presumably fell in the enclosed garden occupying the center of the square What was that I cried Get in quickly Smith rapped back It was attempt number one More than that I cannot say Don t let the man hear He has noticed nothing Pull up the window on your side Petrie and look out behind Good We ve started The cab moved off with a metallic jerk and I turned and looked back through the little window in the rear Someone has got into another cab It is following ours I think Nayland Smith lay back and laughed unmirthfully Petrie he said if I escape alive from this business I shall know that I bear a charmed life I made no reply as he pulled out the dilapidated pouch and filled his pipe You have asked me to explain matters he continued and I will do so to the best of my ability You no doubt wonder why a servant of the British Government lately stationed in Burma suddenly appears in London in the character of a detective I am here Petrie and I bear credentials from the very highest sources because quite by accident I came upon a clew Following it up in the ordinary course of routine I obtained evidence of the existence and malignant activity of a certain man At the present stage of the case I should not be justified in terming him the emissary of an Eastern Power but I may say that representations are shortly to be made to that Power s ambassador in London He paused and glanced back towards the pursuing cab There is little to fear until we arrive home he said calmly Afterwards there is much To continue This man whether a fanatic or a duly appointed agent is unquestionably the most malign and formidable personality existing in the known world today He is a linguist who speaks with almost equal facility in any of the civilized languages and in most of the barbaric He is an adept in all the arts and sciences which a great university could teach him He also is an adept in certain obscure arts and sciences which no university of to day can teach He has the brains of any three men of genius Petrie he is a mental giant You amaze me I said As to his mission among men Why did M Jules Furneaux fall dead in a Paris opera house Because of heart failure No Because his last speech had shown that he held the key to the secret of Tongking What became of the Grand Duke Stanislaus Elopement Suicide Nothing of the kind He alone was fully alive to Russia s growing peril He alone knew the truth about Mongolia Why was Sir Crichton Davey murdered Because had the work he was engaged upon ever seen the light it would have shown him to be the only living Englishman who understood the importance of the Tibetan frontiers I say to you solemnly Petrie that these are but a few Is there a man who would arouse the West to a sense of the awakening of the East who would teach the deaf to hear the blind to see that the millions only await their leader He will die And this is only one phase of the devilish campaign The others I can merely surmise But Smith this is almost incredible What perverted genius controls this awful secret movement Imagine a person tall lean and feline high shouldered with a brow like Shakespeare and a face like Satan a close shaven skull and long magnetic eyes of the true cat green Invest him with all the cruel cunning of an entire Eastern race accumulated in one giant intellect with all the resources of science past and present with all the resources if you will of a wealthy government which however already has denied all knowledge of his existence Imagine that awful being and you have a mental picture of doctor Fu Manchu the yellow peril incarnate in one man CHAPTER III I SANK into an arm chair in my rooms and gulped down a strong peg of brandy We have been followed here I said Why did you make no attempt to throw the pursuers off the track to have them intercepted 
1614-13759-0000	train-other-500	Smith laughed Useless in the first place Wherever we went HE would find us And of what use to arrest his creatures We could prove nothing against them Further it is evident that an attempt is to be made upon my life to night
1614-13759-0001	train-other-500	and by the same means that proved so successful in the case of poor Sir Crichton
none	none	 His square jaw grew truculently prominent 
1614-13759-0002	train-other-500	and he leapt stormily to his feet shaking his clenched fists towards the window The villain he cried The fiendishly clever villain I suspected that Sir Crichton was next and I was right But I came too late Petrie That hits me hard old man
1614-13759-0003	train-other-500	To think that I knew and yet failed to save him He resumed his seat smoking hard Fu Manchu has made the blunder common to all men of unusual genius he said He has underrated his adversary
1614-13759-0004	train-other-500	He has not given me credit for perceiving the meaning of the scented messages He has thrown away one powerful weapon to get such a message into my hands and he thinks that once safe within doors I shall sleep unsuspecting and die as Sir Crichton died
1614-13759-0005	train-other-500	But without the indiscretion of your charming friend
none	none	 I should have known what to expect when I receive her information 
1614-13759-0006	train-other-500	which by the way consists of a blank sheet of paper Smith I broke in who is she She is either Fu Manchu s daughter his wife
none	none	 or his slave I am inclined to believe the last 
1614-13759-0007	train-other-500	for she has no will but his will except with a quizzical glance in a certain instance How can you jest with some awful thing Heaven knows what hanging over your head What is the meaning of these perfumed envelopes
1614-13759-0008	train-other-500	How did Sir Crichton die He died of the Zayat Kiss Ask me what that is and I reply I do not know
none	none	 The zayats are the Burmese caravanserais or rest houses 
1614-13759-0009	train-other-500	Along a certain route upon which I set eyes for the first and only time upon doctor Fu Manchu travelers who use them sometimes die as Sir Crichton died
1614-13759-0010	train-other-500	with nothing to show the cause of death but a little mark upon the neck face or limb which has earned in those parts the title of the Zayat Kiss The rest houses along that route are shunned now I have my theory
1614-13759-0011	train-other-500	and I hope to prove it to night if I live It will be one more broken weapon in his fiendish armory and it is thus
none	none	 and thus only that I can hope to crush him 
1614-13759-0012	train-other-500	This was my principal reason for not enlightening doctor Cleeve Even walls have ears where Fu Manchu is concerned so I feigned ignorance of the meaning of the mark knowing that he would be almost certain to employ the same methods upon some other victim
1614-13759-0013	train-other-500	I wanted an opportunity to study the Zayat Kiss in operation and I shall have one But the scented envelopes In the swampy forests of the district I have referred to a rare species of orchid almost green and with a peculiar scent
none	none	 is sometimes met with I recognized the heavy perfume at once I take it that the thing which kills the traveler is attracted by this orchid You will notice that the perfume clings to whatever it touches I doubt if it can be washed off in the ordinary way After at least one unsuccessful attempt to kill Sir Crichton 
1614-13759-0014	train-other-500	you recall that he thought there was something concealed in his study on a previous occasion Fu Manchu hit upon the perfumed envelopes He may have a supply of these green orchids in his possession possibly to feed the creature What creature
none	none	 How could any kind of creature have got into Sir Crichton s room tonight 
1614-13759-0015	train-other-500	You no doubt observed that I examined the grate of the study I found a fair quantity of fallen soot
none	none	 I at once assumed since it appeared to be the only means of entrance that something has been dropped down 
1614-13759-0016	train-other-500	and I took it for granted that the thing whatever it was must still be concealed either in the study or in the library But when I had obtained the evidence of the groom Wills I perceived that the cry from the lane or from the park was a signal
1614-13759-0017	train-other-500	I noted that the movements of anyone seated at the study table were visible in shadow on the blind and that the study occupied the corner of a two storied wing and therefore had a short chimney What did the signal mean
1614-13759-0018	train-other-500	That Sir Crichton had leaped up from his chair and either had received the Zayat Kiss
none	none	 or had seen the thing which someone on the roof 
1614-13759-0019	train-other-500	had lowered down the straight chimney It was the signal to withdraw that deadly thing By means of the iron stairway at the rear of Major General Platt Houston s I quite easily gained access to the roof above Sir Crichton s study and I found this
1614-13759-0020	train-other-500	Out from his pocket Nayland Smith drew a tangled piece of silk mixed up with which were a brass ring and a number of unusually large sized split shot
none	none	 nipped on in the manner usual on a fishing line 
1614-13759-0021	train-other-500	My theory proven he resumed Not anticipating a search on the roof
none	none	 they had been careless 
1614-13759-0022	train-other-500	This was to weight the line and to prevent the creature clinging to the walls of the chimney
none	none	 Directly it had dropped in the grate however by means of this ring I assume that the weighted line was withdrawn 
1614-13759-0023	train-other-500	and the thing was only held by one slender thread which sufficed though
none	none	 to draw it back again when it had done its work 
1614-13759-0024	train-other-500	It might have got tangled of course
none	none	 but they reckoned on its making straight up the carved leg of the writing table for the prepared envelope 
1614-13759-0025	train-other-500	From there to the hand of Sir Crichton which from having touched the envelope would also be scented with the perfume was a certain move My God How horrible I exclaimed and glanced apprehensively into the dusky shadows of the room
1614-13759-0026	train-other-500	What is your theory respecting this creature what shape what color It is something that moves rapidly and silently
none	none	 I will venture no more at present 
1614-13759-0027	train-other-500	but I think it works in the dark The study was dark remember save for the bright patch beneath the reading lamp I have observed that the rear of this house is ivy covered right up to and above your bedroom Let us make ostentatious preparations to retire
1614-13759-0028	train-other-500	and I think we may rely upon Fu Manchu s servants to attempt my removal at any rate if not yours But my dear fellow it is a climb of thirty five feet at the very least You remember the cry in the back lane It suggested something to me
1614-13759-0029	train-other-500	and I tested my idea successfully It was the cry of a dacoit Oh dacoity though quiescent is by no means extinct Fu Manchu has dacoits in his train and probably it is one who operates the Zayat Kiss
1614-13759-0030	train-other-500	since it was a dacoit who watched the window of the study this evening To such a man an ivy covered wall is a grand staircase The horrible events that followed are punctuated in my mind by the striking of a distant clock
1614-13759-0031	train-other-500	It is singular how trivialities thus assert themselves in moments of high tension I will proceed then by these punctuations to the coming of the horror that it was written we should encounter The clock across the common struck two
1614-13759-0032	train-other-500	Having removed all traces of the scent of the orchid from our hands with a solution of ammonia Smith and I had followed the programme laid down It was an easy matter to reach the rear of the house by simply climbing a fence and we did not doubt
1614-13759-0033	train-other-500	that seeing the light go out in the front our unseen watcher would proceed to the back The room was a large one and we had made up my camp bed at one end stuffing odds and ends under the clothes to lend the appearance of a sleeper
none	none	 which device we also had adopted in the case of the larger bed 
1614-13759-0034	train-other-500	The perfumed envelope lay upon a little coffee table in the center of the floor and Smith with an electric pocket lamp a revolver and a brassey beside him sat on cushions in the shadow of the wardrobe I occupied a post between the windows
1614-13759-0035	train-other-500	No unusual sound so far had disturbed the stillness of the night Save for the muffled throb of the rare all night cars passing the front of the house our vigil had been a silent one The full moon had painted about the floor
1614-13759-0036	train-other-500	weird shadows of the clustering ivy spreading the design gradually from the door across the room past the little table where the envelope lay and finally to the foot of the bed The distant clock struck a quarter past two A slight breeze stirred the ivy
1614-13759-0037	train-other-500	and a new shadow added itself to the extreme edge of the moon s design Something rose inch by inch above the sill of the westerly window
none	none	 I could see only its shadow 
1614-13759-0038	train-other-500	but a sharp sibilant breath from Smith told me that he from his post could see the cause of the shadow Every nerve in my body seemed to be strung tensely I was icy cold expectant
none	none	 and prepared for whatever horror was upon us 
1614-13759-0039	train-other-500	The shadow became stationary The dacoit was studying the interior of the room Then it suddenly lengthened and craning my head to the left
none	none	 I saw a lithe black clad form surmounted by a Yellow face 
1614-13759-0040	train-other-500	sketchy in the moonlight pressed against the window panes One thin brown hand appeared over the edge of the lowered sash which it grasped and then another The man made absolutely no sound whatever The second hand disappeared and reappeared
none	none	 It held a small square box There was a very faint 
1614-13759-0041	train-other-500	CLICK The dacoit swung himself below the window with the agility of an ape as with a dull muffled thud
none	none	 SOMETHING dropped upon the carpet 
1614-13759-0042	train-other-500	Stand still for your life came Smith s voice high pitched
none	none	 A beam of white leaped out across the room and played full upon the coffee table in the center 
1614-13759-0043	train-other-500	Prepared as I was for something horrible
none	none	 I know that I paled at sight of the thing that was running round the edge of the envelope 
1614-13759-0044	train-other-500	It was an insect full six inches long and of a vivid venomous red color It had something of the appearance of a great ant
none	none	 with its long quivering antennae 
1614-13759-0045	train-other-500	and its febrile horrible vitality
none	none	 but it was proportionately longer of body and smaller of head 
1614-13759-0046	train-other-500	and had numberless rapidly moving legs In short it was a giant centipede apparently of the scolopendra group but of a form quite new to me These things I realized in one breathless instant
none	none	 in the next Smith had dashed the thing s poisonous life out with one straight true blow of the golf club 
1614-13759-0047	train-other-500	I leaped to the window and threw it widely open feeling a silk thread brush my hand as I did so A black shape was dropping with incredible agility from branch to branch of the ivy and without once offering a mark for a revolver shot
1614-13759-0048	train-other-500	it merged into the shadows beneath the trees of the garden As I turned and switched on the light Nayland Smith dropped limply into a chair leaning his head upon his hands Even that grim courage had been tried sorely
1614-13759-0049	train-other-500	Never mind the dacoit Petrie he said Nemesis will know where to find him We know now what causes the mark of the Zayat Kiss Therefore science is richer for our first brush with the enemy and the enemy is poorer
none	none	 unless he has any more unclassified centipedes I understand now something that has been puzzling me 
1614-13759-0050	train-other-500	since I heard of it Sir Crichton s stifled cry When we remember that he was almost past speech it is reasonable to suppose that his cry was not The red hand but The red ANT Petrie
none	none	 to think that I failed by less than an hour to save him from such an end CHAPTER IV THE body of a lascar dressed in the manner usual on the P O boats was recovered from the Thames off Tilbury by the river police at six A M this morning It is supposed that the man met with an accident in leaving his ship Nayland Smith passed me the evening paper and pointed to the above paragraph For lascar read dacoit he said Our visitor who came by way of the ivy fortunately for us failed to follow his instructions Also he lost the centipede and left a clew behind him doctor Fu Manchu does not overlook such lapses It was a sidelight upon the character of the awful being with whom we had to deal My very soul recoiled from bare consideration of the fate that would be ours if ever we fell into his hands The telephone bell rang I went out and found that Inspector Weymouth of New Scotland Yard had called us up Will mister Nayland Smith please come to the Wapping River Police Station at once was the message Peaceful interludes were few enough throughout that wild pursuit It is certainly something important said my friend and if Fu Manchu is at the bottom of it as we must presume him to be probably something ghastly A brief survey of the time tables showed us that there were no trains to serve our haste We accordingly chartered a cab and proceeded east Smith throughout the journey talked entertainingly about his work in Burma Of intent I think he avoided any reference to the circumstances which first had brought him in contact with the sinister genius of the Yellow Movement His talk was rather of the sunshine of the East than of its shadows But the drive concluded and all too soon In a silence which neither of us seemed disposed to break we entered the police depot and followed an officer who received us into the room where Weymouth waited The inspector greeted us briefly nodding toward the table Poor Cadby the most promising lad at the Yard he said and his usually gruff voice had softened strangely Smith struck his right fist into the palm of his left hand and swore under his breath striding up and down the neat little room No one spoke for a moment and in the silence I could hear the whispering of the Thames outside of the Thames which had so many strange secrets to tell and now was burdened with another The body lay prone upon the deal table this latest of the river s dead dressed in rough sailor garb and to all outward seeming a seaman of nondescript nationality such as is no stranger in Wapping and Shadwell His dark curly hair clung clammily about the brown forehead his skin was stained they told me He wore a gold ring in one ear and three fingers of the left hand were missing It was almost the same with Mason The river police inspector was speaking A week ago on a Wednesday he went off in his own time on some funny business down saint George s way and Thursday night the ten o clock boat got the grapnel on him off Hanover Hole His first two fingers on the right hand were clean gone and his left hand was mutilated frightfully He paused and glanced at Smith That lascar too he continued that you came down to see sir you remember his hands Smith nodded He was not a lascar he said shortly He was a dacoit Silence fell again I turned to the array of objects lying on the table those which had been found in Cadby s clothing None of them were noteworthy except that which had been found thrust into the loose neck of his shirt This last it was which had led the police to send for Nayland Smith for it constituted the first clew which had come to light pointing to the authors of these mysterious tragedies It was a Chinese pigtail That alone was sufficiently remarkable but it was rendered more so by the fact that the plaited queue was a false one being attached to a most ingenious bald wig You re sure it wasn t part of a Chinese make up questioned Weymouth his eye on the strange relic Cadby was clever at disguise Smith snatched the wig from my hands with a certain irritation and tried to fit it on the dead detective Too small by inches he jerked And look how it s padded in the crown This thing was made for a most abnormal head He threw it down and fell to pacing the room again Where did you find him exactly he asked Limehouse Reach under Commercial Dock Pier exactly an hour ago And you last saw him at eight o clock last night to Weymouth Eight to a quarter past You think he has been dead nearly twenty four hours Petrie Roughly twenty four hours I replied Then we know that he was on the track of the Fu Manchu group that he followed up some clew which led him to the neighborhood of old Ratcliff Highway and that he died the same night You are sure that is where he was going Yes said Weymouth He was jealous of giving anything away poor chap it meant a big lift for him if he pulled the case off But he gave me to understand that he expected to spend last night in that district He left the Yard about eight as I ve said to go to his rooms and dress for the job Did he keep any record of his cases Of course He was most particular Cadby was a man with ambitions sir You ll want to see his book Wait while I get his address it s somewhere in Brixton He went to the telephone and Inspector Ryman covered up the dead man s face Nayland Smith was palpably excited He almost succeeded where we have failed Petrie he said There is no doubt in my mind that he was hot on the track of Fu Manchu Poor Mason had probably blundered on the scent too and he met with a similar fate Without other evidence the fact that they both died in the same way as the dacoit would be conclusive for we know that Fu Manchu killed the dacoit What is the meaning of the mutilated hands Smith God knows Cadby s death was from drowning you say There are no other marks of violence But he was a very strong swimmer Doctor interrupted Inspector Ryman Why he pulled off the quarter mile championship at the Crystal Palace last year Cadby wasn t a man easy to drown And as for Mason he was an R N R and like a fish in the water Smith shrugged his shoulders helplessly Let us hope that one day we shall know how they died he said simply Weymouth returned from the telephone The address is No Cold Harbor Lane he reported I shall not be able to come along but you can t miss it it s close by the Brixton Police Station There s no family fortunately he was quite alone in the world His case book isn t in the American desk which you ll find in his sitting room it s in the cupboard in the corner top shelf Here are his keys all intact I think this is the cupboard key Smith nodded Come on Petrie he said We haven t a second to waste Our cab was waiting and in a few seconds we were speeding along Wapping High Street We had gone no more than a few hundred yards I think when Smith suddenly slapped his open hand down on his knee That pigtail he cried I have left it behind We must have it Petrie Stop Stop The cab was pulled up and Smith alighted Don t wait for me he directed hurriedly Here take Weymouth s card Remember where he said the book was It s all we want Come straight on to Scotland Yard and meet me there But Smith I protested a few minutes can make no difference Can t it he snapped Do you suppose Fu Manchu is going to leave evidence like that lying about It s a thousand to one he has it already but there is just a bare chance It was a new aspect of the situation and one that afforded no room for comment and so lost in thought did I become that the cab was outside the house for which I was bound ere I realized that we had quitted the purlieus of Wapping Yet I had had leisure to review the whole troop of events which had crowded my life since the return of Nayland Smith from Burma Mentally I had looked again upon the dead Sir Crichton Davey and with Smith had waited in the dark for the dreadful thing that had killed him Now with those remorseless memories jostling in my mind I was entering the house of Fu Manchu s last victim and the shadow of that giant evil seemed to be upon it like a palpable cloud Cadby s old landlady greeted me with a queer mixture of fear and embarrassment in her manner I am doctor Petrie I said and I regret that I bring bad news respecting mister Cadby Oh sir she cried Don t tell me that anything has happened to him And divining something of the mission on which I was come for such sad duty often falls to the lot of the medical man Oh the poor brave lad Indeed I respected the dead man s memory more than ever from that hour since the sorrow of the worthy old soul was quite pathetic and spoke eloquently for the unhappy cause of it There was a terrible wailing at the back of the house last night Doctor and I heard it again to night a second before you knocked Poor lad It was the same when his mother died At the moment I paid little attention to her words for such beliefs are common unfortunately but when she was sufficiently composed I went on to explain what I thought necessary And now the old lady s embarrassment took precedence of her sorrow and presently the truth came out There s a young lady in his rooms sir I started This might mean little or might mean much She came and waited for him last night Doctor from ten until half past and this morning again She came the third time about an hour ago and has been upstairs since Do you know her missus Dolan missus Dolan grew embarrassed again Well Doctor she said wiping her eyes the while I DO And God knows he was a good lad and I like a mother to him but she is not the girl I should have liked a son of mine to take up with At any other time this would have been amusing now it might be serious missus Dolan s account of the wailing became suddenly significant for perhaps it meant that one of Fu Manchu s dacoit followers was watching the house to give warning of any stranger s approach Warning to whom It was unlikely that I should forget the dark eyes of another of Fu Manchu s servants Was that lure of men even now in the house completing her evil work I should never have allowed her in his rooms began missus Dolan again Then there was an interruption A soft rustling reached my ears intimately feminine The girl was stealing down I leaped out into the hall and she turned and fled blindly before me back up the stairs Taking three steps at a time I followed her bounded into the room above almost at her heels and stood with my back to the door She cowered against the desk by the window a slim figure in a clinging silk gown which alone explained missus Dolan s distrust The gaslight was turned very low and her hat shadowed her face but could not hide its startling beauty could not mar the brilliancy of the skin nor dim the wonderful eyes of this modern Delilah For it was she So I came in time I said grimly and turned the key in the lock Oh she panted at that and stood facing me leaning back with her jewel laden hands clutching the desk edge Give me whatever you have removed from here I said sternly and then prepare to accompany me She took a step forward her eyes wide with fear her lips parted I have taken nothing she said Her breast was heaving tumultuously Oh let me go Please let me go And impulsively she threw herself forward pressing clasped hands against my shoulder and looking up into my face with passionate pleading eyes It is with some shame that I confess how her charm enveloped me like a magic cloud Unfamiliar with the complex Oriental temperament I had laughed at Nayland Smith when he had spoken of this girl s infatuation Love in the East he had said is like the conjurer s mango tree it is born grows and flowers at the touch of a hand Now in those pleading eyes I read confirmation of his words Her clothes or her hair exhaled a faint perfume Like all Fu Manchu s servants she was perfectly chosen for her peculiar duties Her beauty was wholly intoxicating But I thrust her away You have no claim to mercy I said Do not count upon any What have you taken from here She grasped the lapels of my coat I will tell you all I can all I dare she panted eagerly fearfully I should know how to deal with your friend but with you I am lost If you could only understand you would not be so cruel Her slight accent added charm to the musical voice I am not free as your English women are What I do I must do for it is the will of my master and I am only a slave Ah you are not a man if you can give me to the police You have no heart if you can forget that I tried to save you once I had feared that plea for in her own Oriental fashion she certainly had tried to save me from a deadly peril once at the expense of my friend But I had feared the plea for I did not know how to meet it How could I give her up perhaps to stand her trial for murder And now I fell silent and she saw why I was silent I may deserve no mercy I may be even as bad as you think but what have YOU to do with the police It is not your work to hound a woman to death Could you ever look another woman in the eyes one that you loved and know that she trusted you if you had done such a thing Ah I have no friend in all the world or I should not be here Do not be my enemy my judge and make me worse than I am be my friend and save me from HIM The tremulous lips were close to mine her breath fanned my cheek Have mercy on me At that moment I honestly would have given half of my worldly possessions to have been spared the decision which I knew I must come to After all what proof had I that she was a willing accomplice of doctor Fu Manchu Furthermore she was an Oriental and her code must necessarily be different from mine Irreconcilable as the thing may be with Western ideas Nayland Smith had really told me that he believed the girl to be a slave Then there remained that other reason why I loathed the idea of becoming her captor It was almost tantamount to betrayal Must I soil my hands with such work Thus I suppose her seductive beauty argued against my sense of right The jeweled fingers grasped my shoulders nervously and her slim body quivered against mine as she watched me with all her soul in her eyes in an abandonment of pleading despair Then I remembered the fate of the man in whose room we stood You lured Cadby to his death I said and shook her off No no she cried wildly clutching at me No I swear by the holy name I did not I did not I watched him spied upon him yes But listen it was because he would not be warned that he met his death I could not save him Ah I am not so bad as that I will tell you I have taken his notebook and torn out the last pages and burnt them Look in the grate The book was too big to steal away I came twice and could not find it There will you let me go If you will tell me where and how to seize doctor Fu Manchu yes Her hands dropped and she took a backward step A new terror was to be read in her face I dare not I dare not Then you would if you dared She was watching me intently Not if YOU would go to find him she said And with all that I thought her to be the stern servant of justice that I would have had myself I felt the hot blood leap to my cheek at all which the words implied She grasped my arm Could you hide me from him if I came to you and told you all I know The authorities Ah Her expression changed They can put me on the rack if they choose but never one word would I speak never one little word She threw up her head scornfully Then the proud glance softened again But I will speak for you Closer she came and closer until she could whisper in my ear Hide me from your police from HIM from everybody and I will no longer be his slave My heart was beating with painful rapidity I had not counted on this warring with a woman moreover it was harder than I could have dreamt of For some time I had been aware that by the charm of her personality and the art of her pleading she had brought me down from my judgment seat had made it all but impossible for me to give her up to justice Now I was disarmed but in a quandary What should I do What COULD I do I turned away from her and walked to the hearth in which some paper ash lay and yet emitted a faint smell Not more than ten seconds elapsed I am confident from the time that I stepped across the room until I glanced back But she had gone As I leapt to the door the key turned gently from the outside Ma alesh came her soft whisper but I am afraid to trust you yet Be comforted for there is one near who would have killed you had I wished it Remember I will come to you whenever you will take me and hide me Light footsteps pattered down the stairs I heard a stifled cry from missus Dolan as the mysterious visitor ran past her The front door opened and closed CHAPTER V Shen Yan s is a dope shop in one of the burrows off the old Ratcliff Highway said Inspector Weymouth Singapore Charlie s they call it It s a center for some of the Chinese societies I believe but all sorts of opium smokers use it There have never been any complaints that I know of I don t understand this We stood in his room at New Scotland Yard bending over a sheet of foolscap upon which were arranged some burned fragments from poor Cadby s grate for so hurriedly had the girl done her work that combustion had not been complete What do we make of this said Smith Hunchback lascar went up unlike others not return till Shen Yan there is no doubt about the name I think turned me out booming sound lascar in mortuary I could ident not for days or suspici Tuesday night in a different make snatch pigtail The pigtail again rapped Weymouth She evidently burned the torn out pages all together continued Smith They lay flat and this was in the middle I see the hand of retributive justice in that Inspector Now we have a reference to a hunchback and what follows amounts to this A lascar amongst several other persons went up somewhere presumably upstairs at Shen Yan s and did not come down again Cadby who was there disguised noted a booming sound Later he identified the lascar in some mortuary We have no means of fixing the date of this visit to Shen Yan s but I feel inclined to put down the lascar as the dacoit who was murdered by Fu Manchu It is sheer supposition however But that Cadby meant to pay another visit to the place in a different make up or disguise is evident and that the Tuesday night proposed was last night is a reasonable deduction The reference to a pigtail is principally interesting because of what was found on Cadby s body Inspector Weymouth nodded affirmatively and Smith glanced at his watch Exactly ten twenty three he said I will trouble you Inspector for the freedom of your fancy wardrobe There is time to spend an hour in the company of Shen Yan s opium friends Weymouth raised his eyebrows It might be risky What about an official visit Nayland Smith laughed Worse than useless By your own showing the place is open to inspection No guile against guile We are dealing with a Chinaman with the incarnate essence of Eastern subtlety with the most stupendous genius that the modern Orient has produced I don t believe in disguises said Weymouth with a certain truculence It s mostly played out that game and generally leads to failure Still if you re determined sir there s an end of it Foster will make your face up What disguise do you propose to adopt A sort of Dago seaman I think something like poor Cadby I can rely on my knowledge of the brutes if I am sure of my disguise You are forgetting me Smith I said He turned to me quickly Petrie he replied it is MY business unfortunately but it is no sort of hobby You mean that you can no longer rely upon me I said angrily Smith grasped my hand and met my rather frigid stare with a look of real concern on his gaunt bronzed face My dear old chap he answered that was really unkind You know that I meant something totally different It s all right Smith I said immediately ashamed of my choler and wrung his hand heartily I can pretend to smoke opium as well as another I shall be going too Inspector As a result of this little passage of words some twenty minutes later two dangerous looking seafaring ruffians entered a waiting cab accompanied by Inspector Weymouth and were driven off into the wilderness of London s night In this theatrical business there was to my mind something ridiculous almost childish and I could have laughed heartily had it not been that grim tragedy lurked so near to farce The mere recollection that somewhere at our journey s end Fu Manchu awaited us was sufficient to sober my reflections Fu Manchu who with all the powers represented by Nayland Smith pitted against him pursued his dark schemes triumphantly and lurked in hiding within this very area which was so sedulously patrolled Fu Manchu whom I had never seen but whose name stood for horrors indefinable Perhaps I was destined to meet the terrible Chinese doctor to night I ceased to pursue a train of thought which promised to lead to morbid depths and directed my attention to what Smith was saying We will drop down from Wapping and reconnoiter as you say the place is close to the riverside Then you can put us ashore somewhere below Ryman can keep the launch close to the back of the premises and your fellows will be hanging about near the front near enough to hear the whistle Yes assented Weymouth I ve arranged for that If you are suspected you shall give the alarm I don t know said Smith thoughtfully Even in that event I might wait awhile Don t wait too long advised the Inspector We shouldn t be much wiser if your next appearance was on the end of a grapnel somewhere down Greenwich Reach with half your fingers missing The cab pulled up outside the river police depot and Smith and I entered without delay four shabby looking fellows who had been seated in the office springing up to salute the Inspector who followed us in Guthrie and Lisle he said briskly get along and find a dark corner which commands the door of Singapore Charlie s off the old Highway You look the dirtiest of the troupe Guthrie you might drop asleep on the pavement and Lisle can argue with you about getting home Don t move till you hear the whistle inside or have my orders and note everybody that goes in and comes out You other two belong to this division The C I D men having departed the remaining pair saluted again Well you re on special duty to night You ve been prompt but don t stick your chests out so much Do you know of a back way to Shen Yan s The men looked at one another and both shook their heads There s an empty shop nearly opposite sir replied one of them I know a broken window at the back where we could climb in Then we could get through to the front and watch from there Good cried the Inspector See you are not spotted though and if you hear the whistle don t mind doing a bit of damage but be inside Shen Yan s like lightning Otherwise wait for orders Inspector Ryman came in glancing at the clock Launch is waiting he said Right replied Smith thoughtfully I am half afraid though that the recent alarms may have scared our quarry your man Mason and then Cadby Against which we have that so far as he is likely to know there has been no clew pointing to this opium den Remember he thinks Cadby s notes are destroyed The whole business is an utter mystery to me confessed Ryman I m told that there s some dangerous Chinese devil hiding somewhere in London and that you expect to find him at Shen Yan s Supposing he uses that place which is possible how do you know he s there to night I don t said Smith but it is the first clew we have had pointing to one of his haunts and time means precious lives where doctor Fu Manchu is concerned Who is he sir exactly this doctor Fu Manchu I have only the vaguest idea Inspector but he is no ordinary criminal He is the greatest genius which the powers of evil have put on earth for centuries He has the backing of a political group whose wealth is enormous and his mission in Europe is to PAVE THE WAY Do you follow me He is the advance agent of a movement so epoch making that not one Britisher and not one American in fifty thousand has ever dreamed of it Ryman stared but made no reply and we went out passing down to the breakwater and boarding the waiting launch With her crew of three the party numbered seven that swung out into the Pool and clearing the pier drew in again and hugged the murky shore The night had been clear enough hitherto but now came scudding rainbanks to curtain the crescent moon and anon to unveil her again and show the muddy swirls about us The view was not extensive from the launch Sometimes a deepening of the near shadows would tell of a moored barge or lights high above our heads mark the deck of a large vessel In the floods of moonlight gaunt shapes towered above in the ensuing darkness only the oily glitter of the tide occupied the foreground of the night piece The Surrey shore was a broken wall of blackness patched with lights about which moved hazy suggestions of human activity The bank we were following offered a prospect even more gloomy a dense dark mass amid which sometimes mysterious half tones told of a dock gate or sudden high lights leapt flaring to the eye Then out of the mystery ahead a green light grew and crept down upon us A giant shape loomed up and frowned crushingly upon the little craft A blaze of light the jangle of a bell and it was past We were dancing in the wash of one of the Scotch steamers and the murk had fallen again Discords of remote activity rose above the more intimate throbbing of our screw and we seemed a pigmy company floating past the workshops of Brobdingnagian toilers The chill of the near water communicated itself to me and I felt the protection of my shabby garments inadequate against it Far over on the Surrey shore a blue light vaporous mysterious flicked translucent tongues against the night s curtain It was a weird elusive flame leaping wavering magically changing from blue to a yellowed violet rising falling Only a gasworks came Smith s voice and I knew that he too had been watching those elfin fires But it always reminds me of a Mexican teocalli and the altar of sacrifice The simile was apt but gruesome I thought of doctor Fu Manchu and the severed fingers and could not repress a shudder On your left past the wooden pier Not where the lamp is beyond that next to the dark square building Shen Yan s It was Inspector Ryman speaking Drop us somewhere handy then replied Smith and lie close in with your ears wide open We may have to run for it so don t go far away From the tone of his voice I knew that the night mystery of the Thames had claimed at least one other victim Dead slow came Ryman s order We ll put in to the Stone Stairs CHAPTER VI A SEEMINGLY drunken voice was droning from a neighboring alleyway as Smith lurched in hulking fashion to the door of a little shop above which crudely painted were the words SHEN YAN Barber I shuffled along behind him and had time to note the box of studs German shaving tackle and rolls of twist which lay untidily in the window ere Smith kicked the door open clattered down three wooden steps and pulled himself up with a jerk seizing my arm for support We stood in a bare and very dirty room which could only claim kinship with a civilized shaving saloon by virtue of the grimy towel thrown across the back of the solitary chair A Yiddish theatrical bill of some kind illustrated adorned one of the walls and another bill in what may have been Chinese completed the decorations From behind a curtain heavily brocaded with filth a little Chinaman appeared dressed in a loose smock black trousers and thick soled slippers and advancing shook his head vigorously No shavee no shavee he chattered simian fashion squinting from one to the other of us with his twinkling eyes Too late Shuttee shop Don t you come none of it wi me roared Smith in a voice of amazing gruffness and shook an artificially dirtied fist under the Chinaman s nose Get inside and gimme an my mate a couple o pipes Smokee pipe you yellow scum savvy My friend bent forward and glared into the other s eyes with a vindictiveness that amazed me unfamiliar as I was with this form of gentle persuasion Kop old o that he said and thrust a coin into the Chinaman s yellow paw Keep me waitin an I ll pull the dam shop down Charlie You can lay to it No hab got pipee began the other Smith raised his fist and Yan capitulated Allee lightee he said Full up no loom You come see He dived behind the dirty curtain Smith and I following and ran up a dark stair The next moment I found myself in an atmosphere which was literally poisonous It was all but unbreathable being loaded with opium fumes Never before had I experienced anything like it Every breath was an effort A tin oil lamp on a box in the middle of the floor dimly illuminated the horrible place about the walls of which ten or twelve bunks were ranged and all of them occupied Most of the occupants were lying motionless but one or two were squatting in their bunks noisily sucking at the little metal pipes These had not yet attained to the opium smoker s Nirvana No loom samee tella you said Shen Yan complacently testing Smith s shilling with his yellow decayed teeth Smith walked to a corner and dropped cross legged on the floor pulling me down with him Two pipe quick he said Plenty room Two piecee pipe or plenty heap trouble A dreary voice from one of the bunks came Give im a pipe Charlie curse yer an stop is palaver Yan performed a curious little shrug rather of the back than of the shoulders and shuffled to the box which bore the smoky lamp Holding a needle in the flame he dipped it when red hot into an old cocoa tin and withdrew it with a bead of opium adhering to the end Slowly roasting this over the lamp he dropped it into the bowl of the metal pipe which he held ready where it burned with a spirituous blue flame Pass it over said Smith huskily and rose on his knees with the assumed eagerness of a slave to the drug Yan handed him the pipe which he promptly put to his lips and prepared another for me Whatever you do don t inhale any came Smith s whispered injunction It was with a sense of nausea greater even than that occasioned by the disgusting atmosphere of the den that I took the pipe and pretended to smoke Taking my cue from my friend I allowed my head gradually to sink lower and lower until within a few minutes I sprawled sideways on the floor Smith lying close beside me The ship s sinkin droned a voice from one of the bunks Look at the rats Yan had noiselessly withdrawn and I experienced a curious sense of isolation from my fellows from the whole of the Western world My throat was parched with the fumes my head ached The vicious atmosphere seemed contaminating I was as one dropped Somewhere East of Suez where the best is like the worst And there ain t no Ten Commandments and a man can raise a thirst Smith began to whisper softly We have carried it through successfully so far he said I don t know if you have observed it but there is a stair just behind you half concealed by a ragged curtain We are near that and well in the dark I have seen nothing suspicious so far or nothing much But if there was anything going forward it would no doubt be delayed until we new arrivals were well doped S SH He pressed my arm to emphasize the warning Through my half closed eyes I perceived a shadowy form near the curtain to which he had referred I lay like a log but my muscles were tensed nervously The shadow materialized as the figure moved forward into the room with a curiously lithe movement The smoky lamp in the middle of the place afforded scant illumination serving only to indicate sprawling shapes here an extended hand brown or yellow there a sketchy corpse like face whilst from all about rose obscene sighings and murmurings in far away voices an uncanny animal chorus It was like a glimpse of the Inferno seen by some Chinese Dante But so close to us stood the newcomer that I was able to make out a ghastly parchment face with small oblique eyes and a misshapen head crowned with a coiled pigtail surmounting a slight hunched body There was something unnatural inhuman about that masklike face and something repulsive in the bent shape and the long yellow hands clasped one upon the other Fu Manchu from Smith s account in no way resembled this crouching apparition with the death s head countenance and lithe movements but an instinct of some kind told me that we were on the right scent that this was one of the doctor s servants How I came to that conclusion I cannot explain but with no doubt in my mind that this was a member of the formidable murder group I saw the yellow man creep nearer nearer silently bent and peering He was watching us Of another circumstance I became aware and a disquieting circumstance There were fewer murmurings and sighings from the surrounding bunks The presence of the crouching figure had created a sudden semi silence in the den which could only mean that some of the supposed opium smokers had merely feigned coma and the approach of coma Nayland Smith lay like a dead man and trusting to the darkness I too lay prone and still but watched the evil face bending lower and lower until it came within a few inches of my own I completely closed my eyes Delicate fingers touched my right eyelid Divining what was coming I rolled my eyes up as the lid was adroitly lifted and lowered again The man moved away I had saved the situation And noting anew the hush about me a hush in which I fancied many pairs of ears listened I was glad For just a moment I realized fully how with the place watched back and front we yet were cut off were in the hands of Far Easterns to some extent in the power of members of that most inscrutably mysterious race the Chinese Good whispered Smith at my side I don t think I could have done it He took me on trust after that My God what an awful face Petrie it s the hunchback of Cadby s notes Ah I thought so Do you see that I turned my eyes round as far as was possible A man had scrambled down from one of the bunks and was following the bent figure across the room They passed around us quietly the little yellow man leading with his curious lithe gait and the other an impassive Chinaman following The curtain was raised and I heard footsteps receding on the stairs Don t stir whispered Smith An intense excitement was clearly upon him and he communicated it to me Who was the occupant of the room above Footsteps on the stair and the Chinaman reappeared recrossed the floor and went out The little bent man went over to another bunk this time leading up the stair one who looked like a lascar Did you see his right hand whispered Smith A dacoit They come here to report and to take orders Petrie doctor Fu Manchu is up there What shall we do softly Wait Then we must try to rush the stairs It would be futile to bring in the police first He is sure to have some other exit I will give the word while the little yellow devil is down here You are nearer and will have to go first but if the hunchback follows I can then deal with him Our whispered colloquy was interrupted by the return of the dacoit who recrossed the room as the Chinaman had done and immediately took his departure A third man whom Smith identified as a Malay ascended the mysterious stairs descended and went out and a fourth whose nationality it was impossible to determine followed Then as the softly moving usher crossed to a bunk on the right of the outer door Up you go Petrie cried Smith for further delay was dangerous and further dissimulation useless I leaped to my feet Snatching my revolver from the pocket of the rough jacket I wore I bounded to the stair and went blundering up in complete darkness A chorus of brutish cries clamored from behind with a muffled scream rising above them all But Nayland Smith was close behind as I raced along a covered gangway in a purer air and at my heels when I crashed open a door at the end and almost fell into the room beyond What I saw were merely a dirty table with some odds and ends upon it of which I was too excited to take note an oil lamp swung by a brass chain above and a man sitting behind the table But from the moment that my gaze rested upon the one who sat there I think if the place had been an Aladdin s palace I should have had no eyes for any of its wonders He wore a plain yellow robe of a hue almost identical with that of his smooth hairless countenance His hands were large long and bony and he held them knuckles upward and rested his pointed chin upon their thinness He had a great high brow crowned with sparse neutral colored hair Of his face as it looked out at me over the dirty table I despair of writing convincingly It was that of an archangel of evil and it was wholly dominated by the most uncanny eyes that ever reflected a human soul for they were narrow and long very slightly oblique and of a brilliant green But their unique horror lay in a certain filminess it made me think of the membrana nictitans in a bird which obscuring them as I threw wide the door seemed to lift as I actually passed the threshold revealing the eyes in all their brilliant iridescence I know that I stopped dead one foot within the room for the malignant force of the man was something surpassing my experience He was surprised by this sudden intrusion yes but no trace of fear showed upon that wonderful face only a sort of pitying contempt And as I paused he rose slowly to his feet never removing his gaze from mine IT S FU MANCHU cried Smith over my shoulder in a voice that was almost a scream IT S FU MANCHU Cover him Shoot him dead if The conclusion of that sentence I never heard doctor Fu Manchu reached down beside the table and the floor slipped from under me One last glimpse I had of the fixed green eyes and with a scream I was unable to repress I dropped dropped dropped and plunged into icy water which closed over my head Vaguely I had seen a spurt of flame had heard another cry following my own a booming sound the trap the flat note of a police whistle But when I rose to the surface impenetrable darkness enveloped me I was spitting filthy oily liquid from my mouth and fighting down the black terror that had me by the throat terror of the darkness about me of the unknown depths beneath me of the pit into which I was cast amid stifling stenches and the lapping of tidal water Smith I cried Help Help My voice seemed to beat back upon me yet I was about to cry out again when mustering all my presence of mind and all my failing courage I recognized that I had better employment of my energies and began to swim straight ahead desperately determined to face all the horrors of this place to die hard if die I must A drop of liquid fire fell through the darkness and hissed into the water beside me I felt that despite my resolution I was going mad Another fiery drop and another I touched a rotting wooden post and slimy timbers I had reached one bound of my watery prison More fire fell from above and the scream of hysteria quivered unuttered in my throat Keeping myself afloat with increasing difficulty in my heavy garments I threw my head back and raised my eyes No more drops fell and no more drops would fall but it was merely a question of time for the floor to collapse For it was beginning to emit a dull red glow The room above me was in flames It was drops of burning oil from the lamp finding passage through the cracks in the crazy flooring which had fallen about me for the death trap had reclosed I suppose mechanically My saturated garments were dragging me down and now I could hear the flames hungrily eating into the ancient rottenness overhead Shortly that cauldron would be loosed upon my head The glow of the flames grew brighter and showed me the half rotten piles upholding the building showed me the tidal mark upon the slime coated walls showed me that there was no escape By some subterranean duct the foul place was fed from the Thames By that duct with the outgoing tide my body would pass in the wake of Mason Cadby and many another victim Rusty iron rungs were affixed to one of the walls communicating with a trap but the bottom three were missing Brighter and brighter grew the awesome light the light of what should be my funeral pyre reddening the oily water and adding a new dread to the whispering clammy horror of the pit But something it showed me a projecting beam a few feet above the water and directly below the iron ladder Merciful Heaven I breathed Have I the strength A desire for laughter claimed me with sudden all but irresistible force I knew what it portended and fought it down grimly sternly My garments weighed upon me like a suit of mail with my chest aching dully my veins throbbing to bursting I forced tired muscles to work and every stroke an agony approached the beam Nearer I swam nearer Its shadow fell black upon the water which now had all the seeming of a pool of blood Confused sounds a remote uproar came to my ears I was nearly spent I was in the shadow of the beam If I could throw up one arm A shrill scream sounded far above me Petrie Petrie That voice must be Smith s Don t touch the beam For God s sake DON T TOUCH THE BEAM Keep afloat another few seconds and I can get to you Another few seconds Was that possible I managed to turn to raise my throbbing head and I saw the strangest sight which that night yet had offered Nayland Smith stood upon the lowest iron rung supported by the hideous crook backed Chinaman who stood upon the rung above I can t reach him It was as Smith hissed the words despairingly that I looked up and saw the Chinaman snatch at his coiled pigtail and pull it off With it came the wig to which it was attached and the ghastly yellow mask deprived of its fastenings fell from position Here Here Be quick Oh be quick You can lower this to him Be quick Be quick A cloud of hair came falling about the slim shoulders as the speaker bent to pass this strange lifeline to Smith and I think it was my wonder at knowing her for the girl whom that day I had surprised in Cadby s rooms which saved my life For I not only kept afloat but kept my gaze upturned to that beautiful flushed face and my eyes fixed upon hers which were wild with fear for me Smith by some contortion got the false queue into my grasp and I with the strength of desperation by that means seized hold upon the lowest rung With my friend s arm round me I realized that exhaustion was even nearer than I had supposed My last distinct memory is of the bursting of the floor above and the big burning joist hissing into the pool beneath us Its fiery passage striated with light disclosed two sword blades riveted edges up along the top of the beam which I had striven to reach The severed fingers I said and swooned How Smith got me through the trap I do not know nor how we made our way through the smoke and flames of the narrow passage it opened upon My next recollection is of sitting up with my friend s arm supporting me and Inspector Ryman holding a glass to my lips A bright glare dazzled my eyes A crowd surged about us and a clangor and shouting drew momentarily nearer It s the engines coming explained Smith seeing my bewilderment Shen Yan s is in flames It was your shot as you fell through the trap broke the oil lamp Is everybody out So far as we know Fu Manchu Smith shrugged his shoulders No one has seen him There was some door at the back Do you think he may No he said tensely Not until I see him lying dead before me shall I believe it Then memory resumed its sway I struggled to my feet Smith where is she I cried Where is she I don t know he answered She s given us the slip Doctor said Inspector Weymouth as a fire engine came swinging round the corner of the narrow lane So has mister Singapore Charlie and I m afraid somebody else We ve got six or eight all sorts some awake and some asleep but I suppose we shall have to let em go again mister Smith tells me that the girl was disguised as a Chinaman I expect that s why she managed to slip away I recalled how I had been dragged from the pit by the false queue how the strange discovery which had brought death to poor Cadby had brought life to me and I seemed to remember too that Smith had dropped it as he threw his arm about me on the ladder Her mask the girl might have retained but her wig I felt certain had been dropped into the water It was later that night when the brigade still were playing upon the blackened shell of what had been Shen Yan s opium shop and Smith and I were speeding away in a cab from the scene of God knows how many crimes that I had an idea Smith I said did you bring the pigtail with you that was found on Cadby Yes I had hoped to meet the owner Have you got it now No I met the owner I thrust my hands deep into the pockets of the big pea jacket lent to me by Inspector Ryman leaning back in my corner We shall never really excel at this business continued Nayland Smith We are far too sentimental I knew what it meant to us Petrie what it meant to the world but I hadn t the heart I owed her your life I had to square the account CHAPTER VII NIGHT fell on Redmoat I glanced from the window at the nocturne in silver and green which lay beneath me To the west of the shrubbery with its broken canopy of elms and beyond the copper beech which marked the center of its mazes a gap offered a glimpse of the Waverney where it swept into a broad Faint bird calls floated over the water These with the whisper of leaves alone claimed the ear Ideal rural peace and the music of an English summer evening but to my eyes every shadow holding fantastic terrors to my ears every sound a signal of dread For the deathful hand of Fu Manchu was stretched over Redmoat at any hour to loose strange Oriental horrors upon its inmates Well said Nayland Smith joining me at the window we had dared to hope him dead but we know now that he lives The reverend J D Eltham coughed nervously and I turned leaning my elbow upon the table and studied the play of expression upon the refined sensitive face of the clergyman You think I acted rightly in sending for you mister Smith Nayland Smith smoked furiously mister Eltham he replied you see in me a man groping in the dark I am to day no nearer to the conclusion of my mission than upon the day when I left Mandalay You offer me a clew I am here Your affair I believe stands thus A series of attempted burglaries or something of the kind has alarmed your household Yesterday returning from London with your daughter you were both drugged in some way and occupying a compartment to yourselves you both slept Your daughter awoke and saw someone else in the carriage a yellow faced man who held a case of instruments in his hands Yes I was of course unable to enter into particulars over the telephone The man was standing by one of the windows Directly he observed that my daughter was awake he stepped towards her What did he do with the case in his hands She did not notice or did not mention having noticed In fact as was natural she was so frightened that she recalls nothing more beyond the fact that she strove to arouse me without succeeding felt hands grasp her shoulders and swooned But someone used the emergency cord and stopped the train Greba has no recollection of having done so Hm Of course no yellow faced man was on the train When did you awake I was aroused by the guard but only when he had repeatedly shaken me Upon reaching Great Yarmouth you immediately called up Scotland Yard You acted very wisely sir How long were you in China mister Eltham s start of surprise was almost comical It is perhaps not strange that you should be aware of my residence in China mister Smith he said but my not having mentioned it may seem so The fact is his sensitive face flushed in palpable embarrassment I left China under what I may term an episcopal cloud I have lived in retirement ever since Unwittingly I solemnly declare to you mister Smith unwittingly I stirred up certain deep seated prejudices in my endeavors to do my duty my duty I think you asked me how long I was in China I was there from eighteen ninety six until nineteen hundred four years I recall the circumstances mister Eltham said Smith with an odd note in his voice I have been endeavoring to think where I had come across the name and a moment ago I remembered I am happy to have met you sir The clergyman blushed again like a girl and slightly inclined his head with its scanty fair hair Has Redmoat as its name implies a moat round it I was unable to see in the dusk It remains Redmoat a corruption of Round Moat was formerly a priory disestablished by the eighth Henry in fifteen thirty six His pedantic manner was quaint at times But the moat is no longer flooded In fact we grow cabbages in part of it If you refer to the strategic strength of the place he smiled but his manner was embarrassed again it is considerable I have barbed wire fencing and other arrangements You see it is a lonely spot he added apologetically And now if you will excuse me we will resume these gruesome inquiries after the more pleasant affairs of dinner He left us Who is our host I asked as the door closed Smith smiled You are wondering what caused the episcopal cloud he suggested Well the deep seated prejudices which our reverend friend stirred up culminated in the Boxer Risings Good heavens Smith I said for I could not reconcile the diffident personality of the clergyman with the memories which those words awakened He evidently should be on our danger list my friend continued quickly but he has so completely effaced himself of recent years that I think it probable that someone else has only just recalled his existence to mind The reverend J D Eltham my dear Petrie though he may be a poor hand at saving souls at any rate has saved a score of Christian women from death and worse J D Eltham I began Is Parson Dan rapped Smith the Fighting Missionary the man who with a garrison of a dozen cripples and a German doctor held the hospital at Nan Yang against two hundred Boxers That s who the reverend J D Eltham is But what is he up to now I have yet to find out He is keeping something back something which has made him an object of interest to Young China During dinner the matters responsible for our presence there did not hold priority in the conversation In fact this for the most part consisted in light talk of books and theaters Greba Eltham the clergyman s daughter was a charming young hostess and she with Vernon Denby mister Eltham s nephew completed the party No doubt the girl s presence in part at any rate led us to refrain from the subject uppermost in our minds These little pools of calm dotted along the torrential course of the circumstances which were bearing my friend and me onward to unknown issues form pleasant sunny spots in my dark recollections So I shall always remember with pleasure that dinner party at Redmoat in the old world dining room it was so very peaceful so almost grotesquely calm For I within my very bones felt it to be the calm before the storm When later we men passed to the library we seemed to leave that atmosphere behind us Redmoat said the reverend J D Eltham has latterly become the theater of strange doings He stood on the hearth rug A shaded lamp upon the big table and candles in ancient sconces upon the mantelpiece afforded dim illumination mister Eltham s nephew Vernon Denby lolled smoking on the window seat and I sat near to him Nayland Smith paced restlessly up and down the room Some months ago almost a year continued the clergyman a burglarious attempt was made upon the house There was an arrest and the man confessed that he had been tempted by my collection He waved his hand vaguely towards the several cabinets about the shadowed room It was shortly afterwards that I allowed my hobby for playing at forts to run away with me He smiled an apology I virtually fortified Redmoat against trespassers of any kind I mean You have seen that the house stands upon a kind of large mound This is artificial being the buried ruins of a Roman outwork a portion of the ancient castrum Again he waved indicatively this time toward the window When it was a priory it was completely isolated and defended by its environing moat Today it is completely surrounded by barbed wire fencing Below this fence on the east is a narrow stream a tributary of the Waverney on the north and west the high road but nearly twenty feet below the banks being perpendicular On the south is the remaining part of the moat now my kitchen garden but from there up to the level of the house is nearly twenty feet again and the barbed wire must also be counted with The entrance as you know is by the way of a kind of cutting There is a gate at the foot of the steps they are some of the original steps of the priory doctor Petrie and another gate at the head He paused and smiled around upon us boyishly My secret defenses remain to be mentioned he resumed and opening a cupboard he pointed to a row of batteries with a number of electric bells upon the wall behind The more vulnerable spots are connected at night with these bells he said triumphantly Any attempt to scale the barbed wire or to force either gate would set two or more of these ringing A stray cow raised one false alarm he added and a careless rook threw us into a perfect panic on another occasion He was so boyish so nervously brisk and acutely sensitive that it was difficult to see in him the hero of the Nan Yang hospital I could only suppose that he had treated the Boxers raid in the same spirit wherein he met would be trespassers within the precincts of Redmoat It had been an escapade of which he was afterwards ashamed as faintly he was ashamed of his fortifications But rapped Smith it was not the visit of the burglar which prompted these elaborate precautions mister Eltham coughed nervously I am aware he said that having invoked official aid I must be perfectly frank with you mister Smith It was the burglar who was responsible for my continuing the wire fence all round the grounds but the electrical contrivance followed later as a result of several disturbed nights My servants grew uneasy about someone who came they said after dusk No one could describe this nocturnal visitor but certainly we found traces I must admit that Then I received what I may term a warning My position is a peculiar one a peculiar one My daughter too saw this prowling person over by the Roman castrum and described him as a yellow man It was the incident in the train following closely upon this other which led me to speak to the police little as I desired to er court publicity Nayland Smith walked to a window and looked out across the sloping lawn to where the shadows of the shrubbery lay A dog was howling dismally somewhere Your defenses are not impregnable after all then he jerked On our way up this evening mister Denby was telling us about the death of his collie a few nights ago The clergyman s face clouded That certainly was alarming he confessed I had been in London for a few days and during my absence Vernon came down bringing the dog with him On the night of his arrival it ran barking into the shrubbery yonder and did not come out He went to look for it with a lantern and found it lying among the bushes quite dead The poor creature had been dreadfully beaten about the head The gates were locked Denby interrupted and no one could have got out of the grounds without a ladder and someone to assist him But there was no sign of a living thing about Edwards and I searched every corner How long has that other dog taken to howling inquired Smith Only since Rex s death said Denby quickly It is my mastiff explained the clergyman and he is confined in the yard He is never allowed on this side of the house Nayland Smith wandered aimlessly about the library I am sorry to have to press you mister Eltham he said but what was the nature of the warning to which you referred and from whom did it come mister Eltham hesitated for a long time I have been so unfortunate he said at last in my previous efforts that I feel assured of your hostile criticism when I tell you that I am contemplating an immediate return to Ho Nan Smith jumped round upon him as though moved by a spring Then you are going back to Nan Yang he cried Now I understand Why have you not told me before That is the key for which I have vainly been seeking Your troubles date from the time of your decision to return Yes I must admit it confessed the clergyman diffidently And your warning came from China It did From a Chinaman From the Mandarin Yen Sun Yat Yen Sun Yat My good sir He warned you to abandon your visit And you reject his advice Listen to me Smith was intensely excited now his eyes bright his lean figure curiously strung up alert The Mandarin Yen Sun Yat is one of the seven I do not follow you mister Smith No sir China to day is not the China of ninety eight It is a huge secret machine and Ho Nan one of its most important wheels But if as I understand this official is a friend of yours believe me he has saved your life You would be a dead man now if it were not for your friend in China My dear sir you must accept his counsel Then for the first time since I had made his acquaintance Parson Dan showed through the surface of the reverend J D Eltham No sir replied the clergyman and the change in his voice was startling I am called to Nan Yang Only One may deter my going The admixture of deep spiritual reverence with intense truculence in his voice was dissimilar from anything I ever had heard Then only One can protect you cried Smith for by Heaven no MAN will be able to do so Your presence in Ho Nan can do no possible good at present It must do harm Your experience in nineteen hundred should be fresh in your memory Hard words mister Smith The class of missionary work which you favor sir is injurious to international peace At the present moment Ho Nan is a barrel of gunpowder you would be the lighted match I do not willingly stand between any man and what he chooses to consider his duty but I insist that you abandon your visit to the interior of China You insist mister Smith As your guest I regret the necessity for reminding you that I hold authority to enforce it Denby fidgeted uneasily The tone of the conversation was growing harsh and the atmosphere of the library portentous with brewing storms There was a short silent interval This is what I had feared and expected said the clergyman This was my reason for not seeking official protection The phantom Yellow Peril said Nayland Smith to day materializes under the very eyes of the Western world The Yellow Peril You scoff sir and so do others We take the proffered right hand of friendship nor inquire if the hidden left holds a knife The peace of the world is at stake mister Eltham Unknowingly you tamper with tremendous issues mister Eltham drew a deep breath thrusting both hands in his pockets You are painfully frank mister Smith he said but I like you for it I will reconsider my position and talk this matter over again with you to morrow Thus then the storm blew over Yet I had never experienced such an overwhelming sense of imminent peril of a sinister presence as oppressed me at that moment The very atmosphere of Redmoat was impregnated with Eastern devilry it loaded the air like some evil perfume And then through the silence cut a throbbing scream the scream of a woman in direst fear My God it s Greba whispered mister Eltham CHAPTER VIII IN what order we dashed down to the drawing room I cannot recall But none was before me when I leaped over the threshold and saw Miss Eltham prone by the French windows These were closed and bolted and she lay with hands outstretched in the alcove which they formed I bent over her Nayland Smith was at my elbow Get my bag I said She has swooned It is nothing serious Her father pale and wide eyed hovered about me muttering incoherently but I managed to reassure him and his gratitude when I having administered a simple restorative the girl sighed shudderingly and opened her eyes was quite pathetic I would permit no questioning at that time and on her father s arm she retired to her own rooms It was some fifteen minutes later that her message was brought to me I followed the maid to a quaint little octagonal apartment and Greba Eltham stood before me the candlelight caressing the soft curves of her face and gleaming in the meshes of her rich brown hair When she had answered my first question she hesitated in pretty confusion We are anxious to know what alarmed you Miss Eltham She bit her lip and glanced with apprehension towards the window I am almost afraid to tell father she began rapidly He will think me imaginative but you have been so kind It was two green eyes Oh doctor Petrie they looked up at me from the steps leading to the lawn And they shone like the eyes of a cat The words thrilled me strangely Are you sure it was not a cat Miss Eltham The eyes were too large doctor Petrie There was something dreadful most dreadful in their appearance I feel foolish and silly for having fainted twice in two days But the suspense is telling upon me I suppose Father thinks she was becoming charmingly confidential as a woman often will with a tactful physician that shut up here we are safe from whatever threatens us I noted with concern a repetition of the nervous shudder But since our return someone else has been in Redmoat Whatever do you mean Miss Eltham Oh I don t quite know what I do mean doctor Petrie What does it ALL mean Vernon has been explaining to me that some awful Chinaman is seeking the life of mister Nayland Smith But if the same man wants to kill my father why has he not done so I am afraid you puzzle me Of course I must do so But the man in the train He could have killed us both quite easily And last night someone was in father s room In his room I could not sleep and I heard something moving My room is the next one I knocked on the wall and woke father There was nothing so I said it was the howling of the dog that had frightened me How could anyone get into his room I cannot imagine But I am not sure it was a man Miss Eltham you alarm me What do you suspect You must think me hysterical and silly but whilst father and I have been away from Redmoat perhaps the usual precautions have been neglected Is there any creature any large creature which could climb up the wall to the window Do you know of anything with a long thin body For a moment I offered no reply studying the girl s pretty face her eager blue gray eyes widely opened and fixed upon mine She was not of the neurotic type with her clear complexion and sun kissed neck her arms healthily toned by exposure to the country airs were rounded and firm and she had the agile shape of a young Diana with none of the anaemic languor which breeds morbid dreams She was frightened yes who would not have been But the mere idea of this thing which she believed to be in Redmoat without the apparition of the green eyes must have prostrated a victim of nerves Have you seen such a creature Miss Eltham She hesitated again glancing down and pressing her finger tips together As father awoke and called out to know why I knocked I glanced from my window The moonlight threw half the lawn into shadow and just disappearing in this shadow was something something of a brown color marked with sections What size and shape It moved so quickly I could form no idea of its shape but I saw quite six feet of it flash across the grass Did you hear anything A swishing sound in the shrubbery then nothing more She met my eyes expectantly Her confidence in my powers of understanding and sympathy was gratifying though I knew that I but occupied the position of a father confessor Have you any idea I said how it came about that you awoke in the train yesterday whilst your father did not We had coffee at a refreshment room it must have been drugged in some way I scarcely tasted mine the flavor was so awful but father is an old traveler and drank the whole of his cupful mister Eltham s voice called from below doctor Petrie said the girl quickly what do you think they want to do to him Ah I replied I wish I knew that Will you think over what I have told you For I do assure you there is something here in Redmoat something that comes and goes in spite of father s fortifications Caesar knows there is Listen to him He drags at his chain so that I wonder he does not break it As we passed downstairs the howling of the mastiff sounded eerily through the house as did the clank clank of the tightening chain as he threw the weight of his big body upon it I sat in Smith s room that night for some time he pacing the floor smoking and talking Eltham has influential Chinese friends he said but they dare not have him in Nan Yang at present He knows the country as he knows Norfolk he would see things His precautions here have baffled the enemy I think The attempt in the train points to an anxiety to waste no opportunity But whilst Eltham was absent he was getting his outfit in London by the way they have been fixing some second string to their fiddle here In case no opportunity offered before he returned they provided for getting at him here But how Smith That s the mystery But the dead dog in the shrubbery is significant Do you think some emissary of Fu Manchu is actually inside the moat It s impossible Petrie You are thinking of secret passages and so forth There are none Eltham has measured up every foot of the place There isn t a rathole left unaccounted for and as for a tunnel under the moat the house stands on a solid mass of Roman masonry a former camp of Hadrian s time I have seen a very old plan of the Round Moat Priory as it was called There is no entrance and no exit save by the steps So how was the dog killed I knocked out my pipe on a bar of the grate We are in the thick of it here I said We are always in the thick of it replied Smith Our danger is no greater in Norfolk than in London But what do they want to do That man in the train with the case of instruments WHAT instruments Then the apparition of the green eyes to night Can they have been the eyes of Fu Manchu Is some peculiarly unique outrage contemplated something calling for the presence of the master He may have to prevent Eltham s leaving England without killing him Quite so He probably has instructions to be merciful But God help the victim of Chinese mercy I went to my own room then But I did not even undress refilling my pipe and seating myself at the open window Having looked upon the awful Chinese doctor the memory of his face with its filmed green eyes could never leave me The idea that he might be near at that moment was a poor narcotic The howling and baying of the mastiff was almost continuous When all else in Redmoat was still the dog s mournful note yet rose on the night with something menacing in it I sat looking out across the sloping turf to where the shrubbery showed as a black island in a green sea The moon swam in a cloudless sky and the air was warm and fragrant with country scents It was in the shrubbery that Denby s collie had met his mysterious death that the thing seen by Miss Eltham had disappeared What uncanny secret did it hold Caesar became silent As the stopping of a clock will sometimes awaken a sleeper the abrupt cessation of that distant howling to which I had grown accustomed now recalled me from a world of gloomy imaginings I glanced at my watch in the moonlight It was twelve minutes past midnight As I replaced it the dog suddenly burst out afresh but now in a tone of sheer anger He was alternately howling and snarling in a way that sounded new to me The crashes as he leapt to the end of his chain shook the building in which he was confined It was as I stood up to lean from the window and commanded a view of the corner of the house that he broke loose With a hoarse bay he took that decisive leap and I heard his heavy body fall against the wooden wall There followed a strange guttural cry and the growling of the dog died away at the rear of the house He was out But that guttural note had not come from the throat of a dog Of what was he in pursuit At which point his mysterious quarry entered the shrubbery I do not know I only know that I saw absolutely nothing until Caesar s lithe shape was streaked across the lawn and the great creature went crashing into the undergrowth Then a faint sound above and to my right told me that I was not the only spectator of the scene I leaned farther from the window Is that you Miss Eltham I asked Oh doctor Petrie she said I am so glad you are awake Can we do nothing to help Caesar will be killed Did you see what he went after No she called back and drew her breath sharply For a strange figure went racing across the grass It was that of a man in a blue dressing gown who held a lantern high before him and a revolver in his right hand Coincident with my recognition of mister Eltham he leaped plunging into the shrubbery in the wake of the dog But the night held yet another surprise for Nayland Smith s voice came Come back Come back Eltham I ran out into the passage and downstairs The front door was open A terrible conflict waged in the shrubbery between the mastiff and something else Passing round to the lawn I met Smith fully dressed He just had dropped from a first floor window The man is mad he snapped Heaven knows what lurks there He should not have gone alone Together we ran towards the dancing light of Eltham s lantern The sounds of conflict ceased suddenly Stumbling over stumps and lashed by low sweeping branches we struggled forward to where the clergyman knelt amongst the bushes He glanced up with tears in his eyes as was revealed by the dim light Look he cried The body of the dog lay at his feet It was pitiable to think that the fearless brute should have met his death in such a fashion and when I bent and examined him I was glad to find traces of life Drag him out He is not dead I said And hurry rapped Smith peering about him right and left So we three hurried from that haunted place dragging the dog with us We were not molested No sound disturbed the now perfect stillness By the lawn edge we came upon Denby half dressed and almost immediately Edwards the gardener also appeared The white faces of the house servants showed at one window and Miss Eltham called to me from her room Is he dead No I replied only stunned We carried the dog round to the yard and I examined his head It had been struck by some heavy blunt instrument but the skull was not broken It is hard to kill a mastiff Will you attend to him Doctor asked Eltham We must see that the villain does not escape His face was grim and set This was a different man from the diffident clergyman we knew this was Parson Dan again I accepted the care of the canine patient and Eltham with the others went off for more lights to search the shrubbery As I was washing a bad wound between the mastiff s ears Miss Eltham joined me It was the sound of her voice I think rather than my more scientific ministration which recalled Caesar to life For as she entered his tail wagged feebly and a moment later he struggled to his feet one of which was injured Having provided for his immediate needs I left him in charge of his young mistress and joined the search party They had entered the shrubbery from four points and drawn blank There is absolutely nothing there and no one can possibly have left the grounds said Eltham amazedly We stood on the lawn looking at one another Nayland Smith angry but thoughtful tugging at the lobe of his left ear as was his habit in moments of perplexity CHAPTER IX WITH the first coming of light Eltham Smith and I tested the electrical contrivances from every point They were in perfect order It became more and more incomprehensible how anyone could have entered and quitted Redmoat during the night The barbed wire fencing was intact and bore no signs of having been tampered with Smith and I undertook an exhaustive examination of the shrubbery At the spot where we had found the dog some five paces to the west of the copper beech the grass and weeds were trampled and the surrounding laurels and rhododendrons bore evidence of a struggle but no human footprint could be found The ground is dry said Smith We cannot expect much In my opinion I said someone tried to get at Caesar his presence is dangerous And in his rage he broke loose I think so too agreed Smith But why did this person make for here And how having mastered the dog get out of Redmoat I am open to admit the possibility of someone s getting in during the day whilst the gates are open and hiding until dusk But how in the name of all that s wonderful does he GET OUT He must possess the attributes of a bird I thought of Greba Eltham s statements reminding my friend of her description of the thing which she had seen passing into this strangely haunted shrubbery That line of speculation soon takes us out of our depth Petrie he said Let us stick to what we can understand and that may help us to a clearer idea of what at present is incomprehensible My view of the case to date stands thus one Eltham having rashly decided to return to the interior of China is warned by an official whose friendship he has won in some way to stay in England two I know this official for one of the Yellow group represented in England by doctor Fu Manchu three Several attempts of which we know but little to get at Eltham are frustrated presumably by his curious defenses An attempt in a train fails owing to Miss Eltham s distaste for refreshment room coffee An attempt here fails owing to her insomnia four During Eltham s absence from Redmoat certain preparations are made for his return These lead to a The death of Denby s collie b The things heard and seen by Miss Eltham c The things heard and seen by us all last night So that the clearing up of my fourth point id est the discovery of the nature of these preparations becomes our immediate concern The prime object of these preparations Petrie was to enable someone to gain access to Eltham s room The other events are incidental The dogs HAD to be got rid of for instance and there is no doubt that Miss Eltham s wakefulness saved her father a second time But from what For Heaven s sake from what Smith glanced about into the light patched shadows From a visit by someone perhaps by Fu Manchu himself he said in a hushed voice The object of that visit I hope we may never learn for that would mean that it had been achieved Smith I said I do not altogether understand you but do you think he has some incredible creature hidden here somewhere It would be like him I begin to suspect the most formidable creature in the known world to be hidden here I believe Fu Manchu is somewhere inside Redmoat Our conversation was interrupted at this point by Denby who came to report that he had examined the moat the roadside and the bank of the stream but found no footprints or clew of any kind No one left the grounds of Redmoat last night I think he said And his voice had awe in it That day dragged slowly on A party of us scoured the neighborhood for traces of strangers examining every foot of the Roman ruin hard by but vainly May not your presence here induce Fu Manchu to abandon his plans I asked Smith I think not he replied You see unless we can prevail upon him Eltham sails in a fortnight So the Doctor has no time to waste Furthermore I have an idea that his arrangements are of such a character that they MUST go forward He might turn aside of course to assassinate me if opportunity arose But we know from experience that he permits nothing to interfere with his schemes There are few states I suppose which exact so severe a toll from one s nervous system as the ANTICIPATION of calamity All anticipation is keener be it of joy or pain than the reality whereof it is a mental forecast but that inactive waiting at Redmoat for the blow which we knew full well to be pending exceeded in its nerve taxation anything I hitherto had experienced I felt as one bound upon an Aztec altar with the priest s obsidian knife raised above my breast Secret and malign forces throbbed about us forces against which we had no armor Dreadful as it was I count it a mercy that the climax was reached so quickly And it came suddenly enough for there in that quiet Norfolk home we found ourselves at hand grips with one of the mysterious horrors which characterized the operations of doctor Fu Manchu It was upon us before we realized it There is no incidental music to the dramas of real life As we sat on the little terrace in the creeping twilight I remember thinking how the peace of the scene gave the lie to my fears that we bordered upon tragic things Then Caesar who had been a docile patient all day began howling again and I saw Greba Eltham shudder I caught Smith s eye and was about to propose our retirement indoors when the party was broken up in more turbulent fashion I suppose it was the presence of the girl which prompted Denby to the rash act a desire personally to distinguish himself But as I recalled afterwards his gaze had rarely left the shrubbery since dusk save to seek her face and now he leaped wildly to his feet overturning his chair and dashed across the grass to the trees Did you see it he yelled Did you see it He evidently carried a revolver For from the edge of the shrubbery a shot sounded and in the flash we saw Denby with the weapon raised Greba go in and fasten the windows cried Eltham mister Smith will you enter the bushes from the west doctor Petrie east Edwards Edwards And he was off across the lawn with the nervous activity of a cat As I made off in an opposite direction I heard the gardener s voice from the lower gate and I saw Eltham s plan It was to surround the shrubbery Two more shots and two flashes from the dense heart of greenwood Then a loud cry I thought from Denby and a second muffled one Following silence only broken by the howling of the mastiff I sprinted through the rose garden leaped heedlessly over a bed of geranium and heliotrope and plunged in among the bushes and under the elms Away on the left I heard Edwards shouting and Eltham s answering voice Denby I cried and yet louder Denby But the silence fell again Dusk was upon Redmoat now but from sitting in the twilight my eyes had grown accustomed to gloom and I could see fairly well what lay before me Not daring to think what might lurk above below around me I pressed on into the midst of the thicket Vernon came Eltham s voice from one side Bear more to the right Edwards I heard Nayland Smith cry directly ahead of me With an eerie and indescribable sensation of impending disaster upon me I thrust my way through to a gray patch which marked a break in the elmen roof At the foot of the copper beech I almost fell over Eltham Then Smith plunged into view Lastly Edwards the gardener rounded a big rhododendron and completed the party We stood quite still for a moment A faint breeze whispered through the beech leaves Where is he I cannot remember who put it into words I was too dazed with amazement to notice Then Eltham began shouting Vernon Vernon VERNON His voice pitched higher upon each repetition There was something horrible about that vain calling under the whispering beech with shrubs banked about us cloaking God alone could know what From the back of the house came Caesar s faint reply Quick Lights rapped Smith Every lamp you have Off we went dodging laurels and privets and poured out on to the lawn a disordered company Eltham s face was deathly pale and his jaw set hard He met my eye God forgive me he said I could do murder to night He was a man composed of strange perplexities It seemed an age before the lights were found But at last we returned to the bushes really after a very brief delay and ten minutes sufficed us to explore the entire shrubbery for it was not extensive We found his revolver but there was no one there nothing When we all stood again on the lawn I thought that I had never seen Smith so haggard What in Heaven s name can we do he muttered What does it mean He expected no answer for there was none to offer one Search Everywhere said Eltham hoarsely He ran off into the rose garden and began beating about among the flowers like a madman muttering Vernon Vernon For close upon an hour we all searched We searched every square yard I think within the wire fencing and found no trace Miss Eltham slipped out in the confusion and joined with the rest of us in that frantic hunt Some of the servants assisted too It was a group terrified and awestricken which came together again on the terrace One and then another would give up until only Eltham and Smith were missing Then they came back together from examining the steps to the lower gate Eltham dropped on to a rustic seat and sank his head in his hands Nayland Smith paced up and down like a newly caged animal snapping his teeth together and tugging at his ear Possessed by some sudden idea or pressed to action by his tumultuous thoughts he snatched up a lantern and strode silently off across the grass and to the shrubbery once more I followed him I think his idea was that he might surprise anyone who lurked there He surprised himself and all of us For right at the margin he tripped and fell flat I ran to him He had fallen over the body of Denby which lay there Denby had not been there a few moments before and how he came to be there now we dared not conjecture mister Eltham joined us uttered one short dry sob and dropped upon his knees Then we were carrying Denby back to the house with the mastiff howling a marche funebre We laid him on the grass where it sloped down from the terrace Nayland Smith s haggard face was terrible But the stark horror of the thing inspired him to that which conceived earlier had saved Denby Twisting suddenly to Eltham he roared in a voice audible beyond the river Heavens we are fools LOOSE THE DOG But the dog I began Smith clapped his hand over my mouth I know he s crippled he whispered But if anything human lurks there the dog will lead us to it If a MAN is there he will fly Why did we not think of it before Fools fools He raised his voice again Keep him on leash Edwards He will lead us The scheme succeeded Edwards barely had started on his errand when bells began ringing inside the house Wait snapped Eltham and rushed indoors A moment later he was out again his eyes gleaming madly Above the moat he panted And we were off en masse round the edge of the trees It was dark above the moat but not so dark as to prevent our seeing a narrow ladder of thin bamboo joints and silken cord hanging by two hooks from the top of the twelve foot wire fence There was no sound He s out screamed Eltham Down the steps We all ran our best and swiftest But Eltham outran us Like a fury he tore at bolts and bars and like a fury sprang out into the road Straight and white it showed to the acclivity by the Roman ruin But no living thing moved upon it The distant baying of the dog was borne to our ears Curse it he s crippled hissed Smith Without him as well pursue a shadow A few hours later the shrubbery yielded up its secret a simple one enough A big cask sunk in a pit with a laurel shrub cunningly affixed to its movable lid which was further disguised with tufts of grass A slender bamboo jointed rod lay near the fence It had a hook on the top and was evidently used for attaching the ladder It was the end of this ladder which Miss Eltham saw said Smith as he trailed it behind him into the shrubbery when she interrupted him in her fathers room He and whomever he had with him doubtless slipped in during the daytime whilst Eltham was absent in London bringing the prepared cask and all necessary implements with them They concealed themselves somewhere probably in the shrubbery and during the night made the cache The excavated earth would be disposed of on the flower beds the dummy bush they probably had ready You see the problem of getting IN was never a big one But owing to the defenses it was impossible whilst Eltham was in residence at any rate to get OUT after dark For Fu Manchu s purposes then a working base INSIDE Redmoat was essential His servant for he needed assistance must have been in hiding somewhere outside Heaven knows where During the day they could come or go by the gates as we have already noted You think it was the Doctor himself It seems possible Who else has eyes like the eyes Miss Eltham saw from the window last night Then remains to tell the nature of the outrage whereby Fu Manchu had planned to prevent Eltham s leaving England for China This we learned from Denby For Denby was not dead It was easy to divine that he had stumbled upon the fiendish visitor at the very entrance to his burrow had been stunned judging from the evidence with a sand bag and dragged down into the cache to which he must have lain in such dangerous proximity as to render detection of the dummy bush possible in removing him The quickest expedient then had been to draw him beneath When the search of the shrubbery was concluded his body had been borne to the edge of the bushes and laid where we found it Why his life had been spared I cannot conjecture but provision had been made against his recovering consciousness and revealing the secret of the shrubbery The ruse of releasing the mastiff alone had terminated the visit of the unbidden guest within Redmoat Denby made a very slow recovery and even when convalescent consciously added not one fact to those we already had collated his memory had completely deserted him This in my opinion as in those of the several specialists consulted was due not to the blow on the head but to the presence slightly below and to the right of the first cervical curve of the spine of a minute puncture undoubtedly caused by a hypodermic syringe Then unconsciously poor Denby furnished the last link in the chain for undoubtedly by means of this operation Fu Manchu had designed to efface from Eltham s mind his plans of return to Ho Nan The nature of the fluid which could produce such mental symptoms was a mystery a mystery which defied Western science one of the many strange secrets of doctor Fu Manchu CHAPTER X SINCE Nayland Smith s return from Burma I had rarely taken up a paper without coming upon evidences of that seething which had cast up doctor Fu Manchu Whether hitherto such items had escaped my attention or had seemed to demand no particular notice or whether they now became increasingly numerous I was unable to determine One evening some little time after our sojourn in Norfolk in glancing through a number of papers which I had brought in with me I chanced upon no fewer than four items of news bearing more or less directly upon the grim business which engaged my friend and I No white man I honestly believe appreciates the unemotional cruelty of the Chinese Throughout the time that doctor Fu Manchu remained in England the press preserved a uniform silence upon the subject of his existence This was due to Nayland Smith But as a result I feel assured that my account of the Chinaman s deeds will in many quarters meet with an incredulous reception I had been at work earlier in the evening upon the opening chapters of this chronicle and I had realized how difficult it would be for my reader amid secure and cozy surroundings to credit any human being with a callous villainy great enough to conceive and to put into execution such a death pest as that directed against Sir Crichton Davey One would expect God s worst man to shrink from employing against however vile an enemy such an instrument as the Zayat Kiss So thinking my eye was caught by the following EXPRESS CORRESPONDENT NEW YORK Secret service men of the United States Government are searching the South Sea Islands for a certain Hawaiian from the island of Maui who it is believed has been selling poisonous scorpions to Chinese in Honolulu anxious to get rid of their children Infanticide by scorpion and otherwise among the Chinese has increased so terribly that the authorities have started a searching inquiry which has led to the hunt for the scorpion dealer of Maui Practically all the babies that die mysteriously are unwanted girls and in nearly every case the parents promptly ascribe the death to the bite of a scorpion and are ready to produce some more or less poisonous insect in support of the statement The authorities have no doubt that infanticide by scorpion bite is a growing practice and orders have been given to hunt down the scorpion dealer at any cost Is it any matter for wonder that such a people had produced a Fu Manchu I pasted the cutting into a scrap book determined that if I lived to publish my account of those days I would quote it therein as casting a sidelight upon Chinese character A Reuter message to The Globe and a paragraph in The Star also furnished work for my scissors Here were evidences of the deep seated unrest the secret turmoil which manifested itself so far from its center as peaceful England in the person of the sinister Doctor HONG KONG Friday Li honorable Hung the Chinaman who fired at the Governor yesterday was charged before the magistrate with shooting at him with intent to kill which is equivalent to attempted murder The prisoner who was not defended pleaded guilty The Assistant Crown Solicitor who prosecuted asked for a remand until Monday which was granted Snapshots taken by the spectators of the outrage yesterday disclosed the presence of an accomplice also armed with a revolver It is reported that this man who was arrested last night was in possession of incriminating documentary evidence Later Examination of the documents found on Li honorable Hung s accomplice has disclosed the fact that both men were well financed by the Canton Triad Society the directors of which had enjoined the assassination of Sir F M or mister C S the Colonial Secretary In a report prepared by the accomplice for dispatch to Canton also found on his person he expressed regret that the attempt had failed Reuter It is officially reported in saint Petersburg that a force of Chinese soldiers and villagers surrounded the house of a Russian subject named Said Effendi near Khotan in Chinese Turkestan They fired at the house and set it in flames There were in the house about one hundred Russians many of whom were killed The Russian Government has instructed its Minister at Peking to make the most vigorous representations on the subject Reuter Finally in a Personal Column I found the following HO NAN Have abandoned visit ELTHAM I had just pasted it into my book when Nayland Smith came in and threw himself into an arm chair facing me across the table I showed him the cutting I am glad for Eltham s sake and for the girl s was his comment But it marks another victory for Fu Manchu Just Heaven Why is retribution delayed Smith s darkly tanned face had grown leaner than ever since he had begun his fight with the most uncanny opponent I suppose against whom a man ever had pitted himself He stood up and began restlessly to pace the room furiously stuffing tobacco into his briar I have seen Sir Lionel Barton he said abruptly and to put the whole thing in a nutshell he has laughed at me During the months that I have been wondering where he had gone to he has been somewhere in Egypt He certainly bears a charmed life for on the evidence of his letter to The Times he has seen things in Tibet which Fu Manchu would have the West blind to in fact I think he has found a new keyhole to the gate of the Indian Empire Long ago we had placed the name of Sir Lionel Barton upon the list of those whose lives stood between Fu Manchu and the attainment of his end Orientalist and explorer the fearless traveler who first had penetrated to Lhassa who thrice as a pilgrim had entered forbidden Mecca he now had turned his attention again to Tibet thereby signing his own death warrant That he has reached England alive is a hopeful sign I suggested Smith shook his head and lighted the blackened briar England at present is the web he replied The spider will be waiting Petrie I sometimes despair Sir Lionel is an impossible man to shepherd You ought to see his house at Finchley A low squat place completely hemmed in by trees Damp as a swamp smells like a jungle Everything topsy turvy He only arrived to day and he is working and eating and sleeping I expect in a study that looks like an earthquake at Sotheby s auction rooms The rest of the house is half a menagerie and half a circus He has a Bedouin groom a Chinese body servant and Heaven only knows what other strange people Chinese Yes I saw him a squinting Cantonese he calls Kwee I don t like him Also there is a secretary known as Strozza who has an unpleasant face He is a fine linguist I understand and is engaged upon the Spanish notes for Barton s forthcoming book on the Mayapan temples By the way all Sir Lionel s baggage disappeared from the landing stage including his Tibetan notes Significant Of course But he argues that he has crossed Tibet from the Kuen Lun to the Himalayas without being assassinated and therefore that it is unlikely he will meet with that fate in London I left him dictating the book from memory at the rate of about two hundred words a minute He is wasting no time Wasting time In addition to the Yucatan book and the work on Tibet he has to read a paper at the Institute next week about some tomb he has unearthed in Egypt As I came away a van drove up from the docks and a couple of fellows delivered a sarcophagus as big as a boat It is unique according to Sir Lionel and will go to the British Museum after he has examined it The man crams six months work into six weeks then he is off again What do you propose to do What CAN I do I know that Fu Manchu will make an attempt upon him I cannot doubt it Ugh that house gave me the shudders No sunlight I ll swear Petrie can ever penetrate to the rooms and when I arrived this afternoon clouds of gnats floated like motes wherever a stray beam filtered through the trees of the avenue There s a steamy smell about the place that is almost malarious and the whole of the west front is covered with a sort of monkey creeper which he has imported at some time or other It has a close exotic perfume that is quite in the picture I tell you the place was made for murder Have you taken any precautions I called at Scotland Yard and sent a man down to watch the house but He shrugged his shoulders helplessly What is Sir Lionel like A madman Petrie A tall massive man wearing a dirty dressing gown of neutral color a man with untidy gray hair and a bristling mustache keen blue eyes and a brown skin who wears a short beard or rarely shaves I don t know which I left him striding about among the thousand and one curiosities of that incredible room picking his way through his antique furniture works of reference manuscripts mummies spears pottery and what not sometimes kicking a book from his course or stumbling over a stuffed crocodile or a Mexican mask alternately dictating and conversing Phew For some time we were silent Smith I said we are making no headway in this business With all the forces arrayed against him Fu Manchu still eludes us still pursues his devilish inscrutable way Nayland Smith nodded And we don t know all he said We mark such and such a man as one alive to the Yellow Peril and we warn him if we have time Perhaps he escapes perhaps he does not But what do we know Petrie of those others who may die every week by his murderous agency We cannot know EVERYONE who has read the riddle of China I never see a report of someone found drowned of an apparent suicide of a sudden though seemingly natural death without wondering I tell you Fu Manchu is omnipresent his tentacles embrace everything I said that Sir Lionel must bear a charmed life The fact that WE are alive is a miracle He glanced at his watch Nearly eleven he said But sleep seems a waste of time apart from its dangers We heard a bell ring A few moments later followed a knock at the room door Come in I cried A girl entered with a telegram addressed to Smith His jaw looked very square in the lamplight and his eyes shone like steel as he took it from her and opened the envelope He glanced at the form stood up and passed it to me reaching for his hat which lay upon my writing table God help us Petrie he said This was the message Sir Lionel Barton murdered Meet me at his house at once WEYMOUTH INSPECTOR CHAPTER XI ALTHOUGH we avoided all unnecessary delay it was close upon midnight when our cab swung round into a darkly shadowed avenue at the farther end of which as seen through a tunnel the moonlight glittered upon the windows of Rowan House Sir Lionel Barton s home Stepping out before the porch of the long squat building I saw that it was banked in as Smith had said by trees and shrubs The facade showed mantled in the strange exotic creeper which he had mentioned and the air was pungent with an odor of decaying vegetation with which mingled the heavy perfume of the little nocturnal red flowers which bloomed luxuriantly upon the creeper The place looked a veritable wilderness and when we were admitted to the hall by Inspector Weymouth I saw that the interior was in keeping with the exterior for the hall was constructed from the model of some apartment in an Assyrian temple and the squat columns the low seats the hangings all were eloquent of neglect being thickly dust coated The musty smell too was almost as pronounced here as outside beneath the trees To a library whose contents overflowed in many literary torrents upon the floor the detective conducted us Good heavens I cried what s that Something leaped from the top of the bookcase ambled silently across the littered carpet and passed from the library like a golden streak I stood looking after it with startled eyes Inspector Weymouth laughed dryly It s a young puma or a civet cat or something Doctor he said This house is full of surprises and mysteries His voice was not quite steady I thought and he carefully closed the door ere proceeding further Where is he asked Nayland Smith harshly How was it done Weymouth sat down and lighted a cigar which I offered him I thought you would like to hear what led up to it so far as we know before seeing him Smith nodded Well continued the Inspector the man you arranged to send down from the Yard got here all right and took up a post in the road outside where he could command a good view of the gates He saw and heard nothing until going on for half past ten when a young lady turned up and went in A young lady Miss Edmonds Sir Lionel s shorthand typist She had found after getting home that her bag with her purse in was missing and she came back to see if she had left it here She gave the alarm My man heard the row from the road and came in Then he ran out and rang us up I immediately wired for you He heard the row you say What row Miss Edmonds went into violent hysterics Smith was pacing the room now in tense excitement Describe what he saw when he came in He saw a negro footman there isn t an Englishman in the house trying to pacify the girl out in the hall yonder and a Malay and another colored man beating their foreheads and howling There was no sense to be got out of any of them so he started to investigate for himself He had taken the bearings of the place earlier in the evening and from the light in a window on the ground floor had located the study so he set out to look for the door When he found it it was locked from the inside Well He went out and round to the window There s no blind and from the shrubbery you can see into the lumber room known as the study He looked in as apparently Miss Edmonds had done before him What he saw accounted for her hysterics Both Smith and I were hanging upon his words All amongst the rubbish on the floor a big Egyptian mummy case was lying on its side and face downwards with his arms thrown across it lay Sir Lionel Barton My God Yes Go on There was only a shaded reading lamp alight and it stood on a chair shining right down on him it made a patch of light on the floor you understand The Inspector indicated its extent with his hands Well as the man smashed the glass and got the window open and was just climbing in he saw something else so he says He paused What did he see demanded Smith shortly A sort of GREEN MIST sir He says it seemed to be alive It moved over the floor about a foot from the ground going away from him and towards a curtain at the other end of the study Nayland Smith fixed his eyes upon the speaker Where did he first see this green mist He says mister Smith that he thinks it came from the mummy case Yes go on It is to his credit that he climbed into the room after seeing a thing like that He did He turned the body over and Sir Lionel looked horrible He was quite dead Then Croxted that s the man s name went over to this curtain There was a glass door shut He opened it and it gave on a conservatory a place stacked from the tiled floor to the glass roof with more rubbish It was dark inside but enough light came from the study it s really a drawing room by the way as he d turned all the lamps on to give him another glimpse of this green crawling mist There are three steps to go down On the steps lay a dead Chinaman A dead Chinaman A dead CHINAMAN Doctor seen them rapped Smith Yes a local man He was out of his depth I could see Contradicted himself three times But there s no need for another opinion until we get the coroner s And Croxted Croxted was taken ill mister Smith and had to be sent home in a cab What ails him Detective Inspector Weymouth raised his eyebrows and carefully knocked the ash from his cigar He held out until I came gave me the story and then fainted right away He said that something in the conservatory seemed to get him by the throat Did he mean that literally I couldn t say We had to send the girl home too of course Nayland Smith was pulling thoughtfully at the lobe of his left ear Got any theory he jerked Weymouth shrugged his shoulders Not one that includes the green mist he said Shall we go in now We crossed the Assyrian hall where the members of that strange household were gathered in a panic stricken group They numbered four Two of them were negroes and two Easterns of some kind I missed the Chinaman Kwee of whom Smith had spoken and the Italian secretary and from the way in which my friend peered about the shadows of the hall I divined that he too wondered at their absence We entered Sir Lionel s study an apartment which I despair of describing Nayland Smith s words an earthquake at Sotheby s auction rooms leaped to my mind at once for the place was simply stacked with curious litter loot of Africa Mexico and Persia In a clearing by the hearth a gas stove stood upon a packing case and about it lay a number of utensils for camp cookery The odor of rotting vegetation mingled with the insistent perfume of the strange night blooming flowers was borne in through the open window In the center of the floor beside an overturned sarcophagus lay a figure in a neutral colored dressing gown face downwards and arms thrust forward and over the side of the ancient Egyptian mummy case My friend advanced and knelt beside the dead man Good God Smith sprang upright and turned with an extraordinary expression to Inspector Weymouth You do not know Sir Lionel Barton by sight he rapped No began Weymouth but This is not Sir Lionel This is Strozza the secretary What shouted Weymouth Where is the other the Chinaman quick cried Smith I have had him left where he was found on the conservatory steps said the Inspector Smith ran across the room to where beyond the open door a glimpse might be obtained of stacked up curiosities Holding back the curtain to allow more light to penetrate he bent forward over a crumpled up figure which lay upon the steps below It is he cried aloud It is Sir Lionel s servant Kwee Weymouth and I looked at one another across the body of the Italian then our eyes turned together to where my friend grim faced stood over the dead Chinaman A breeze whispered through the leaves a great wave of exotic perfume swept from the open window towards the curtained doorway It was a breath of the East that stretched out a yellow hand to the West It was symbolic of the subtle intangible power manifested in doctor Fu Manchu as Nayland Smith lean agile bronzed with the suns of Burma was symbolic of the clean British efficiency which sought to combat the insidious enemy One thing is evident said Smith no one in the house Strozza excepted knew that Sir Lionel was absent How do you arrive at that asked Weymouth The servants in the hall are bewailing him as dead If they had seen him go out they would know that it must be someone else who lies here What about the Chinaman Since there is no other means of entrance to the conservatory save through the study Kwee must have hidden himself there at some time when his master was absent from the room Croxted found the communicating door closed What killed the Chinaman Both Miss Edmonds and Croxted found the study door locked from the inside What killed Strozza retorted Smith You will have noted continued the Inspector that the secretary is wearing Sir Lionel s dressing gown It was seeing him in that as she looked in at the window which led Miss Edmonds to mistake him for her employer and consequently to put us on the wrong scent He wore it in order that anybody looking in at the window would be sure to make that mistake rapped Smith Why I asked Because he came here for a felonious purpose See Smith stooped and took up several tools from the litter on the floor There lies the lid He came to open the sarcophagus It contained the mummy of some notable person who flourished under Meneptah II and Sir Lionel told me that a number of valuable ornaments and jewels probably were secreted amongst the wrappings He proposed to open the thing and to submit the entire contents to examination to night He evidently changed his mind fortunately for himself I ran my fingers through my hair in perplexity Then what has become of the mummy Nayland Smith laughed dryly It has vanished in the form of a green vapor apparently he said Look at Strozza s face He turned the body over and used as I was to such spectacles the contorted features of the Italian filled me with horror so suggestive were they of a death more than ordinarily violent I pulled aside the dressing gown and searched the body for marks but failed to find any Nayland Smith crossed the room and assisted by the detective carried Kwee the Chinaman into the study and laid him fully in the light His puckered yellow face presented a sight even more awful than the other and his blue lips were drawn back exposing both upper and lower teeth There were no marks of violence but his limbs like Strozza s had been tortured during his mortal struggles into unnatural postures The breeze was growing higher and pungent odor waves from the damp shrubbery bearing too the oppressive sweetness of the creeping plant swept constantly through the open window Inspector Weymouth carefully relighted his cigar I m with you this far mister Smith he said Strozza knowing Sir Lionel to be absent locked himself in here to rifle the mummy case for Croxted entering by way of the window found the key on the inside Strozza didn t know that the Chinaman was hidden in the conservatory And Kwee did not dare to show himself because he too was there for some mysterious reason of his own interrupted Smith Having got the lid off something somebody Suppose we say the mummy Weymouth laughed uneasily Well sir something that vanished from a locked room without opening the door or the window killed Strozza And something which having killed Strozza next killed the Chinaman apparently without troubling to open the door behind which he lay concealed Smith continued For once in a way Inspector doctor Fu Manchu has employed an ally which even his giant will was incapable entirely to subjugate What blind force what terrific agent of death had he confined in that sarcophagus You think this is the work of Fu Manchu I said If you are correct his power indeed is more than human Something in my voice I suppose brought Smith right about He surveyed me curiously Can you doubt it The presence of a concealed Chinaman surely is sufficient Kwee I feel assured was one of the murder group though probably he had only recently entered that mysterious service He is unarmed or I should feel disposed to think that his part was to assassinate Sir Lionel whilst unsuspecting the presence of a hidden enemy he was at work here Strozza s opening the sarcophagus clearly spoiled the scheme And led to the death Of a servant of Fu Manchu Yes I am at a loss to account for that Do you think that the sarcophagus entered into the scheme Smith My friend looked at me in evident perplexity You mean that its arrival at the time when a creature of the Doctor Kwee was concealed here may have been a coincidence I nodded and Smith bent over the sarcophagus curiously examining the garish paintings with which it was decorated inside and out It lay sideways upon the floor and seizing it by its edge he turned it over Heavy he muttered but Strozza must have capsized it as he fell He would not have laid it on its side to remove the lid Hallo He bent farther forward catching at a piece of twine and out of the mummy case pulled a rubber stopper or cork This was stuck in a hole level with the floor of the thing he said Ugh it has a disgusting smell I took it from his hands and was about to examine it when a loud voice sounded outside in the hall The door was thrown open and a big man who despite the warmth of the weather wore a fur lined overcoat rushed impetuously into the room Sir Lionel cried Smith eagerly I warned you And see you have had a very narrow escape Sir Lionel Barton glanced at what lay upon the floor then from Smith to myself and from me to Inspector Weymouth He dropped into one of the few chairs unstacked with books mister Smith he said with emotion what does this mean Tell me quickly In brief terms Smith detailed the happenings of the night or so much as he knew of them Sir Lionel Barton listened sitting quite still the while an unusual repose in a man of such evidently tremendous nervous activity He came for the jewels he said slowly when Smith was finished and his eyes turned to the body of the dead Italian I was wrong to submit him to the temptation God knows what Kwee was doing in hiding Perhaps he had come to murder me as you surmise mister Smith though I find it hard to believe But I don t think this is the handiwork of your Chinese doctor He fixed his gaze upon the sarcophagus Smith stared at him in surprise What do you mean Sir Lionel The famous traveler continued to look towards the sarcophagus with something in his blue eyes that might have been dread I received a wire from Professor Rembold to night he continued You were correct in supposing that no one but Strozza knew of my absence I dressed hurriedly and met the professor at the Traveler s He knew that I was to read a paper next week upon again he looked toward the mummy case the tomb of Mekara and he knew that the sarcophagus had been brought untouched to England He begged me not to open it Nayland Smith was studying the speaker s face What reason did he give for so extraordinary a request he asked Sir Lionel Barton hesitated One he replied at last which amused me at the time I must inform you that Mekara whose tomb my agent had discovered during my absence in Tibet and to enter which I broke my return journey to Alexandria was a high priest and first prophet of Amen under the Pharaoh of the Exodus in short one of the magicians who contested in magic arts with Moses I thought the discovery unique until Professor Rembold furnished me with some curious particulars respecting the death of M Page le Roi the French Egyptologist particulars new to me We listened in growing surprise scarcely knowing to what this tended M le Roi continued Barton discovered but kept secret the tomb of Amenti another of this particular brotherhood It appears that he opened the mummy case on the spot these priests were of royal line and are buried in the valley of Biban le Moluk His Fellah and Arab servants deserted him for some reason on seeing the mummy case and he was found dead apparently strangled beside it The matter was hushed up by the Egyptian Government Rembold could not explain why But he begged of me not to open the sarcophagus of Mekara A silence fell The strange facts regarding the sudden death of Page le Roi which I now heard for the first time had impressed me unpleasantly coming from a man of Sir Lionel Barton s experience and reputation How long had it lain in the docks jerked Smith For two days I believe I am not a superstitious man mister Smith but neither is Professor Rembold and now that I know the facts respecting Page le Roi I can find it in my heart to thank God that I did not see whatever came out of that sarcophagus Nayland Smith stared him hard in the face I am glad you did not Sir Lionel he said for whatever the priest Mekara has to do with the matter by means of his sarcophagus doctor Fu Manchu has made his first attempt upon your life He has failed but I hope you will accompany me from here to a hotel He will not fail twice CHAPTER XII IT was the night following that of the double tragedy at Rowan House Nayland Smith with Inspector Weymouth was engaged in some mysterious inquiry at the docks and I had remained at home to resume my strange chronicle And why should I not confess it my memories had frightened me I was arranging my notes respecting the case of Sir Lionel Barton They were hopelessly incomplete For instance I had jotted down the following queries one Did any true parallel exist between the death of M Page le Roi and the death of Kwee the Chinaman and of Strozza two What had become of the mummy of Mekara three How had the murderer escaped from a locked room four What was the purpose of the rubber stopper five Why was Kwee hiding in the conservatory six Was the green mist a mere subjective hallucination a figment of Croxted s imagination or had he actually seen it Until these questions were satisfactorily answered further progress was impossible Nayland Smith frankly admitted that he was out of his depth It looks on the face of it more like a case for the Psychical Research people than for a plain Civil Servant lately of Mandalay he had said only that morning Sir Lionel Barton really believes that supernatural agencies were brought into operation by the opening of the high priest s coffin For my part even if I believed the same I should still maintain that doctor Fu Manchu controlled those manifestations But reason it out for yourself and see if we arrive at any common center Don t work so much upon the datum of the green mist but keep to the FACTS which are established I commenced to knock out my pipe in the ash tray then paused pipe in hand The house was quite still for my landlady and all the small household were out Above the noise of the passing tramcar I thought I had heard the hall door open In the ensuing silence I sat and listened Not a sound Stay I slipped my hand into the table drawer took out my revolver and stood up There WAS a sound Someone or something was creeping upstairs in the dark Familiar with the ghastly media employed by the Chinaman I was seized with an impulse to leap to the door shut and lock it But the rustling sound proceeded now from immediately outside my partially opened door I had not the time to close it knowing somewhat of the horrors at the command of Fu Manchu I had not the courage to open it My heart leaping wildly and my eyes upon that bar of darkness with its gruesome potentialities I waited waited for whatever was to come Perhaps twelve seconds passed in silence Who s there I cried Answer or I fire Ah no came a soft voice thrillingly musical Put it down that pistol Quick I must speak to you The door was pushed open and there entered a slim figure wrapped in a hooded cloak My hand fell and I stood stricken to silence looking into the beautiful dark eyes of doctor Fu Manchu s messenger if her own statement could be credited slave On two occasions this girl whose association with the Doctor was one of the most profound mysteries of the case had risked I cannot say what unnameable punishment perhaps to save me from death in both cases from a terrible death For what was she come now Her lips slightly parted she stood holding her cloak about her and watching me with great passionate eyes How I began But she shook her head impatiently HE has a duplicate key of the house door was her amazing statement I have never betrayed a secret of my master before but you must arrange to replace the lock She came forward and rested her slim hands confidingly upon my shoulders I have come again to ask you to take me away from him she said simply And she lifted her face to me Her words struck a chord in my heart which sang with strange music with music so barbaric that frankly I blushed to find it harmony Have I said that she was beautiful It can convey no faint conception of her With her pure fair skin eyes like the velvet darkness of the East and red lips so tremulously near to mine she was the most seductively lovely creature I ever had looked upon In that electric moment my heart went out in sympathy to every man who had bartered honor country all for a woman s kiss I will see that you are placed under proper protection I said firmly but my voice was not quite my own It is quite absurd to talk of slavery here in England You are a free agent or you could not be here now doctor Fu Manchu cannot control your actions Ah she cried casting back her head scornfully and releasing a cloud of hair through whose softness gleamed a jeweled head dress No He cannot Do you know what it means to have been a slave Here in your free England do you know what it means the razzia the desert journey the whips of the drivers the house of the dealer the shame Bah How beautiful she was in her indignation Slavery is put down you imagine perhaps You do not believe that to day TO DAY twenty five English sovereigns will buy a Galla girl who is brown and whisper two hundred and fifty a Circassian who is white No there is no slavery So Then what am I She threw open her cloak and it is a literal fact that I rubbed my eyes half believing that I dreamed For beneath she was arrayed in gossamer silk which more than indicated the perfect lines of her slim shape wore a jeweled girdle and barbaric ornaments was a figure fit for the walled gardens of Stamboul a figure amazing incomprehensible in the prosaic setting of my rooms To night I had no time to make myself an English miss she said wrapping her cloak quickly about her You see me as I am Her garments exhaled a faint perfume and it reminded me of another meeting I had had with her I looked into the challenging eyes Your request is but a pretense I said Why do you keep the secrets of that man when they mean death to so many Death I have seen my own sister die of fever in the desert seen her thrown like carrion into a hole in the sand I have seen men flogged until they prayed for death as a boon I have known the lash myself Death What does it matter She shocked me inexpressibly Enveloped in her cloak again and with only her slight accent to betray her it was dreadful to hear such words from a girl who save for her singular type of beauty might have been a cultured European Prove then that you really wish to leave this man s service Tell me what killed Strozza and the Chinaman I said She shrugged her shoulders I do not know that But if you will carry me off she clutched me nervously so that I am helpless lock me up so that I cannot escape beat me if you like I will tell you all I do know While he is my master I will never betray him Tear me from him by force do you understand BY FORCE and my lips will be sealed no longer Ah but you do not understand with your proper authorities your police Police Ah I have said enough A clock across the common began to strike The girl started and laid her hands upon my shoulders again There were tears glittering among the curved black lashes You do not understand she whispered Oh will you never understand and release me from him I must go Already I have remained too long Listen Go out without delay Remain out at a hotel where you will but do not stay here And Nayland Smith What is he to me this Nayland Smith Ah why will you not unseal my lips You are in danger you hear me in danger Go away from here to night She dropped her hands and ran from the room In the open doorway she turned stamping her foot passionately You have hands and arms she cried and yet you let me go Be warned then fly from here She broke off with something that sounded like a sob I made no move to stay her this beautiful accomplice of the arch murderer Fu Manchu I heard her light footsteps pattering down the stairs I heard her open and close the door the door of which doctor Fu Manchu held the key Still I stood where she had parted from me and was so standing when a key grated in the lock and Nayland Smith came running up Did you see her I began But his face showed that he had not done so and rapidly I told him of my strange visitor of her words of her warning How can she have passed through London in that costume I cried in bewilderment Where can she have come from Smith shrugged his shoulders and began to stuff broad cut mixture into the familiar cracked briar She might have traveled in a car or in a cab he said and undoubtedly she came direct from the house of doctor Fu Manchu You should have detained her Petrie It is the third time we have had that woman in our power the third time we have let her go free Smith I replied I couldn t She came of her own free will to give me a warning She disarms me Because you can see she is in love with you he suggested and burst into one of his rare laughs when the angry flush rose to my cheek She is Petrie why pretend to be blind to it You don t know the Oriental mind as I do but I quite understand the girl s position She fears the English authorities but would submit to capture by you If you would only seize her by the hair drag her to some cellar hurl her down and stand over her with a whip she would tell you everything she knows and salve her strange Eastern conscience with the reflection that speech was forced from her I am not joking it is so I assure you And she would adore you for your savagery deeming you forceful and strong Smith I said be serious You know what her warning meant before I can guess what it means now he rapped Hallo Someone was furiously ringing the bell No one at home said my friend I will go I think I know what it is A few minutes later he returned carrying a large square package From Weymouth he explained by district messenger I left him behind at the docks and he arranged to forward any evidence which subsequently he found This will be fragments of the mummy What You think the mummy was abstracted Yes at the docks I am sure of it and somebody else was in the sarcophagus when it reached Rowan House A sarcophagus I find is practically airtight so that the use of the rubber stopper becomes evident ventilation How this person killed Strozza I have yet to learn Also how he escaped from a locked room And what about the green mist Nayland Smith spread his hands in a characteristic gesture The green mist Petrie can be explained in several ways Remember we have only one man s word that it existed It is at best a confusing datum to which we must not attach a factitious importance He threw the wrappings on the floor and tugged at a twine loop in the lid of the square box which now stood upon the table Suddenly the lid came away bringing with it a lead lining such as is usual in tea chests This lining was partially attached to one side of the box so that the action of removing the lid at once raised and tilted it Then happened a singular thing Out over the table billowed a sort of yellowish green cloud an oily vapor and an inspiration it was nothing less born of a memory and of some words of my beautiful visitor came to me RUN SMITH I screamed The door the door for your life Fu Manchu sent that box I threw my arms round him As he bent forward the moving vapor rose almost to his nostrils I dragged him back and all but pitched him out on to the landing We entered my bedroom and there as I turned on the light I saw that Smith s tanned face was unusually drawn and touched with pallor It is a poisonous gas I said hoarsely in many respects identical with chlorine but having unique properties which prove it to be something else God and Fu Manchu alone know what It is the fumes of chlorine that kill the men in the bleaching powder works We have been blind I particularly Don t you see There was no one in the sarcophagus Smith but there was enough of that fearful stuff to have suffocated a regiment Smith clenched his fists convulsively My God he said how can I hope to deal with the author of such a scheme I see the whole plan He did not reckon on the mummy case being overturned and Kwee s part was to remove the plug with the aid of the string after Sir Lionel had been suffocated The gas I take it is heavier than air Chlorine gas has a specific gravity of two point four hundred seventy I said two and a half times heavier than air You can pour it from jar to jar like a liquid if you are wearing a chemist s mask In these respects this stuff appears to be similar the points of difference would not interest you The sarcophagus would have emptied through the vent and the gas have dispersed with no clew remaining except the smell I did smell it Petrie on the stopper but of course was unfamiliar with it You may remember that you were prevented from doing so by the arrival of Sir Lionel The scent of those infernal flowers must partially have drowned it too Poor misguided Strozza inhaled the stuff capsized the case in his fall and all the gas Went pouring under the conservatory door and down the steps where Kwee was crouching Croxted s breaking the window created sufficient draught to disperse what little remained It will have settled on the floor now I will go and open both windows Nayland raised his haggard face He evidently made more than was necessary to dispatch Sir Lionel Barton he said and contemptuously you note the attitude Petrie contemptuously devoted the surplus to me His contempt is justified I am a child striving to cope with a mental giant It is by no wit of mine that doctor Fu Manchu scores a double failure CHAPTER XIII I WILL tell you now of a strange dream which I dreamed and of the stranger things to which I awakened Since out of a blank a void this vision burst in upon my mind I cannot do better than relate it without preamble It was thus I dreamed that I lay writhing on the floor in agony indescribable My veins were filled with liquid fire and but that stygian darkness was about me I told myself that I must have seen the smoke arising from my burning body This I thought was death Then a cooling shower descended upon me soaked through skin and tissue to the tortured arteries and quenched the fire within Panting but free from pain I lay exhausted Strength gradually returning to me I tried to rise but the carpet felt so singularly soft that it offered me no foothold I waded and plunged like a swimmer treading water and all about me rose impenetrable walls of darkness darkness all but palpable I wondered why I could not see the windows The horrible idea flashed to my mind that I was become blind Somehow I got upon my feet and stood swaying dizzily I became aware of a heavy perfume and knew it for some kind of incense Then a dim light was born at an immeasurable distance away It grew steadily in brilliance It spread like a bluish red stain like a liquid It lapped up the darkness and spread throughout the room But this was not my room Nor was it any room known to me It was an apartment of such size that its dimensions filled me with a kind of awe such as I never had known the awe of walled vastness Its immense extent produced a sensation of sound Its hugeness had a distinct NOTE Tapestries covered the four walls There was no door visible These tapestries were magnificently figured with golden dragons and as the serpentine bodies gleamed and shimmered in the increasing radiance each dragon I thought intertwined its glittering coils more closely with those of another The carpet was of such richness that I stood knee deep in its pile And this too was fashioned all over with golden dragons and they seemed to glide about amid the shadows of the design stealthily At the farther end of the hall for hall it was a huge table with dragons legs stood solitary amid the luxuriance of the carpet It bore scintillating globes and tubes that held living organisms and books of a size and in such bindings as I never had imagined with instruments of a type unknown to Western science a heterogeneous litter quite indescribable which overflowed on to the floor forming an amazing oasis in a dragon haunted desert of carpet A lamp hung above this table suspended by golden chains from the ceiling which was so lofty that following the chains upward my gaze lost itself in the purple shadows above In a chair piled high with dragon covered cushions a man sat behind this table The light from the swinging lamp fell fully upon one side of his face as he leaned forward amid the jumble of weird objects and left the other side in purplish shadow From a plain brass bowl upon the corner of the huge table smoke writhed aloft and at times partially obscured that dreadful face From the instant that my eyes were drawn to the table and to the man who sat there neither the incredible extent of the room nor the nightmare fashion of its mural decorations could reclaim my attention I had eyes only for him For it was doctor Fu Manchu Something of the delirium which had seemed to fill my veins with fire to people the walls with dragons and to plunge me knee deep in the carpet left me Those dreadful filmed green eyes acted somewhat like a cold douche I knew without removing my gaze from the still face that the walls no longer lived but were merely draped in exquisite Chinese dragon tapestry The rich carpet beneath my feet ceased to be as a jungle and became a normal carpet extraordinarily rich but merely a carpet But the sense of vastness nevertheless remained with the uncomfortable knowledge that the things upon the table and overflowing about it were all or nearly all of a fashion strange to me Then and almost instantaneously the comparative sanity which I had temporarily experienced began to slip from me again for the smoke faintly penciled through the air from the burning perfume on the table grew in volume thickened and wafted towards me in a cloud of gray horror It enveloped me clammily Dimly through its oily wreaths I saw the immobile yellow face of Fu Manchu And my stupefied brain acclaimed him a sorcerer against whom unwittingly we had pitted our poor human wits The green eyes showed filmy through the fog An intense pain shot through my lower limbs and catching my breath I looked down As I did so the points of the red slippers which I dreamed that I wore increased in length curled sinuously upward twined about my throat and choked the breath from my body Came an interval and then a dawning like consciousness but it was a false consciousness since it brought with it the idea that my head lay softly pillowed and that a woman s hand caressed my throbbing forehead Confusedly as though in the remote past I recalled a kiss and the recollection thrilled me strangely Dreamily content I lay and a voice stole to my ears They are killing him they are killing him Oh do you not understand In my dazed condition I thought that it was I who had died and that this musical girl voice was communicating to me the fact of my own dissolution But I was conscious of no interest in the matter For hours and hours I thought that soothing hand caressed me I never once raised my heavy lids until there came a resounding crash that seemed to set my very bones vibrating a metallic jangling crash as the fall of heavy chains I thought that then I half opened my eyes and that in the dimness I had a fleeting glimpse of a figure clad in gossamer silk with arms covered with barbaric bangles and slim ankles surrounded by gold bands The girl was gone even as I told myself that she was an houri and that I though a Christian had been consigned by some error to the paradise of Mohammed Then a complete blank My head throbbed madly my brain seemed to be clogged inert and though my first feeble movement was followed by the rattle of a chain some moments more elapsed ere I realized that the chain was fastened to a steel collar that the steel collar was clasped about my neck I moaned weakly Smith I muttered Where are you Smith On to my knees I struggled and the pain on the top of my skull grew all but insupportable It was coming back to me now how Nayland Smith and I had started for the hotel to warn Graham Guthrie how as we passed up the steps from the Embankment and into Essex Street we saw the big motor standing before the door of one of the offices I could recall coming up level with the car a modern limousine but my mind retained no impression of our having passed it only a vague memory of a rush of footsteps a blow Then my vision of the hall of dragons and now this real awakening to a worse reality Groping in the darkness my hands touched a body that lay close beside me My fingers sought and found the throat sought and found the steel collar about it Smith I groaned and I shook the still form Smith old man speak to me Smith Could he be dead Was this the end of his gallant fight with doctor Fu Manchu and the murder group If so what did the future hold for me what had I to face He stirred beneath my trembling hands Thank God I muttered and I cannot deny that my joy was tainted with selfishness For waking in that impenetrable darkness and yet obsessed with the dream I had dreamed I had known what fear meant at the realization that alone chained I must face the dreadful Chinese doctor in the flesh Smith began incoherent mutterings Sand bagged Look out Petrie He has us at last Oh Heavens He struggled on to his knees clutching at my hand All right old man I said We are both alive So let s be thankful A moment s silence a groan then Petrie I have dragged you into this God forgive me Dry up Smith I said slowly I m not a child There is no question of being dragged into the matter I m here and if I can be of any use I m glad I am here He grasped my hand There were two Chinese in European clothes lord how my head throbs in that office door They sand bagged us Petrie think of it in broad daylight within hail of the Strand We were rushed into the car and it was all over before His voice grew faint God they gave me an awful knock Why have we been spared Smith Do you think he is saving us for Don t Petrie If you had been in China if you had seen what I have seen Footsteps sounded on the flagged passage A blade of light crept across the floor towards us My brain was growing clearer The place had a damp earthen smell It was slimy some noisome cellar A door was thrown open and a man entered carrying a lantern Its light showed my surmise to be accurate showed the slime coated walls of a dungeon some fifteen feet square shone upon the long yellow robe of the man who stood watching us upon the malignant intellectual countenance It was doctor Fu Manchu At last they were face to face the head of the great Yellow Movement and the man who fought on behalf of the entire white race How can I paint the individual who now stood before us perhaps the greatest genius of modern times Of him it had been fitly said that he had a brow like Shakespeare and a face like Satan Something serpentine hypnotic was in his very presence Smith drew one sharp breath and was silent Together chained to the wall two mediaeval captives living mockeries of our boasted modern security we crouched before doctor Fu Manchu He came forward with an indescribable gait cat like yet awkward carrying his high shoulders almost hunched He placed the lantern in a niche in the wall never turning away the reptilian gaze of those eyes which must haunt my dreams forever They possessed a viridescence which hitherto I had supposed possible only in the eye of the cat and the film intermittently clouded their brightness but I can speak of them no more I had never supposed prior to meeting doctor Fu Manchu that so intense a force of malignancy could radiate from any human being He spoke His English was perfect though at times his words were oddly chosen his delivery alternately was guttural and sibilant mister Smith and doctor Petrie your interference with my plans has gone too far I have seriously turned my attention to you He displayed his teeth small and evenly separated but discolored in a way that was familiar to me I studied his eyes with a new professional interest which even the extremity of our danger could not wholly banish Their greenness seemed to be of the iris the pupil was oddly contracted a pin point Smith leaned his back against the wall with assumed indifference You have presumed continued Fu Manchu to meddle with a world change Poor spiders caught in the wheels of the inevitable You have linked my name with the futility of the Young China Movement the name of Fu Manchu mister Smith you are an incompetent meddler I despise you doctor Petrie you are a fool I am sorry for you He rested one bony hand on his hip narrowing the long eyes as he looked down on us The purposeful cruelty of the man was inherent it was entirely untheatrical Still Smith remained silent So I am determined to remove you from the scene of your blunders added Fu Manchu Opium will very shortly do the same for you I rapped at him savagely Without emotion he turned the narrowed eyes upon me That is a matter of opinion Doctor he said You may have lacked the opportunities which have been mine for studying that subject and in any event I shall not be privileged to enjoy your advice in the future You will not long outlive me I replied And our deaths will not profit you incidentally because Smith s foot touched mine Because inquired Fu Manchu softly Ah mister Smith is so prudent He is thinking that I have FILES He pronounced the word in a way that made me shudder mister Smith has seen a WIRE JACKET Have you ever seen a wire jacket As a surgeon its functions would interest you I stifled a cry that rose to my lips for with a shrill whistling sound a small shape came bounding into the dimly lit vault then shot upward A marmoset landed on the shoulder of doctor Fu Manchu and peered grotesquely into the dreadful yellow face The Doctor raised his bony hand and fondled the little creature crooning to it One of my pets mister Smith he said suddenly opening his eyes fully so that they blazed like green lamps I have others equally useful My scorpions have you met my scorpions No My pythons and hamadryads Then there are my fungi and my tiny allies the bacilli I have a collection in my laboratory quite unique Have you ever visited Molokai the leper island Doctor No But mister Nayland Smith will be familiar with the asylum at Rangoon And we must not forget my black spiders with their diamond eyes my spiders that sit in the dark and watch then leap He raised his lean hands so that the sleeve of the robe fell back to the elbow and the ape dropped chattering to the floor and ran from the cellar O God of Cathay he cried by what death shall these die these miserable ones who would bind thine Empire which is boundless Like some priest of Tezcat he stood his eyes upraised to the roof his lean body quivering a sight to shock the most unimpressionable mind He is mad I whispered to Smith God help us the man is a dangerous homicidal maniac Nayland Smith s tanned face was very drawn but he shook his head grimly Dangerous yes I agree he muttered his existence is a danger to the entire white race which now we are powerless to avert doctor Fu Manchu recovered himself took up the lantern and turning abruptly walked to the door with his awkward yet feline gait At the threshold be looked back You would have warned mister Graham Guthrie he said in a soft voice To night at half past twelve mister Graham Guthrie dies Smith sat silent and motionless his eyes fixed upon the speaker You were in Rangoon in nineteen oh eight continued doctor Fu Manchu you remember the Call From somewhere above us I could not determine the exact direction came a low wailing cry an uncanny thing of falling cadences which in that dismal vault with the sinister yellow robed figure at the door seemed to pour ice into my veins Its effect upon Smith was truly extraordinary His face showed grayly in the faint light and I heard him draw a hissing breath through clenched teeth It calls for you said Fu Manchu At half past twelve it calls for Graham Guthrie The door closed and darkness mantled us again Smith I said what was that The horrors about us were playing havoc with my nerves It was the Call of Siva replied Smith hoarsely What is it Who uttered it What does it mean I don t know what it is Petrie nor who utters it But it means death CHAPTER XIV THERE may be some who could have lain chained to that noisome cell and felt no fear no dread of what the blackness might hold I confess that I am not one of these I knew that Nayland Smith and I stood in the path of the most stupendous genius who in the world s history had devoted his intellect to crime I knew that the enormous wealth of the political group backing doctor Fu Manchu rendered him a menace to Europe and to America greater than that of the plague He was a scientist trained at a great university an explorer of nature s secrets who had gone farther into the unknown I suppose than any living man His mission was to remove all obstacles human obstacles from the path of that secret movement which was progressing in the Far East Smith and I were two such obstacles and of all the horrible devices at his command I wondered and my tortured brain refused to leave the subject by which of them were we doomed to be dispatched Even at that very moment some venomous centipede might be wriggling towards me over the slime of the stones some poisonous spider be preparing to drop from the roof Fu Manchu might have released a serpent in the cellar or the air be alive with microbes of a loathsome disease Smith I said scarcely recognizing my own voice I can t bear this suspense He intends to kill us that is certain but Don t worry came the reply he intends to learn our plans first You mean You heard him speak of his files and of his wire jacket Oh my God I groaned can this be England Smith laughed dryly and I heard him fumbling with the steel collar about his neck I have one great hope he said since you share my captivity but we must neglect no minor chance Try with your pocket knife if you can force the lock I am trying to break this one Truth to tell the idea had not entered my half dazed mind but I immediately acted upon my friend s suggestion setting to work with the small blade of my knife I was so engaged and having snapped one blade was about to open another when a sound arrested me It came from beneath my feet Smith I whispered listen The scraping and clicking which told of Smith s efforts ceased Motionless we sat in that humid darkness and listened Something was moving beneath the stones of the cellar I held my breath every nerve in my body was strung up A line of light showed a few feet from where we lay It widened became an oblong A trap was lifted and within a yard of me there rose a dimly seen head Horror I had expected and death or worse Instead I saw a lovely face crowned with a disordered mass of curling hair I saw a white arm upholding the stone slab a shapely arm clasped about the elbow by a broad gold bangle The girl climbed into the cellar and placed the lantern on the stone floor In the dim light she was unreal a figure from an opium vision with her clinging silk draperies and garish jewelry with her feet encased in little red slippers In short this was the houri of my vision materialized It was difficult to believe that we were in modern up to date England easy to dream that we were the captives of a caliph in a dungeon in old Bagdad My prayers are answered said Smith softly She has come to save YOU S sh warned the girl and her wonderful eyes opened widely fearfully A sound and he will kill us all She bent over me a key jarred in the lock which had broken my penknife and the collar was off As I rose to my feet the girl turned and released Smith She raised the lantern above the trap and signed to us to descend the wooden steps which its light revealed Your knife she whispered to me Leave it on the floor He will think you forced the locks Down Quickly Nayland Smith stepping gingerly disappeared into the darkness I rapidly followed Last of all came our mysterious friend a gold band about one of her ankles gleaming in the rays of the lantern which she carried We stood in a low arched passage Tie your handkerchiefs over your eyes and do exactly as I tell you she ordered Neither of us hesitated to obey her Blind folded I allowed her to lead me and Smith rested his hand upon my shoulder In that order we proceeded and came to stone steps which we ascended Keep to the wall on the left came a whisper There is danger on the right With my free hand I felt for and found the wall and we pressed forward The atmosphere of the place through which we were passing was steamy and loaded with an odor like that of exotic plant life But a faint animal scent crept to my nostrils too and there was a subdued stir about me infinitely suggestive mysterious Now my feet sank in a soft carpet and a curtain brushed my shoulder A gong sounded We stopped The din of distant drumming came to my ears Where in Heaven s name are we hissed Smith in my ear that is a tom tom S sh S sh The little hand grasping mine quivered nervously We were near a door or a window for a breath of perfume was wafted through the air and it reminded me of my other meetings with the beautiful woman who was now leading us from the house of Fu Manchu who with her own lips had told me that she was his slave Through the horrible phantasmagoria she flitted a seductive vision her piquant loveliness standing out richly in its black setting of murder and devilry Not once but a thousand times I had tried to reason out the nature of the tie which bound her to the sinister Doctor Silence fell Quick This way Down a thickly carpeted stair we went Our guide opened a door and led us along a passage Another door was opened and we were in the open air But the girl never tarried pulling me along a graveled path with a fresh breeze blowing in my face and along until unmistakably I stood upon the river bank Now planking creaked to our tread and looking downward beneath the handkerchief I saw the gleam of water beneath my feet Be careful I was warned and found myself stepping into a narrow boat a punt Nayland Smith followed and the girl pushed the punt off and poled out into the stream Don t speak she directed My brain was fevered I scarce knew if I dreamed and was waking or if the reality ended with my imprisonment in the clammy cellar and this silent escape blindfolded upon the river with a girl for our guide who might have stepped out of the pages of The Arabian Nights were fantasy the mockery of sleep Indeed I began seriously to doubt if this stream whereon we floated whose waters plashed and tinkled about us were the Thames the Tigris or the Styx The punt touched a bank You will hear a clock strike in a few minutes said the girl with her soft charming accent but I rely upon your honor not to remove the handkerchiefs until then You owe me this We do said Smith fervently I heard him scrambling to the bank and a moment later a soft hand was placed in mine and I too was guided on to terra firma Arrived on the bank I still held the girl s hand drawing her towards me You must not go back I whispered We will take care of you You must not return to that place Let me go she said When once I asked you to take me from him you spoke of police protection that was your answer police protection You would let them lock me up imprison me and make me betray him For what For what She wrenched herself free How little you understand me Never mind Perhaps one day you will know Until the clock strikes She was gone I heard the creak of the punt the drip of the water from the pole Fainter it grew and fainter What is her secret muttered Smith beside me Why does she cling to that monster The distant sound died away entirely A clock began to strike it struck the half hour In an instant my handkerchief was off and so was Smith s We stood upon a towing path Away to the left the moon shone upon the towers and battlements of an ancient fortress It was Windsor Castle Half past ten cried Smith Two hours to save Graham Guthrie We had exactly fourteen minutes in which to catch the last train to Waterloo and we caught it But I sank into a corner of the compartment in a state bordering upon collapse Neither of us I think could have managed another twenty yards With a lesser stake than a human life at issue I doubt if we should have attempted that dash to Windsor station Due at Waterloo at eleven fifty one panted Smith That gives us thirty nine minutes to get to the other side of the river and reach his hotel Where in Heaven s name is that house situated Did we come up or down stream I couldn t determine But at any rate it stands close to the riverside It should be merely a question of time to identify it I shall set Scotland Yard to work immediately but I am hoping for nothing Our escape will warn him I said no more for a time sitting wiping the perspiration from my forehead and watching my friend load his cracked briar with the broadcut Latakia mixture Smith I said at last what was that horrible wailing we heard and what did Fu Manchu mean when he referred to Rangoon I noticed how it affected you My friend nodded and lighted his pipe There was a ghastly business there in nineteen oh eight or early in nineteen oh nine he replied an utterly mysterious epidemic And this beastly wailing was associated with it In what way And what do you mean by an epidemic It began I believe at the Palace Mansions Hotel in the cantonments A young American whose name I cannot recall was staying there on business connected with some new iron buildings One night he went to his room locked the door and jumped out of the window into the courtyard Broke his neck of course Suicide Apparently But there were singular features in the case For instance his revolver lay beside him fully loaded In the courtyard In the courtyard Was it murder by any chance Smith shrugged his shoulders His door was found locked from the inside had to be broken in But the wailing business That began later or was only noticed later A French doctor named Lafitte died in exactly the same way At the same place At the same hotel but he occupied a different room Here is the extraordinary part of the affair a friend shared the room with him and actually saw him go Saw him leap from the window Yes The friend an Englishman was aroused by the uncanny wailing I was in Rangoon at the time so that I know more of the case of Lafitte than of that of the American I spoke to the man about it personally He was an electrical engineer Edward Martin and he told me that the cry seemed to come from above him It seemed to come from above when we heard it at Fu Manchu s house Martin sat up in bed it was a clear moonlight night the sort of moonlight you get in Burma Lafitte for some reason had just gone to the window His friend saw him look out The next moment with a dreadful scream he threw himself forward and crashed down into the courtyard What then Martin ran to the window and looked down Lafitte s scream had aroused the place of course But there was absolutely nothing to account for the occurrence There was no balcony no ledge by means of which anyone could reach the window But how did you come to recognize the cry I stopped at the Palace Mansions for some time and one night this uncanny howling aroused me I heard it quite distinctly and am never likely to forget it It was followed by a hoarse yell The man in the next room an orchid hunter had gone the same way as the others Did you change your quarters No Fortunately for the reputation of the hotel a first class establishment several similar cases occurred elsewhere both in Rangoon in Prome and in Moulmein A story got about the native quarter and was fostered by some mad fakir that the god Siva was reborn and that the cry was his call for victims a ghastly story which led to an outbreak of dacoity and gave the District Superintendent no end of trouble Was there anything unusual about the bodies They all developed marks after death as though they had been strangled The marks were said all to possess a peculiar form though it was not appreciable to my eye and this again was declared to be the five heads of Siva Were the deaths confined to Europeans Oh no Several Burmans and others died in the same way At first there was a theory that the victims had contracted leprosy and committed suicide as a result but the medical evidence disproved that The Call of Siva became a perfect nightmare throughout Burma Did you ever hear it again before this evening Yes I heard it on the Upper Irrawaddy one clear moonlight night and a Colassie a deck hand leaped from the top deck of the steamer aboard which I was traveling My God to think that the fiend Fu Manchu has brought That to England But brought what Smith I cried in perplexity What has he brought An evil spirit A mental disease What is it What CAN it be A new agent of death Petrie Something born in a plague spot of Burma the home of much that is unclean and much that is inexplicable Heaven grant that we be in time and are able to save Guthrie CHAPTER XV THE train was late and as our cab turned out of Waterloo Station and began to ascend to the bridge from a hundred steeples rang out the gongs of midnight the bell of saint Paul s raised above them all to vie with the deep voice of Big Ben I looked out from the cab window across the river to where towering above the Embankment that place of a thousand tragedies the light of some of London s greatest caravanserais formed a sort of minor constellation From the subdued blaze that showed the public supper rooms I looked up to the hundreds of starry points marking the private apartments of those giant inns I thought how each twinkling window denoted the presence of some bird of passage some wanderer temporarily abiding in our midst There floor piled upon floor above the chattering throngs were these less gregarious units each something of a mystery to his fellow guests each in his separate cell and each as remote from real human companionship as if that cell were fashioned not in the bricks of London but in the rocks of Hindustan In one of those rooms Graham Guthrie might at that moment be sleeping all unaware that he would awake to the Call of Siva to the summons of death As we neared the Strand Smith stopped the cab discharging the man outside Sotheby s auction rooms One of the doctor s watch dogs may be in the foyer he said thoughtfully and it might spoil everything if we were seen to go to Guthrie s rooms There must be a back entrance to the kitchens and so on There is I replied quickly I have seen the vans delivering there But have we time Yes Lead on We walked up the Strand and hurried westward Into that narrow court with its iron posts and descending steps upon which opens a well known wine cellar we turned Then going parallel with the Strand but on the Embankment level we ran round the back of the great hotel and came to double doors which were open An arc lamp illuminated the interior and a number of men were at work among the casks crates and packages stacked about the place We entered Hallo cried a man in a white overall where d you think you re going Smith grasped him by the arm I want to get to the public part of the hotel without being seen from the entrance hall he said Will you please lead the way Here began the other staring Don t waste time snapped my friend in that tone of authority which he knew so well how to assume It s a matter of life and death Lead the way I say Police sir asked the man civilly Yes said Smith hurry Off went our guide without further demur Skirting sculleries kitchens laundries and engine rooms he led us through those mysterious labyrinths which have no existence for the guest above but which contain the machinery that renders these modern khans the Aladdin s palaces they are On a second floor landing we met a man in a tweed suit to whom our cicerone presented us Glad I met you sir Two gentlemen from the police The man regarded us haughtily with a suspicious smile Who are you he asked You re not from Scotland Yard at any rate Smith pulled out a card and thrust it into the speaker s hand If you are the hotel detective he said take us without delay to mister Graham Guthrie A marked change took place in the other s demeanor on glancing at the card in his hand Excuse me sir he said deferentially but of course I didn t know who I was speaking to We all have instructions to give you every assistance Is mister Guthrie in his room He s been in his room for some time sir You will want to get there without being seen This way We can join the lift on the third floor Off we went again with our new guide In the lift Have you noticed anything suspicious about the place to night asked Smith I have was the startling reply That accounts for your finding me where you did My usual post is in the lobby But about eleven o clock when the theater people began to come in I had a hazy sort of impression that someone or something slipped past in the crowd something that had no business in the hotel We got out of the lift I don t quite follow you said Smith If you thought you saw something entering you must have formed a more or less definite impression regarding it That s the funny part of the business answered the man doggedly I didn t But as I stood at the top of the stairs I could have sworn that there was something crawling up behind a party two ladies and two gentlemen A dog for instance It didn t strike me as being a dog sir Anyway when the party passed me there was nothing there Mind you whatever it was it hadn t come in by the front I have made inquiries everywhere but without result He stopped abruptly No one hundred eighty nine mister Guthrie s door sir Smith knocked Hallo came a muffled voice what do you want Open the door Don t delay it is important He turned to the hotel detective Stay right there where you can watch the stairs and the lift he instructed and note everyone and everything that passes this door But whatever you see or hear do nothing without my orders The man moved off and the door was opened Smith whispered in my ear Some creature of doctor Fu Manchu is in the hotel mister Graham Guthrie British resident in North Bhutan was a big thick set man gray haired and florid with widely opened eyes of the true fighting blue a bristling mustache and prominent shaggy brows Nayland Smith introduced himself tersely proffering his card and an open letter Those are my credentials mister Guthrie he said so no doubt you will realize that the business which brings me and my friend doctor Petrie here at such an hour is of the first importance He switched off the light There is no time for ceremony he explained It is now twenty five minutes past twelve At half past an attempt will be made upon your life mister Smith said the other who arrayed in his pajamas was seated on the edge of the bed you alarm me very greatly I may mention that I was advised of your presence in England this morning Do you know anything respecting the person called Fu Manchu doctor Fu Manchu Only what I was told to day that he is the agent of an advanced political group It is opposed to his interests that you should return to Bhutan A more gullible agent would be preferable Therefore unless you implicitly obey my instructions you will never leave England Graham Guthrie breathed quickly I was growing more used to the gloom and I could dimly discern him his face turned towards Nayland Smith whilst with his hand he clutched the bed rail Such a visit as ours I think must have shaken the nerve of any man But mister Smith he said surely I am safe enough here The place is full of American visitors at present and I have had to be content with a room right at the top so that the only danger I apprehend is that of fire There is another danger replied Smith The fact that you are at the top of the building enhances that danger Do you recall anything of the mysterious epidemic which broke out in Rangoon in nineteen oh eight the deaths due to the Call of Siva I read of it in the Indian papers said Guthrie uneasily Suicides were they not No snapped Smith Murders There was a brief silence From what I recall of the cases said Guthrie that seems impossible In several instances the victims threw themselves from the windows of locked rooms and the windows were quite inaccessible Exactly replied Smith and in the dim light his revolver gleamed dully as he placed it on the small table beside the bed Except that your door is unlocked the conditions to night are identical Silence please I hear a clock striking It was Big Ben It struck the half hour leaving the stillness complete In that room high above the activity which yet prevailed below high above the supping crowds in the hotel high above the starving crowds on the Embankment a curious chill of isolation swept about me Again I realized how in the very heart of the great metropolis a man may be as far from aid as in the heart of a desert I was glad that I was not alone in that room marked with the death mark of Fu Manchu and I am certain that Graham Guthrie welcomed his unexpected company I may have mentioned the fact before but on this occasion it became so peculiarly evident to me that I am constrained to record it here I refer to the sense of impending danger which invariably preceded a visit from Fu Manchu Even had I not known that an attempt was to be made that night I should have realized it as strung to high tension I waited in the darkness Some invisible herald went ahead of the dreadful Chinaman proclaiming his coming to every nerve in one s body It was like a breath of astral incense announcing the presence of the priests of death A wail low but singularly penetrating falling in minor cadences to a new silence came from somewhere close at hand My God hissed Guthrie what was that The Call of Siva whispered Smith Don t stir for your life Guthrie was breathing hard I knew that we were three that the hotel detective was within hail that there was a telephone in the room that the traffic of the Embankment moved almost beneath us but I knew and am not ashamed to confess that King Fear had icy fingers about my heart It was awful that tense waiting for what Three taps sounded very distinctly upon the window Graham Guthrie started so as to shake the bed It s supernatural he muttered all that was Celtic in his blood recoiling from the omen Nothing human can reach that window S sh from Smith Don t stir The tapping was repeated Smith softly crossed the room My heart was beating painfully He threw open the window Further inaction was impossible I joined him and we looked out into the empty air Don t come too near Petrie he warned over his shoulder One on either side of the open window we stood and looked down at the moving Embankment lights at the glitter of the Thames at the silhouetted buildings on the farther bank with the Shot Tower starting above them all Three taps sounded on the panes above us In all my dealings with doctor Fu Manchu I had had to face nothing so uncanny as this What Burmese ghoul had he loosed Was it outside in the air Was it actually in the room Don t let me go Petrie whispered Smith suddenly Get a tight hold on me That was the last straw for I thought that some dreadful fascination was impelling my friend to hurl himself out Wildly I threw my arms about him and Guthrie leaped forward to help Smith leaned from the window and looked up One choking cry he gave smothered inarticulate and I found him slipping from my grip being drawn out of the window drawn to his death Hold him Guthrie I gasped hoarsely My God he s going Hold him My friend writhed in our grasp and I saw him stretch his arm upward The crack of his revolver came and he collapsed on to the floor carrying me with him But as I fell I heard a scream above Smith s revolver went hurtling through the air and hard upon it went a black shape flashing past the open window into the gulf of the night The light The light I cried Guthrie ran and turned on the light Nayland Smith his eyes starting from his head his face swollen lay plucking at a silken cord which showed tight about his throat It was a Thug screamed Guthrie Get the rope off He s choking My hands a twitch I seized the strangling cord A knife Quick I cried I have lost mine Guthrie ran to the dressing table and passed me an open penknife I somehow forced the blade between the rope and Smith s swollen neck and severed the deadly silken thing Smith made a choking noise and fell back swooning in my arms When later we stood looking down upon the mutilated thing which had been brought in from where it fell Smith showed me a mark on the brow close beside the wound where his bullet had entered The mark of Kali he said The man was a phansigar a religious strangler Since Fu Manchu has dacoits in his service I might have expected that he would have Thugs A group of these fiends would seem to have fled into Burma so that the mysterious epidemic in Rangoon was really an outbreak of thuggee on slightly improved lines I had suspected something of the kind but naturally I had not looked for Thugs near Rangoon My unexpected resistance led the strangler to bungle the rope You have seen how it was fastened about my throat That was unscientific The true method as practiced by the group operating in Burma was to throw the line about the victim s neck and jerk him from the window A man leaning from an open window is very nicely poised it requires only a slight jerk to pitch him forward No loop was used but a running line which as the victim fell remained in the hand of the murderer No clew Therefore we see at once what commended the system to Fu Manchu Graham Guthrie very pale stood looking down at the dead strangler I owe you my life mister Smith he said If you had come five minutes later He grasped Smith s hand You see Guthrie continued no one thought of looking for a Thug in Burma And no one thought of the ROOF These fellows are as active as monkeys and where an ordinary man would infallibly break his neck they are entirely at home I might have chosen my room especially for the business He slipped in late this evening said Smith The hotel detective saw him but these stranglers are as elusive as shadows otherwise despite their having changed the scene of their operations not one could have survived Didn t you mention a case of this kind on the Irrawaddy I asked Yes was the reply and I know of what you are thinking The steamers of the Irrawaddy flotilla have a corrugated iron roof over the top deck The Thug must have been lying up there as the Colassie passed on the deck below But Smith what is the motive of the Call I continued Partly religious he explained and partly to wake the victims You are perhaps going to ask me how doctor Fu Manchu has obtained power over such people as phansigars I can only reply that doctor Fu Manchu has secret knowledge of which so far we know absolutely nothing but despite all at last I begin to score You do I agreed but your victory took you near to death I owe my life to you Petrie he said Once to your strength of arm and once to Don t speak of her Smith I interrupted doctor Fu Manchu may have discovered the part she played In which event God help her CHAPTER XVI UPON the following day we were afoot again and shortly at handgrips with the enemy In retrospect that restless time offers a chaotic prospect with no peaceful spot amid its turmoils All that was reposeful in nature seemed to have become an irony and a mockery to us who knew how an evil demigod had his sacrificial altars amid our sweetest groves This idea ruled strongly in my mind upon that soft autumnal day The net is closing in said Nayland Smith Let us hope upon a big catch I replied with a laugh Beyond where the Thames tided slumberously seaward showed the roofs of Royal Windsor the castle towers showing through the autumn haze The peace of beautiful Thames side was about us This was one of the few tangible clews upon which thus far we had chanced but at last it seemed indeed that we were narrowing the resources of that enemy of the white race who was writing his name over England in characters of blood To capture doctor Fu Manchu we did not hope but at least there was every promise of destroying one of the enemy s strongholds We had circled upon the map a tract of country cut by the Thames with Windsor for its center Within that circle was the house from which miraculously we had escaped a house used by the most highly organized group in the history of criminology So much we knew Even if we found the house and this was likely enough to find it vacated by Fu Manchu and his mysterious servants we were prepared But it would be a base destroyed We were working upon a methodical plan and although our cooperators were invisible these numbered no fewer than twelve all of them experienced men Thus far we had drawn blank but the place for which Smith and I were making now came clearly into view an old mansion situated in extensive walled grounds Leaving the river behind us we turned sharply to the right along a lane flanked by a high wall On an open patch of ground as we passed I noted a gypsy caravan An old woman was seated on the steps her wrinkled face bent her chin resting in the palm of her hand I scarcely glanced at her but pressed on nor did I notice that my friend no longer was beside me I was all anxiety to come to some point from whence I might obtain a view of the house all anxiety to know if this was the abode of our mysterious enemy the place where he worked amid his weird company where he bred his deadly scorpions and his bacilli reared his poisonous fungi from whence he dispatched his murder ministers Above all perhaps I wondered if this would prove to be the hiding place of the beautiful slave girl who was such a potent factor in the Doctor s plans but a two edged sword which yet we hoped to turn upon Fu Manchu Even in the hands of a master a woman s beauty is a dangerous weapon A cry rang out behind me I turned quickly And a singular sight met my gaze Nayland Smith was engaged in a furious struggle with the old gypsy woman His long arms clasped about her he was roughly dragging her out into the roadway she fighting like a wild thing silently fiercely Smith often surprised me but at that sight frankly I thought that he was become bereft of reason I ran back and I had almost reached the scene of this incredible contest and Smith now was evidently hard put to it to hold his own when a man swarthy with big rings in his ears leaped from the caravan One quick glance he threw in our direction and made off towards the river Smith twisted round upon me never releasing his hold of the woman After him Petrie he cried After him Don t let him escape It s a dacoit My brain in a confused whirl my mind yet disposed to a belief that my friend had lost his senses the word dacoit was sufficient I started down the road after the fleetly running man Never once did he glance behind him so that he evidently had occasion to fear pursuit The dusty road rang beneath my flying footsteps That sense of fantasy which claimed me often enough in those days of our struggle with the titanic genius whose victory meant the victory of the yellow races over the white now had me fast in its grip again I was an actor in one of those dream scenes of the grim Fu Manchu drama Out over the grass and down to the river s brink ran the gypsy who was no gypsy but one of that far more sinister brotherhood the dacoits I was close upon his heels But I was not prepared for him to leap in among the rushes at the margin of the stream and seeing him do this I pulled up quickly Straight into the water he plunged and I saw that he held some object in his hand He waded out he dived and as I gained the bank and looked to right and left he had vanished completely Only ever widening rings showed where he had been I had him For directly he rose to the surface he would be visible from either bank and with the police whistle which I carried I could if necessary summon one of the men in hiding across the stream I waited A wild fowl floated serenely past untroubled by this strange invasion of his precincts A full minute I waited From the lane behind me came Smith s voice Don t let him escape Petrie Never lifting my eyes from the water I waved my hand reassuringly But still the dacoit did not rise I searched the surface in all directions as far as my eyes could reach but no swimmer showed above it Then it was that I concluded he had dived too deeply become entangled in the weeds and was drowned With a final glance to right and left and some feeling of awe at this sudden tragedy this grim going out of a life at glorious noonday I turned away Smith had the woman securely but I had not taken five steps towards him when a faint splash behind warned me Instinctively I ducked From whence that saving instinct arose I cannot surmise but to it I owed my life For as I rapidly lowered my head something hummed past me something that flew out over the grass bank and fell with a jangle upon the dusty roadside A knife I turned and bounded back to the river s brink I heard a faint cry behind me which could only have come from the gypsy woman Nothing disturbed the calm surface of the water The reach was lonely of rowers Out by the farther bank a girl was poling a punt along and her white clad figure was the only living thing that moved upon the river within the range of the most expert knife thrower To say that I was nonplused is to say less than the truth I was amazed That it was the dacoit who had shown me this murderous attention I could not doubt But where in Heaven s name WAS he He could not humanly have remained below water for so long yet he certainly was not above was not upon the surface concealed amongst the reeds nor hidden upon the bank There in the bright sunshine a consciousness of the eerie possessed me It was with an uncomfortable feeling that my phantom foe might be aiming a second knife at my back that I turned away and hastened towards Smith My fearful expectations were not realized and I picked up the little weapon which had so narrowly missed me and with it in my hand rejoined my friend He was standing with one arm closely clasped about the apparently exhausted woman and her dark eyes were fixed upon him with an extraordinary expression What does it mean Smith I began But he interrupted me Where is the dacoit he demanded rapidly Since he seemingly possesses the attributes of a fish I replied I cannot pretend to say The gypsy woman lifted her eyes to mine and laughed Her laughter was musical not that of such an old hag as Smith held captive it was familiar too I started and looked closely into the wizened face He s tricked you said Smith an angry note in his voice What is that you have in your hand I showed him the knife and told him how it had come into my possession I know he rapped I saw it He was in the water not three yards from where you stood You must have seen him Was there nothing visible Nothing The woman laughed again and again I wondered A wild fowl I added nothing else A wild fowl snapped Smith If you will consult your recollections of the habits of wild fowl you will see that this particular specimen was a RARA AVIS It s an old trick Petrie but a good one for it is used in decoying A dacoit s head was concealed in that wild fowl It s useless He has certainly made good his escape by now Smith I said somewhat crestfallen why are you detaining this gypsy woman Gypsy woman he laughed hugging her tightly as she made an impatient movement Use your eyes old man He jerked the frowsy wig from her head and beneath was a cloud of disordered hair that shimmered in the sunlight A wet sponge will do the rest he said Into my eyes widely opened in wonder looked the dark eyes of the captive and beneath the disguise I picked out the charming features of the slave girl There were tears on the whitened lashes and she was submissive now This time said my friend hardly we have fairly captured her and we will hold her From somewhere up stream came a faint call The dacoit Nayland Smith s lean body straightened he stood alert strung up Another call answered and a third responded Then followed the flatly shrill note of a police whistle and I noted a column of black vapor rising beyond the wall mounting straight to heaven as the smoke of a welcome offering The surrounded mansion was in flames Curse it rapped Smith So this time we were right But of course he has had ample opportunity to remove his effects I knew that The man s daring is incredible He has given himself till the very last moment and we blundered upon two of the outposts I lost one No matter We have the other I expect no further arrests and the house will have been so well fired by the Doctor s servants that nothing can save it I fear its ashes will afford us no clew Petrie but we have secured a lever which should serve to disturb Fu Manchu s world He glanced at the queer figure which hung submissively in his arms She looked up proudly You need not hold me so tight she said in her soft voice I will come with you That I moved amid singular happenings you who have borne with me thus far have learned and that I witnessed many curious scenes but of the many such scenes in that race drama wherein Nayland Smith and doctor Fu Manchu played the leading parts I remember none more bizarre than the one at my rooms that afternoon Without delay and without taking the Scotland Yard men into our confidence we had hurried our prisoner back to London for my friend s authority was supreme A strange trio we were and one which excited no little comment but the journey came to an end at last Now we were in my unpretentious sitting room the room wherein Smith first had unfolded to me the story of doctor Fu Manchu and of the great secret society which sought to upset the balance of the world to place Europe and America beneath the scepter of Cathay I sat with my elbows upon the writing table my chin in my hands Smith restlessly paced the floor relighting his blackened briar a dozen times in as many minutes In the big arm chair the pseudogypsy was curled up A brief toilet had converted the wizened old woman s face into that of a fascinatingly pretty girl Wildly picturesque she looked in her ragged Romany garb She held a cigarette in her fingers and watched us through lowered lashes Seemingly with true Oriental fatalism she was quite reconciled to her fate and ever and anon she would bestow upon me a glance from her beautiful eyes which few men I say with confidence could have sustained unmoved Though I could not be blind to the emotions of that passionate Eastern soul yet I strove not to think of them Accomplice of an arch murderer she might be but she was dangerously lovely That man who was with you said Smith suddenly turning upon her was in Burma up till quite recently He murdered a fisherman thirty miles above Prome only a mouth before I left The D S P had placed a thousand rupees on his head Am I right The girl shrugged her shoulders Suppose What then she asked Suppose I handed you over to the police suggested Smith But he spoke without conviction for in the recent past we both had owed our lives to this girl As you please she replied The police would learn nothing You do not belong to the Far East my friend said abruptly You may have Eastern blood in your veins but you are no kin of Fu Manchu That is true she admitted and knocked the ash from her cigarette Will you tell me where to find Fu Manchu She shrugged her shoulders again glancing eloquently in my direction Smith walked to the door I must make out my report Petrie he said Look after the prisoner And as the door closed softly behind him I knew what was expected of me but honestly I shirked my responsibility What attitude should I adopt How should I go about my delicate task In a quandary I stood watching the girl whom singular circumstances saw captive in my rooms You do not think we would harm you I began awkwardly No harm shall come to you Why will you not trust us She raised her brilliant eyes Of what avail has your protection been to some of those others she said those others whom HE has sought for Alas it had been of none and I knew it well I thought I grasped the drift of her words You mean that if you speak Fu Manchu will find a way of killing you Of killing ME she flashed scornfully Do I seem one to fear for myself Then what do you fear I asked in surprise She looked at me oddly When I was seized and sold for a slave she answered slowly my sister was taken too and my brother a child She spoke the word with a tender intonation and her slight accent rendered it the more soft My sister died in the desert My brother lived Better far better that he had died too Her words impressed me intensely Of what are you speaking I questioned You speak of slave raids of the desert Where did these things take place Of what country are you Does it matter she questioned in turn Of what country am I A slave has no country no name No name I cried You may call me Karamaneh she said As Karamaneh I was sold to doctor Fu Manchu and my brother also he purchased We were cheap at the price he paid She laughed shortly wildly But he has spent a lot of money to educate me My brother is all that is left to me in the world to love and he is in the power of doctor Fu Manchu You understand It is upon him the blow will fall You ask me to fight against Fu Manchu You talk of protection Did your protection save Sir Crichton Davey I shook my head sadly You understand now why I cannot disobey my master s orders why if I would I dare not betray him I walked to the window and looked out How could I answer her arguments What could I say I heard the rustle of her ragged skirts and she who called herself Karamaneh stood beside me She laid her hand upon my arm Let me go she pleaded He will kill him He will kill him Her voice shook with emotion He cannot revenge himself upon your brother when you are in no way to blame I said angrily We arrested you you are not here of your own free will She drew her breath sharply clutching at my arm and in her eyes I could read that she was forcing her mind to some arduous decision Listen She was speaking rapidly nervously If I help you to take doctor Fu Manchu tell you where he is to be found ALONE will you promise me solemnly promise me that you will immediately go to the place where I shall guide you and release my brother that you will let us both go free I will I said without hesitation You may rest assured of it But there is a condition she added What is it When I have told you where to capture him you must release me I hesitated Smith often had accused me of weakness where this girl was concerned What now was my plain duty That she would utterly decline to speak under any circumstances unless it suited her to do so I felt assured If she spoke the truth in her proposed bargain there was no personal element her conduct I now viewed in a new light Humanity I thought dictated that I accept her proposal policy also I agree I said and looked into her eyes which were aflame now with emotion an excitement perhaps of anticipation perhaps of fear She laid her hands upon my shoulders You will be careful she said pleadingly For your sake I replied I shall Not for my sake Then for your brother s No Her voice had sunk to a whisper For your own CHAPTER XVII A COOL breeze met us blowing from the lower reaches of the Thames Far behind us twinkled the dim lights of Low s Cottages the last regular habitations abutting upon the marshes Between us and the cottages stretched half a mile of lush land through which at this season there were however numerous dry paths Before us the flats again a dull monotonous expanse beneath the moon with the promise of the cool breeze that the river flowed round the bend ahead It was very quiet Only the sound of our footsteps as Nayland Smith and I tramped steadily towards our goal broke the stillness of that lonely place Not once but many times within the last twenty minutes I had thought that we were ill advised to adventure alone upon the capture of the formidable Chinese doctor but we were following out our compact with Karamaneh and one of her stipulations had been that the police must not be acquainted with her share in the matter A light came into view far ahead of us That s the light Petrie said Smith If we keep that straight before us according to our information we shall strike the hulk I grasped the revolver in my pocket and the presence of the little weapon was curiously reassuring I have endeavored perhaps in extenuation of my own fears to explain how about doctor Fu Manchu there rested an atmosphere of horror peculiar unique He was not as other men The dread that he inspired in all with whom he came in contact the terrors which he controlled and hurled at whomsoever cumbered his path rendered him an object supremely sinister I despair of conveying to those who may read this account any but the coldest conception of the man s evil power Smith stopped suddenly and grasped my arm We stood listening What I asked You heard nothing I shook my head Smith was peering back over the marshes in his oddly alert way He turned to me and his tanned face wore a peculiar expression You don t think it s a trap he jerked We are trusting her blindly Strange it may seem but something within me rose in arms against the innuendo I don t I said shortly He nodded We pressed on Ten minutes steady tramping brought us within sight of the Thames Smith and I both had noticed how Fu Manchu s activities centered always about the London river Undoubtedly it was his highway his line of communication along which he moved his mysterious forces The opium den off Shadwell Highway the mansion upstream at that hour a smoldering shell now the hulk lying off the marshes Always he made his headquarters upon the river It was significant and even if to night s expedition should fail this was a clew for our future guidance Bear to the right directed Smith We must reconnoiter before making our attack We took a path that led directly to the river bank Before us lay the gray expanse of water and out upon it moved the busy shipping of the great mercantile city But this life of the river seemed widely removed from us The lonely spot where we stood had no kinship with human activity Its dreariness illuminated by the brilliant moon it looked indeed a fit setting for an act in such a drama as that wherein we played our parts When I had lain in the East End opium den when upon such another night as this I had looked out upon a peaceful Norfolk countryside the same knowledge of aloofness of utter detachment from the world of living men had come to me Silently Smith stared out at the distant moving lights Karamaneh merely means a slave he said irrelevantly I made no comment There s the hulk he added The bank upon which we stood dipped in mud slopes to the level of the running tide Seaward it rose higher and by a narrow inlet for we perceived that we were upon a kind of promontory a rough pier showed Beneath it was a shadowy shape in the patch of gloom which the moon threw far out upon the softly eddying water Only one dim light was visible amid this darkness That will be the cabin said Smith Acting upon our prearranged plan we turned and walked up on to the staging above the hulk A wooden ladder led out and down to the deck below and was loosely lashed to a ring on the pier With every motion of the tidal waters the ladder rose and fell its rings creaking harshly against the crazy railing How are we going to get down without being detected whispered Smith We ve got to risk it I said grimly Without further words my friend climbed around on to the ladder and commenced to descend I waited until his head disappeared below the level and clumsily enough prepared to follow him The hulk at that moment giving an unusually heavy heave I stumbled and for one breathless moment looked down upon the glittering surface streaking the darkness beneath me My foot had slipped and but that I had a firm grip upon the top rung that instant most probably had marked the end of my share in the fight with Fu Manchu As it was I had a narrow escape I felt something slip from my hip pocket but the weird creaking of the ladder the groans of the laboring hulk and the lapping of the waves about the staging drowned the sound of the splash as my revolver dropped into the river Rather white faced I think I joined Smith on the deck He had witnessed my accident but We must risk it he whispered in my ear We dare not turn back now He plunged into the semi darkness making for the cabin I perforce following At the bottom of the ladder we came fully into the light streaming out from the singular apartments at the entrance to which we found ourselves It was fitted up as a laboratory A glimpse I had of shelves loaded with jars and bottles of a table strewn with scientific paraphernalia with retorts with tubes of extraordinary shapes holding living organisms and with instruments some of them of a form unknown to my experience I saw too that books papers and rolls of parchment littered the bare wooden floor Then Smith s voice rose above the confused sounds about me incisive commanding I have you covered doctor Fu Manchu For Fu Manchu sat at the table The picture that he presented at that moment is one which persistently clings in my memory In his long yellow robe his masklike intellectual face bent forward amongst the riot of singular objects upon the table his great high brow gleaming in the light of the shaded lamp above him and with the abnormal eyes filmed and green raised to us he seemed a figure from the realms of delirium But most amazing circumstance of all he and his surroundings tallied almost identically with the dream picture which had come to me as I lay chained in the cell Some of the large jars about the place held anatomy specimens A faint smell of opium hung in the air and playing with the tassel of one of the cushions upon which as upon a divan Fu Manchu was seated leaped and chattered a little marmoset That was an electric moment I was prepared for anything for anything except for what really happened The doctor s wonderful evil face betrayed no hint of emotion The lids flickered over the filmed eyes and their greenness grew momentarily brighter and filmed over again Put up your hands rapped Smith and attempt no tricks His voice quivered with excitement The game s up Fu Manchu Find something to tie him up with Petrie I moved forward to Smith s side and was about to pass him in the narrow doorway The hulk moved beneath our feet like a living thing groaning creaking and the water lapped about the rotten woodwork with a sound infinitely dreary Put up your hands ordered Smith imperatively Fu Manchu slowly raised his hands and a smile dawned upon the impassive features a smile that had no mirth in it only menace revealing as it did his even discolored teeth but leaving the filmed eyes inanimate dull inhuman He spoke softly sibilantly I would advise doctor Petrie to glance behind him before he moves Smith s keen gray eyes never for a moment quitted the speaker The gleaming barrel moved not a hair s breadth But I glanced quickly over my shoulder and stifled a cry of pure horror A wicked pock marked face with wolfish fangs bared and jaundiced eyes squinting obliquely into mine was within two inches of me A lean brown hand and arm the great thews standing up like cords held a crescent shaped knife a fraction of an inch above my jugular vein A slight movement must have dispatched me a sweep of the fearful weapon I doubt not would have severed my head from my body Smith I whispered hoarsely don t look around For God s sake keep him covered But a dacoit has his knife at my throat Then for the first time Smith s hand trembled But his glance never wavered from the malignant emotionless countenance of doctor Fu Manchu He clenched his teeth hard so that the muscles stood out prominently upon his jaw I suppose that silence which followed my awful discovery prevailed but a few seconds To me those seconds were each a lingering death There below in that groaning hulk I knew more of icy terror than any of our meetings with the murder group had brought to me before and through my brain throbbed a thought the girl had betrayed us You supposed that I was alone suggested Fu Manchu So I was Yet no trace of fear had broken through the impassive yellow mask when we had entered But my faithful servant followed you he added I thank him The honors mister Smith are mine I think Smith made no reply I divined that he was thinking furiously Fu Manchu moved his hand to caress the marmoset which had leaped playfully upon his shoulder and crouched there gibing at us in a whistling voice Don t stir said Smith savagely I warn you Fu Manchu kept his hand raised May I ask you how you discovered my retreat he asked This hulk has been watched since dawn lied Smith brazenly So The Doctor s filmed eyes cleared for a moment And to day you compelled me to burn a house and you have captured one of my people too I congratulate you She would not betray me though lashed with scorpions The great gleaming knife was so near to my neck that a sheet of notepaper could scarcely have been slipped between blade and vein I think but my heart throbbed even more wildly when I heard those words An impasse said Fu Manchu I have a proposal to make I assume that you would not accept my word for anything I would not replied Smith promptly Therefore pursued the Chinaman and the occasional guttural alone marred his perfect English I must accept yours Of your resources outside this cabin I know nothing You I take it know as little of mine My Burmese friend and Doctor Petrie will lead the way then you and I will follow We will strike out across the marsh for say three hundred yards You will then place your pistol on the ground pledging me your word to leave it there I shall further require your assurance that you will make no attempt upon me until I have retraced my steps I and my good servant will withdraw leaving you at the expiration of the specified period to act as you see fit Is it agreed Smith hesitated Then The dacoit must leave his knife also he stipulated Fu Manchu smiled his evil smile again Agreed Shall I lead the way No rapped Smith Petrie and the dacoit first then you I last A guttural word of command from Fu Manchu and we left the cabin with its evil odors its mortuary specimens and its strange instruments and in the order arranged mounted to the deck It will be awkward on the ladder said Fu Manchu doctor Petrie I will accept your word to adhere to the terms I promise I said the words almost choking me We mounted the rising and dipping ladder all reached the pier and strode out across the flats the Chinaman always under close cover of Smith s revolver Round about our feet now leaping ahead now gamboling back came and went the marmoset The dacoit dressed solely in a dark loin cloth walked beside me carrying his huge knife and sometimes glancing at me with his blood lustful eyes Never before I venture to say had an autumn moon lighted such a scene in that place Here we part said Fu Manchu and spoke another word to his follower The man threw his knife upon the ground Search him Petrie directed Smith He may have a second concealed The Doctor consented and I passed my hands over the man s scanty garments Now search Fu Manchu This also I did And never have I experienced a similar sense of revulsion from any human being I shuddered as though I had touched a venomous reptile Smith threw down his revolver I curse myself for an honorable fool he said No one could dispute my right to shoot you dead where you stand Knowing him as I did I could tell from the suppressed passion in Smith s voice that only by his unhesitating acceptance of my friend s word and implicit faith in his keeping it had doctor Fu Manchu escaped just retribution at that moment Fiend though he was I admired his courage for all this he too must have known The Doctor turned and with the dacoit walked back Nayland Smith s next move filled me with surprise For just as silently I was thanking God for my escape my friend began shedding his coat collar and waistcoat Pocket your valuables and do the same he muttered hoarsely We have a poor chance but we are both fairly fit To night Petrie we literally have to run for our lives We live in a peaceful age wherein it falls to the lot of few men to owe their survival to their fleetness of foot At Smith s words I realized in a flash that such was to be our fate to night I have said that the hulk lay off a sort of promontory East and west then we had nothing to hope for To the south was Fu Manchu and even as stripped of our heavier garments we started to run northward the weird signal of a dacoit rose on the night and was answered was answered again Three at least hissed Smith three armed dacoits Hopeless Take the revolver I cried Smith it s No he rapped through clenched teeth A servant of the Crown in the East makes his motto Keep your word though it break your neck I don t think we need fear it being used against us Fu Manchu avoids noisy methods So back we ran over the course by which earlier we had come It was roughly a mile to the first building a deserted cottage and another quarter of a mile to any that was occupied Our chance of meeting a living soul other than Fu Manchu s dacoits was practically nil At first we ran easily for it was the second half mile that would decide our fate The professional murderers who pursued us ran like panthers I knew and I dare not allow my mind to dwell upon those yellow figures with the curved gleaming knives For a long time neither of us looked back On we ran and on silently doggedly Then a hissing breath from Smith warned me what to expect Should I too look back Yes It was impossible to resist the horrid fascination I threw a quick glance over my shoulder And never while I live shall I forget what I saw Two of the pursuing dacoits had outdistanced their fellow or fellows and were actually within three hundred yards of us More like dreadful animals they looked than human beings running bent forward with their faces curiously uptilted The brilliant moonlight gleamed upon bared teeth as I could see even at that distance even in that quick agonized glance and it gleamed upon the crescent shaped knives As hard as you can go now panted Smith We must make an attempt to break into the empty cottage Only chance I had never in my younger days been a notable runner for Smith I cannot speak But I am confident that the next half mile was done in time that would not have disgraced a crack man Not once again did either of us look back Yard upon yard we raced forward together My heart seemed to be bursting My leg muscles throbbed with pain At last with the empty cottage in sight it came to that pass with me when another three yards looks as unattainable as three miles Once I stumbled My God came from Smith weakly But I recovered myself Bare feet pattered close upon our heels and panting breaths told how even Fu Manchu s bloodhounds were hard put to it by the killing pace we had made Smith I whispered look in front Someone As through a red mist I had seen a dark shape detach itself from the shadows of the cottage and merge into them again It could only be another dacoit but Smith not heeding or not hearing my faintly whispered words crashed open the gate and hurled himself blindly at the door It burst open before him with a resounding boom and he pitched forward into the interior darkness Flat upon the floor he lay for as with a last effort I gained the threshold and dragged myself within I almost fell over his recumbent body Madly I snatched at the door His foot held it open I kicked the foot away and banged the door to As I turned the leading dacoit his eyes starting from their sockets his face the face of a demon leaped wildly through the gateway That Smith had burst the latch I felt assured but by some divine accident my weak hands found the bolt With the last ounce of strength spared to me I thrust it home in the rusty socket as a full six inches of shining steel split the middle panel and protruded above my head I dropped sprawling beside my friend A terrific blow shattered every pane of glass in the solitary window and one of the grinning animal faces looked in Sorry old man whispered Smith and his voice was barely audible Weakly he grasped my hand My fault I shouldn t have let you come From the corner of the room where the black shadows lay flicked a long tongue of flame Muffled staccato came the report And the yellow face at the window was blotted out One wild cry ending in a rattling gasp told of a dacoit gone to his account A gray figure glided past me and was silhouetted against the broken window Again the pistol sent its message into the night and again came the reply to tell how well and truly that message had been delivered In the stillness intense by sharp contrast the sound of bare soles pattering upon the path outside stole to me Two runners I thought there were so that four dacoits must have been upon our trail The room was full of pungent smoke I staggered to my feet as the gray figure with the revolver turned towards me Something familiar there was in that long gray garment and now I perceived why I had thought so It was my gray rain coat Karamaneh I whispered And Smith with difficulty supporting himself upright and holding fast to the ledge beside the door muttered something hoarsely which sounded like God bless her The girl trembling now placed her hands upon my shoulders with that quaint pathetic gesture peculiarly her own I followed you she said Did you not know I should follow you But I had to hide because of another who was following also I had but just reached this place when I saw you running towards me She broke off and turned to Smith This is your pistol she said naively I found it in your bag Will you please take it He took it without a word Perhaps he could not trust himself to speak Now go Hurry she said You are not safe yet But you I asked You have failed she replied I must go back to him There is no other way Strangely sick at heart for a man who has just had a miraculous escape from death I opened the door Coatless disheveled figures my friend and I stepped out into the moonlight Hideous under the pale rays lay the two dead men their glazed eyes upcast to the peace of the blue heavens Karamaneh had shot to kill for both had bullets in their brains If God ever planned a more complex nature than hers a nature more tumultuous with conflicting passions I cannot conceive of it Yet her beauty was of the sweetest and in some respects she had the heart of a child this girl who could shoot so straight We must send the police to night said Smith Or the papers Hurry came the girl s voice commandingly from the darkness of the cottage It was a singular situation My very soul rebelled against it But what could we do Tell us where we can communicate began Smith Hurry I shall be suspected Do you want him to kill me We moved away All was very still now and the lights glimmered faintly ahead Not a wisp of cloud brushed the moon s disk Good night Karamaneh I whispered softly CHAPTER XVIII TO pursue further the adventure on the marshes would be a task at once useless and thankless In its actual and in its dramatic significance it concluded with our parting from Karamaneh And in that parting I learned what Shakespeare meant by Sweet Sorrow There was a world I learned upon the confines of which I stood a world whose very existence hitherto had been unsuspected Not the least of the mysteries which peeped from the darkness was the mystery of the heart of Karamaneh I sought to forget her I sought to remember her Indeed in the latter task I found one more congenial yet in the direction and extent of the ideas which it engendered one that led me to a precipice East and West may not intermingle As a student of world policies as a physician I admitted could not deny that truth Again if Karamaneh were to be credited she had come to Fu Manchu a slave had fallen into the hands of the raiders had crossed the desert with the slave drivers had known the house of the slave dealer Could it be With the fading of the crescent of Islam I had thought such things to have passed But if it were so At the mere thought of a girl so deliciously beautiful in the brutal power of slavers I found myself grinding my teeth closing my eyes in a futile attempt to blot out the pictures called up Then at such times I would find myself discrediting her story Again I would find myself wondering vaguely why such problems persistently haunted my mind But always my heart had an answer And I was a medical man who sought to build up a family practice who in short a very little time ago had thought himself past the hot follies of youth and entered upon that staid phase of life wherein the daily problems of the medical profession hold absolute sway and such seductive follies as dark eyes and red lips find no place are excluded But it is foreign from the purpose of this plain record to enlist sympathy for the recorder The topic upon which here I have ventured to touch was one fascinating enough to me I cannot hope that it holds equal charm for any other Let us return to that which it is my duty to narrate and let us forget my brief digression It is a fact singular but true that few Londoners know London Under the guidance of my friend Nayland Smith I had learned since his return from Burma how there are haunts in the very heart of the metropolis whose existence is unsuspected by all but the few places unknown even to the ubiquitous copy hunting pressman Into a quiet thoroughfare not two minutes walk from the pulsing life of Leicester Square Smith led the way Before a door sandwiched in between two dingy shop fronts he paused and turned to me Whatever you see or hear he cautioned express no surprise A cab had dropped us at the corner We both wore dark suits and fez caps with black silk tassels My complexion had been artificially reduced to a shade resembling the deep tan of my friend s He rang the bell beside the door Almost immediately it was opened by a negro woman gross hideously ugly Smith uttered something in voluble Arabic As a linguist his attainments were a constant source of surprise The jargons of the East Far and Near he spoke as his mother tongue The woman immediately displayed the utmost servility ushering us into an ill lighted passage with every evidence of profound respect Following this passage and passing an inner door from beyond whence proceeded bursts of discordant music we entered a little room bare of furniture with coarse matting for mural decorations and a patternless red carpet on the floor In a niche burned a common metal lamp The negress left us and close upon her departure entered a very aged man with a long patriarchal beard who greeted my friend with dignified courtesy Following a brief conversation the aged Arab for such he appeared to be drew aside a strip of matting revealing a dark recess Placing his finger upon his lips he silently invited us to enter We did so and the mat was dropped behind us The sounds of crude music were now much plainer and as Smith slipped a little shutter aside I gave a start of surprise Beyond lay a fairly large apartment having divans or low seats around three of its walls These divans were occupied by a motley company of Turks Egyptians Greeks and others and I noted two Chinese Most of them smoked cigarettes and some were drinking A girl was performing a sinuous dance upon the square carpet occupying the center of the floor accompanied by a young negro woman upon a guitar and by several members of the assembly who clapped their hands to the music or hummed a low monotonous melody Shortly after our entrance into the passage the dance terminated and the dancer fled through a curtained door at the farther end of the room A buzz of conversation arose It is a sort of combined Wekaleh and place of entertainment for a certain class of Oriental residents in or visiting London Smith whispered The old gentleman who has just left us is the proprietor or host I have been here before on several occasions but have always drawn blank He was peering out eagerly into the strange clubroom Whom do you expect to find here I asked It is a recognized meeting place said Smith in my ear It is almost a certainty that some of the Fu Manchu group use it at times Curiously I surveyed all these faces which were visible from the spy hole My eyes rested particularly upon the two Chinamen Do you recognize anyone I whispered S sh Smith was craning his neck so as to command a sight of the doorway He obstructed my view and only by his tense attitude and some subtle wave of excitement which he communicated to me did I know that a new arrival was entering The hum of conversation died away and in the ensuing silence I heard the rustle of draperies The newcomer was a woman then Fearful of making any noise I yet managed to get my eyes to the level of the shutter A woman in an elegant flame colored opera cloak was crossing the floor and coming in the direction of the spot where we were concealed She wore a soft silk scarf about her head a fold partly draped across her face A momentary view I had of her and wildly incongruous she looked in that place and she had disappeared from sight having approached someone invisible who sat upon the divan immediately beneath our point of vantage From the way in which the company gazed towards her I divined that she was no habitue of the place but that her presence there was as greatly surprising to those in the room as it was to me Whom could she be this elegant lady who visited such a haunt who it would seem was so anxious to disguise her identity but who was dressed for a society function rather than for a midnight expedition of so unusual a character I began a whispered question but Smith tugged at my arm to silence me His excitement was intense Had his keener powers enabled him to recognize the unknown A faint but most peculiar perfume stole to my nostrils a perfume which seemed to contain the very soul of Eastern mystery Only one woman known to me used that perfume Karamaneh Then it was she At last my friend s vigilance had been rewarded Eagerly I bent forward Smith literally quivered in anticipation of a discovery Again the strange perfume was wafted to our hiding place and glancing neither to right nor left I saw Karamaneh for that it was she I no longer doubted recross the room and disappear The man she spoke to hissed Smith We must see him We must have him He pulled the mat aside and stepped out into the anteroom It was empty Down the passage he led and we were almost come to the door of the big room when it was thrown open and a man came rapidly out opened the street door before Smith could reach him and was gone slamming it fast I can swear that we were not four seconds behind him but when we gained the street it was empty Our quarry had disappeared as if by magic A big car was just turning the corner towards Leicester Square That is the girl rapped Smith but where in Heaven s name is the man to whom she brought the message I would give a hundred pounds to know what business is afoot To think that we have had such an opportunity and have thrown it away Angry and nonplused he stood at the corner looking in the direction of the crowded thoroughfare into which the car had been driven tugging at the lobe of his ear as was his habit in such moments of perplexity and sharply clicking his teeth together I too was very thoughtful Clews were few enough in those days of our war with that giant antagonist The mere thought that our trifling error of judgment tonight in tarrying a moment too long might mean the victory of Fu Manchu might mean the turning of the balance which a wise providence had adjusted between the white and yellow races was appalling To Smith and me who knew something of the secret influences at work to overthrow the Indian Empire to place it might be the whole of Europe and America beneath an Eastern rule it seemed that a great yellow hand was stretched out over London Doctor Fu Manchu was a menace to the civilized world Yet his very existence remained unsuspected by the millions whose fate he sought to command Into what dark scheme have we had a glimpse said Smith What State secret is to be filched What faithful servant of the British Raj to be spirited away Upon whom now has Fu Manchu set his death seal Karamaneh on this occasion may not have been acting as an emissary of the Doctor s I feel assured that she was Petrie Of the many whom this yellow cloud may at any moment envelop to which one did her message refer The man s instructions were urgent Witness his hasty departure Curse it He dashed his right clenched fist into the palm of his left hand I never had a glimpse of his face first to last To think of the hours I have spent in that place in anticipation of just such a meeting only to bungle the opportunity when it arose Scarce heeding what course we followed we had come now to Piccadilly Circus and had walked out into the heart of the night s traffic I just dragged Smith aside in time to save him from the off front wheel of a big Mercedes Then the traffic was blocked and we found ourselves dangerously penned in amidst the press of vehicles Somehow we extricated ourselves jeered at by taxi drivers who naturally took us for two simple Oriental visitors and just before that impassable barrier the arm of a London policeman was lowered and the stream moved on a faint breath of perfume became perceptible to me The cabs and cars about us were actually beginning to move again and there was nothing for it but a hasty retreat to the curb I could not pause to glance behind but instinctively I knew that someone someone who used that rare fragrant essence was leaning from the window of the car ANDAMAN SECOND floated a soft whisper We gained the pavement as the pent up traffic roared upon its way Smith had not noticed the perfume worn by the unseen occupant of the car had not detected the whispered words But I had no reason to doubt my senses and I knew beyond question that Fu Manchu s lovely slave Karamaneh had been within a yard of us had recognized us and had uttered those words for our guidance On regaining my rooms we devoted a whole hour to considering what ANDAMAN SECOND could possibly mean Hang it all cried Smith it might mean anything the result of a race for instance He burst into one of his rare laughs and began to stuff broadcut mixture into his briar I could see that he had no intention of turning in I can think of no one no one of note in London at present upon whom it is likely that Fu Manchu would make an attempt he said except ourselves We began methodically to go through the long list of names which we had compiled and to review our elaborate notes When at last I turned in the night had given place to a new day But sleep evaded me and ANDAMAN SECOND danced like a mocking phantom through my brain Then I heard the telephone bell I heard Smith speaking A minute afterwards he was in my room his face very grim I knew as well as if I d seen it with my own eyes that some black business was afoot last night he said And it was Within pistol shot of us Someone has got at Frank Norris West Inspector Weymouth has just been on the phone Norris West I cried the American aviator and inventor Of the West aero torpedo yes He s been offering it to the English War Office and they have delayed too long I got out of bed What do you mean I mean that the potentialities have attracted the attention of doctor Fu Manchu Those words operated electrically I do not know how long I was in dressing how long a time elapsed ere the cab for which Smith had phoned arrived how many precious minutes were lost upon the journey but in a nervous whirl these things slipped into the past like the telegraph poles seen from the window of an express and still in that tense state we came upon the scene of this newest outrage mister Norris West whose lean stoic face had latterly figured so often in the daily press lay upon the floor in the little entrance hall of his chambers flat upon his back with the telephone receiver in his hand The outer door had been forced by the police They had had to remove a piece of the paneling to get at the bolt A medical man was leaning over the recumbent figure in the striped pajama suit and Detective Inspector Weymouth stood watching him as Smith and I entered He has been heavily drugged said the Doctor sniffing at West s lips but I cannot say what drug has been used It isn t chloroform or anything of that nature He can safely be left to sleep it off I think I agreed after a brief examination It s most extraordinary said Weymouth He rang up the Yard about an hour ago and said his chambers had been invaded by Chinamen Then the man at the phone plainly heard him fall When we got here his front door was bolted as you ve seen and the windows are three floors up Nothing is disturbed The plans of the aero torpedo rapped Smith I take it they are in the safe in his bedroom replied the detective and that is locked all right I think he must have taken an overdose of something and had illusions But in case there was anything in what he mumbled you could hardly understand him I thought it as well to send for you Quite right said Smith rapidly His eyes shone like steel Lay him on the bed Inspector It was done and my friend walked into the bedroom Save that the bed was disordered showing that West had been sleeping in it there were no evidences of the extraordinary invasion mentioned by the drugged man It was a small room the chambers were of that kind which are let furnished and very neat A safe with a combination lock stood in a corner The window was open about a foot at the top Smith tried the safe and found it fast He stood for a moment clicking his teeth together by which I knew him to be perplexed He walked over to the window and threw it up We both looked out You see came Weymouth s voice it is altogether too far from the court below for our cunning Chinese friends to have fixed a ladder with one of their bamboo rod arrangements And even if they could get up there it s too far down from the roof two more stories for them to have fixed it from there Smith nodded thoughtfully at the same time trying the strength of an iron bar which ran from side to side of the window sill Suddenly he stooped with a sharp exclamation Bending over his shoulder I saw what it was that had attracted his attention Clearly imprinted upon the dust coated gray stone of the sill was a confused series of marks tracks call them what you will Smith straightened himself and turned a wondering look upon me What is it Petrie he said amazedly Some kind of bird has been here and recently Inspector Weymouth in turn examined the marks I never saw bird tracks like these mister Smith he muttered Smith was tugging at the lobe of his ear No he returned reflectively come to think of it neither did I He twisted around looking at the man on the bed Do you think it was all an illusion asked the detective What about those marks on the window sill jerked Smith He began restlessly pacing about the room sometimes stopping before the locked safe and frequently glancing at Norris West Suddenly he walked out and briefly examined the other apartments only to return again to the bedroom Petrie he said we are losing valuable time West must be aroused Inspector Weymouth stared Smith turned to me impatiently The doctor summoned by the police had gone Is there no means of arousing him Petrie he said Doubtless I replied he could be revived if one but knew what drug he had taken My friend began his restless pacing again and suddenly pounced upon a little phial of tabloids which had been hidden behind some books on a shelf near the bed He uttered a triumphant exclamation See what we have here Petrie he directed handing the phial to me It bears no label I crushed one of the tabloids in my palm and applied my tongue to the powder Some preparation of chloral hydrate I pronounced A sleeping draught suggested Smith eagerly We might try I said and scribbled a formula upon a leaf of my notebook I asked Weymouth to send the man who accompanied him to call up the nearest chemist and procure the antidote During the man s absence Smith stood contemplating the unconscious inventor a peculiar expression upon his bronzed face ANDAMAN SECOND he muttered Shall we find the key to the riddle here I wonder Inspector Weymouth who had concluded I think that the mysterious telephone call was due to mental aberration on the part of Norris West was gnawing at his mustache impatiently when his assistant returned I administered the powerful restorative and although as later transpired chloral was not responsible for West s condition the antidote operated successfully Norris West struggled into a sitting position and looked about him with haggard eyes The Chinamen The Chinamen he muttered He sprang to his feet glaring wildly at Smith and me reeled and almost fell It is all right I said supporting him I m a doctor You have been unwell Have the police come he burst out The safe try the safe It s all right said Inspector Weymouth The safe is locked unless someone else knows the combination there s nothing to worry about No one else knows it said West and staggered unsteadily to the safe Clearly his mind was in a dazed condition but setting his jaw with a curious expression of grim determination he collected his thoughts and opened the safe He bent down looking in In some way the knowledge came to me that the curtain was about to rise on a new and surprising act in the Fu Manchu drama God he whispered we could scarcely hear him the plans are gone CHAPTER XIX I HAVE never seen a man quite so surprised as Inspector Weymouth This is absolutely incredible he said There s only one door to your chambers We found it bolted from the inside Yes groaned West pressing his hand to his forehead I bolted it myself at eleven o clock when I came in No human being could climb up or down to your windows The plans of the aero torpedo were inside a safe I put them there myself said West on returning from the War Office and I had occasion to consult them after I had come in and bolted the door I returned them to the safe and locked it That it was still locked you saw for yourselves and no one else in the world knows the combination But the plans have gone said Weymouth It s magic How was it done What happened last night sir What did you mean when you rang us up Smith during this colloquy was pacing rapidly up and down the room He turned abruptly to the aviator Every fact you can remember mister West please he said tersely and be as brief as you possibly can I came in as I said explained West about eleven o clock and having made some notes relating to an interview arranged for this morning I locked the plans in the safe and turned in There was no one hidden anywhere in your chambers snapped Smith There was not replied West I looked I invariably do Almost immediately I went to sleep How many chloral tabloids did you take I interrupted Norris West turned to me with a slow smile You re cute Doctor he said I took two It s a bad habit but I can t sleep without They are specially made up for me by a firm in Philadelphia How long sleep lasted when it became filled with uncanny dreams and when those dreams merged into reality I do not know shall never know I suppose But out of the dreamless void a face came to me closer closer and peered into mine I was in that curious condition wherein one knows that one is dreaming and seeks to awaken to escape But a nightmare like oppression held me So I must lie and gaze into the seared yellow face that hung over me for it would drop so close that I could trace the cicatrized scar running from the left ear to the corner of the mouth and drawing up the lip like the lip of a snarling cur I could look into the malignant jaundiced eyes I could hear the dim whispering of the distorted mouth whispering that seemed to counsel something something evil That whispering intimacy was indescribably repulsive Then the wicked yellow face would be withdrawn and would recede until it became as a pin s head in the darkness far above me almost like a glutinous liquid thing Somehow I got upon my feet or dreamed I did God knows where dreaming ended and reality began Gentlemen maybe you ll conclude I went mad last night but as I stood holding on to the bedrail I heard the blood throbbing through my arteries with a noise like a screw propeller I started laughing The laughter issued from my lips with a shrill whistling sound that pierced me with physical pain and seemed to wake the echoes of the whole block I thought myself I was going mad and I tried to command my will to break the power of the chloral for I concluded that I had accidentally taken an overdose Then the walls of my bedroom started to recede till at last I stood holding on to a bed which had shrunk to the size of a doll s cot in the middle of a room like Trafalgar Square That window yonder was such a long way off I could scarcely see it but I could just detect a Chinaman the owner of the evil yellow face creeping through it He was followed by another who was enormously tall so tall that as they came towards me and it seemed to take them something like half an hour to cross this incredible apartment in my dream the second Chinaman seemed to tower over me like a cypress tree I looked up to his face his wicked hairless face mister Smith whatever age I live to I ll never forget that face I saw last night or did I see it God knows The pointed chin the great dome of a forehead and the eyes heavens above the huge green eyes He shook like a sick man and I glanced at Smith significantly Inspector Weymouth was stroking his mustache and his mingled expression of incredulity and curiosity was singular to behold The pumping of my blood continued West seemed to be bursting my body the room kept expanding and contracting One time the ceiling would be pressing down on my head and the Chinamen sometimes I thought there were two of them sometimes twenty became dwarfs the next instant it shot up like the roof of a cathedral Can I be awake I whispered or am I dreaming My whisper went sweeping in windy echoes about the walls and was lost in the shadowy distances up under the invisible roof You are dreaming yes It was the Chinaman with the green eyes who was addressing me and the words that he uttered appeared to occupy an immeasurable time in the utterance But at will I can render the subjective objective I don t think I can have dreamed those singular words gentlemen And then he fixed the green eyes upon me the blazing green eyes I made no attempt to move They seemed to be draining me of something vital bleeding me of every drop of mental power The whole nightmare room grew green and I felt that I was being absorbed into its greenness I can see what you think And even in my delirium if it was delirium I thought the same Now comes the climax of my experience my vision I don t know what to call it I SAW some WORDS issuing from my own mouth Inspector Weymouth coughed discreetly Smith whisked round upon him This will be outside your experience Inspector I know he said but mister Norris West s statement does not surprise me in the least I know to what the experience was due Weymouth stared incredulously but a dawning perception of the truth was come to me too How I SAW a SOUND I just won t attempt to explain I simply tell you I saw it Somehow I knew I had betrayed myself given something away You gave away the secret of the lock combination rapped Smith Eh grunted Weymouth But West went on hoarsely Just before the blank came a name flashed before my eyes It was Bayard Taylor At that I interrupted West I understand I cried I understand Another name has just occurred to me mister West that of the Frenchman Moreau You have solved the mystery said Smith It was natural mister West should have thought of the American traveler Bayard Taylor though Moreau s book is purely scientific He has probably never read it I fought with the stupor that was overcoming me continued West striving to associate that vaguely familiar name with the fantastic things through which I moved It seemed to me that the room was empty again I made for the hall for the telephone I could scarcely drag my feet along It seemed to take me half an hour to get there I remember calling up Scotland Yard and I remember no more There was a short tense interval In some respects I was nonplused but frankly I think Inspector Weymouth considered West insane Smith his hands locked behind his back stared out of the window ANDAMAN SECOND he said suddenly Weymouth when is the first train to Tilbury Five twenty two from Fenchurch Street replied the Scotland Yard man promptly Too late rapped my friend Jump in a taxi and pick up two good men to leave for China at once Then go and charter a special to Tilbury to leave in twenty five minutes Order another cab to wait outside for me Weymouth was palpably amazed but Smith s tone was imperative The Inspector departed hastily I stared at Smith not comprehending what prompted this singular course Now that you can think clearly mister West he said of what does your experience remind you The errors of perception regarding time the idea of SEEING A SOUND the illusion that the room alternately increased and diminished in size your fit of laughter and the recollection of the name Bayard Taylor Since evidently you are familiar with that author s work The Land of the Saracen is it not these symptoms of the attack should be familiar I think Norris West pressed his hands to his evidently aching head Bayard Taylor s book he said dully Yes I know of what my brain sought to remind me Taylor s account of his experience under hashish mister Smith someone doped me with hashish Smith nodded grimly Cannabis indica I said Indian hemp That is what you were drugged with I have no doubt that now you experience a feeling of nausea and intense thirst with aching in the muscles particularly the deltoid I think you must have taken at least fifteen grains Smith stopped his perambulations immediately in front of West looking into his dulled eyes Someone visited your chambers last night he said slowly and for your chloral tabloids substituted some containing hashish or perhaps not pure hashish Fu Manchu is a profound chemist Norris West started Someone substituted he began Exactly said Smith looking at him keenly someone who was here yesterday Have you any idea whom it could have been West hesitated I had a visitor in the afternoon he said seemingly speaking the words unwillingly but A lady jerked Smith I suggest that it was a lady West nodded You re quite right he admitted I don t know how you arrived at the conclusion but a lady whose acquaintance I made recently a foreign lady Karamaneh snapped Smith I don t know what you mean in the least but she came here knowing this to be my present address to ask me to protect her from a mysterious man who had followed her right from Charing Cross She said he was down in the lobby and naturally I asked her to wait here whilst I went and sent him about his business He laughed shortly I am over old he said to be guyed by a woman You spoke just now of someone called Fu Manchu Is that the crook I m indebted to for the loss of my plans I ve had attempts made by agents of two European governments but a Chinaman is a novelty This Chinaman Smith assured him is the greatest novelty of his age You recognize your symptoms now from Bayard Taylor s account mister West s statement I said ran closely parallel with portions of Moreau s book on Hashish Hallucinations Only Fu Manchu I think would have thought of employing Indian hemp I doubt though if it was pure Cannabis indica At any rate it acted as an opiate And drugged mister West interrupted Smith sufficiently to enable Fu Manchu to enter unobserved Whilst it produced symptoms which rendered him an easy subject for the Doctor s influence It is difficult in this case to separate hallucination from reality but I think mister West that Fu Manchu must have exercised an hypnotic influence upon your drugged brain We have evidence that he dragged from you the secret of the combination God knows we have said West But who is this Fu Manchu and how how in the name of wonder did he get into my chambers Smith pulled out his watch That he said rapidly I cannot delay to explain if I m to intercept the man who has the plans Come along Petrie we must be at Tilbury within the hour There is just a bare chance CHAPTER XX IT was with my mind in a condition of unique perplexity that I hurried with Nayland Smith into the cab which waited and dashed off through the streets in which the busy life of London just stirred into being I suppose I need not say that I could penetrate no farther into this Fu Manchu s latest plot than the drugging of Norris West with hashish Of his having been so drugged with Indian hemp that is converted temporarily into a maniac would have been evident to any medical man who had heard his statement and noted the distressing after effects which conclusively pointed to Indian hemp poisoning Knowing something of the Chinese doctor s powers I could understand that he might have extracted from West the secret of the combination by sheer force of will whilst the American was under the influence of the drug But I could not understand how Fu Manchu had gained access to locked chambers on the third story of a building Smith I said those bird tracks on the window sill they furnish the key to a mystery which is puzzling me They do said Smith glancing impatiently at his watch Consult your memories of doctor Fu Manchu s habits especially your memories of his pets I reviewed in my mind the creatures gruesome and terrible which surrounded the Chinaman the scorpions the bacteria the noxious things which were the weapons wherewith he visited death upon whomsoever opposed the establishment of a potential Yellow Empire But no one of them could account for the imprints upon the dust of West s window sill You puzzle me Smith I confessed There is much in this extraordinary case that puzzles me I can think of nothing to account for the marks Have you thought of Fu Manchu s marmoset asked Smith The monkey I cried They were the footprints of a small ape my friend continued For a moment I was deceived as you were and believed them to be the tracks of a large bird but I have seen the footprints of apes before now and a marmoset though an American variety I believe is not unlike some of the apes of Burma I am still in the dark I said It is pure hypothesis continued Smith but here is the theory in lieu of a better one it covers the facts The marmoset and it is contrary from the character of Fu Manchu to keep any creature for mere amusement is trained to perform certain duties You observed the waterspout running up beside the window you observed the iron bar intended to prevent a window cleaner from falling out For an ape the climb from the court below to the sill above was a simple one He carried a cord probably attached to his body He climbed on to the sill over the bar and climbed down again By means of this cord a rope was pulled up over the bar by means of the rope one of those ladders of silk and bamboo One of the Doctor s servants ascended probably to ascertain if the hashish had acted successfully That was the yellow dream face which West saw bending over him Then followed the Doctor and to his giant will the drugged brain of West was a pliant instrument which he bent to his own ends The court would be deserted at that hour of the night and in any event directly after the ascent the ladder probably was pulled up only to be lowered again when West had revealed the secret of his own safe and Fu Manchu had secured the plans The reclosing of the safe and the removing of the hashish tabloids leaving no clew beyond the delirious ravings of a drug slave for so anyone unacquainted with the East must have construed West s story is particularly characteristic His own tabloids were returned of course The sparing of his life alone is a refinement of art which points to a past master Karamaneh was the decoy again I said shortly Certainly Hers was the task to ascertain West s habits and to substitute the tabloids She it was who waited in the luxurious car infinitely less likely to attract attention at that hour in that place than a modest taxi and received the stolen plans She did her work well Poor Karamaneh she had no alternative I said I would have given a hundred pounds for a sight of the messenger s face the man to whom she handed them I would give a thousand now ANDAMAN SECOND I said What did she mean Then it has not dawned upon you cried Smith excitedly as the cab turned into the station The ANDAMAN of the Oriental Navigation Company s line leaves Tilbury with the next tide for China ports Our man is a second class passenger I am wiring to delay her departure and the special should get us to the docks inside of forty minutes Very vividly I can reconstruct in my mind that dash to the docks through the early autumn morning My friend being invested with extraordinary powers from the highest authorities by Inspector Weymouth s instructions the line had been cleared all the way Something of the tremendous importance of Nayland Smith s mission came home to me as we hurried on to the platform escorted by the station master and the five of us for Weymouth had two other C I D men with him took our seats in the special Off we went on top speed roaring through stations where a glimpse might be had of wondering officials upon the platforms for a special train was a novelty on the line All ordinary traffic arrangements were held up until we had passed through and we reached Tilbury in time which I doubt not constituted a record There at the docks was the great liner delayed in her passage to the Far East by the will of my royally empowered companion It was novel and infinitely exciting mister Commissioner Nayland Smith said the captain interrogatively when we were shown into his room and looked from one to another and back to the telegraph form which he held in his hand The same Captain said my friend briskly I shall not detain you a moment I am instructing the authorities at all ports east of Suez to apprehend one of your second class passengers should he leave the ship He is in possession of plans which practically belong to the British Government Why not arrest him now asked the seaman bluntly Because I don t know him All second class passengers baggage will be searched as they land I am hoping something from that if all else fails But I want you privately to instruct your stewards to watch any passenger of Oriental nationality and to cooperate with the two Scotland Yard men who are joining you for the voyage I look to you to recover these plans Captain I will do my best the captain assured him Then from amid the heterogeneous group on the dockside we were watching the liner depart and Nayland Smith s expression was a very singular one Inspector Weymouth stood with us a badly puzzled man Then occurred the extraordinary incident which to this day remains inexplicable for clearly heard by all three of us a guttural voice said Another victory for China mister Nayland Smith I turned as though I had been stung Smith turned also My eyes passed from face to face of the group about us None was familiar No one apparently had moved away But the voice was the voice of DOCTOR FU MANCHU As I write of it now I can appreciate the difference between that happening as it appealed to us and as it must appeal to you who merely read of it It is beyond my powers to convey the sense of the uncanny which the episode created Yet even as I think of it I feel again though in lesser degree the chill which seemed to creep through my veins that day From my brief history of the wonderful and evil man who once walked by the way unsuspected in the midst of the people of England near whom you personally may at some time unwittingly have been I am aware that much must be omitted I have no space for lengthy examinations of the many points but ill illuminated with which it is dotted This incident at the docks is but one such point Another is the singular vision which appeared to me whilst I lay in the cellar of the house near Windsor It has since struck me that it possessed peculiarities akin to those of a hashish hallucination Can it be that we were drugged on that occasion with Indian hemp Cannabis indica is a treacherous narcotic as every medical man knows full well but Fu Manchu s knowledge of the drug was far in advance of our slow science West s experience proved so much I may have neglected opportunities later you shall judge if I did so opportunities to glean for the West some of the strange knowledge of the secret East Perhaps at a future time I may rectify my errors Perhaps that wisdom the wisdom stored up by Fu Manchu is lost forever There is however at least a bare possibility of its survival in part and I do not wholly despair of one day publishing a scientific sequel to this record of our dealings with the Chinese doctor CHAPTER XXI TIME wore on and seemingly brought us no nearer or very little nearer to our goal So carefully had my friend Nayland Smith excluded the matter from the press that whilst public interest was much engaged with some of the events in the skein of mystery which he had come from Burma to unravel outside the Secret Service and the special department of Scotland Yard few people recognized that the several murders robberies and disappearances formed each a link in a chain fewer still were aware that a baneful presence was in our midst that a past master of the evil arts lay concealed somewhere in the metropolis searched for by the keenest wits which the authorities could direct to the task but eluding all triumphant contemptuous One link in that chain Smith himself for long failed to recognize Yet it was a big and important link Petrie he said to me one morning listen to this In sight of Shanghai a clear dark night On board the deck of a junk passing close to seaward of the Andaman a blue flare started up A minute later there was a cry of Man overboard mister Lewin the chief officer who was in charge stopped the engines A boat was put out But no one was recovered There are sharks in these waters A fairly heavy sea was running Inquiry showed the missing man to be a James Edwards second class booked to Shanghai I think the name was assumed The man was some sort of Oriental and we had had him under close observation That s the end of their report exclaimed Smith He referred to the two C I D men who had joined the Andaman at the moment of her departure from Tilbury He carefully lighted his pipe IS it a victory for China Petrie he said softly Until the great war reveals her secret resources and I pray that the day be not in my time we shall never know I replied Smith began striding up and down the room Whose name he jerked abruptly stands now at the head of our danger list He referred to a list which we had compiled of the notable men intervening between the evil genius who secretly had invaded London and the triumph of his cause the triumph of the yellow races I glanced at our notes Lord Southery I replied Smith tossed the morning paper across to me Look he said shortly He s dead I read the account of the peer s death and glanced at the long obituary notice but no more than glanced at it He had but recently returned from the East and now after a short illness had died from some affection of the heart There had been no intimation that his illness was of a serious nature and even Smith who watched over his flock the flock threatened by the wolf Fu Manchu with jealous zeal had not suspected that the end was so near Do you think he died a natural death Smith I asked My friend reached across the table and rested the tip of a long finger upon one of the sub headings to the account SIR FRANK NARCOMBE SUMMONED TOO LATE You see said Smith Southery died during the night but Sir Frank Narcombe arriving a few minutes later unhesitatingly pronounced death to be due to syncope and seems to have noticed nothing suspicious I looked at him thoughtfully Sir Frank is a great physician I said slowly but we must remember he would be looking for nothing suspicious We must remember rapped Smith that if doctor Fu Manchu is responsible for Southery s death except to the eye of an expert there would be nothing suspicious to see Fu Manchu leaves no clews Are you going around I asked Smith shrugged his shoulders I think not he replied Either a greater One than Fu Manchu has taken Lord Southery or the yellow doctor has done his work so well that no trace remains of his presence in the matter Leaving his breakfast untasted he wandered aimlessly about the room littering the hearth with matches as he constantly relighted his pipe which went out every few minutes It s no good Petrie he burst out suddenly it cannot be a coincidence We must go around and see him An hour later we stood in the silent room with its drawn blinds and its deathful atmosphere looking down at the pale intellectual face of Henry Stradwick Lord Southery the greatest engineer of his day The mind that lay behind that splendid brow had planned the construction of the railway for which Russia had paid so great a price had conceived the scheme for the canal which in the near future was to bring two great continents a full week s journey nearer one to the other But now it would plan no more He had latterly developed symptoms of angina pectoris explained the family physician but I had not anticipated a fatal termination so soon I was called about two o clock this morning and found Lord Southery in a dangerously exhausted condition I did all that was possible and Sir Frank Narcombe was sent for But shortly before his arrival the patient expired I understand Doctor that you had been treating Lord Southery for angina pectoris I said Yes was the reply for some months You regard the circumstances of his end as entirely consistent with a death from that cause Certainly Do you observe anything unusual yourself Sir Frank Narcombe quite agrees with me There is surely no room for doubt No said Smith tugging reflectively at the lobe of his left ear We do not question the accuracy of your diagnosis in any way sir The physician seemed puzzled But am I not right in supposing that you are connected with the police asked the physician Neither doctor Petrie nor myself are in any way connected with the police answered Smith But nevertheless I look to you to regard our recent questions as confidential As we were leaving the house hushed awesomely in deference to the unseen visitor who had touched Lord Southery with gray cold fingers Smith paused detaining a black coated man who passed us on the stairs You were Lord Southery s valet The man bowed Were you in the room at the moment of his fatal seizure I was sir Did you see or hear anything unusual anything unaccountable Nothing sir No strange sounds outside the house for instance The man shook his head and Smith taking my arm passed out into the street Perhaps this business is making me imaginative he said but there seems to be something tainting the air in yonder something peculiar to houses whose doors bear the invisible death mark of Fu Manchu You are right Smith I cried I hesitated to mention the matter but I too have developed some other sense which warns me of the Doctor s presence Although there is not a scrap of confirmatory evidence I am as sure that he has brought about Lord Southery s death as if I had seen him strike the blow It was in that torturing frame of mind chained helpless in our ignorance or by reason of the Chinaman s supernormal genius that we lived throughout the ensuing days My friend began to look like a man consumed by a burning fever Yet we could not act In the growing dark of an evening shortly following I stood idly turning over some of the works exposed for sale outside a second hand bookseller s in New Oxford Street One dealing with the secret societies of China struck me as being likely to prove instructive and I was about to call the shopman when I was startled to feel a hand clutch my arm I turned around rapidly and was looking into the darkly beautiful eyes of Karamaneh She whom I had seen in so many guises was dressed in a perfectly fitting walking habit and had much of her wonderful hair concealed beneath a fashionable hat She glanced about her apprehensively Quick Come round the corner I must speak to you she said her musical voice thrilling with excitement I never was quite master of myself in her presence He must have been a man of ice who could have been I think for her beauty had all the bouquet of rarity she was a mystery and mystery adds charm to a woman Probably she should have been under arrest but I know I would have risked much to save her from it As we turned into a quiet thoroughfare she stopped and said I am in distress You have often asked me to enable you to capture doctor Fu Manchu I am prepared to do so I could scarcely believe that I heard right Your brother I began She seized my arm entreatingly looking into my eyes You are a doctor she said I want you to come and see him now What Is he in London He is at the house of doctor Fu Manchu And you would have me Accompany me there yes Nayland Smith I doubted not would have counseled me against trusting my life in the hands of this girl with the pleading eyes Yet I did so and with little hesitation shortly we were traveling eastward in a closed cab Karamaneh was very silent but always when I turned to her I found her big eyes fixed upon me with an expression in which there was pleading in which there was sorrow in which there was something else something indefinable yet strangely disturbing The cabman she had directed to drive to the lower end of the Commercial Road the neighborhood of the new docks and the scene of one of our early adventures with doctor Fu Manchu The mantle of dusk had closed about the squalid activity of the East End streets as we neared our destination Aliens of every shade of color were about us now emerging from burrow like alleys into the glare of the lamps upon the main road In the short space of the drive we had passed from the bright world of the West into the dubious underworld of the East I do not know that Karamaneh moved but in sympathy as we neared the abode of the sinister Chinaman she crept nearer to me and when the cab was discharged and together we walked down a narrow turning leading riverward she clung to me fearfully hesitated and even seemed upon the point of turning back But overcoming her fear or repugnance she led on through a maze of alleyways and courts wherein I hopelessly lost my bearings so that it came home to me how wholly I was in the hands of this girl whose history was so full of shadows whose real character was so inscrutable whose beauty whose charm truly might mask the cunning of a serpent I spoke to her S SH She laid her hand upon my arm enjoining me to silence The high drab brick wall of what looked like some part of a dock building loomed above us in the darkness and the indescribable stenches of the lower Thames were borne to my nostrils through a gloomy tunnel like opening beyond which whispered the river The muffled clangor of waterside activity was about us I heard a key grate in a lock and Karamaneh drew me into the shadow of an open door entered and closed it behind her For the first time I perceived in contrast to the odors of the court without the fragrance of the peculiar perfume which now I had come to associate with her Absolute darkness was about us and by this perfume alone I knew that she was near to me until her hand touched mine and I was led along an uncarpeted passage and up an uncarpeted stair A second door was unlocked and I found myself in an exquisitely furnished room illuminated by the soft light of a shaded lamp which stood upon a low inlaid table amidst a perfect ocean of silken cushions strewn upon a Persian carpet whose yellow richness was lost in the shadows beyond the circle of light Karamaneh raised a curtain draped before a doorway and stood listening intently for a moment The silence was unbroken Then something stirred amid the wilderness of cushions and two tiny bright eyes looked up at me Peering closely I succeeded in distinguishing crouched in that soft luxuriance a little ape It was doctor Fu Manchu s marmoset This way whispered Karamaneh Never I thought was a staid medical man committed to a more unwise enterprise but so far I had gone and no consideration of prudence could now be of avail The corridor beyond was thickly carpeted Following the direction of a faint light which gleamed ahead it proved to extend as a balcony across one end of a spacious apartment Together we stood high up there in the shadows and looked down upon such a scene as I never could have imagined to exist within many a mile of that district The place below was even more richly appointed than the room into which first we had come Here as there piles of cushions formed splashes of gaudy color about the floor Three lamps hung by chains from the ceiling their light softened by rich silk shades One wall was almost entirely occupied by glass cases containing chemical apparatus tubes retorts and other less orthodox indications of doctor Fu Manchu s pursuits whilst close against another lay the most extraordinary object of a sufficiently extraordinary room a low couch upon which was extended the motionless form of a boy In the light of a lamp which hung directly above him his olive face showed an almost startling resemblance to that of Karamaneh save that the girl s coloring was more delicate He had black curly hair which stood out prominently against the white covering upon which he lay his hands crossed upon his breast Transfixed with astonishment I stood looking down upon him The wonders of the Arabian Nights were wonders no longer for here in East End London was a true magician s palace lacking not its beautiful slave lacking not its enchanted prince It is Aziz my brother said Karamaneh We passed down a stairway on to the floor of the apartment Karamaneh knelt and bent over the boy stroking his hair and whispering to him lovingly I too bent over him and I shall never forget the anxiety in the girl s eyes as she watched me eagerly whilst I made a brief examination Brief indeed for even ere I had touched him I knew that the comely shell held no spark of life But Karamaneh fondled the cold hands and spoke softly in that Arabic tongue which long before I had divined must be her native language Then as I remained silent she turned and looked at me read the truth in my eyes and rose from her knees stood rigidly upright and clutched me tremblingly He is not dead he is NOT dead she whispered and shook me as a child might seeking to arouse me to a proper understanding Oh tell me he is not I cannot I replied gently for indeed he is No she said wild eyed and raising her hands to her face as though half distraught You do not understand yet you are a doctor You do not understand She stopped moaning to herself and looking from the handsome face of the boy to me It was pitiful it was uncanny But sorrow for the girl predominated in my mind Then from somewhere I heard a sound which I had heard before in houses occupied by doctor Fu Manchu that of a muffled gong Quick Karamaneh had me by the arm Up He has returned She fled up the stairs to the balcony I close at her heels The shadows veiled us the thick carpet deadened the sound of our tread or certainly we must have been detected by the man who entered the room we had just quitted It was doctor Fu Manchu Yellow robed immobile the inhuman green eyes glittering catlike even it seemed before the light struck them he threaded his way through the archipelago of cushions and bent over the couch of Aziz Karamaneh dragged me down on to my knees Watch she whispered Watch doctor Fu Manchu felt for the pulse of the boy whom a moment since I had pronounced dead and stepping to the tall glass case took out a long necked flask of chased gold and from it into a graduated glass he poured some drops of an amber liquid wholly unfamiliar to me I watched him with all my eyes and noted how high the liquid rose in the measure He charged a needle syringe and bending again over Aziz made an injection Then all the wonders I had heard of this man became possible and with an awe which any other physician who had examined Aziz must have felt I admitted him a miracle worker For as I watched all but breathless the dead came to life The glow of health crept upon the olive cheek the boy moved he raised his hands above his head he sat up supported by the Chinese doctor Fu Manchu touched some hidden bell A hideous yellow man with a scarred face entered carrying a tray upon which were a bowl containing some steaming fluid apparently soup what looked like oaten cakes and a flask of red wine As the boy exhibiting no more unusual symptoms than if he had just awakened from a normal sleep commenced his repast Karamaneh drew me gently along the passage into the room which we had first entered My heart leaped wildly as the marmoset bounded past us to drop hand over hand to the lower apartment in search of its master You see said Karamaneh her voice quivering he is not dead But without Fu Manchu he is dead to me How can I leave him when he holds the life of Aziz in his hand You must get me that flask or some of its contents I directed But tell me how does he produce the appearance of death I cannot tell you she replied I do not know It is something in the wine In another hour Aziz will be again as you saw him But see And opening a little ebony box she produced a phial half filled with the amber liquid Good I said and slipped it into my pocket When will be the best time to seize Fu Manchu and to restore your brother I will let you know she whispered and opening the door pushed me hurriedly from the room He is going away to night to the north but you must not come to night Quick Quick Along the passage He may call me at any moment So with the phial in my pocket containing a potent preparation unknown to Western science and with a last long look into the eyes of Karamaneh I passed out into the narrow alley out from the fragrant perfumes of that mystery house into the place of Thames side stenches CHAPTER XXII WE must arrange for the house to be raided without delay said Smith This time we are sure of our ally But we must keep our promise to her I interrupted You can look after that Petrie my friend said I will devote the whole of my attention to doctor Fu Manchu he added grimly Up and down the room he paced gripping the blackened briar between his teeth so that the muscles stood out squarely upon his lean jaws The bronze which spoke of the Burmese sun enhanced the brightness of his gray eyes What have I all along maintained he jerked looking back at me across his shoulder that although Karamaneh was one of the strongest weapons in the Doctor s armory she was one which some day would be turned against him That day has dawned We must await word from her Quite so He knocked out his pipe on the grate Then Have you any idea of the nature of the fluid in the phial Not the slightest And I have none to spare for analytical purposes Nayland Smith began stuffing mixture into the hot pipe bowl and dropping an almost equal quantity on the floor I cannot rest Petrie he said I am itching to get to work Yet a false move and He lighted his pipe and stood staring from the window I shall of course take a needle syringe with me I explained Smith made no reply If I but knew the composition of the drug which produced the semblance of death I continued my fame would long survive my ashes My friend did not turn But She said it was something he put in the wine he jerked In the wine yes Silence fell My thoughts reverted to Karamaneh whom doctor Fu Manchu held in bonds stronger than any slave chains For with Aziz her brother suspended between life and death what could she do save obey the mandates of the cunning Chinaman What perverted genius was his If that treasury of obscure wisdom which he perhaps alone of living men had rifled could but be thrown open to the sick and suffering the name of doctor Fu Manchu would rank with the golden ones in the history of healing Nayland Smith suddenly turned and the expression upon his face amazed me Look up the next train to L he rapped To L What There s the Bradshaw We haven t a minute to waste In his voice was the imperative note I knew so well in his eyes was the light which told of an urgent need for action a portentous truth suddenly grasped One in half an hour the last We must catch it No further word of explanation he vouchsafed but darted off to dress for he had spent the afternoon pacing the room in his dressing gown and smoking without intermission Out and to the corner we hurried and leaped into the first taxi upon the rank Smith enjoined the man to hasten and we were off all in that whirl of feverish activity which characterized my friend s movements in times of important action He sat glancing impatiently from the window and twitching at the lobe of his ear I know you will forgive me old man he said but there is a little problem which I am trying to work out in my mind Did you bring the things I mentioned Yes Conversation lapsed until just as the cab turned into the station Smith said Should you consider Lord Southery to have been the first constructive engineer of his time Petrie Undoubtedly I replied Greater than Von Homber of Berlin Possibly not But Von Homber has been dead for three years Three years is it Roughly Ah We reached the station in time to secure a non corridor compartment to ourselves and to allow Smith leisure carefully to inspect the occupants of all the others from the engine to the guard s van He was muffled up to the eyes and he warned me to keep out of sight in the corner of the compartment In fact his behavior had me bursting with curiosity The train having started Don t imagine Petrie said Smith that I am trying to lead you blindfolded in order later to dazzle you with my perspicacity I am simply afraid that this may be a wild goose chase The idea upon which I am acting does not seem to have struck you I wish it had The fact would argue in favor of its being sound At present I am hopelessly mystified Well then I will not bias you towards my view But just study the situation and see if you can arrive at the reason for this sudden journey I shall be distinctly encouraged if you succeed But I did not succeed and since Smith obviously was unwilling to enlighten me I pressed him no more The train stopped at Rugby where he was engaged with the stationmaster in making some mysterious arrangements At L however their object became plain for a high power car was awaiting us and into this we hurried and ere the greater number of passengers had reached the platform were being driven off at headlong speed along the moon bathed roads Twenty minutes rapid traveling and a white mansion leaped into the line of sight standing out vividly against its woody backing Stradwick Hall said Smith The home of Lord Southery We are first but doctor Fu Manchu was on the train Then the truth dawned upon the gloom of my perplexity CHAPTER XXIII YOUR extraordinary proposal fills me with horror mister Smith The sleek little man in the dress suit who looked like a head waiter but was the trusted legal adviser of the house of Southery puffed at his cigar indignantly Nayland Smith whose restless pacing had led him to the far end of the library turned a remote but virile figure and looked back to where I stood by the open hearth with the solicitor I am in your hands mister Henderson he said and advanced upon the latter his gray eyes ablaze Save for the heir who is abroad on foreign service you say there is no kin of Lord Southery to consider The word rests with you If I am wrong and you agree to my proposal there is none whose susceptibilities will suffer My own sir If I am right and you prevent me from acting you become a murderer mister Henderson The lawyer started staring nervously up at Smith who now towered over him menacingly Lord Southery was a lonely man continued my friend If I could have placed my proposition before one of his blood I do not doubt what my answer had been Why do you hesitate Why do you experience this feeling of horror mister Henderson stared down into the fire His constitutionally ruddy face was pale It is entirely irregular mister Smith We have not the necessary powers Smith snapped his teeth together impatiently snatching his watch from his pocket and glancing at it I am vested with the necessary powers I will give you a written order sir The proceeding savors of paganism Such a course might be admissible in China in Burma Do you weigh a life against such quibbles Do you suppose that granting MY irresponsibility doctor Petrie would countenance such a thing if he doubted the necessity mister Henderson looked at me with pathetic hesitance There are guests in the house mourners who attended the ceremony to day They Will never know if we are in error interrupted Smith Good God why do you delay You wish it to be kept secret You and I mister Henderson and doctor Petrie will go now We require no other witnesses We are answerable only to our consciences The lawyer passed his hand across his damp brow I have never in my life been called upon to come to so momentous a decision in so short a time he confessed But aided by Smith s indomitable will he made his decision As its result we three looking and feeling like conspirators hurried across the park beneath a moon whose placidity was a rebuke to the turbulent passions which reared their strangle growth in the garden of England Not a breath of wind stirred amid the leaves The calm of perfect night soothed everything to slumber Yet if Smith were right and I did not doubt him the green eyes of doctor Fu Manchu had looked upon the scene and I found myself marveling that its beauty had not wilted up Even now the dread Chinaman must be near to us As mister Henderson unlocked the ancient iron gates he turned to Nayland Smith His face twitched oddly Witness that I do this unwillingly he said most unwillingly Mine be the responsibility was the reply Smith s voice quivered responsive to the nervous vitality pent up within that lean frame He stood motionless listening and I knew for whom he listened He peered about him to right and left and I knew whom he expected but dreaded to see Above us now the trees looked down with a solemnity different from the aspect of the monarchs of the park and the nearer we came to our journey s end the more somber and lowering bent the verdant arch or so it seemed By that path patched now with pools of moonlight Lord Southery had passed upon his bier with the sun to light his going by that path several generations of Stradwicks had gone to their last resting place To the doors of the vault the moon rays found free access No branch no leaf intervened mister Henderson s face looked ghastly The keys which he carried rattled in his hand Light the lantern he said unsteadily Nayland Smith who again had been peering suspiciously about into the shadows struck a match and lighted the lantern which he carried He turned to the solicitor Be calm mister Henderson he said sternly It is your plain duty to your client God be my witness that I doubt it replied Henderson and opened the door We descended the steps The air beneath was damp and chill It touched us as with clammy fingers and the sensation was not wholly physical Before the narrow mansion which now sufficed Lord Southery the great engineer whom kings had honored Henderson reeled and clutched at me for support Smith and I had looked to him for no aid in our uncanny task and rightly With averted eyes he stood over by the steps of the tomb whilst my friend and myself set to work In the pursuit of my profession I had undertaken labors as unpleasant but never amid an environment such as this It seemed that generations of Stradwicks listened to each turn of every screw At last it was done and the pallid face of Lord Southery questioned the intruding light Nayland Smith s hand was as steady as a rigid bar when he raised the lantern Later I knew there would be a sudden releasing of the tension of will a reaction physical and mental but not until his work was finished That my own hand was steady I ascribed to one thing solely professional zeal For under conditions which in the event of failure and exposure must have led to an unpleasant inquiry by the British Medical Association I was about to attempt an experiment never before essayed by a physician of the white races Though I failed though I succeeded that it ever came before the B M A or any other council was improbable in the former event all but impossible But the knowledge that I was about to practice charlatanry or what any one of my fellow practitioners must have designated as such was with me Yet so profound had my belief become in the extraordinary being whose existence was a danger to the world that I reveled in my immunity from official censure I was glad that it had fallen to my lot to take at least one step though blindly into the FUTURE of medical science So far as my skill bore me Lord Southery was dead Unhesitatingly I would have given a death certificate save for two considerations The first although his latest scheme ran contrary from the interests of doctor Fu Manchu his genius diverted into other channels would serve the yellow group better than his death The second I had seen the boy Aziz raised from a state as like death as this From the phial of amber hued liquid which I had with me I charged the needle syringe I made the injection and waited If he is really dead whispered Smith It seems incredible that he can have survived for three days without food Yet I have known a fakir to go for a week mister Henderson groaned Watch in hand I stood observing the gray face A second passed another a third In the fourth the miracle began Over the seemingly cold clay crept the hue of pulsing life It came in waves in waves which corresponded with the throbbing of the awakened heart which swept fuller and stronger which filled and quickened the chilled body As we rapidly freed the living man from the trappings of the dead one Southery uttering a stifled scream sat up looked about him with half glazed eyes and fell back My God cried Smith It is all right I said and had time to note how my voice had assumed a professional tone A little brandy from my flask is all that is necessary now You have two patients Doctor rapped my friend mister Henderson had fallen in a swoon to the floor of the vault Quiet whispered Smith HE is here He extinguished the light I supported Lord Southery What has happened he kept moaning Where am I Oh God what has happened I strove to reassure him in a whisper and placed my traveling coat about him The door at the top of the mausoleum steps we had reclosed but not relocked Now as I upheld the man whom literally we had rescued from the grave I heard the door reopen To aid Henderson I could make no move Smith was breathing hard beside me I dared not think what was about to happen nor what its effects might be upon Lord Southery in his exhausted condition Through the Memphian dark of the tomb cut a spear of light touching the last stone of the stairway A guttural voice spoke some words rapidly and I knew that doctor Fu Manchu stood at the head of the stairs Although I could not see my friend I became aware that Nayland Smith had his revolver in his hand and I reached into my pocket for mine At last the cunning Chinaman was about to fall into a trap It would require all his genius I thought to save him to night Unless his suspicions were aroused by the unlocked door his capture was imminent Someone was descending the steps In my right hand I held my revolver and with my left arm about Lord Southery I waited through ten such seconds of suspense as I have rarely known The spear of light plunged into the well of darkness again Lord Southery Smith and myself were hidden by the angle of the wall but full upon the purplish face of mister Henderson the beam shone In some way it penetrated to the murk in his mind and he awakened from his swoon with a hoarse cry struggled to his feet and stood looking up the stair in a sort of frozen horror Smith was past him at a bound Something flashed towards him as the light was extinguished I saw him duck and heard the knife ring upon the floor I managed to move sufficiently to see at the top as I fired up the stairs the yellow face of doctor Fu Manchu to see the gleaming chatoyant eyes greenly terrible as they sought to pierce the gloom A flying figure was racing up three steps at a time that of a brown man scantily clad He stumbled and fell by which I knew that he was hit but went on again Smith hard on his heels mister Henderson I cried relight the lantern and take charge of Lord Southery Here is my flask on the floor I rely upon you Smith s revolver spoke again as I went bounding up the stair Black against the square of moonlight I saw him stagger I saw him fall As he fell for the third time I heard the crack of his revolver Instantly I was at his side Somewhere along the black aisle beneath the trees receding footsteps pattered Are you hurt Smith I cried anxiously He got upon his feet He has a dacoit with him he replied and showed me the long curved knife which he held in his hand a full inch of the blade bloodstained A near thing for me Petrie I heard the whir of a restarted motor We have lost him said Smith But we have saved Lord Southery I said Fu Manchu will credit us with a skill as great as his own We must get to the car Smith muttered and try to overtake them Ugh my left arm is useless It would be mere waste of time to attempt to overtake them I argued for we have no idea in which direction they will proceed I have a very good idea snapped Smith Stradwick Hall is less than ten miles from the coast There is only one practicable means of conveying an unconscious man secretly from here to London You think he meant to take him from here to London Prior to shipping him to China I think so His clearing house is probably on the Thames A boat A yacht presumably is lying off the coast in readiness Fu Manchu may even have designed to ship him direct to China Lord Southery a bizarre figure my traveling coat wrapped about him and supported by his solicitor who was almost as pale as himself emerged from the vault into the moonlight This is a triumph for you Smith I said The throb of Fu Manchu s car died into faintness and was lost in the night s silence Only half a triumph he replied But we still have another chance the raid on his house When will the word come from Karamaneh Southery spoke in a weak voice Gentlemen he said it seems I am raised from the dead It was the weirdest moment of the night wherein we heard that newly buried man speak from the mold of his tomb Yes replied Smith slowly and spared from the fate of Heaven alone knows how many men of genius The yellow society lacks a Southery but that doctor Fu Manchu was in Germany three years ago I have reason to believe so that even without visiting the grave of your great Teutonic rival who suddenly died at about that time I venture to predict that they have a Von Homber And the futurist group in China knows how to MAKE men work CHAPTER XXIV FROM the rescue of Lord Southery my story bears me mercilessly on to other things I may not tarry as more leisurely penmen to round my incidents they were not of my choosing I may not pause to make you better acquainted with the figure of my drama its scheme is none of mine Often enough in those days I found a fitness in the lines of Omar We are no other than a moving show Of Magic Shadow shapes that come and go Round with the Sun illumined Lantern held In Midnight by the Master of the Show But the Master of the Show in this case was doctor Fu Manchu I have been asked many times since the days with which these records deal Who WAS doctor Fu Manchu Let me confess here that my final answer must be postponed I can only indicate at this place the trend of my reasoning and leave my reader to form whatever conclusion he pleases What group can we isolate and label as responsible for the overthrow of the Manchus The casual student of modern Chinese history will reply Young China This is unsatisfactory What do we mean by Young China In my own hearing Fu Manchu had disclaimed with scorn association with the whole of that movement and assuming that the name were not an assumed one he clearly can have been no anti Manchu no Republican The Chinese Republican is of the mandarin class but of a new generation which veneers its Confucianism with Western polish These youthful and unbalanced reformers in conjunction with older but no less ill balanced provincial politicians may be said to represent Young China Amid such turmoils as this we invariably look for and invariably find a Third Party In my opinion doctor Fu Manchu was one of the leaders of such a party Another question often put to me was Where did the Doctor hide during the time that he pursued his operations in London This is more susceptible of explanation For a time Nayland Smith supposed as I did myself that the opium den adjacent to the old Ratcliff Highway was the Chinaman s base of operations later we came to believe that the mansion near Windsor was his hiding place and later still the hulk lying off the downstream flats But I think I can state with confidence that the spot which he had chosen for his home was neither of these but the East End riverside building which I was the first to enter Of this I am all but sure for the reason that it not only was the home of Fu Manchu of Karamaneh and of her brother Aziz but the home of something else of something which I shall speak of later The dreadful tragedy or series of tragedies which attended the raid upon the place will always mark in my memory the supreme horror of a horrible case Let me endeavor to explain what occurred By the aid of Karamaneh you have seen how we had located the whilom warehouse which from the exterior was so drab and dreary but which within was a place of wondrous luxury At the moment selected by our beautiful accomplice Inspector Weymouth and a body of detectives entirely surrounded it a river police launch lay off the wharf which opened from it on the river side and this upon a singularly black night than which a better could not have been chosen You will fulfill your promise to me said Karamaneh and looked up into my face She was enveloped in a big loose cloak and from the shadow of the hood her wonderful eyes gleamed out like stars What do you wish us to do asked Nayland Smith You and doctor Petrie she replied swiftly must enter first and bring out Aziz Until he is safe until he is out of that place you are to make no attempt upon Upon doctor Fu Manchu interrupted Weymouth for Karamaneh hesitated to pronounce the dreaded name as she always did But how can we be sure that there is no trap laid for us The Scotland Yard man did not entirely share my confidence in the integrity of this Eastern girl whom he knew to have been a creature of the Chinaman s Aziz lies in the private room she explained eagerly her old accent more noticeable than usual There is only one of the Burmese men in the house and he he dare not enter without orders But Fu Manchu We have nothing to fear from him He will be your prisoner within ten minutes from now I have no time for words you must believe She stamped her foot impatiently And the dacoit snapped Smith He also I think perhaps I d better come in too said Weymouth slowly Karamaneh shrugged her shoulders with quick impatience and unlocked the door in the high brick wall which divided the gloomy evil smelling court from the luxurious apartments of doctor Fu Manchu Make no noise she warned And Smith and myself followed her along the uncarpeted passage beyond Inspector Weymouth with a final word of instruction to his second in command brought up the rear The door was reclosed a few paces farther on a second was unlocked Passing through a small room unfurnished a farther passage led us to a balcony The transition was startling Darkness was about us now and silence a perfumed slumberous darkness a silence full of mystery For beyond the walls of the apartment whereon we looked down waged the unceasing battle of sounds that is the hymn of the great industrial river About the scented confines which bounded us now floated the smoke laden vapors of the Lower Thames From the metallic but infinitely human clangor of dock side life from the unpleasant but homely odors which prevail where ships swallow in and belch out the concrete evidences of commercial prosperity we had come into this incensed stillness where one shaded lamp painted dim enlargements of its Chinese silk upon the nearer walls and left the greater part of the room the darker for its contrast Nothing of the Thames side activity of the riveting and scraping the bumping of bales the bawling of orders the hiss of steam penetrated to this perfumed place In the pool of tinted light lay the deathlike figure of a dark haired boy Karamaneh s muffled form bending over him At last I stand in the house of doctor Fu Manchu whispered Smith Despite the girl s assurance we knew that proximity to the sinister Chinaman must be fraught with danger We stood not in the lion s den but in the serpent s lair From the time when Nayland Smith had come from Burma in pursuit of this advance guard of a cogent Yellow Peril the face of doctor Fu Manchu rarely had been absent from my dreams day or night The millions might sleep in peace the millions in whose cause we labored but we who knew the reality of the danger knew that a veritable octopus had fastened upon England a yellow octopus whose head was that of doctor Fu Manchu whose tentacles were dacoity thuggee modes of death secret and swift which in the darkness plucked men from life and left no clew behind Karamaneh I called softly The muffled form beneath the lamp turned so that the soft light fell upon the lovely face of the slave girl She who had been a pliant instrument in the hands of Fu Manchu now was to be the means whereby society should be rid of him She raised her finger warningly then beckoned me to approach My feet sinking in the rich pile of the carpet I came through the gloom of the great apartment in to the patch of light and Karamaneh beside me stood looking down upon the boy It was Aziz her brother dead so far as Western lore had power to judge but kept alive in that deathlike trance by the uncanny power of the Chinese doctor Be quick she said be quick Awaken him I am afraid From the case which I carried I took out a needle syringe and a phial containing a small quantity of amber hued liquid It was a drug not to be found in the British Pharmacopoeia Of its constitution I knew nothing Although I had had the phial in my possession for some days I had not dared to devote any of its precious contents to analytical purposes The amber drops spelled life for the boy Aziz spelled success for the mission of Nayland Smith spelled ruin for the fiendish Chinaman I raised the white coverlet The boy fully dressed lay with his arms crossed upon his breast I discerned the mark of previous injections as charging the syringe from the phial I made what I hoped would be the last of such experiments upon him I would have given half of my small worldly possessions to have known the real nature of the drug which was now coursing through the veins of Aziz which was tinting the grayed face with the olive tone of life which so far as my medical training bore me was restoring the dead to life But such was not the purpose of my visit I was come to remove from the house of doctor Fu Manchu the living chain which bound Karamaneh to him The boy alive and free the Doctor s hold upon the slave girl would be broken My lovely companion her hands convulsively clasped knelt and devoured with her eyes the face of the boy who was passing through the most amazing physiological change in the history of therapeutics The peculiar perfume which she wore which seemed to be a part of her which always I associated with her was faintly perceptible Karamaneh was breathing rapidly You have nothing to fear I whispered see he is reviving In a few moments all will be well with him The hanging lamp with its garishly colored shade swung gently above us wafted it seemed by some draught which passed through the apartment The boy s heavy lids began to quiver and Karamaneh nervously clutched my arm and held me so whilst we watched for the long lashed eyes to open The stillness of the place was positively unnatural it seemed inconceivable that all about us was the discordant activity of the commercial East End Indeed this eerie silence was becoming oppressive it began positively to appall me Inspector Weymouth s wondering face peeped over my shoulder Where is doctor Fu Manchu I whispered as Nayland Smith in turn appeared beside me I cannot understand the silence of the house Look about replied Karamaneh never taking her eyes from the face of Aziz I peered around the shadowy walls Tall glass cases there were shelves and niches where once from the gallery above I had seen the tubes and retorts the jars of unfamiliar organisms the books of unfamiliar lore the impedimenta of the occult student and man of science the visible evidences of Fu Manchu s presence Shelves cases niches were bare Of the complicated appliances unknown to civilized laboratories wherewith he pursued his strange experiments of the tubes wherein he isolated the bacilli of unclassified diseases of the yellow bound volumes for a glimpse at which had they known of their contents the great men of Harley Street would have given a fortune no trace remained The silken cushions the inlaid tables all were gone The room was stripped dismantled Had Fu Manchu fled The silence assumed a new significance His dacoits and kindred ministers of death all must have fled too You have let him escape us I said rapidly You promised to aid us to capture him to send us a message and you have delayed until No she said no and clutched at my arm again Oh is he not reviving slowly Are you sure you have made no mistake Her thoughts were all for the boy and her solicitude touched me I again examined Aziz the most remarkable patient of my busy professional career As I counted the strengthening pulse he opened his dark eyes which were so like the eyes of Karamaneh and with the girl s eager arms tightly about him sat up looking wonderingly around Karamaneh pressed her cheek to his whispering loving words in that softly spoken Arabic which had first betrayed her nationality to Nayland Smith I handed her my flask which I had filled with wine My promise is fulfilled I said You are free Now for Fu Manchu But first let us admit the police to this house there is something uncanny in its stillness No she replied First let my brother be taken out and placed in safety Will you carry him She raised her face to that of Inspector Weymouth upon which was written awe and wonder The burly detective lifted the boy as tenderly as a woman passed through the shadows to the stairway ascended and was swallowed up in the gloom Nayland Smith s eyes gleamed feverishly He turned to Karamaneh You are not playing with us he said harshly We have done our part it remains for you to do yours Do not speak so loudly the girl begged HE is near us and oh God I fear him so Where is he persisted my friend Karamaneh s eyes were glassy with fear now You must not touch him until the police are here she said but from the direction of her quick agitated glances I knew that her brother safe now she feared for me and for me alone Those glances sent my blood dancing for Karamaneh was an Eastern jewel which any man of flesh and blood must have coveted had he known it to lie within his reach Her eyes were twin lakes of mystery which more than once I had known the desire to explore Look beyond that curtain her voice was barely audible but do not enter Even as he is I fear him Her voice her palpable agitation prepared us for something extraordinary Tragedy and Fu Manchu were never far apart Though we were two and help was so near we were in the abode of the most cunning murderer who ever came out of the East It was with strangely mingled emotions that I crossed the thick carpet Nayland Smith beside me and drew aside the draperies concealing a door to which Karamaneh had pointed Then upon looking into the dim place beyond all else save what it held was forgotten We looked upon a small square room the walls draped with fantastic Chinese tapestry the floor strewn with cushions and reclining in a corner where the faint blue light from a lamp placed upon a low table painted grotesque shadows about the cavernous face was doctor Fu Manchu At sight of him my heart leaped and seemed to suspend its functions so intense was the horror which this man s presence inspired in me My hand clutching the curtain I stood watching him The lids veiled the malignant green eyes but the thin lips seemed to smile Then Smith silently pointed to the hand which held a little pipe A sickly perfume assailed my nostrils and the explanation of the hushed silence and the ease with which we had thus far executed our plan came to me The cunning mind was torpid lost in a brutish world of dreams Fu Manchu was in an opium sleep The dim light traced out a network of tiny lines which covered the yellow face from the pointed chin to the top of the great domed brow and formed deep shadow pools in the hollows beneath his eyes At last we had triumphed I could not determine the depth of his obscene trance and mastering some of my repugnance and forgetful of Karamaneh s warning I was about to step forward into the room loaded with its nauseating opium fumes when a soft breath fanned my cheek Do not go in came Karamaneh s warning voice hushed trembling Her little hand grasped my arm She drew Smith and myself back from the door There is danger there she whispered Do not enter that room The police must reach him in some way and drag him out Do not enter that room The girl s voice quivered hysterically her eyes blazed into savage flame The fierce resentment born of dreadful wrongs was consuming her now but fear of Fu Manchu held her yet Inspector Weymouth came down the stairs and joined us I have sent the boy to Ryman s room at the station he said The divisional surgeon will look after him until you arrive doctor Petrie All is ready now The launch is just off the wharf and every side of the place under observation Where s our man He drew a pair of handcuffs from his pocket and raised his eyebrows interrogatively The absence of sound of any demonstration from the uncanny Chinaman whom he was there to arrest puzzled him Nayland Smith jerked his thumb toward the curtain At that and before we could utter a word Weymouth stepped to the draped door He was a man who drove straight at his goal and saved reflections for subsequent leisure I think moreover that the atmosphere of the place stripped as it was it retained its heavy voluptuous perfume had begun to get a hold upon him He was anxious to shake it off to be up and doing He pulled the curtain aside and stepped into the room Smith and I perforce followed him Just within the door the three of us stood looking across at the limp thing which had spread terror throughout the Eastern and Western world Helpless as Fu Manchu was he inspired terror now though the giant intellect was inert stupefied In the dimly lit apartment we had quitted I heard Karamaneh utter a stifled scream But it came too late As though cast up by a volcano the silken cushions the inlaid table with its blue shaded lamp the garish walls the sprawling figure with the ghastly light playing upon its features quivered and shot upward So it seemed to me though in the ensuing instant I remembered too late a previous experience of the floors of Fu Manchu s private apartments I knew what had indeed befallen us A trap had been released beneath our feet I recall falling but have no recollection of the end of my fall of the shock marking the drop I only remember fighting for my life against a stifling something which had me by the throat I knew that I was being suffocated but my hands met only the deathly emptiness Into a poisonous well of darkness I sank I could not cry out I was helpless Of the fate of my companions I knew nothing could surmise nothing Then all consciousness ended CHAPTER XXV I WAS being carried along a dimly lighted tunnel like place slung sackwise across the shoulder of a Burman He was not a big man but he supported my considerable weight with apparent ease A deadly nausea held me but the rough handling had served to restore me to consciousness My hands and feet were closely lashed I hung limply as a wet towel I felt that this spark of tortured life which had flickered up in me must ere long finally become extinguished A fancy possessed me in these the first moments of my restoration to the world of realities that I had been smuggled into China and as I swung head downward I told myself that the huge puffy things which strewed the path were a species of giant toadstool unfamiliar to me and possibly peculiar to whatever district of China I now was in The air was hot steamy and loaded with a smell as of rotting vegetation I wondered why my bearer so scrupulously avoided touching any of the unwholesome looking growths in passing through what seemed a succession of cellars but steered a tortuous course among the bloated unnatural shapes lifting his bare brown feet with a catlike delicacy He passed under a low arch dropped me roughly to the ground and ran back Half stunned I lay watching the agile brown body melt into the distances of the cellars Their walls and roof seemed to emit a faint phosphorescent light Petrie came a weak voice from somewhere ahead Is that you Petrie It was Nayland Smith Smith I said and strove to sit up But the intense nausea overcame me so that I all but swooned I heard his voice again but could attach no meaning to the words which he uttered A sound of terrific blows reached my ears too The Burman reappeared bending under the heavy load which he bore For as he picked his way through the bloated things which grew upon the floors of the cellars I realized that he was carrying the inert body of Inspector Weymouth And I found time to compare the strength of the little brown man with that of a Nile beetle which can raise many times its own weight Then behind him appeared a second figure which immediately claimed the whole of my errant attention Fu Manchu hissed my friend from the darkness which concealed him It was indeed none other than Fu Manchu the Fu Manchu whom we had thought to be helpless The deeps of the Chinaman s cunning the fine quality of his courage were forced upon me as amazing facts He had assumed the appearance of a drugged opium smoker so well as to dupe me a medical man so well as to dupe Karamaneh whose experience of the noxious habit probably was greater than my own And with the gallows dangling before him he had waited played the part of a lure whilst a body of police actually surrounded the place I have since thought that the room probably was one which he actually used for opium debauches and the device of the trap was intended to protect him during the comatose period Now holding a lantern above his head the deviser of the trap whereinto we mouselike had blindly entered came through the cellars following the brown man who carried Weymouth The faint rays of the lantern it apparently contained a candle revealed a veritable forest of the gigantic fungi poisonously colored hideously swollen climbing from the floor up the slimy walls climbing like horrid parasites to such part of the arched roof as was visible to me Fu Manchu picked his way through the fungi ranks as daintily as though the distorted tumid things had been viper headed The resounding blows which I had noted before and which had never ceased culminated in a splintering crash doctor Fu Manchu and his servant who carried the apparently insensible detective passed in under the arch Fu Manchu glancing back once along the passages The lantern he extinguished or concealed and whilst I waited my mind dully surveying memories of all the threats which this uncanny being had uttered a distant clamor came to my ears Then abruptly it ceased doctor Fu Manchu had closed a heavy door and to my surprise I perceived that the greater part of it was of glass The will o the wisp glow which played around the fungi rendered the vista of the cellars faintly luminous and visible to me from where I lay Fu Manchu spoke softly His voice its guttural note alternating with a sibilance on certain words betrayed no traces of agitation The man s unbroken calm had in it something inhuman For he had just perpetrated an act of daring unparalleled in my experience and in the clamor now shut out by the glass door I tardily recognized the entrance of the police into some barricaded part of the house the coming of those who would save us who would hold the Chinese doctor for the hangman I have decided he said deliberately that you are more worthy of my attention than I had formerly supposed A man who can solve the secret of the Golden Elixir I had not solved it I had merely stolen some should be a valuable acquisition to my Council The extent of the plans of mister Commissioner Nayland Smith and of the English Scotland Yard it is incumbent upon me to learn Therefore gentlemen you live for the present And you ll swing came Weymouth s hoarse voice in the near future You and all your yellow gang I trust not was the placid reply Most of my people are safe some are shipped as lascars upon the liners others have departed by different means Ah That last word was the only one indicative of excitement which had yet escaped him A disk of light danced among the brilliant poison hues of the passages but no sound reached us by which I knew that the glass door must fit almost hermetically It was much cooler here than in the place through which we had passed and the nausea began to leave me my brain to grow more clear Had I known what was to follow I should have cursed the lucidity of mind which now came to me I should have prayed for oblivion to be spared the sight of that which ensued It s Logan cried Inspector Weymouth and I could tell that he was struggling to free himself of his bonds From his voice it was evident that he too was recovering from the effects of the narcotic which had been administered to us all Logan he cried Logan This way HELP But the cry beat back upon us in that enclosed space and seemed to carry no farther than the invisible walls of our prison The door fits well came Fu Manchu s mocking voice It is fortunate for us all that it is so This is my observation window doctor Petrie and you are about to enjoy an unique opportunity of studying fungology I have already drawn your attention to the anaesthetic properties of the lycoperdon or common puff ball You may have recognized the fumes The chamber into which you rashly precipitated yourselves was charged with them By a process of my own I have greatly enhanced the value of the puff ball in this respect Your friend mister Weymouth proved the most obstinate subject but he succumbed in fifteen seconds Logan Help HELP This way man Something very like fear sounded in Weymouth s voice now Indeed the situation was so uncanny that it almost seemed unreal A group of men had entered the farthermost cellars led by one who bore an electric pocket lamp The hard white ray danced from bloated gray fungi to others of nightmare shape of dazzling venomous brilliance The mocking lecture room voice continued Note the snowy growth upon the roof Doctor Do not be deceived by its size It is a giant variety of my own culture and is of the order empusa You in England are familiar with the death of the common house fly which is found attached to the window pane by a coating of white mold I have developed the spores of this mold and have produced a giant species Observe the interesting effect of the strong light upon my orange and blue amanita fungus Hard beside me I heard Nayland Smith groan Weymouth had become suddenly silent For my own part I could have shrieked in pure horror FOR I KNEW WHAT WAS COMING I realized in one agonized instant the significance of the dim lantern of the careful progress through the subterranean fungi grove of the care with which Fu Manchu and his servant had avoided touching any of the growths I knew now that doctor Fu Manchu was the greatest fungologist the world had ever known was a poisoner to whom the Borgias were as children and I knew that the detectives blindly were walking into a valley of death Then it began the unnatural scene the saturnalia of murder Like so many bombs the brilliantly colored caps of the huge toadstool like things alluded to by the Chinaman exploded as the white ray sought them out in the darkness which alone preserved their existence A brownish cloud I could not determine whether liquid or powdery arose in the cellar I tried to close my eyes or to turn them away from the reeling forms of the men who were trapped in that poison hole It was useless I must look The bearer of the lamp had dropped it but the dim eerily illuminated gloom endured scarce a second A bright light sprang up doubtless at the touch of the fiendish being who now resumed speech Observe the symptoms of delirium Doctor Out there beyond the glass door the unhappy victims were laughing tearing their garments from their bodies leaping waving their arms were become MANIACS We will now release the ripe spores of giant entpusa continued the wicked voice The air of the second cellar being super charged with oxygen they immediately germinate Ah it is a triumph That process is the scientific triumph of my life Like powdered snow the white spores fell from the roof frosting the writhing shapes of the already poisoned men Before my horrified gaze THE FUNGUS GREW it spread from the head to the feet of those it touched it enveloped them as in glittering shrouds They die like flies screamed Fu Manchu with a sudden febrile excitement and I felt assured of something I had long suspected that that magnificent perverted brain was the brain of a homicidal maniac though Smith would never accept the theory It is my fly trap shrieked the Chinaman And I am the god of destruction CHAPTER XXVI THE clammy touch of the mist revived me The culmination of the scene in the poison cellars together with the effects of the fumes which I had inhaled again had deprived me of consciousness Now I knew that I was afloat on the river I still was bound furthermore a cloth was wrapped tightly about my mouth and I was secured to a ring in the deck By moving my aching head to the left I could look down into the oily water by moving it to the right I could catch a glimpse of the empurpled face of Inspector Weymouth who similarly bound and gagged lay beside me but only of the feet and legs of Nayland Smith For I could not turn my head sufficiently far to see more We were aboard an electric launch I heard the hated guttural voice of Fu Manchu subdued now to its habitual calm and my heart leaped to hear the voice that answered him It was that of Karamaneh His triumph was complete Clearly his plans for departure were complete his slaughter of the police in the underground passages had been a final reckless demonstration of which the Chinaman s subtle cunning would have been incapable had he not known his escape from the country to be assured What fate was in store for us How would he avenge himself upon the girl who had betrayed him to his enemies What portion awaited those enemies He seemed to have formed the singular determination to smuggle me into China but what did he purpose in the case of Weymouth and in the case of Nayland Smith All but silently we were feeling our way through the mist Astern died the clangor of dock and wharf into a remote discord Ahead hung the foggy curtain veiling the traffic of the great waterway but through it broke the calling of sirens the tinkling of bells The gentle movement of the screw ceased altogether The launch lay heaving slightly upon the swells A distant throbbing grew louder and something advanced upon us through the haze A bell rang and muffled by the fog a voice proclaimed itself a voice which I knew I felt Weymouth writhing impotently beside me heard him mumbling incoherently and I knew that he too had recognized the voice It was that of Inspector Ryman of the river police and their launch was within biscuit throw of that upon which we lay Hoy Hoy I trembled A feverish excitement claimed me They were hailing us We carried no lights but now and ignoring the pain which shot from my spine to my skull I craned my neck to the left the port light of the police launch glowed angrily through the mist I was unable to utter any save mumbling sounds and my companions were equally helpless It was a desperate position Had the police seen us or had they hailed at random The light drew nearer Launch hoy They had seen us Fu Manchu s guttural voice spoke shortly and our screw began to revolve again we leaped ahead into the bank of darkness Faint grew the light of the police launch and was gone But I heard Ryman s voice shouting Full speed came faintly through the darkness Port Port Then the murk closed down and with our friends far astern of us we were racing deeper into the fog banks speeding seaward though of this I was unable to judge at the time On we raced and on sweeping over growing swells Once a black towering shape dropped down upon us Far above lights blazed bells rang vague cries pierced the fog The launch pitched and rolled perilously but weathered the wash of the liner which so nearly had concluded this episode It was such a journey as I had taken once before early in our pursuit of the genius of the Yellow Peril but this was infinitely more terrible for now we were utterly in Fu Manchu s power A voice mumbled in my ear I turned my bound up face and Inspector Weymouth raised his hands in the dimness and partly slipped the bandage from his mouth I ve been working at the cords since we left those filthy cellars he whispered My wrists are all cut but when I ve got out a knife and freed my ankles Smith had kicked him with his bound feet The detective slipped the bandage back to position and placed his hands behind him again doctor Fu Manchu wearing a heavy overcoat but no hat came aft He was dragging Karamaneh by the wrists He seated himself on the cushions near to us pulling the girl down beside him Now I could see her face and the expression in her beautiful eyes made me writhe Fu Manchu was watching us his discolored teeth faintly visible in the dim light to which my eyes were becoming accustomed doctor Petrie he said you shall be my honored guest at my home in China You shall assist me to revolutionize chemistry mister Smith I fear you know more of my plans than I had deemed it possible for you to have learned and I am anxious to know if you have a confidant Where your memory fails you and my files and wire jackets prove ineffectual Inspector Weymouth s recollections may prove more accurate He turned to the cowering girl who shrank away from him in pitiful abject terror In my hands Doctor he continued I hold a needle charged with a rare culture It is the link between the bacilli and the fungi You have seemed to display an undue interest in the peach and pearl which render my Karamaneh so delightful In the supple grace of her movements and the sparkle of her eyes You can never devote your whole mind to those studies which I have planned for you whilst such distractions exist A touch of this keen point and the laughing Karamaneh becomes the shrieking hag the maniacal mowing Then with an ox like rush Weymouth was upon him Karamaneh wrought upon past endurance with a sobbing cry sank to the deck and lay still I managed to writhe into a half sitting posture and Smith rolled aside as the detective and the Chinaman crashed down together Weymouth had one big hand at the Doctor s yellow throat with his left he grasped the Chinaman s right It held the needle Now I could look along the length of the little craft and so far as it was possible to make out in the fog only one other was aboard the half clad brown man who navigated her and who had carried us through the cellars The murk had grown denser and now shut us in like a box The throb of the motor the hissing breath of the two who fought with so much at issue these sounds and the wash of the water alone broke the eerie stillness By slow degrees and with a reptilian agility horrible to watch Fu Manchu was neutralizing the advantage gained by Weymouth His clawish fingers were fast in the big man s throat the right hand with its deadly needle was forcing down the left of his opponent He had been underneath but now he was gaining the upper place His powers of physical endurance must have been truly marvelous His breath was whistling through his nostrils significantly but Weymouth was palpably tiring The latter suddenly changed his tactics By a supreme effort to which he was spurred I think by the growing proximity of the needle he raised Fu Manchu by the throat and arm and pitched him sideways The Chinaman s grip did not relax and the two wrestlers dropped a writhing mass upon the port cushions The launch heeled over and my cry of horror was crushed back into my throat by the bandage For as Fu Manchu sought to extricate himself he overbalanced fell back and bearing Weymouth with him slid into the river The mist swallowed them up There are moments of which no man can recall his mental impressions moments so acutely horrible that mercifully our memory retains nothing of the emotions they occasioned This was one of them A chaos ruled in my mind I had a vague belief that the Burman forward glanced back Then the course of the launch was changed How long intervened between the tragic end of that Gargantuan struggle and the time when a black wall leaped suddenly up before us I cannot pretend to state With a sickening jerk we ran aground A loud explosion ensued and I clearly remember seeing the brown man leap out into the fog which was the last I saw of him Water began to wash aboard Fully alive to our imminent peril I fought with the cords that bound me but I lacked poor Weymouth s strength of wrist and I began to accept as a horrible and imminent possibility a death from drowning within six feet of the bank Beside me Nayland Smith was straining and twisting I think his object was to touch Karamaneh in the hope of arousing her Where he failed in his project the inflowing water succeeded A silent prayer of thankfulness came from my very soul when I saw her stir when I saw her raise her hands to her head and saw the big horror bright eyes gleam through the mist veil CHAPTER XXVII WE quitted the wrecked launch but a few seconds before her stern settled down into the river Where the mud bank upon which we found ourselves was situated we had no idea But at least it was terra firma and we were free from doctor Fu Manchu Smith stood looking out towards the river My God he groaned My God He was thinking as I was of Weymouth And when an hour later the police boat located us on the mud flats below Greenwich and we heard that the toll of the poison cellars was eight men we also heard news of our brave companion Back there in the fog sir reported Inspector Ryman who was in charge and his voice was under poor command there was an uncanny howling and peals of laughter that I m going to dream about for weeks Karamaneh who nestled beside me like a frightened child shivered and I knew that the needle had done its work despite Weymouth s giant strength Smith swallowed noisily Pray God the river has that yellow Satan he said I would sacrifice a year of my life to see his rat s body on the end of a grappling iron We were a sad party that steamed through the fog homeward that night It seemed almost like deserting a staunch comrade to leave the spot so nearly as we could locate it where Weymouth had put up that last gallant fight Our helplessness was pathetic and although had the night been clear as crystal I doubt if we could have acted otherwise it came to me that this stinking murk was a new enemy which drove us back in coward retreat But so many were the calls upon our activity and so numerous the stimulants to our initiative in those times that soon we had matter to relieve our minds from this stress of sorrow There was Karamaneh to be considered Karamaneh and her brother A brief counsel was held whereat it was decided that for the present they should be lodged at a hotel I shall arrange Smith whispered to me for the girl was watching us to have the place patrolled night and day You cannot suppose Petrie I cannot and dare not suppose Fu Manchu dead until with my own eyes I have seen him so Accordingly we conveyed the beautiful Oriental girl and her brother away from that luxurious abode in its sordid setting I will not dwell upon the final scene in the poison cellars lest I be accused of accumulating horror for horror s sake Members of the fire brigade helmed against contagion brought out the bodies of the victims wrapped in their living shrouds From Karamaneh we learned much of Fu Manchu little of herself What am I Does my poor history matter to anyone was her answer to questions respecting herself And she would droop her lashes over her dark eyes The dacoits whom the Chinaman had brought to England originally numbered seven we learned As you having followed me thus far will be aware we had thinned the ranks of the Burmans Probably only one now remained in England They had lived in a camp in the grounds of the house near Windsor which as we had learned at the time of its destruction the Doctor had bought outright The Thames had been his highway Other members of the group had occupied quarters in various parts of the East End where sailormen of all nationalities congregate Shen Yan s had been the East End headquarters He had employed the hulk from the time of his arrival as a laboratory for a certain class of experiments undesirable in proximity to a place of residence Nayland Smith asked the girl on one occasion if the Chinaman had had a private sea going vessel and she replied in the affirmative She had never been on board however had never even set eyes upon it and could give us no information respecting its character It had sailed for China You are sure asked Smith keenly that it has actually left I understood so and that we were to follow by another route It would have been difficult for Fu Manchu to travel by a passenger boat I cannot say what were his plans In a state of singular uncertainty then readily to be understood we passed the days following the tragedy which had deprived us of our fellow worker Vividly I recall the scene at poor Weymouth s home on the day that we visited it I then made the acquaintance of the Inspector s brother Nayland Smith gave him a detailed account of the last scene Out there in the mist he concluded wearily it all seemed very unreal I wish to God it had been Amen to that mister Weymouth But your brother made a gallant finish If ridding the world of Fu Manchu were the only good deed to his credit his life had been well spent James Weymouth smoked awhile in thoughtful silence Though but four and a half miles S S E of saint Paul s the quaint little cottage with its rustic garden shadowed by the tall trees which had so lined the village street before motor buses were was a spot as peaceful and secluded as any in broad England But another shadow lay upon it to day chilling fearful An incarnate evil had come out of the dim East and in its dying malevolence had touched this home There are two things I don t understand about it sir continued Weymouth What was the meaning of the horrible laughter which the river police heard in the fog And where are the bodies Karamaneh seated beside me shuddered at the words Smith whose restless spirit granted him little repose paused in his aimless wanderings about the room and looked at her In these latter days of his Augean labors to purge England of the unclean thing which had fastened upon her my friend was more lean and nervous looking than I had ever known him His long residence in Burma had rendered him spare and had burned his naturally dark skin to a coppery hue but now his gray eyes had grown feverishly bright and his face so lean as at times to appear positively emaciated But I knew that he was as fit as ever This lady may be able to answer your first question he said She and her brother were for some time in the household of doctor Fu Manchu In fact mister Weymouth Karamaneh as her name implies was a slave Weymouth glanced at the beautiful troubled face with scarcely veiled distrust You don t look as though you had come from China miss he said with a sort of unwilling admiration I do not come from China replied Karamaneh My father was a pure Bedawee But my history does not matter At times there was something imperious in her manner and to this her musical accent added force When your brave brother Inspector Weymouth and doctor Fu Manchu were swallowed up by the river Fu Manchu held a poisoned needle in his hand The laughter meant that the needle had done its work Your brother had become mad Weymouth turned aside to hide his emotion What was on the needle he asked huskily It was something which he prepared from the venom of a kind of swamp adder she answered It produces madness but not always death He would have had a poor chance said Smith even had he been in complete possession of his senses At the time of the encounter we must have been some considerable distance from shore and the fog was impenetrable But how do you account for the fact that neither of the bodies have been recovered Ryman of the river police tells me that persons lost at that point are not always recovered or not until a considerable time later There was a faint sound from the room above The news of that tragic happening out in the mist upon the Thames had prostrated poor missus Weymouth She hasn t been told half the truth said her brother in law She doesn t know about the poisoned needle What kind of fiend was this doctor Fu Manchu He burst out into a sudden blaze of furious resentment John never told me much and you have let mighty little leak into the papers What was he Who was he Half he addressed the words to Smith half to Karamaneh doctor Fu Manchu replied the former was the ultimate expression of Chinese cunning a phenomenon such as occurs but once in many generations He was a superman of incredible genius who had he willed could have revolutionized science There is a superstition in some parts of China according to which under certain peculiar conditions one of which is proximity to a deserted burial ground an evil spirit of incredible age may enter unto the body of a new born infant All my efforts thus far have not availed me to trace the genealogy of the man called doctor Fu Manchu Even Karamaneh cannot help me in this But I have sometimes thought that he was a member of a certain very old Kiangsu family and that the peculiar conditions I have mentioned prevailed at his birth Smith observing our looks of amazement laughed shortly and quite mirthlessly Poor old Weymouth he jerked I suppose my labors are finished but I am far from triumphant Is there any improvement in missus Weymouth s condition Very little was the reply she has lain in a semi conscious state since the news came No one had any idea she would take it so At one time we were afraid her brain was going She seemed to have delusions Smith spun round upon Weymouth Of what nature he asked rapidly The other pulled nervously at his mustache My wife has been staying with her he explained since it happened and for the last three nights poor John s widow has cried out at the same time half past two that someone was knocking on the door What door That door yonder the street door All our eyes turned in the direction indicated John often came home at half past two from the Yard continued Weymouth so we naturally thought poor Mary was wandering in her mind But last night and it s not to be wondered at my wife couldn t sleep and she was wide awake at half past two Well Nayland Smith was standing before him alert bright eyed She heard it too The sun was streaming into the cozy little sitting room but I will confess that Weymouth s words chilled me uncannily Karamaneh laid her hand upon mine in a quaint childish fashion peculiarly her own Her hand was cold but its touch thrilled me For Karamaneh was not a child but a rarely beautiful girl a pearl of the East such as many a monarch has fought for What then asked Smith She was afraid to move afraid to look from the window My friend turned and stared hard at me A subjective hallucination Petrie In all probability I replied You should arrange that your wife be relieved in her trying duties mister Weymouth It is too great a strain for an inexperienced nurse CHAPTER XXVIII OF all that we had hoped for in our pursuit of Fu Manchu how little had we accomplished Excepting Karamaneh and her brother who were victims and not creatures of the Chinese doctor s not one of the formidable group had fallen alive into our hands Dreadful crimes had marked Fu Manchu s passage through the land Not one half of the truth and nothing of the later developments had been made public Nayland Smith s authority was sufficient to control the press In the absence of such a veto a veritable panic must have seized upon the entire country for a monster a thing more than humanly evil existed in our midst Always Fu Manchu s secret activities had centered about the great waterway There was much of poetic justice in his end for the Thames had claimed him who so long had used the stream as a highway for the passage to and fro for his secret forces Gone now were the yellow men who had been the instruments of his evil will gone was the giant intellect which had controlled the complex murder machine Karamaneh whose beauty he had used as a lure at last was free and no more with her smile would tempt men to death that her brother might live Many there are I doubt not who will regard the Eastern girl with horror I ask their forgiveness in that I regarded her quite differently No man having seen her could have condemned her unheard Many having looked into her lovely eyes had they found there what I found must have forgiven her almost any crime That she valued human life but little was no matter for wonder Her nationality her history furnished adequate excuse for an attitude not condonable in a European equally cultured But indeed let me confess that hers was a nature incomprehensible to me in some respects The soul of Karamaneh was a closed book to my short sighted Western eyes But the body of Karamaneh was exquisite her beauty of a kind that was a key to the most extravagant rhapsodies of Eastern poets Her eyes held a challenge wholly Oriental in its appeal her lips even in repose were a taunt And herein East is West and West is East Finally despite her lurid history despite the scornful self possession of which I knew her capable she was an unprotected girl in years I believe a mere child whom Fate had cast in my way At her request we had booked passages for her brother and herself to Egypt The boat sailed in three days But Karamaneh s beautiful eyes were sad often I detected tears on the black lashes Shall I endeavor to describe my own tumultuous conflicting emotions It would be useless since I know it to be impossible For in those dark eyes burned a fire I might not see those silken lashes veiled a message I dared not read Nayland Smith was not blind to the facts of the complicated situation I can truthfully assert that he was the only man of my acquaintance who having come in contact with Karamaneh had kept his head We endeavored to divert her mind from the recent tragedies by a round of amusements though with poor Weymouth s body still at the mercy of unknown waters Smith and I made but a poor show of gayety and I took a gloomy pride in the admiration which our lovely companion everywhere excited I learned in those days how rare a thing in nature is a really beautiful woman One afternoon we found ourselves at an exhibition of water colors in Bond Street Karamaneh was intensely interested in the subjects of the drawings which were entirely Egyptian As usual she furnished matter for comment amongst the other visitors as did the boy Aziz her brother anew upon the world from his living grave in the house of doctor Fu Manchu Suddenly Aziz clutched at his sister s arm whispering rapidly in Arabic I saw her peachlike color fade saw her become pale and wild eyed the haunted Karamaneh of the old days She turned to me doctor Petrie he says that Fu Manchu is here Where Nayland Smith rapped out the question violently turning in a flash from the picture which he was examining In this room she whispered glancing furtively affrightedly about her Something tells Aziz when HE is near and I too feel strangely afraid Oh can it be that he is not dead She held my arm tightly Her brother was searching the room with big velvet black eyes I studied the faces of the several visitors and Smith was staring about him with the old alert look and tugging nervously at the lobe of his ear The name of the giant foe of the white race instantaneously had strung him up to a pitch of supreme intensity Our united scrutinies discovered no figure which could have been that of the Chinese doctor Who could mistake that long gaunt shape with the high mummy like shoulders and the indescribable gait which I can only liken to that of an awkward cat Then over the heads of a group of people who stood by the doorway I saw Smith peering at someone at someone who passed across the outer room Stepping aside I too obtained a glimpse of this person As I saw him he was a tall old man wearing a black Inverness coat and a rather shabby silk hat He had long white hair and a patriarchal beard wore smoked glasses and walked slowly leaning upon a stick Smith s gaunt face paled With a rapid glance at Karamaneh he made off across the room Could it be doctor Fu Manchu Many days had passed since already half choked by Inspector Weymouth s iron grip Fu Manchu before our own eyes had been swallowed up by the Thames Even now men were seeking his body and that of his last victim Nor had we left any stone unturned Acting upon information furnished by Karamaneh the police had searched every known haunt of the murder group But everything pointed to the fact that the group was disbanded and dispersed that the lord of strange deaths who had ruled it was no more Yet Smith was not satisfied Neither let me confess was I Every port was watched and in suspected districts a kind of house to house patrol had been instituted Unknown to the great public in those days a secret war waged a war in which all the available forces of the authorities took the field against one man But that one man was the evil of the East incarnate When we rejoined him Nayland Smith was talking to the commissionaire at the door He turned to me That is Professor Jenner Monde he said The sergeant here knows him well The name of the celebrated Orientalist of course was familiar to me although I had never before set eyes upon him The Professor was out East the last time I was there sir stated the commissionaire I often used to see him But he s an eccentric old gentleman Seems to live in a world of his own He s recently back from China I think Nayland Smith stood clicking his teeth together in irritable hesitation I heard Karamaneh sigh and looking at her I saw that her cheeks were regaining their natural color She smiled in pathetic apology If he was here he is gone she said I am not afraid now Smith thanked the commissionaire for his information and we quitted the gallery Professor Jenner Monde muttered my friend has lived so long in China as almost to be a Chinaman I have never met him never seen him before but I wonder You wonder what Smith I wonder if he could possibly be an ally of the Doctor s I stared at him in amazement If we are to attach any importance to the incident at all I said we must remember that the boy s impression and Karamaneh s was that Fu Manchu was present in person I DO attach importance to the incident Petrie they are naturally sensitive to such impressions But I doubt if even the abnormal organization of Aziz could distinguish between the hidden presence of a creature of the Doctor s and that of the Doctor himself I shall make a point of calling upon Professor Jenner Monde But Fate had ordained that much should happen ere Smith made his proposed call upon the Professor Karamaneh and her brother safely lodged in their hotel which was watched night and day by four men under Smith s orders we returned to my quiet suburban rooms First said Smith let us see what we can find out respecting Professor Monde He went to the telephone and called up New Scotland Yard There followed some little delay before the requisite information was obtained Finally however we learned that the Professor was something of a recluse having few acquaintances and fewer friends He lived alone in chambers in New Inn Court Carey Street A charwoman did such cleaning as was considered necessary by the Professor who employed no regular domestic When he was in London he might be seen fairly frequently at the British Museum where his shabby figure was familiar to the officials When he was not in London that is during the greater part of each year no one knew where he went He never left any address to which letters might be forwarded How long has he been in London now asked Smith So far as could be ascertained from New Inn Court replied Scotland Yard roughly a week My friend left the telephone and began restlessly to pace the room The charred briar was produced and stuffed with that broad cut Latakia mixture of which Nayland Smith consumed close upon a pound a week He was one of those untidy smokers who leave tangled tufts hanging from the pipe bowl and when they light up strew the floor with smoldering fragments A ringing came and shortly afterwards a girl entered mister James Weymouth to see you sir Hullo rapped Smith What s this Weymouth entered big and florid and in some respects singularly like his brother in others as singularly unlike Now in his black suit he was a somber figure and in the blue eyes I read a fear suppressed mister Smith he began there s something uncanny going on at Maple Cottage Smith wheeled the big arm chair forward Sit down mister Weymouth he said I am not entirely surprised But you have my attention What has occurred Weymouth took a cigarette from the box which I proffered and poured out a peg of whisky His hand was not quite steady That knocking he explained It came again the night after you were there and missus Weymouth my wife I mean felt that she couldn t spend another night there alone Did she look out of the window I asked No Doctor she was afraid But I spent last night downstairs in the sitting room and I looked out He took a gulp from his glass Nayland Smith seated on the edge of the table his extinguished pipe in his hand was watching him keenly I ll admit I didn t look out at once Weymouth resumed There was something so uncanny gentlemen in that knocking knocking in the dead of the night I thought his voice shook of poor Jack lying somewhere amongst the slime of the river and oh my God it came to me that it was Jack who was knocking and I dare not think what he what it would look like He leaned forward his chin in his hand For a few moments we were all silent I know I funked he continued huskily But when the wife came to the head of the stairs and whispered to me There it is again What in heaven s name can it be I started to unbolt the door The knocking had stopped Everything was very still I heard Mary HIS widow sobbing upstairs that was all I opened the door a little bit at a time Pausing again he cleared his throat and went on It was a bright night and there was no one there not a soul But somewhere down the lane as I looked out into the porch I heard most awful groans They got fainter and fainter Then I could have sworn I heard SOMEONE LAUGHING My nerves cracked up at that and I shut the door again The narration of his weird experience revived something of the natural fear which it had occasioned He raised his glass with unsteady hand and drained it Smith struck a match and relighted his pipe He began to pace the room again His eyes were literally on fire Would it be possible to get missus Weymouth out of the house before to night Remove her to your place for instance he asked abruptly Weymouth looked up in surprise She seems to be in a very low state he replied He glanced at me Perhaps doctor Petrie would give us an opinion I will come and see her I said But what is your idea Smith I want to hear that knocking he rapped But in what I may see fit to do I must not be handicapped by the presence of a sick woman Her condition at any rate will admit of our administering an opiate I suggested That would meet the situation Good cried Smith He was intensely excited now I rely upon you to arrange something Petrie mister Weymouth he turned to our visitor I shall be with you this evening not later than twelve o clock Weymouth appeared to be greatly relieved I asked him to wait whilst I prepared a draught for the patient When he was gone What do you think this knocking means Smith I asked He tapped out his pipe on the side of the grate and began with nervous energy to refill it again from the dilapidated pouch I dare not tell you what I hope Petrie he replied nor what I fear CHAPTER XXIX 
1614-13785-0000	train-other-500	DUSK was falling when we made our way in the direction of Maple Cottage Nayland Smith appeared to be keenly interested in the character of the district
none	none	 A high and ancient wall bordered the road along which we walked for a considerable distance 
1614-13785-0001	train-other-500	Later it gave place to a rickety fence My friend peered through a gap in the latter There is quite an extensive estate here he said not yet cut up by the builder It is well wooded on one side and there appears to be a pool lower down
1614-13785-0002	train-other-500	The road was a quiet one and we plainly heard the tread quite unmistakable of an approaching policeman
none	none	 Smith continued to peer through the hole in the fence until the officer drew up level with us Then 
1614-13785-0003	train-other-500	Does this piece of ground extend down to the village constable he inquired Quite willing for a chat the man stopped and stood with his thumbs thrust in his belt Yes sir They tell me three new roads will be made through it between here and the hill
1614-13785-0004	train-other-500	It must be a happy hunting ground for tramps I ve seen some suspicious looking coves about at times But after dusk an army might be inside there and nobody would ever be the wiser Burglaries frequent in the houses backing on to it Oh no
1614-13785-0005	train-other-500	A favorite game in these parts is snatching loaves and bottles of milk from the doors first thing as they re delivered There s been an extra lot of it lately My mate who relieves me has got special instructions to keep his eye open in the mornings The man grinned
1614-13785-0006	train-other-500	It wouldn t be a very big case even if he caught anybody No said Smith absently perhaps not
none	none	 Your business must be a dry one this warm weather 
1614-13785-0007	train-other-500	Good night Good night sir replied the constable richer by half a crown and thank you Smith stared after him for a moment tugging reflectively at the lobe of his ear I don t know that it wouldn t be a big case after all he murmured
1614-13785-0008	train-other-500	Come on Petrie Not another word did he speak until we stood at the gate of Maple Cottage There a plain clothes man was standing evidently awaiting Smith He touched his hat Have you found a suitable hiding place asked my companion rapidly
none	none	 Yes sir was the reply Kent my mate is there now You ll notice that he can t be seen from here No agreed Smith peering all about him He can t Where is he Behind the broken wall explained the man pointing 
1614-13785-0009	train-other-500	Through that ivy there s a clear view of the cottage door Good Keep your eyes open If a messenger comes for me he is to be intercepted you understand No one must be allowed to disturb us You will recognize the messenger He will be one of your fellows
none	none	 Should he come hoot three times as much like an owl as you can We walked up to the porch of the cottage In response to Smith s ringing came James Weymouth who seemed greatly relieved by our arrival First said my friend briskly 
1614-13785-0010	train-other-500	you had better run up and see the patient Accordingly I followed Weymouth upstairs and was admitted by his wife to a neat little bedroom where the grief stricken woman lay a wanly pathetic sight Did you administer the draught as directed I asked
1614-13785-0011	train-other-500	missus James Weymouth nodded She was a kindly looking woman with the same dread haunting her hazel eyes as that which lurked in her husband s blue ones The patient was sleeping soundly Some whispered instructions I gave to the faithful nurse
1614-13785-0012	train-other-500	and descended to the sitting room It was a warm night and Weymouth sat by the open window smoking The dim light from the lamp on the table lent him an almost startling likeness to his brother and for a moment I stood at the foot of the stairs scarce able to trust my reason
1614-13785-0013	train-other-500	Then he turned his face fully towards me and the illusion was lost Do you think she is likely to wake Doctor he asked I think not I replied Nayland Smith stood upon the rug before the hearth
1614-13785-0014	train-other-500	swinging from one foot to the other in his nervously restless way The room was foggy with the fumes of tobacco for he too was smoking At intervals of some five to ten minutes his blackened briar which I never knew him to clean or scrape would go out
none	none	 I think Smith used more matches than any other smoker I have ever met and he invariably carried three boxes in various pockets of his garments 
1614-13785-0015	train-other-500	The tobacco habit is infectious and seating myself in an arm chair I lighted a cigarette
none	none	 For this dreary vigil I had come prepared with a bunch of rough notes a writing block and a fountain pen 
1614-13785-0016	train-other-500	I settled down to work upon my record of the Fu Manchu case Silence fell upon Maple Cottage Save for the shuddering sigh which whispered through the over hanging cedars and Smith s eternal match striking
none	none	 nothing was there to disturb me in my task 
1614-13785-0017	train-other-500	Yet I could make little progress
none	none	 Between my mind and the chapter upon which I was at work a certain sentence persistently intruded itself It was as though an unseen hand held the written page closely before my eyes 
1614-13785-0018	train-other-500	This was the sentence Imagine a person tall lean and feline high shouldered with a brow like Shakespeare and a face like Satan a close shaven skull and long magnetic eyes of the true cat green
1614-13785-0019	train-other-500	invest him with all the cruel cunning of an entire Eastern race accumulated in one giant intellect doctor Fu Manchu Fu Manchu as Smith had described him to me on that night which now seemed so remotely distant
1614-13785-0020	train-other-500	the night upon which I had learned of the existence of the wonderful and evil being born of that secret quickening
none	none	 which stirred in the womb of the yellow races 
1614-13785-0021	train-other-500	As Smith for the ninth or tenth time knocked out his pipe on a bar of the grate the cuckoo clock in the kitchen proclaimed the hour Two said James Weymouth I abandoned my task
1614-13785-0022	train-other-500	replacing notes and writing block in the bag that I had with me Weymouth adjusted the lamp which had begun to smoke I tiptoed to the stairs and stepping softly ascended to the sick room All was quiet and missus Weymouth whispered to me that the patient still slept soundly
1614-13785-0023	train-other-500	I returned to find Nayland Smith pacing about the room in that state of suppressed excitement habitual with him in the approach of any crisis At a quarter past two the breeze dropped entirely
1614-13785-0024	train-other-500	and such a stillness reigned all about us as I could not have supposed possible so near to the ever throbbing heart of the great metropolis Plainly I could hear Weymouth s heavy breathing He sat at the window and looked out into the black shadows under the cedars
none	none	 Smith ceased his pacing and stood again on the rug very still 
1614-13785-0025	train-other-500	He was listening I doubt not we were all listening Some faint sound broke the impressive stillness
none	none	 coming from the direction of the village street It was a vague indefinite disturbance 
1614-13785-0026	train-other-500	brief and upon it ensued a silence more marked than ever Some minutes before Smith had extinguished the lamp In the darkness I heard his teeth snap sharply together The call of an owl sounded very clearly three times
none	none	 I knew that to mean that a messenger had come but from whence or bearing what tidings I knew not My friend s plans were incomprehensible to me nor had I pressed him for any explanation of their nature 
1614-13785-0027	train-other-500	knowing him to be in that high strung and somewhat irritable mood which claimed him at times of uncertainty when he doubted the wisdom of his actions
none	none	 the accuracy of his surmises 
1614-13785-0028	train-other-500	He gave no sign Very faintly I heard a clock strike the half hour A soft breeze stole again through the branches above The wind I thought must be in a new quarter
none	none	 since I had not heard the clock before 
1614-13785-0029	train-other-500	In so lonely a spot
none	none	 it was difficult to believe that the bell was that of saint Paul s 
1614-13785-0030	train-other-500	Yet such was the fact And hard upon the ringing followed another sound
none	none	 a sound we all had expected had waited for 
1614-13785-0031	train-other-500	but at whose coming no one of us I think retained complete mastery of himself Breaking up the silence in a manner that set my heart wildly leaping it came an imperative knocking on the door My God groaned Weymouth
1614-13785-0032	train-other-500	but he did not move from his position at the window Stand by Petrie said Smith He strode to the door and threw it widely open
none	none	 I know I was very pale 
1614-13785-0033	train-other-500	I think I cried out as I fell back retreated with clenched hands from before THAT which stood on the threshold It was a wild unkempt figure with straggling beard hideously staring eyes With its hands it clutched at its hair at its chin
1614-13785-0034	train-other-500	plucked at its mouth No moonlight touched the features of this unearthly visitant but scanty as was the illumination we could see the gleaming teeth and the wildly glaring eyes It began to laugh peal after peal
1614-13785-0035	train-other-500	hideous and shrill Nothing so terrifying had ever smote upon my ears I was palsied by the horror of the sound Then Nayland Smith pressed the button of an electric torch which he carried
1614-13785-0036	train-other-500	He directed the disk of white light fully upon the face in the doorway Oh God cried Weymouth It s John and again and again Oh God Oh God Perhaps for the first time in my life I really believed
1614-13785-0037	train-other-500	nay I could not doubt that a thing of another world stood before me I am ashamed to confess the extent of the horror that came upon me James Weymouth raised his hands as if to thrust away from him that awful thing in the door He was babbling prayers I think
none	none	 but wholly incoherent Hold him Petrie Smith s voice was low When we were past thought or intelligent action he dominant and cool with that forced calm for which a crisis over he always paid so dearly was thinking of the woman who slept above 
1614-13785-0038	train-other-500	He leaped forward and in the instant that he grappled with the one who had knocked I knew the visitant for a man of flesh and blood a man who shrieked and fought like a savage animal foamed at the mouth and gnashed his teeth in horrid frenzy knew him for a madman
1614-13785-0039	train-other-500	knew him for the victim of Fu Manchu not dead but living for Inspector Weymouth a maniac In a flash I realized all this
none	none	 and sprang to Smith s assistance There was a sound of racing footsteps 
1614-13785-0040	train-other-500	and the men who had been watching outside came running into the porch A third was with them and the five of us for Weymouth s brother had not yet grasped the fact that a man and not a spirit shrieked and howled in our midst clung to the infuriated madman yet barely held our own with him
1614-13785-0041	train-other-500	The syringe Petrie gasped Smith Quick You must manage to make an injection I extricated myself and raced into the cottage for my bag
none	none	 A hypodermic syringe ready charged I had brought with me at Smith s request 
1614-13785-0042	train-other-500	Even in that thrilling moment I could find time to admire the wonderful foresight of my friend
none	none	 who had divined what would befall isolated the strange pitiful truth from the chaotic circumstances which saw us at Maple Cottage that night Let me not enlarge upon the end of the awful struggle At one time I despaired we all despaired of quieting the poor demented creature But at last it was done and the gaunt blood stained savage whom we had known as Detective Inspector Weymouth 
1614-13785-0043	train-other-500	lay passive upon the couch in his own sitting room A great wonder possessed my mind for the genius of the uncanny being who with the scratch of a needle had made a brave and kindly man into this unclean brutish thing
1614-13785-0044	train-other-500	Nayland Smith gaunt and wild eyed and trembling yet with his tremendous exertions turned to the man whom I knew to be the messenger from Scotland Yard Well he rapped He is arrested sir the detective reported
none	none	 They have kept him at his chambers as you ordered 
1614-13785-0045	train-other-500	Has she slept through it said Smith to me
none	none	 I had just returned from a visit to the room above I nodded Is HE safe for an hour or two indicating the figure on the couch For eight or ten I replied grimly Come then Our night s labors are not nearly complete CHAPTER XXX LATER was forthcoming evidence to show that poor Weymouth had lived a wild life in hiding among the thick bushes of the tract of land which lay between the village and the suburb on the neighboring hill Literally he had returned to primitive savagery and some of his food had been that of the lower animals though he had not scrupled to steal as we learned when his lair was discovered He had hidden himself cunningly but witnesses appeared who had seen him in the dusk and fled from him They never learned that the object of their fear was Inspector John Weymouth How having escaped death in the Thames he had crossed London unobserved we never knew but his trick of knocking upon his own door at half past two each morning a sort of dawning of sanity mysteriously linked with old custom will be a familiar class of symptom to all students of alienation I revert to the night when Smith solved the mystery of the knocking In a car which he had in waiting at the end of the village we sped through the deserted streets to New Inn Court I who had followed Nayland Smith through the failures and successes of his mission knew that to night he had surpassed himself had justified the confidence placed in him by the highest authorities We were admitted to an untidy room that of a student a traveler and a crank by a plain clothes officer Amid picturesque and disordered fragments of a hundred ages in a great carven chair placed before a towering statue of the Buddha sat a hand cuffed man His white hair and beard were patriarchal his pose had great dignity But his expression was entirely masked by the smoked glasses which he wore Two other detectives were guarding the prisoner We arrested Professor Jenner Monde as he came in sir reported the man who had opened the door He has made no statement I hope there isn t a mistake I hope not rapped Smith He strode across the room He was consumed by a fever of excitement Almost savagely he tore away the beard tore off the snowy wig dashed the smoked glasses upon the floor A great high brow was revealed and green malignant eyes which fixed themselves upon him with an expression I never can forget IT WAS doctor FU MANCHU One intense moment of silence ensued of silence which seemed to throb Then What have you done with Professor Monde demanded Smith doctor Fu Manchu showed his even yellow teeth in the singularly evil smile which I knew so well A manacled prisoner he sat as unruffled as a judge upon the bench In truth and in justice I am compelled to say that Fu Manchu was absolutely fearless He has been detained in China he replied in smooth sibilant tones by affairs of great urgency His well known personality and ungregarious habits have served me well here Smith I could see was undetermined how to act he stood tugging at his ear and glancing from the impassive Chinaman to the wondering detectives What are we to do sir one of them asked Leave doctor Petrie and myself alone with the prisoner until I call you The three withdrew I divined now what was coming Can you restore Weymouth s sanity rapped Smith abruptly I cannot save you from the hangman nor his fists clenched convulsively would I if I could but Fu Manchu fixed his brilliant eyes upon him Say no more mister Smith he interrupted you misunderstand me I do not quarrel with that but what I have done from conviction and what I have done of necessity are separated are seas apart The brave Inspector Weymouth I wounded with a poisoned needle in self defense but I regret his condition as greatly as you do I respect such a man There is an antidote to the poison of the needle Name it said Smith Fu Manchu smiled again Useless he replied I alone can prepare it My secrets shall die with me I will make a sane man of Inspector Weymouth but no one else shall be in the house but he and I It will be surrounded by police interrupted Smith grimly As you please said Fu Manchu Make your arrangements In that ebony case upon the table are the instruments for the cure Arrange for me to visit him where and when you will I distrust you utterly It is some trick jerked Smith doctor Fu Manchu rose slowly and drew himself up to his great height His manacled hands could not rob him of the uncanny dignity which was his He raised them above his head with a tragic gesture and fixed his piercing gaze upon Nayland Smith The God of Cathay hear me he said with a deep guttural note in his voice I swear The most awful visitor who ever threatened the peace of England the end of the visit of Fu Manchu was characteristic terrible inexplicable Strange to relate I did not doubt that this weird being had conceived some kind of admiration or respect for the man to whom he had wrought so terrible an injury He was capable of such sentiments for he entertained some similar one in regard to myself A cottage farther down the village street than Weymouth s was vacant and in the early dawn of that morning became the scene of outre happenings Poor Weymouth still in a comatose condition we removed there Smith having secured the key from the astonished agent I suppose so strange a specialist never visited a patient before certainly not under such conditions For into the cottage which had been entirely surrounded by a ring of police doctor Fu Manchu was admitted from the closed car in which his work of healing complete he was to be borne to prison to death Law and justice were suspended by my royally empowered friend that the enemy of the white race might heal one of those who had hunted him down No curious audience was present for sunrise was not yet come no concourse of excited students followed the hand of the Master but within that surrounded cottage was performed one of those miracles of science which in other circumstances had made the fame of doctor Fu Manchu to live forever Inspector Weymouth dazed disheveled clutching his head as a man who has passed through the Valley of the Shadow but sane sane walked out into the porch He looked towards us his eyes wild but not with the fearsome wildness of insanity mister Smith he cried and staggered down the path doctor Petrie What There came a deafening explosion From EVERY visible window of the deserted cottage flames burst forth QUICK Smith s voice rose almost to a scream into the house He raced up the path past Inspector Weymouth who stood swaying there like a drunken man I was close upon his heels Behind me came the police The door was impassable Already it vomited a deathly heat borne upon stifling fumes like those of the mouth of the Pit We burst a window The room within was a furnace My God cried someone This is supernatural Listen cried another Listen The crowd which a fire can conjure up at any hour of day or night out of the void of nowhere was gathering already But upon all descended a pall of silence From the heat of the holocaust a voice proclaimed itself a voice raised not in anguish but in TRIUMPH It chanted barbarically and was still The abnormal flames rose higher leaping forth from every window The alarm said Smith hoarsely Call up the brigade I come to the close of my chronicle and feel that I betray a trust the trust of my reader For having limned in the colors at my command the fiendish Chinese doctor I am unable to conclude my task as I should desire unable with any consciousness of finality to write Finis to the end of my narrative It seems to me sometimes that my pen is but temporarily idle that I have but dealt with a single phase of a movement having a hundred phases One sequel I hope for and against all the promptings of logic and Western bias If my hope shall be realized I cannot at this time pretend to state The future mid its many secrets holds this precious one from me I ask you then to absolve me from the charge of ill completing my work for any curiosity with which this narrative may leave the reader burdened is shared by the writer With intent I have rushed you from the chambers of Professor Jenner Monde to that closing episode at the deserted cottage I have made the pace hot in order to impart to these last pages of my account something of the breathless scurry which characterized those happenings My canvas may seem sketchy it is my impression of the reality No hard details remain in my mind of the dealings of that night Fu Manchu arrested Fu Manchu manacled entering the cottage on his mission of healing Weymouth miraculously rendered sane coming forth the place in flames And then To a shell the cottage burned with an incredible rapidity which pointed to some hidden agency to a shell about ashes which held NO TRACE OF HUMAN BONES It has been asked of me Was there no possibility of Fu Manchu s having eluded us in the ensuing confusion Was there no loophole of escape I reply that so far as I was able to judge a rat could scarce have quitted the building undetected Yet that Fu Manchu had in some incomprehensible manner and by some mysterious agency produced those abnormal flames I cannot doubt Did he voluntarily ignite his own funeral pyre As I write there lies before me a soiled and creased sheet of vellum It bears some lines traced in a cramped peculiar and all but illegible hand This fragment was found by Inspector Weymouth to this day a man mentally sound in a pocket of his ragged garments When it was written I leave you to judge How it came to be where Weymouth found it calls for no explanation To mister Commissioner NAYLAND SMITH and doctor PETRIE Greeting I am recalled home by One who may not be denied In much that I came to do I have failed Much that I have done I would undo some little I have undone Out of fire I came the smoldering fire of a thing one day to be a consuming flame in fire I go Seek not my ashes I am the lord of the fires Farewell FU MANCHU Who has been with me in my several meetings with the man who penned that message I leave to adjudge if it be the letter of a madman bent upon self destruction by strange means or the gibe of a preternaturally clever scientist and the most elusive being ever born of the land of mystery China For the present I can aid you no more in the forming of your verdict A day may come though I pray it do not when I shall be able to throw new light upon much that is dark in this matter That day so far as I can judge could only dawn in the event of the Chinaman s survival therefore I pray that the veil be never lifted But as I have said there is another sequel to this story which I can contemplate with a different countenance How then shall I conclude this very unsatisfactory account Shall I tell you finally of my parting with lovely dark eyed Karamaneh on board the liner which was to bear her to Egypt No let me instead conclude with the words of Nayland Smith I sail for Burma in a fortnight Petrie I have leave to break my journey at the Ditch How would a run up the Nile fit your programme Bit
