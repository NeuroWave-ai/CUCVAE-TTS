To Jack London CHAPTER I I am said Reggie Mann quite beside myself to meet this Lucy Dupree Who told you about her asked Allan Montague Ollie s been telling everybody about her said Reggie It sounds really wonderful But I fear he must have exaggerated People seem to develop a tendency to exaggeration said Montague when they talk about Lucy I am in quite a state about her said Reggie Allan Montague looked at him and smiled There were no visible signs of agitation about Reggie He had come to take Alice to church and he was exquisitely groomed and perfumed and wore a wonderful scarlet orchid in his buttonhole Montague lounging back in a big leather chair and watching him smiled to himself at the thought that Reggie regarded Lucy as a new kind of flower with which he might parade down the Avenue and attract attention Is she large or small asked Reggie She is about your size said Montague which was very small indeed Alice entered at this moment in a new spring costume Reggie sprang to his feet and greeted her with his inevitable effusiveness When he asked Do you know her too Who Lucy asked Alice I went to school with her Judge Dupree s plantation was next to ours said Montague We all grew up together There was hardly a day that I did not see her until she was married said Alice She was married at seventeen you know to a man much older than herself We have never seen her since that added the other She has lived in New Orleans And only twenty two now exclaimed Reggie All the wisdom of a widow and the graces of an ingenue And he raised his hands with a gesture of admiration Has she got money he asked She had enough for New Orleans was the reply I don t know about New York Ah well he said meditatively there s plenty of money lying about He took Alice away to her devotions leaving Montague to the memories which the mention of Lucy Dupree awakened Allan Montague had been in love with Lucy a half a dozen times in his life it had begun when she was a babe in arms and continued intermittently until her marriage Lucy was a beauty of the creole type with raven black hair and gorgeous colouring and Allan carried with him everywhere the face of joy with the quick mobile features across which tears and laughter chased like April showers across the sky Lucy was a tiny creature as he had said but she was a well spring of abounding energy She had been the life of a lonely household from the first hour and all who came near her yielded to her spell Allan remembered one occasion when he had entered the house and seen the grave and venerable chief justice of the State down upon his hands and knees with Lucy on his back She was a born actress everybody said When she was no more than four she would lie in bed when she should have been asleep and tell herself tragic stories to make her weep Before long she had discovered several chests full of the clothes which her mother had worn in the days when she was a belle of the old plantation society and then Lucy would have tableaus and theatricals and would astonish all beholders in the role of an Oriental princess or a Queen of the Night Her mother had died when she was very young and she had grown up with only her father for a companion Judge Dupree was one of the rich men of the neighbourhood and he lavished everything upon his daughter but people had said that Lucy would suffer for the lack of a woman s care and the prophecy had been tragically fulfilled There had come a man much older than herself but with a glamour of romance about him and the wonder of love had suddenly revealed itself to Lucy and swept her away as no emotion had ever done before One day she disappeared and Montague had never seen her again He knew that she had gone to New Orleans to live and he heard rumours that she was very unhappy that her husband was a spendthrift and a rake Scarcely a year after her marriage Montague heard the story of his death by an accident while driving He had heard no more until a short time after his coming to New York when the home papers had reported the death of Judge Dupree And then a week or so ago had come a letter from Lucy to his brother Oliver Montague saying that she was coming to New York perhaps to live permanently and asking him to meet her and to engage accommodations for her in some hotel Montague wondered what she would be like when he saw her again He wondered what five years of suffering and experience would have done for her whether it would have weakened her enthusiasm and dried up her springs of joy Lucy grown serious was something that was difficult for him to imagine And then again would come a mood of doubt when he distrusted the thrill which the memory of her brought Would she be able to maintain her spell in competition with what life had brought him since His revery was broken by Oliver who came in to ask him if he wished to go to meet her Those Southern trains are always several hours late he said I told my man to go over and phone me You are to have her in charge said Montague you had better see her first Tell her I will come in the evening And so he went to the great apartment hotel the same to which Oliver had originally introduced him And there was Lucy She was just the same He could see it in an instant there was the same joyfulness the same eagerness there was the same beauty which had made men s hearts leap up There was not a line of care upon her features she was like a perfect flower come to its fulness She came to him with both her hands outstretched Allan she cried Allan I am so glad to see you And she caught his hands in hers and stood and gazed at him My how big you have grown and how serious Isn t he splendid Ollie Oliver stood by watching He smiled drily He is a trifle too epic for me he said Oh my how wonderful it seems to see you she exclaimed It makes me think of fifty things at once We must sit down and have a long talk It will take me all night to ask you all the questions I have to Lucy was in mourning for her father but she had contrived to make her costume serve as a frame for her beauty She seemed like a flaming ruby against a background of black velvet Tell me how you have been she rushed on And what has happened to you up here How is your mother Just the same said Montague she wants you to come around to morrow morning I will said Lucy the first thing before I go anywhere And Mammy Lucy How is Mammy Lucy She is well he replied She s beside herself to see you Tell her I am coming said she I would rather see Mammy Lucy than the Brooklyn Bridge She led him to a seat placed herself opposite him devouring him with her eyes It makes me seem like a girl again to see you she said Do you count yourself aged asked Montague laughing Oh I feel old said Lucy with a sudden look of fear you have no idea Allan But I don t want anybody to know about it And then she cried eagerly Do you remember the swing in the orchard And do you remember the pool where the big alligator lived And the persimmons And Old Joe Allan Montague remembered all these things in the course of the half hour that followed he remembered pretty nearly all the exciting adventures which he and Oliver and Lucy had had since Lucy was old enough to walk And he told her the latest news about all their neighbours and about all the servants whom she remembered He told her also about his father s death and how the house had been burned and how they had sold the plantation and come North And how are you doing Allan she asked I am practising law he said I m not making a fortune but I m managing to pay my bills That is more than some other people do in this city I should imagine it said Lucy With all that row of shops on Fifth Avenue Oh I know I shall spend all that I own in the first week And this hotel why it s perfectly frightful Oliver has told you the prices has he said Montague with a laugh He has taken my breath away said Lucy How am I ever to manage such things You will have to settle that with him said Montague He has taken charge and he doesn t want me to interfere But I want your advice said Lucy You are a business man and Ollie never was anything but a boy Ollie has learned a good deal since he has been in New York the other responded I can tell you my side of the case very quickly he went on after a moment s pause He brought me here and persuaded me that this was how I ought to live if I wanted to get into Society I tried it for a while but I found that I did not like the things I had to do and so I quit You will find us in an apartment a couple of blocks farther from Fifth Avenue and we only pay about one tenth as much for it And now whether you follow me or Ollie depends upon whether you want to get into Society Lucy wrinkled her brows in thought I didn t come to New York to bury myself in a boarding house she said I do want to meet people Well said Montague Oliver knows a lot of them and he will introduce you Perhaps you will like them I don t know I am sure you won t have any difficulty in making them like you Thank you sir said Lucy You are as ingenuous as ever I don t want to say anything to spoil your pleasure said the other You will find out about matters for yourself But I feel like telling you this don t you be too ingenuous You can t trust people quite so freely here as you did at home Thank you said Lucy Ollie has already been lecturing me I had no idea it was such a serious matter to come to New York I told him that widows were commonly supposed to know how to take care of themselves I had a rather bad time of it myself getting adjusted to things said Montague smiling So you must make allowances for my forebodings I ve told Lucy a little about it put in Oliver drily He told me a most fascinating love story said Lucy gazing at him with a mischievous twinkle in her eyes I shall certainly look out for the dazzling missus Winnie You may meet her to morrow night put in Oliver You are invited to dinner at missus Billy Alden s I have read about missus Billy in the newspapers said Lucy But I never expected to meet her How in the world has Oliver managed to jump so into the midst of things Oliver undertook to explain and Montague sat by smiling to himself over his brother s carefully expurgated account of his own social career Oliver had evidently laid his plans to take charge of Lucy and to escort her to a high seat upon the platform of Society But tell me all this will cost so much money Lucy protested And I don t want to have to marry one of these terrible millionaires She turned to Montague abruptly Have you got an office somewhere down town she asked And may I come to morrow and see you and get you to be my business adviser Old mister Holmes is dead you know He used to be father s lawyer and he knew all about my affairs He never thought it worth while to explain anything to me so now I don t know very well what I have or what I can do I will do all I can to help you Montague answered And you must be very severe with me Lucy continued and not let me spend too much money or make any blunders That was the way mister Holmes used to do and since he is dead I have positively been afraid to trust myself about If I am to play that part for you said Montague laughing I am afraid we ll very soon clash with my brother Montague had very little confidence in his ability to fill the part As he watched Lucy he had a sense of tragedy impending He knew enough to feel sure that Lucy was not rich according to New York standards of wealth and he felt that the lure of the city was already upon her She was dazzled by the vision of automobiles and shops and hotels and theatres and all the wonders which these held out to her She had come with all her generous enthusiasms and she was hungry with a terrible hunger for life Montague had been through the mill and he saw ahead so clearly that it was impossible for him not to try to guide her and to save her from the worst of her mistakes Hence arose a strange relationship between them from the beginning Lucy made him her confidant and told him all her troubles To be sure she never took his advice she would say with her pretty laugh that she did not want him to keep her out of trouble but only to sympathise with her afterwards And Montague followed her he told himself again and again that there was no excuse for Lucy but all the while he was making excuses She went over the next morning to see Oliver s mother and Mammy Lucy who had been named after her grandmother Then in the afternoon she went shopping with Alice declaring that it was impossible for her to appear anywhere in New York until she had made herself respectable And then in the evening Montague called for her and took her to missus Billy Alden s Fifth Avenue palace On the way he beguiled the time by telling her about the terrible missus Billy and her terrible tongue and about the war between the great lady and her relatives the Wallings You must not be surprised he said if she pins you in a corner and asks all about you missus Billy is a privileged character and the conventions do not apply to her Montague had come to take the Alden magnificence as a matter of course by this time but he felt Lucy thrill with excitement at the vision of the Doge s palace with its black marble carvings and its lackeys in scarlet and gold Then came missus Billy herself resplendent in dark purple brocade with a few ropes of pearls flung about her neck She was almost tall enough to look over the top of Lucy s head and she stood away a little so as to look at her comfortably I tried to have missus Winnie here for you she said to Montague as she placed him at her right hand But she was not able to come so you will have to make out with me Have you many more beauties like that down in Mississippi she asked when they were seated If so I don t see why you came up here You like her do you he asked I like her looks said missus Billy Has she got any sense It is quite impossible to believe that she s a widow She needs someone to take care of her just the same I will recommend her to your favour said Montague I have been telling her about you What have you told her asked missus Billy serenely that I win too much money at bridge and drink Scotch at dinner Then seeing Montague blush furiously she laughed I know it is true I have caught you thinking it half a dozen times And she reached out for the decanter which the butler had just placed in front of her and proceeded to help herself to her opening glass Montague told her all about Lucy and in the meantime he watched the latter who sat near the centre of the table talking with Stanley Ryder Montague had played bridge with this man once or twice at missus Winnie s and he thought to himself that Lucy could hardly have met a man who would embody in himself more of the fascinations of the Metropolis Ryder was president of the Gotham Trust Company an institution whose magnificent marble front was one of the sights of Fifth Avenue He was a man a trifle under fifty tall and distinguished looking with an iron grey mustache and the manners of a diplomat He was not only a banker he was also a man of culture he had run away to sea in his youth and he had travelled in every country of the world He was also a bit of an author in an amateur way and if there was any book which he had not dipped into it was not a book of which one would be apt to hear in Society He could talk upon any subject and a hostess who could secure Stanley Ryder for one of her dinner parties generally counted upon a success He doesn t go out much these busy days said missus Billy But I told him about your friend Now and then the conversation at the table would become general and Montague noticed that it was always Ryder who led His flashes of wit shot back and forth across the table and those who matched themselves against him seldom failed to come off the worse It was an unscrupulous kind of wit dazzling and dangerous Ryder was the type of man one met now and then in Society who had adopted radical ideas for the sake of being distinguished It was a fine thing for a man who had made a brilliant success in a certain social environment to shatter in his conversation all the ideals and conventions of that environment and thus to reveal how little he really cared for the success which he had won It was very entertaining at a dinner party but Montague thought to himself with a smile how far was Stanley Ryder from the type of person one imagined as the head of an enormous and flourishing bank When they had adjourned to the drawing room he capped the climax of the incongruity by going to the piano and playing a movement from some terrible Russian suite Afterwards Montague saw him stroll off to the conservatory with Lucy Dupree There were two people too many for bridge and that was a good excuse but none the less Montague felt restless during the hours that he sat at table and let missus Billy win his money After the ordeal was over and the party had broken up he found his friend sitting by the side of the fountain in missus Billy s conservatory gazing fixedly in front of her while Ryder at her side was talking You met an interesting man he said when they had got settled in the carriage One of the most extraordinary men I ever met said Lucy quickly I wish that you would tell me about him Do you know him well I have heard him talk some and I know him in a business way Is he so very rich she asked He has a few millions said he And I suppose he is turning them over very rapidly People say that he is a daring speculator A speculator exclaimed Lucy Why I thought that he was the president of a bank When you have been in New York awhile said Montague with a smile you will realise that there is nothing incompatible in the two Lucy was silent a little staggered at the remark I am told Montague added with a smile that even Ryder s wife won t keep her money in the Gotham Trust Montague had not anticipated the effect of this remark Lucy gave a sudden start His wife she exclaimed Why yes said Montague Didn t you know that he was married No said Lucy in a low voice I did not There was a long silence Finally she asked Why was not his wife invited to the dinner They seldom go out together said Montague Have they separated she asked There is a new and fashionable kind of separation was the answer They live in opposite sides of a large mansion and meet on formal occasions What sort of a woman is she asked Lucy I don t know anything about her he replied There was a silence again Finally Montague said There is no cause to be sorry for him you understand And Lucy touched his hand lightly with hers That s all right Allan she said Don t worry I am not apt to make the same mistake twice It seemed to Montague that there was nothing to be said after that CHAPTER II Lucy wanted to come down to Montague s office to talk business with him but he would not put her to that trouble and called the next morning at her apartment before he went down town She showed him all her papers her father s will with a list of his property and also the accounts of mister Holmes and the rent roll of her properties in New Orleans As Montague had anticipated Lucy s affairs had not been well managed and he had many matters to look into and many questions to ask There were a number of mortgages on real estate and buildings and on the other hand some of Lucy s own properties were mortgaged a state of affairs which she was not able to explain There were stocks in several industrial companies of which Montague knew but little Last and most important of all there was a block of five thousand shares in the Northern Mississippi Railroad You know all about that at any rate said Lucy Have you sold your own holdings yet No said Montague Father wished me to keep the agreement as long as the others did I am free to sell mine am I not asked Lucy I should certainly advise you to sell it said Montague But I am afraid it will not be easy to find a purchaser The Northern Mississippi was a railroad with which Montague had grown up so to speak there was never a time in his recollection when the two families had not talked about it It ran from Atkin to Opala a distance of about fifty miles connecting at the latter point with one of the main lines of the State It was an enterprise which Judge Dupree had planned as a means of opening up a section of country in the future of which he had faith It had been undertaken at a time when distrust of Wall Street was very keen in that neighbourhood and Judge Dupree had raised a couple of million dollars among his own friends and neighbours adding another half million of his own with a gentlemen s agreement among all of them that the road would not ask favours of Northern capitalists and that its stock should never be listed on the Exchanges The first president had been an uncle of Lucy s and the present holder of the office was an old friend of the family s But the sectional pride which had raised the capital could not furnish the traffic The towns which Judge Dupree had imagined did not materialise and the little railroad did not keep pace with the progress of the time For the last decade or so its properties had been depreciating and its earnings falling off and it had been several years since Montague had drawn any dividends upon the fifty thousand dollars worth of stock for which his father had paid par value He was reminded as he talked about all this with Lucy of a project which had been mooted some ten or twelve years ago to extend the line from Atkin so as to connect with the plant of the Mississippi Steel Company and give that concern a direct outlet toward the west The Mississippi Steel Company had one of the half dozen largest plate and rail mills in the country and the idea of directing even a small portion of its enormous freight was one which had incessantly tantalised the minds of the directors of the Northern Mississippi They had gone so far as to conduct a survey and to make a careful estimate of the cost of the proposed extension Montague knew about this because it had chanced that he together with Lucy s brother who was now in California had spent part of his vacation on a hunting trip during which they had camped near the surveying party The proposed line had to find its way through the Talula swamps and here was where the uncertainty of the project came in There were a dozen routes proposed and Montague remembered how he had sat by the campfire one evening and got into conversation with one of the younger men of the party and listened to his grumbling about the blundering of the survey It was his opinion that the head surveyor was incompetent that he was obstinately rejecting the best routes in favour of others which were almost impossible Montague had taken this gossip to his father but he did not know whether his father had ever looked into the matter He only knew that when the project for the proposed extension had been brought up at a stockholders meeting the cost of the work was found so great that it was impossible to raise the money A proposal to go to the Mississippi Steel Company was voted down because Mississippi Steel was in the hands of Wall Street men and neither Judge Dupree nor General Montague had realised at that time the hopelessness of the plight of the little railroad All these matters were brought up in the conversation between Lucy and Montague There was no reason he assured her why they should still hold on to their stock if by the proposed extension or by any other plan new capitalists could make a success of the company it would be well to make some combination with them or better yet to sell out entirely Montague promised that he would take the matter in hand and see what he could do His first thought as he went down town was of Jim Hegan Come and see me sometime Hegan had said and Montague had never accepted the invitation The Northern Mississippi would of course be a mere bagatelle to a man like Hegan but who could tell what new plans he might be able to fit it into Montague knew by the rumours in the street that the great financier had sold out all his holdings in two or three of his most important ventures He went at once to Hegan s office in the building of one of the great insurance companies downtown He made his way through corridors of marble to a gate of massively ornamented bronze behind which stood a huge guardian in uniform also massively ornamented Montague generally passed for a big man but this personage made him feel like an office boy Is mister Hegan in he asked Do you call by appointment was the response Not precisely said Montague producing a card Will you kindly send this to mister Hegan Do you know mister Hegan personally the man demanded I do Montague answered The other had made no sign as far as Montague could make out but at this moment a dapper young secretary made his appearance from the doors behind the gate Would you kindly state the business upon which you wish to see mister Hegan he said I wish to see mister Hegan personally Montague answered with just a trifle of asperity If you will kindly take in this card it will be sufficient He submitted with what grace he could to a swift inspection at the secretary s hands wondering in the meantime if his new spring overcoat was sufficiently up to date to entitle him in the secretary s judgment to be a friend of the great man within Finally the man disappeared with the card and half a minute later came back smiling effusively He ushered Montague into a huge office with leather cushioned chairs large enough to hold several people each and too large for any one person to be comfortable in There was a map of the continent upon the wall across which Jim Hegan s railroads stretched like scarlet ribbons There were also heads of bison and reindeer which Hegan had shot himself Montague had to wait only a minute or two and then he was escorted through a chain of rooms and came at last to the magnate s inner sanctum This was plain with an elaborate and studied plainness and Jim Hegan sat in front of a flat mahogany desk which had not a scrap of paper anywhere upon it He rose as the other came in stretching out his huge form How do you do mister Montague he said and shook hands Then he sat down in his chair and settled back until his head rested on the back and bent his great beetling brows and gazed at his visitor The last time that Montague had met Hegan they had talked about horses and about old days in Texas but Montague was wise enough to realise that this had been in the evening I have come on a matter of business mister Hegan he said So I will be as brief as possible A course of action which I do my best to pardon was the smiling reply I want to propose to you to interest yourself in the affairs of the Northern Mississippi Railroad said the other The Northern Mississippi said Hegan knitting his brows I have never heard of it I don t imagine that many people have the other answered and went on to tell the story of the line I have five hundred shares of the stock myself he said but it has been in my family for a long time and I am perfectly satisfied to let it stay there I am not making this proposition on my own account but for a client who has a block of five thousand shares I have here the annual reports of the road for several years and some other information about its condition My idea was that you might care to take the road and make the proposed extension to the works of the Mississippi Steel Company Mississippi Steel exclaimed Hegan He had evidently heard of that How long ago did you say it was that this plan was looked into he asked And Montague told him the story of the survey and what he himself had heard about it That sounds curious said Hegan and bent his brows evidently in deep thought I will look into the matter he said finally I have no plans of my own that would take me into that neighbourhood but it may be possible that I can think of someone who would be interested Have you any idea what your client wants for the thousand shares My client has put the matter into my hands he answered The matter was only broached to me this morning and I shall have to look further into the condition of the road I should advise her to accept a fair offer say seventy five per cent of the par value of the stock We can talk about that later said Hegan if I can find the man for you And Montague shook hands with him and left He stopped in on his way home in the evening to tell Lucy about the result of his interview We shall hear from him soon he said I don t imagine that Hegan is a man who takes long to make up his mind My prayers will be with him said Lucy with a laugh Then she added I suppose I shall see you Friday night at mister Harvey s I shan t come out until Saturday afternoon said he I am very busy these days working on a case But I try to find time to get down to Siegfried Harvey s I seem to get along with him They tell me he goes in for horses said Lucy He has a splendid stable he answered It was good of Ollie to bring him round said she I have certainly jumped into the midst of things What do you think I m going to do to morrow I have no idea he said I have been invited to see mister Waterman s art gallery Dan Waterman s he exclaimed How did that happen missus Alden s brother asked me He knows him and got me the invitation Wouldn t you like to go I shall be busy in court all day to morrow said Montague But I d like to see the collection I understand it s a wonderful affair the old man has spent all his spare time at it You hear fabulous estimates of what it s cost him four or five millions at the least But why in the world does he hide it in a studio way up the Hudson cried Lucy The other shrugged his shoulders Just a whim he said He didn t collect it for other people s pleasure Well so long as he lets me see it I can t complain said Lucy There are so many things to see in this city I am sure I shall be busy for a year You will get tired before you have seen half of them he answered Everybody does Do you know mister Waterman she asked I have never met him he said I have seen him a couple of times And Montague went on to tell her of the occasion in the Millonaires Club when he had seen the Croesus of Wall Street surrounded by an attending throng of little millionaires I hope I shan t meet him said Lucy I know I should be frightened to death They say he can be charming when he wants to replied Montague The ladies are fond of him On Saturday afternoon when Montague went down to Harvey s Long Island home his brother met him at the ferry Allan he began immediately did you know that Lucy had come down here with Stanley Ryder Heavens no exclaimed Montague Is Ryder down here He got Harvey to invite him Oliver replied And I know it was for no reason in the world but to be with Lucy He took her out in his automobile Montague was dumfounded She never hinted it to me he said By God exclaimed Oliver I wonder if that fellow is going after Lucy Montague stood for some time lost in sombre thought I don t think it will do him much good he said Lucy knows too much Lucy has never met a man like Stanley Ryder declared the other He has spent all his life hunting women and she is no match for him at all What do you know about him asked Montague What don t I know about him exclaimed the other He was in love with Betty Wyman once Oh my Lord exclaimed Montague Yes said Oliver and she told me all about it He has as many tricks as a conjurer He has read a lot of New Thought stuff and he talks about his yearning soul and every woman he meets is his affinity And then again he is a free thinker and he discourses about liberty and the rights of women He takes all the moralities and shuffles them up until you d think the noblest role a woman could play is that of a married man s mistress Montague could not forbear to smile I have known you to shuffle the moralities now and then yourself Ollie he said Yes that s all right replied the other But this is Lucy And somebody s got to talk to her about Stanley Ryder I will do it Montague answered He found Lucy in a cosy corner of the library when he came down to dinner She was full of all the wonderful things that she had seen in Dan Waterman s art gallery And Allan she exclaimed what do you think I met him You don t mean it said he He was there the whole afternoon declared Lucy And he never did a thing but be nice to me Then you didn t find him so terrible as you expected said Montague He was perfectly charming said Lucy He showed me his whole collection and told me the history of the different paintings and stories about how he got them I never had such an experience in my life He can be an interesting man when he chooses Montague responded He is marvellous said she You look at that lean figure and the wizened up old hawk s face with the white hair all round it and you d think that he was in his dotage But when he talks I don t wonder men obey him They obey him said Montague No mistake about that There is not a man in Wall Street who could live for twenty four hours if old Dan Waterman went after him in earnest How in the world does he do it asked Lucy Is he so enormously rich It is not the money he owns said Montague it s what he controls He is master of the banks and no man can take a step in Wall Street without his knowing it if he wants to And he can break a man s credit he can have all his loans called He can swing the market so as to break a man And then think of his power in Washington He uses the Treasury as if it were one of his branch offices It seems frightful said Lucy And that old man over eighty I m glad that I met him at any rate She paused seeing Stanley Ryder in the doorway He was evidently looking for her He took her in to dinner and every now and then when Montague stole a glance at her he saw that Ryder was monopolising her attention After dinner they adjourned to the music room and Ryder played a couple of Chopin s Nocturnes He never took his eyes from Lucy s face while he was playing I declare remarked Betty Wyman in Montague s hearing the way Stanley Ryder makes love at the piano is positively indecent Montague dodged several invitations to play cards and deliberately placed himself at Lucy s side for the evening And when at last Stanley Ryder had gone away in disgust to the smoking room he turned to her and said Lucy you must let me speak to you about this I don t mind your speaking to me Allan she said with a feeble attempt at a smile But you must pay attention to me he protested You really don t know the sort of man you are dealing with or what people think about him She sat in silence biting her lip nervously while Montague told her as plainly as he could what Ryder s reputation was All that she could answer was He is such an interesting man There are many interesting men said he but you will never meet them if you get people talking about you like this Lucy clasped her hands together Allan she exclaimed I did my best to persuade him not to come out here And you are right I will do what you say I will have nothing to do with him honestly You shall see It s his own fault that he came and he can find somebody else to entertain him while he s here I wish that you would tell him plainly Lucy said Montague Never mind if he gets angry Make him understand you once for all I will I will she declared And Montague judged that she carried out her promise quickly for the rest of the evening Ryder gave to entertaining the company About midnight Montague chanced to look into the library and he saw the president of the Gotham Trust in the midst of a group which was excitedly discussing divorce Marriage is a sin for which the church refuses absolution he heard Stanley Ryder exclaiming CHAPTER III A few days after these incidents Montague was waiting for a friend who was to come to dinner at his hotel He was sitting in the lobby reading a paper and he noticed an elderly gentleman with a grey goatee and rather florid complexion who passed down the corridor before him A minute or two later he happened to glance up and he caught this gentleman s eye The latter started and a look of amazement came over his face He came forward saying I beg pardon but is not this Allan Montague It is said Montague looking at him in perplexity You don t remember me do you said the other I must confess that I do not was the answer I am Colonel Cole But Montague only knitted his brows in greater perplexity Colonel Cole he repeated You were too young to remember me the other said I have been at your house a dozen times I was in your father s brigade Indeed exclaimed Montague I beg your pardon Don t mention it don t mention it said the other taking a seat beside him It was really extraordinary that I should recall you And how is your brother Is he in New York He is said Montague And your mother She is still living I trust Oh yes said he She is in this hotel It is really an extraordinary pleasure exclaimed the other I did not think I knew a soul in New York You are visiting here asked Montague From the West said the Colonel It is curious how things follow out he continued after a pause I was thinking about your father only this very day I had a proposal from someone who wanted to buy some stock that I have in the Northern Mississippi Railroad Montague gave a start You don t mean it he said Yes said the other Your father persuaded me to take some of the stock away back in the old days And I have had it ever since I had forgotten all about it Montague smiled When you have disposed of yours he said you might refer your party to me I know of some more that is for sale I have no doubt said the Colonel But I fancy it won t fetch much now I don t remember receiving any dividends There was a pause It is a curious coincidence said the other I too have been thinking about the railroad My friend missus Taylor has just come up from New Orleans She used to be Lucy Dupree The Colonel strove to recall Dupree he said Judge Dupree s daughter said Montague His brother John Dupree was the first president of the road Oh yes said the Colonel Of course of course I remember the Judge now Your father told me he had taken quite a lot of the stock Yes he was the prime mover in the enterprise And who was that other gentleman said the Colonel racking his brains The one who used to be so much in his house and was so much interested in him You mean mister Lee Gordon said Montague Yes I think that was the name the other replied He was my father s cousin said Montague He put so much money into the road that the family has been poor ever since It was an unfortunate venture said the Colonel It is too bad some of our big capitalists don t take it up and do something with it That was my idea said Montague I have broached it to one Indeed said the Colonel Possibly that is where my offer came from Who was it It was Jim Hegan said Montague Oh said the Colonel But of course he added Hegan would do his negotiating through an agent Let me give you my card said the Colonel after a pause It is possible that I may be able to interest someone in the matter myself I have friends who believe in the future of the South How many shares do you suppose you could get me and what do you suppose they would cost Montague got out a pencil and paper and proceeded to recall as well as he could the location of the various holdings of Northern Mississippi He and his new acquaintance became quite engrossed in the subject and they talked it out from many points of view By the time that Montague s friend arrived the Colonel was in possession of all the facts and he promised that he would write in a very few days And then after dinner Montague went upstairs and joined his mother I met an old friend of father s this evening he said Who was it she asked Colonel Cole he said and missus Montague looked blank Colonel Cole she repeated Yes that was the name said Montague Here is his card and he took it out Henry W Cole Seattle Washington it read But I never heard of him said missus Montague Never heard of him exclaimed Montague Why he has been at the house a dozen times and he knew father and Cousin Lee and Judge Dupree and everyone But missus Montague only shook her head He may have been at the house she said but I am sure that I was never introduced to him Montague thought that it was strange but he would never have given further thought to the matter had it not been for something which occurred the next morning He went to the office rather early on account of important work which he had to get ready He was the first to arrive and he found the scrub woman who cleaned the office just taking her departure It had never occurred to Montague before that such a person existed and he turned in some surprise when she spoke to him I beg pardon sir she said But there is something I have to tell you What is it said he There is someone trying to find out about you said the woman What do you mean he asked in perplexity Begging your pardon sir said the woman but there was a man came here this morning very early and he offered me money sir and he wanted me to save him all the papers that I took out of your scrap basket sir Montague caught his breath Papers out of my scrap basket he gasped Yes sir said the woman It is done now and then sir we learn of such things you know And we are poor women they don t pay us very well But you are a gentleman sir and I told him I would have nothing to do with it What sort of a looking man was he Montague demanded He was a dark chap sir said the other a sort of Jew like He will maybe come back again Montague took out his purse and gave the woman a bill and she stammered her thanks and went off with her pail and broom He shut the door and went and sat down at his desk and stared in front of him gasping My God Then suddenly he struck his knee with an exclamation of rage I told him everything that I knew Everything He hardly had to ask me a question But then again wonder drowned every other emotion in him What in the world can he have wanted to know And who sent him What can it mean He went back over his talk with the old gentleman from Seattle trying to recall exactly what he had told and what use the other could have made of the information But he could not think very steadily for his mind kept jumping back to the thought of Jim Hegan There could be but one explanation of all this Jim Hegan had set detectives upon him Nobody else knew anything about the Northern Mississippi Railroad or wanted to know about it Jim Hegan And Montague had met him socially at an entertainment at missus de Graffenried s He had met him as one gentleman meets another had shaken hands with him had gone and talked with him freely and frankly And then Hegan had sent a detective to worm his secrets from him and had even tried to get at the contents of his trash basket There was only one resort that Montague could think of in a case so perplexing He sat down and wrote a note to his friend Major Venable at the Millionaires Club saying that he was coming there to dinner and would like to have the Major s company And two or three hours later when sufficient time had elapsed for the Major to have had his shave and his coffee and his morning newspaper he rang for a messenger and sent the note The Major s reply was prompt He had no engagement and his stores of information and advice were at Montague s service But his gout was bad and his temper atrocious and Montague must be warned in advance that his doctors permitted him neither mushrooms nor meat It always seemed to Montague that it could not be possible for a human face to wear a brighter shade of purple than the Major s yet every time he met him it seemed to him that the purple was a shade brighter And it spread farther with every step the Major took He growled and grumbled and swore tremendous oaths under his breath and the way the headwaiter and all his assistants scurried about the dining room of the Club was a joy to the beholder Montague waited until the old gentleman had obtained his usual dry Martini and until he had solved the problem of satisfying his appetite and his doctor And then he told of his extraordinary experience I felt sure that you could explain it if anybody could said he But what is there to explain asked the other It simply means that Jim Hegan is interested in your railroad What more could you want But he sent a detective after me gasped Montague But that s all right said the Major It is done every day There are a half dozen big agencies that do nothing else You are lucky if he hasn t had your telephone tapped and read your telegrams and mail before you saw them 
4064_19132_000052_000000	train-clean-360	Montague stared at him 
none	none	aghast A man like Jim Hegan he exclaimed And to a friend A friend said the Major Pshaw A man doesn t do business with friends And besides Jim Hegan probably never knew anything about it He turned the whole matter over to some subordinate and told him to look it up and he ll never give another thought to it until the facts are laid upon his desk Some one of his men set to work and he was a little clumsy about it that s all But why did he want to know about all my family affairs Why he wanted to know how you were situated said the other how badly you wanted to sell the stock So when he came to do business with you he d have you where he wanted you and he d probably get fifty per cent off the price because of it You ll be lucky if he doesn t have a few loans called on you at your bank The Major sat watching Montague smiling at his naivete Where did you say this road was he asked In Mississippi Yes said Montague I was wondering about it said the other It is not likely that it s Jim Hegan at all I don t believe anybody could get him to take an interest in Southern railroads He has probably mentioned it to someone else What s your road good for anyway We had a plan to extend it said Montague It would take but one or two millions to carry it to the main works of the Mississippi Steel Company The Major gave a start The Mississippi Steel Company he exclaimed Yes said Montague Oh my God cried the other What is the matter Why in the world did you take a matter like that to Jim Hegan demanded Major Venable I took it to him because I knew him said Montague But one doesn t take things to people because one knows them said the Major One takes them to the right people If Jim Hegan could have his way he would wipe the Mississippi Steel Company off the map of the United States What do you mean Don t you know said the Major that Mississippi Steel is the chief competitor of the Trust And old Dan Waterman organised the Steel Trust and watches it all the time But what s that got to do with Hegan Simply that Jim Hegan works with Waterman in everything Montague stared in dismay I see he said Of course said the Major My dear fellow why don t you come to me before you do things like that You should have gone to the Mississippi Steel people and you should have gone quietly and to the men at the top For all you can tell you may have a really big proposition that s been overlooked in the shuffle What was that you said about the survey And Montague told in detail the story of the aborted plan for an extension and of his hunting trip and what he had learned on it Of course said the Major you are in the heart of the thing right now The Steel people balked your plan How do you mean asked the other They bought up the survey And they ve probably controlled your railroad ever since and kept it down But that s impossible They ve had nothing to do with it Bah said the Major How could you know I know the president said Montague He s an old friend of the family s Yes was the reply But suppose they have a mortgage on his business But 
4064_19132_000053_000001	train-clean-360	why not 
none	none	buy the road and be done with it added Montague in perplexity The other laughed I am reminded of a famous saying of Wyman s Why should I buy stock when I can buy directors It s those same people who are watching you now he continued after a pause Probably they think it is some move of the other side and they are trying to run the thing down Who owns the Mississippi Steel Company asked Montague I don t know said the Major I fancy that Wyman must have come into it somehow Didn t you notice in the papers the other day that the contracts for furnishing rails for all his three transcontinental railroads had gone to the Mississippi Steel Company Sure enough exclaimed Montague You see said the Major with a chuckle You have jumped right into the middle of the frog pond and the Lord only knows what a ruction you have stirred up Just think of the situation for a moment The Steel Trust is over capitalised two hundred per cent Because of the tariff it is able to sell its product at home for fifty per cent more than it charges abroad and even so it has to keep cutting its dividends Its common stock is down to ten It is cutting expenses on every hand and of course it s turning out a rotten product And now along comes Wyman the one man in Wall Street who dares to shake his fist at old Dan Waterman and he gives the newspapers all the facts about the bad steel rails that are causing smash ups on his roads and he turns all his contracts over to the Mississippi Steel Company which is under selling the Trust The company is swamped with orders and its plants are running day and night And then along comes a guileless young fool with a little dinky railroad which he wants to run into the Company s back door yard and he takes the proposition to Jim Hegan The Major arrived at his climax in a state of suppressed emotion which culminated in a chuckle which shook his rubicund visage and brought a series of twitches to his aching toe As for Montague he was duly humbled What would you do now he asked after a pause I don t see that there s anything to do said the Major except to hold on tight to your stock Perhaps if you go on talking out loud about your extension some of the Steel people will buy you out at your own price I gave them a scare anyhow said Montague laughing I can wager one thing said the other There has been a fine shaking up in somebody s office down town There s a man who comes here every night who s probably heard of it That s Will Roberts And the Major looked about the dining room Here he comes now he said At the farther end of the room there had entered a tall dark haired man with a keen expression and a brisk step Roberts the Silent said the Major Let s have a try at him And as the man passed near he hailed him Hello Roberts where are you going Let me introduce my friend mister Allan Montague The man looked at Montague
4064_19132_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Good evening 
none	none	sir he said How are you Venable Couldn t be worse thank you said the Major How are things with you on the Street Dull very dull said Roberts as he passed on Matters look bad I m afraid Too many people making money rapidly The Major chuckled A fine sentiment he said when Roberts had passed out of hearing from a man who has made sixty millions in the last ten years It did not appear that he had ever heard of me said Montague Oh trust him for that said the Major He might have been planning to have your throat cut to night but you wouldn t have seen him turn an eyelid He is that sort he s made of steel himself I believe He paused and then went on in a reminiscent mood You ve read of the great strike I suppose It was Roberts put that job through He made himself the worst hated man in the country Gad how the newspapers and the politicians used to rage at him But he stood his ground he would win that strike or die in the attempt And he very nearly did both you know An Anarchist came to his office and shot him twice but he got the fellow down and nearly choked the life out of him and he ran the strike on his sick bed and two weeks later he was back in his office again And now the Major s store rooms of gossip were unlocked He told Montague about the kings of Steel and about the men they had hated and the women they had loved and about the inmost affairs and secrets of their lives William H Roberts had begun his career in the service of the great iron master whose deadly rival he had afterwards become and now he lived but to dispute that rival s claims to glory Let the rival build a library Roberts would build two Let the rival put up a great office building Roberts would buy all the land about it and put up half a dozen and completely shut out its light And day and night Roberts the Silent was plotting and planning and some day he would be the master of the Steel Trust and his rival would be nowhere They are lively chaps the Steel crowd said the Major chuckling You will have to keep your eyes open when you do business with them What would you advise me to do asked the other smiling Set detectives after them Why not asked the Major seriously Why not find out who sent that Colonel Cole to see you And find out how badly he needs your little railroad and make him pay for it accordingly That is not QUITE in my line said Montague It s time you were learning said the Major I can start you I know a detective whom you can trust At any rate he added cautiously I don t know that he s ever played me false Montague sat for a while in thought You said something about their getting after one s telephone he observed Did you really mean that Of course said the other Do you mean to tell me that they could find out what goes over my phone I mean to tell you was the reply that for two hundred and fifty dollars I can get you a stenographic report of every word that you say over your phone for twenty four hours and of every word that anybody says to you That sounds incredible said Montague Who does it Wire tappers It s dangerous work but the pay is big I have a friend who once upon a time was putting through a deal in which the telephone company was interested and they transferred his wire to another branch and he finished up his business before the other side got on to the trick To this day you ll notice that his telephone is Spring though every other phone in the neighbourhood is John And mail too asked Montague Mail echoed the Major What s easier than that You can hold up a man s mail for twenty four hours and take a photograph of every letter You can do the same with every letter that he mails unless he is very careful He can be followed you understand and every time he drops a letter a blue or yellow envelope is dropped on top for a signal to the post office people But then so many persons would have to know about that Nothing of the kind That s a regular branch of the post office work There are Secret Service men who are watching criminals that way all the time And what could be easier than to pay one of them and to have your enemy listed with the suspects The Major smiled in amusement It always gave him delight to witness Montague s consternation over his pictures of the city s corruption There are things even stranger than that he said I can introduce you to a man who s in this room now who was fighting the Ship building swindle and he got hold of a lot of important papers and he took them to his office and sat by while his clerks made thirty two copies of them And he put the originals and thirty one of the copies in thirty two different safe deposit vaults in the city and took the other copy to his home in a valise And that night burglars broke in and the valise was missing The next day he wrote to the people he was fighting I was going to send you a copy of the papers which have come into my possession but as you already have a copy I will simply proceed to outline my proposition And that was all They settled for a million or two The Major paused a moment and looked across the dining room There goes Dick Sanderson he said pointing to a dapper young man with a handsome smooth shaven face He represents the New Jersey Southern Railroad And one day another lawyer who met him at dinner remarked I am going to bring a stockholders suit against your road to morrow He went on to outline the case which was a big one Sanderson said nothing but he went out and telephoned to their agent in Trenton and the next morning a bill went through both houses of the Legislature providing a statute of limitations that outlawed the case The man who was the victim of that trick is now the Governor of New York State and if you ever meet him you can ask him about it There was a pause for a while then suddenly the Major remarked Oh by the way this beautiful widow you have brought up from Mississippi missus Taylor is that the name That s it said Montague I hear that Stanley Ryder has taken quite a fancy to her said the other A grave look came upon Montague s face I am sorry indeed that you have heard it he said Why said the other that s all right He will give her a good time Lucy is new to New York said Montague I don t think she quite realises the sort of man that Ryder is The Major thought for a moment then suddenly began to laugh It might be just as well for her to be careful he said I happened to think of it they say that missus Stanley is getting ready to free herself from the matrimonial bond and if your fascinating widow doesn t want to get into the newspapers she had better be a little careful with her favours CHAPTER IV Two or three days after this Montague met Jim Hegan at a directors meeting He watched him closely but Hegan gave no sign of constraint He was courteous and serene as ever By the way mister Montague he said I mentioned that railroad matter to a friend who is interested You may hear from him in a few days I am obliged to you said the other and that was all The next day was Sunday and Montague came to take Lucy to church and told her of this remark He did not tell her about the episode with Colonel Cole for he thought there was no use disturbing her She for her part had other matters to talk about By the way Allan she said I presume you know that the coaching parade is to morrow Yes said he mister Ryder has offered me a seat on his coach said Lucy I suppose you are going to be angry with me she added quickly seeing his frown You said you would go he asked Yes said Lucy I did not think it would be any harm It is such a public matter A public matter exclaimed Montague I should think so To sit up on top of a coach for the crowds to stare at and for thirty or forty newspaper reporters to take snap shots of And to have yourself blazoned as the fascinating young widow from Mississippi who was one of Stanley Ryder s party and then to have all Society looking at the picture and winking and making remarks about it You take such a cynical view of everything protested Lucy How can people help it if the crowds will stare and if the newspapers will take pictures Surely one cannot give up the pleasure of going for a drive Oh pshaw Lucy said Montague You have too much sense to talk like that If you want to drive go ahead and drive But when a lot of people get together and pay ten or twenty thousand dollars apiece for fancy coaches and horses and then appoint a day and send out notice to the whole city and dress themselves up in fancy costumes and go out and make a public parade of themselves they have no right to talk about driving for pleasure Well said she dubiously it s nice to be noticed It is for those who like it said he and if a woman chooses to set out on a publicity campaign and run a press bureau and make herself a public character why that s her privilege But for heaven s sake let her drop the sickly pretence that she is only driving beautiful horses or listening to music or entertaining her friends I suppose a Society woman has as much right to advertise her personality as a politician or a manufacturer of pills all I object to is the sham of it the everlasting twaddle about her love of privacy Take missus Winnie Duval for instance You would think to hear her that her one ideal in life was to be a simple shepherdess and to raise flowers but as a matter of fact she keeps a scrap album and if a week passes that the newspapers do not have some paragraphs about her doings she begins to get restless Lucy broke into a laugh I was at missus Robbie Walling s last night she said She was talking about the crowds at the opera and she said she was going to withdraw to some place where she wouldn t have to see such mobs of ugly people Yes said he But you can t tell me anything about missus Robbie Walling I have been there There s nothing that lady does from the time she opens her eyes in the morning until the time she goes to bed the next morning that she would ever care to do if it were not for the mobs of ugly people looking on You seem to be going everywhere said Montague after a pause Oh I guess I m a success said Lucy I am certainly having a gorgeous time I never saw so many beautiful houses or such dazzling costumes in my life It s very fine said Montague But take it slowly and make it last When one has got used to it the life seems rather dull and grey I am invited to the Wymans to night said Lucy to play bridge Fancy giving a bridge party on Sunday night Montague shrugged his shoulders Cosi fan tutti he said What do you make of Betty Wyman asked the other She is having a good time said he I don t think she has much conscience about it Is she very much in love with Ollie she asked I don t know he said I can t make them out It doesn t seem to trouble them very much This was after church while they were strolling down the Avenue gazing at the procession of new spring costumes Who is that stately creature you just bowed to inquired Lucy That said Montague That is Miss Hegan Jim Hegan s daughter Oh said Lucy I remember Betty Wyman told me about her Nothing very good I imagine said Montague with a smile It was interesting said Lucy Fancy having a father with a hundred millions and talking about going in for settlement work Well he answered I told you one could get tired of the splurge Lucy looked at him quizzically I should think that kind of a girl would rather appeal to you she said I would like to know her very much said he but she didn t seem to like me Not like you cried the other Why how perfectly outrageous It was not her fault said Montague smiling I am afraid I got myself a bad reputation Oh you mean about missus Winnie exclaimed Lucy Yes said he that s it I wish you would tell me about it said she There is nothing much to tell missus Winnie proceeded to take me up and make a social success of me and I was fool enough to come when she invited me Then the first thing I knew all the gossips were wagging their tongues That didn t do you any harm did it asked Lucy Not particularly said he shrugging his shoulders Only here is a woman whom I would have liked to know and I don t know her That s all Lucy gave him a sly glance You need a sister she said smiling Somebody to fight for you According to Jim Hegan s prediction it was not long before Montague received an offer It came from a firm of lawyers of whom he had never heard We understand ran the letter that you have a block of five thousand shares of the stock of the Northern Mississippi Railroad We have a client on whose behalf we are authorised to offer you fifty thousand dollars cash for these shares Will you kindly consult with your client and advise us at your earliest convenience He called up Lucy on the phone and told her that the offer had come How much she asked eagerly It is not satisfactory he said But I would rather not discuss the matter over the phone How can I arrange to see you Can t you send me up the letter by a messenger she asked I could said Montague but I would like to talk with you about it and also I have that mortgage and the other papers for you to sign There are some things to be explained about these also Couldn t you come to my office this morning I would Allan she said but I have just made a most important engagement and I don t know what to do about it Couldn t it be postponed he asked No she said It s an invitation to join a party on mister Waterman s new yacht The Bruennhilde exclaimed Montague You don t say so Yes and I hate to miss it said she How long shall you be gone he asked I shall be back sometime this evening she answered We are going up the Sound The yacht has just been put into commission you know Where is she lying Off the Battery I am to be on board in an hour and I was just about to start Couldn t you possibly meet me there Yes said Montague I will come over I suppose they will wait a few minutes I am half dying to know about the offer said Lucy Montague had a couple of callers which delayed him somewhat finally he jumped into a cab and drove to the Battery Here in the neighbourhood of Castle Garden was a sheltered place popularly known as the Millionaires Basin being the favourite anchorage of the private yachts of the Wall Street flotilla At this time of the year most of the great men had already moved out to their country places and those of them who lived on the Hudson or up the Sound would come to their offices in vessels of every size from racing motor boats to huge private steamships They would have their breakfasts served on board and would have their secretaries and their mail Many of these yachts were floating palaces of incredible magnificence one upon which Montague had been a guest had a glass domed library extending entirely around its upper deck This one was the property of the Lester Todds and the main purpose it served was to carry them upon their various hunting trips its equipment included such luxuries as a French laundry a model dairy and poultry yard an ice machine and a shooting gallery And here lay the Bruennhilde the wonderful new toy of old Waterman Montague knew all about her for she had just been completed that spring and not a newspaper in the Metropolis but had had her picture and full particulars about her cost Waterman had purchased her from the King of Belgium who had thought she was everything the soul of a monarch could desire Great had been his consternation when he learned that the new owner had given orders to strip her down to the bare steel hull and refit and refurnish her The saloon was now done with Louis Quinze decorations said the newspapers Its walls were panelled in satinwood and inlaid walnut and under foot were velvet carpets twelve feet wide and woven without seam Its closets were automatically lighted and opened at the touch of a button even the drawers of its bureaus were upon ball bearings The owner s private bedroom measured the entire width of the vessel twenty eight feet and opened upon a Roman bath of white marble Such was the Bruennhilde Montague looked about him for one of the yacht s launches but he could not find any so he hailed a boatman and had himself rowed out A man in uniform met him at the steps Is missus Taylor on board he asked She is the other answered Is this mister Montague She left word for you Montague had begun to ascend but a half a second later he stopped short in consternation Through one of the portholes of the vessel he heard distinctly a muffled cry Help help And he recognised the voice It was Lucy s CHAPTER V Montague hesitated only an instant He sprang up to the deck Where is missus Taylor he cried She went below sir said the man hesitating but Montague sprang past him and down the companionway At the foot of the stairs he found himself in a broad entrance hall lighted by a glass dome above He sprang toward a door which opened in the direction of the cry he had heard and shouted aloud Lucy Lucy He heard her answer beyond the doorway and he seized the knob and tried it The door was locked Open the door he shouted There was no sound Open the door he called again or I ll break it down Suiting his action to the word he flung his weight upon it The barrier cracked and then suddenly he heard a man s voice All right Wait Someone fumbled at the knob and Montague stood crouching and watching breathlessly prepared for anything The door opened and he found himself confronted by Dan Waterman Montague recoiled a step in consternation and the other strode out and without a word went past him down the hall There was just time enough for Montague to receive one look of the most furious rage that he had ever seen upon a human face He rushed into the room Lucy was standing at the farther end leaning upon a table to support herself Her clothing was in disarray and her hair was falling about her ears her face was flushed and she was panting in great agitation Lucy he gasped running to her She caught at his arm to steady herself What is the matter he cried She turned her face away making not a sound For a minute or so he stood staring at her Then she whispered Quick let us go from here And with a sudden movement of her hands she swept her hair back from her forehead and straightened her clothing and started to the door leaning upon her friend They went up to the deck where the officer was still standing in perplexity missus Taylor wishes to go ashore said Montague Will you get us a boat The launch will be back in a few minutes sir the man began We wish to go at once said Montague Will you let us have one of those rowboats Otherwise I shall hail that tug The man hesitated but a moment Montague s voice was determined and so he turned and gave orders to lower a small boat In the meantime Lucy stood breathing heavily and gazing about her nervously When at last they had left the yacht he heard her sigh with relief They sat in silence until she had stepped upon the landing Then she said Get me a cab Allan He led her to the street and hailed a vehicle When they were seated Lucy sank back with a gasp Please don t ask me to talk Allan she said And she made not another sound during the long drive to the hotel Is there anything I can do for you he said after he had seen her safely to her apartment No she answered I am all right Wait for me She retired to her dressing room and when she came back all traces of her excitement had been removed Then she seated herself in a chair opposite Montague and gazed at him Allan she began I have been trying to think What can I do to that man I am sure I don t know he answered Why I can hardly believe that this is New York she gasped I feel as though I had got back into the Middle Ages You forget Lucy he replied that I don t know what happened Again she fell silent They sat staring at each other and then suddenly she leaned back in her chair and began to laugh Once she had started burst after burst of merriment swept over her I try to stay angry Allan she gasped It seems as if I ought to But honestly it was perfectly absurd I am sure you d much better laugh than cry said he I will tell you about it Allan the girl went on I know I shall have to tell somebody or I shall simply explode You will have to advise me about it for I was never more bewildered in my life Go ahead said he Begin at the beginning I told you how I met Waterman at his art gallery said Lucy mister David Alden took me and the old man was so polite and so dignified why I never had the slightest idea And then he wrote me a little note in his own hand mind you inviting me to be one of a party for the first trip of the Bruennhilde Of course I thought it was all right I told you I was going you know and you didn t have any objections either I went down there and the launch met me and took me on board and a steward took me down into that room and left me and a second later the old man himself came in And he shut the door behind him and locked it How do you do missus Taylor he said and before I had a chance even to open my mouth and reply he came to me and calmly put his arms around me You can fancy my feelings I was simply paralysed mister Waterman I gasped I didn t hear what he said I was almost dazed with anger and fright I remember I cried several times Let me go but he paid not the slightest attention to me He just held me tight in his arms Finally I got myself together a little I didn t want to bite and scratch like a kitchen wench I tried to speak calmly mister Waterman I said I want you to release me I love you he said But I don t love you I protested I remember thinking even then how absurd it sounded I can t think of anything that wouldn t have sounded absurd in such a situation You will learn to love me he said Many women have I am not that sort of a woman I said I tell you you have made a mistake Let me go I want you he said And when I want a thing I get it I never take any refusal understand that You don t realise the situation It will be no disgrace to you Women think it an honour to have me love them Think what I can do for you You can have anything you want You can go anywhere you wish I will never stint you I remember his going on like that for some time And fancy there I was I might as well have been in the grip of a bear You would not think it you know but he is terribly strong I could not move I could hardly think I was suffocated and all the time I could feel his breath on my face and he was glaring into my eyes like some terrible wild beast mister Waterman I protested I am not used to being treated in this way I know I know he said If you were I should not want you But I am different from other men Think of it think of all that I have on my hands I have no time to make love to women But I love you I loved you the minute I saw you Is not that enough What more can you ask You have brought me here under false pretences I cried You have taken cowardly advantage of me If you have a spark of decency in you you should be ashamed of yourself Tut tut he said don t talk that kind of nonsense You know the world You are no spring chicken Yes he did Allan I remember that very phrase And it made me so furious you can t imagine I tried to get away again but the more I struggled the more it seemed to enrage him I was positively terrified You know I don t believe there was another person on board that yacht except his servants mister Waterman I cried I tell you to take your hands off me If you don t I will make a disturbance I will scream It won t do you any good he said savagely But what do you want me to do I protested I want you to love me he said And then I began to struggle again I shouted once or twice I am not sure and then he clapped his hand over my mouth Then I began to fight for my life I really believe I would have scratched the old creature s eyes out if he had not heard you out in the hall When you called my name he dropped me and sprang back I never saw such furious hatred on a man s countenance in my life When I answered you I tried to run to the door but he stood in my way I will follow you he whispered Do you understand me I will never give you up And then you flung yourself against the door and he turned and opened it and went out Lucy had turned scarlet over the recalling of the scene and she was breathing quickly in her agitation Montague sat staring in front of him without a sound Did you ever hear of anything like that in your life before she asked Yes said he gravely I am sorry to say that I have heard of it several times I have heard of things even worse But what am I to do she cried Surely a man can t behave like that with impunity Montague said nothing He is a monster cried Lucy I ought to have him put in jail Montague shook his head You couldn t do that he said I couldn t exclaimed the other Why not You couldn t prove it said Montague It would be your word against his and they would take his every time You can t go and have Dan Waterman arrested as you could any ordinary man And think of the notoriety it would mean I would like to expose him protested Lucy It would serve him right It would not do him the least harm in the world said Montague I can speak quite positively there for I have seen it tried You couldn t get a newspaper in New York to publish that story All that you could do would be to have yourself blazoned as an adventuress Lucy was staring with clenched hands Why I might as well be living in Turkey she cried Very nearly said he There s an old man in this town who has spent his lifetime lending money and hoarding it he has something like eighty or a hundred millions now I believe and once every six months or so you will read in the newspapers that some woman has made an attempt to blackmail him That is because he does to every pretty girl who comes into his office just exactly what old Waterman did to you and those who are arrested for blackmail are simply the ones who are so unwise as to make a disturbance You see Lucy continued Montague after a pause you must realise the situation This man is a god in New York He controls all the avenues of wealth he can make or break any person he chooses It is really the truth I believe he could ruin any man in the city whom he chose to set out after He can have anything that he wants done so far as the police are concerned It is simply a matter of paying them And he is accustomed to rule in everything his lightest whim is law If he wants a thing he buys it and that is his attitude toward women He is used to being treated as a master women seek him and vie for his favour If you had been able to hold it you might have had a million dollar palace on Riverside Drive or a cottage with a million dollar pier at Newport You might have had carte blanche at all the shops and all the yachting trips and private trains that you wanted That is all that other women want and he could not understand what more you could want Montague paused Is that the way he spends his money Lucy asked He buys everything he takes a fancy to said Montague They say he spends five thousand dollars a day One of the stories they tell in the clubs is that he loved the wife of a physician and he gave a million dollars to found a hospital and one of the conditions of the endowment was that this physician should go abroad for three years and study all the hospitals of Europe Lucy sat buried in thought Allan she asked suddenly what do you suppose he meant by saying he would follow me What could he do I don t know said Allan it is something which we shall have to think over very carefully He made a remark to me that I thought was very strange she said I just happened to recall it He said You have no money You cannot keep up the pace in New York What you own is worth nothing Do you suppose Allan that he can know anything about my affairs Montague was staring at her in consternation Lucy he exclaimed What is it she cried Nothing he said and he added to himself No it is absurd It could not be The idea that it could have been Dan Waterman who had set the detectives to follow him seemed too grotesque for consideration It was nothing but a chance shot he said to Lucy but you must be careful He is a dangerous man And I am powerless to punish him whispered Lucy after a pause It seems to me said Montague that you are very well out of it You will know better next time and as for punishing him I fancy that Nature will attend to that He is getting old you know and they say he is morose and wretched But Allan protested Lucy I can t help thinking what would have happened to me if you had not come on board I can t help thinking about other women who must have been caught in such a trap Why Allan I would have been equally helpless no matter what he had done I am afraid so said he gravely Many a woman has discovered it I imagine I understand how you feel but what can you do about it You can t punish men like Waterman You can t punish them for anything they do whether it is monopolising a necessity of life and starving thousands of people to death or whether it is an attack upon a defenceless woman There are rich men in this city who make it their diversion to answer advertisements and decoy young girls A stenographer in my office told me that she had had over twenty positions in one year and that she had left every one because some man in the office had approached her He paused for a moment You see he added I have been finding out these things You thought I was unreasonable but I know what your dangers are You are a stranger here you have no friends and no influence and so you will always be the one to suffer I don t mean merely in a case like this where it comes to the police and the newspapers I mean in social matters where it is a question of your reputation of the interpretation which people will place upon your actions They have their wealth and their prestige and their privileges and they stand at bay They are perfectly willing to give a stranger a good time if the stranger has a pretty face and a lively wit to entertain them but when you come to trespass or to threaten their power then you find out how they can hate you and how mercilessly they will slander and ruin you CHAPTER VI Lucy s adventure had so taken up the attention of them both that they had forgotten all about the matter of the stock Afterwards however Montague mentioned it and Lucy exclaimed indignantly at the smallness of the offer That is only ten cents on the dollar she cried You surely would not advise me to sell for that No I should not he answered I should reject the offer It might be well however to set a price for them to consider They had talked this matter over before and had agreed upon a hundred and eighty thousand dollars I think it will be best to state that figure he said and give them to understand that it is final I imagine they would expect to bargain but I am not much of a hand at that and would prefer to say what I mean and stick by it Very well said Lucy you use your own judgment There was a pause then Montague seeing the look on Lucy s face started to his feet It won t do you any good to think about to day s mishap he said Let s start over again and not make any more mistakes Come with me this evening I have some friends who have been begging me to bring you around ever since you came Who are they asked Lucy General Prentice and his wife Do you know of them I have heard mister Ryder speak of Prentice the banker Is that the one you mean Yes said Montague the president of the Trust Company of the Republic He was an old comrade of my father s and they were the first people I met here in New York I have got to know them very well since I told them I would bring you up to dinner sometime and I will telephone them if you say so I don t think it s a good idea for you to sit here by yourself and think about Dan Waterman Oh I don t mind it now said Lucy But I will go with you if you like They went to the Prentices There were the General himself and missus Prentice and their two daughters one of whom was a student in college and the other a violinist of considerable talent General Prentice was now over seventy and his beard was snow white but he still had the erect carriage and the commanding presence of a soldier missus Prentice Montague had first met one evening when he had been their guest at the opera and she had impressed him as a lady with a great many diamonds who talked to him about other people while he was trying to listen to the music But she was as Lucy phrased it afterwards a motherly soul when one got underneath her war paint She was always inviting Montague to her home and introducing him to people whom she thought would be of assistance to him Also there came that evening young Harry Curtiss the General s nephew Montague had never met him before but he knew him as a junior partner in the firm of William E Davenant the famous corporation lawyer the man whom Montague had found opposed to him in his suit against the Fidelity Insurance Company Harry Curtiss whom Montague was to know quite well before long was a handsome fellow with frank and winning manners He had met Alice Montague at an affair a week or so ago and he sent word that he was coming to see her After dinner they sat and smoked and talked about the condition of the market It was a time of great agitation in Wall Street There had been a violent slump in stocks and matters seemed to be going from bad to worse They say that Wyman has got caught said Curtiss repeating one of the wild tales of the Street I was talking with one of his brokers yesterday Wyman is not an easy man to catch said the General His own brokers are often the last men to know his real situation There is good reason to believe that some of the big insiders are loaded up for the public is very uneasy as you know but with the situation as it is just now in Wall Street you can t tell anything The men who are really on the inside have matters so completely in their own hands that they are practically omnipotent You mean that you think this slump may be the result of manipulation asked Montague wonderingly Why not asked the General It seems to be such a widespread movement said Montague It seems incredible that any one man could cause such an upset It is not one man said the General it is a group of men I don t say that it s true mind you I wouldn t be at liberty to say it even if I knew it but there are certain things that I have seen and I have my suspicions of others And you must realise that a half dozen men now control about ninety per cent of the banks of this city Things will get worse before they get any better I believe said Curtiss after a pause Something has got to be done replied the General The banking situation in this country at the present moment is simply unendurable the legitimate banker is practically driven from the field by the speculator A man finds himself in the position where he has either to submit to the dictation of such men or else permit himself to be supplanted It is a new element that has forced itself in Apparently all a man needs in order to start a bank is credit enough to put up a building with marble columns and bronze gates I could name you a man who at this moment owns eight banks and when he started in three years ago I don t believe he owned a million dollars But how in the world could he manage it gasped Montague Just as I stated said the General You buy a piece of land with as big a mortgage as you can get and you put up a million dollar building and mortgage that You start a trust company and you get out imposing advertisements and promise high rates of interest and the public comes in Then you hypothecate your stock in company number one and you have your dummy directors lend you more money and you buy another trust company They call that pyramiding you have heard the term no doubt with regard to stocks it is a fascinating game to play with banks because the more of them you get the more prominent you become in the newspapers and the more the public trusts you And the General went on to tell of some of the cases of which he knew There was Stewart the young Lochinvar out of the West He had tried to buy the Trust Company of the Republic long ago and so the General knew him and his methods He had fought the Copper Trust to a standstill in Montana the Trust had bought up the Legislature and both political machines but Cummings had appealed to the public in a series of sensational campaigns and had got his judges into office and in the end the Trust had been forced to buy him out And now he had come to New York to play this new game of bank gambling which paid even quicker profits than buying courts And then there was Holt a sporting character a vulgar man about town who was identified with everything that was low and vile in the city he too had turned his millions into banks And there was Cummings the Ice King who for years had financed the political machine in the city and by securing a monopoly of the docking privileges had forced all his rivals to the wall He had set out to monopolise the coastwise steamship trade of the country and had bought line after line of vessels by this same device of pyramiding and now finding that he needed still more money to buy out his rivals he had purchased or started a dozen or so of trust companies and banks Anyone ought to realise that such things cannot go on indefinitely said the General I know that the big men realise it I was at a directors meeting the other day and I heard Waterman remark that it would have to be ended very soon Anyone who knows Waterman would not expect to get a second hint What could he do asked Montague Waterman exclaimed young Curtiss He would find a way said the General simply That is the one hope that I see in the situation the power of a conservative man like him You trust him then asked Montague Yes said the General I trust him One has to trust somebody I heard a curious story put in Harry Curtiss My uncle had dinner at the old man s house the other night and asked him what he thought of the market I can tell you in a sentence was the answer For the first time in my life I don t own a security The General gave an exclamation of surprise Did he really say that he asked Then one can imagine that things will happen before long And one can imagine why the stock market is weak added the other laughing At that moment the door of the dining room was opened and missus Prentice appeared Are you men going to talk business all evening she asked If so come into the drawing room and talk it to us They arose and followed her and Montague seated himself upon a sofa with missus Prentice and the younger man What were you saying of Dan Waterman she asked of the latter Oh it s a long story said Curtiss You ladies don t care anything about Waterman Montague had been watching Lucy out of the corner of his eye and he could not forbear a slight smile What a wonderful man he is said missus Prentice I admire him more than any man I know of in Wall Street Then she turned to Montague Have you met him Yes said he and added with a mischievous smile I saw him to day I saw him last Sunday night said missus Prentice guilelessly It was at the Church of the Holy Virgin where he passes the collection plate Isn t it admirable that a man who has as much on his mind as mister Waterman has should still save time for the affairs of his church And Montague looked again at Lucy and saw that she was biting her lip CHAPTER VII It was a week before Montague saw Lucy again She came in to lunch with Alice one day when he happened to be home early I went to dinner at missus Frank Landis s last night she said And who do you think was there your friend missus Winnie Duval Indeed said Montague I had quite a long talk with her said she I liked her very much She is easy to like he replied What did you talk about Oh everything in the world but one thing said Lucy mischievously What do you mean asked Montague You you goose she answered missus Winnie knew that I was your friend and I had a feeling that every word she was saying was a message to you Well and what did she have to say to me he asked smiling She wants you to understand that she is cheerful and not pining away because of you was the answer She told me about all the things that she was interested in Did she tell you about the Babubanana The what exclaimed Lucy Why when I saw her last said Montague she was turning into a Hindoo and her talk was all about Swamis and Gnanis and so on No she didn t mention them said Lucy Well probably she has given it up then said he What is it now She has gone in for anti vivisection Anti vivisection Yes said the other didn t you see in the papers that she had been elected an honorary vice president of some society or other and had contributed several thousand dollars One cannot keep track of missus Winnie in the newspapers said Montague Well she continued she has heard some dreadful stories about how surgeons maltreat poor cats and dogs and she would insist on telling me all about it It was the most shocking dinner table conversation imaginable She certainly is a magnificent looking creature said Lucy after a pause I don t wonder the men fall in love with her She had her hair done up with some kind of a band across the front and I declare she might have been an Egyptian princess She has many roles said Montague Is it really true asked the other that she paid fifty thousand dollars for a bath tub She says she did he answered The newspapers say it too so I suppose it is true I know Duval told me with his own lips that she cost him a million dollars a year but then that may have been because he was angry Is he so rich as all that asked Lucy I don t know how rich he is personally said Montague I know he is one of the most powerful men in New York They call him the System s banker I have heard mister Ryder speak of him said she Not very favourably I imagine said he with a smile No said she they had some kind of a quarrel What was the matter I don t know anything about it was the answer But Ryder is a free lance and a new man and Duval works with the big men who don t like to have trespassers about Lucy was silent for a minute her brows were knit in thought Is it really true that mister Ryder s position is so unstable I thought the Gotham Trust Company was one of the largest institutions in the country What are those huge figures that you see in their advertisements seventy millions eighty millions what is it Something like that said Montague And is not that true she asked Yes I guess that s true he said I don t know anything about Ryder s affairs you know I simply hear the gossip Everyone says he is playing a bold game You take my advice and keep your money somewhere else You have to be doubly careful because you have enemies Enemies asked Lucy in perplexity Have you forgotten what Waterman said to you Montague asked You don t mean to tell me cried she that you think that Waterman would interfere with mister Ryder on my account It sounds incredible I know said Montague but such things have happened before this If anyone knew the inside stories of the battles that have shaken Wall Street he would find that many of them had some such beginning Montague said this casually and with nothing in particular in mind He was not watching his friend closely and he did not see the effect which his words had produced upon her He led the conversation into other channels and he had entirely forgotten the matter the next day when he received a telephone call from Lucy It had been a week since he had written to Smith and Hanson the lawyers in regard to the sale of her stock Allan she asked no letter from those people yet Nothing at all he answered I was talking about it with a friend this morning and he made a suggestion that I thought was important Don t you think it might be well to find out whom they are representing What good would that do asked Montague It might help us to get an idea of the prospects said she I fancy they know who wants to sell the stock and we ought to know who is thinking of buying it Suppose you write them that you don t care to negotiate with agents But I am in no position to do that said Montague I have already set the people a figure and they have not replied We should only weaken our position by writing again It would be much better to try to interest someone else But I would like to know very much who made that offer Lucy insisted I have heard rumours about the stock and I really would like to know She reiterated this statement several times and seemed to be very keen about it Montague wondered a little who had been talking to her and what she had heard But warned by what the Major had told him he did not ask these questions over the phone He answered finally I think you are making a mistake but I will do what you wish So he sat down and wrote a note to Messrs Smith and Hanson and said that he would like to have a consultation with a member of their firm He sent this note by messenger and an hour or so later a wiry little person with a much wrinkled face and a shrewd look in his eyes came into his office and introduced himself as mister Hanson I have been talking with my client about the matter of the Northern Mississippi stock said Montague You know perhaps that this road was organised under somewhat unusual circumstances most of the stockholders were personal friends of our family For this reason my client would prefer not to deal with an agent if it can possibly be arranged I wish to find out whether your client would consent to deal directly with the owner of the stock Montague finished what he had to say although while he was speaking he noticed that mister Hanson was staring at him with very evident astonishment Before he finished this had changed to a slight sneer What kind of a trick is this you are trying to play on me the man demanded Montague was too much taken aback to be angry He simply stared I don t understand you he said You don t eh said the other laughing in his face Well it seems I know more than you think I do What do you mean asked Montague Your client no longer has the stock that you are talking about said the other Montague caught his breath No longer has the stock he gasped Of course not said Hanson She sold it three days ago Then unable to deny himself the satisfaction he added She sold it to Stanley Ryder And if you want to know any more about it she sold it for a hundred and sixty thousand dollars and he gave her a six months note for a hundred and forty thousand Montague was utterly dumfounded He could do nothing but stare It was evident to the other man that his emotion was genuine and he smiled sarcastically Evidently mister Montague he said you have been permitting your client to take advantage of you Montague caught himself together and bowed politely I owe you an apology mister Hanson he said in a low voice I can only assure you that I was entirely helpless in the matter Then he rose and bade the man good morning When the door of his office was closed he caught at the chair by his desk to steady himself and stood staring in front of him To Stanley Ryder he gasped He turned to the phone and called up his friend Lucy he said is it true that you have sold that stock He heard her give a gasp Answer me he cried Allan she began you are going to be angry with me Please answer me he cried again Have you sold that stock Yes Allan she said I didn t mean I don t care to discuss the matter on the telephone he said I will stop in to see you this afternoon on my way home Please be in because it is important And then he hung up the receiver He called at the time he had set and Lucy was waiting for him She looked pale and very much distressed She sat in a chair and neither arose to greet him nor spoke to him but simply gazed into his face It was a very sombre face This thing has given me a great deal of pain said Montague and I don t want to prolong it any more than necessary I have thought the matter over and my mind is made up so there need be no discussion It will not be possible for me to have anything further to do with your affairs Lucy gave a gasp Oh Allan He had a valise containing all her papers I have brought everything up to date he said There are all the accounts and the correspondence Anyone will be able to find exactly how things stand Allan she said this is really cruel I am very sorry he answered but there is nothing else that I can do But did I not have a right to sell that stock to Stanley Ryder she cried You had a perfect right to sell it to anyone you pleased he said But you had no right to ask me to take charge of your affairs and then to keep me in the dark about what you had done But Allan she protested I only sold it three days ago I know that perfectly well he said but the moment you made up your mind to sell it it was your business to tell me That however is not the point You tried to use me as a cat s paw to pull chestnuts out of the fire for Stanley Ryder He saw her wince under the words Is it not true he demanded Was it not he who told you to have me try to get that information Yes Allan of course it was he said Lucy But don t you see my plight I am not a business woman and I did not realise You realised that you were not dealing frankly with me he said That is all that I care about and that is why I am not willing to continue to represent you Stanley Ryder has bought your stock and Stanley Ryder will have to be your adviser in the future He had not meant to discuss the matter with her any further but he saw how profoundly he had hurt her and the old bond between them held him still Can t you understand what you did to me Lucy he exclaimed Imagine my position talking to mister Hanson I knowing nothing and he knowing everything He knew what you had been paid and he even knew that you had taken a note Lucy stared at Montague with wide open eyes Allan she gasped You see what it means he said I told you that you could not keep your doings secret Now it will only be a matter of a few days before everybody who knows will be whispering that you have permitted Stanley Ryder to do this for you There was a long silence Lucy sat staring before her Then suddenly she faced Montague Allan she cried Surely you understand She burst out violently I had a right to sell that stock Ryder needed it He is going to organise a syndicate and develop the property It was a simple matter of business I have no doubt of it Lucy said Montague in a low voice but how will you persuade the world of that I told you what would happen if you permitted yourself to be intimate with a man like Stanley Ryder You will find out too late what it means Certainly that incident with Waterman ought to have opened your eyes to what people are saying Lucy gave a start and gazed at him with horror in her eyes Allan she panted What is it he asked Do you mean to tell me that happened to me because Stanley Ryder is my friend Of course I do said he Waterman had heard the gossip and he thought that if Ryder was a rich man he was a ten times richer man Montague could see the colour mount swiftly over Lucy s throat and face She stood twisting her hands together nervously Oh Allan she said That is monstrous It is not of my making It is the way the world is I found it out myself and I tried to point it out to you But it is horrible she cried I will not believe it I will not yield to such things I will not be coward enough to give up a friend for such a motive I know the feeling said Montague I d stand by you if it were another man than Stanley Ryder But I know him better than you I believe You don t Allan you can t she protested I tell you he is a good man He is a man nobody understands Montague shrugged his shoulders It is possible he said I have heard that before Many men are better than the things they do in this world at any rate they like to persuade themselves that they are But you have no right to wreck your life out of pity for Ryder He has made his own reputation and if he had any real care for you he would not ask you to sacrifice yourself to it He did not ask me to said Lucy What I have done I have done of my own free will I believe in him and I will not believe the horrible things that you tell me Very well said Montague then you will have to go your own way He spoke calmly though really his heart was wrung with grief He knew exactly the sort of conversation by which Stanley Ryder had brought Lucy to this state of mind He could have shattered the beautiful image of himself which Ryder had conjured up but he could not bear to do it Perhaps it was an instinct which guided him he knew that Lucy was in love with the man and that no facts that anyone could bring would make any difference to her All he could say was You will have to find out for yourself And then with one more look at her pitiful face of misery he turned and went away without even touching her hand CHAPTER VIII It was now well on in May and most of the people of Montague s acquaintance had moved out to their country places and those who were chained to their desks had yachts or automobiles or private cars and made the trip into the country every afternoon Montague was invited to spend another week at Eldridge Devon s where Alice had been for a week but he could not spare the time until Saturday afternoon when he made the trip up the Hudson in Devon s new three hundred foot steam yacht the Triton Some unkind person had described Devon to Montague as a human yawn but he appeared to have a very keen interest in life that Saturday afternoon He had been seized by a sudden conviction that a new and but little advertised automobile had proven its superiority to any of the seventeen cars which he at present maintained in his establishment He had got three of these new cars and while Montague sat upon the quarter deck of the Triton and gazed at the magnificent scenery of the river he had in his ear the monotonous hum of Devon s voice discussing annular ball bearings and water jacketed cylinders One of the new cars met them at Devon s private pier and swept them over the hill to the mansion The Devon place had never looked more wonderful to Montague than it did just then with fruit trees in full blossom and the wonder of springtime upon everything For miles about one might see hillsides that were one unbroken stretch of luscious green lawn But alas Eldridge Devon had no interest in these hills except to pursue a golf ball over them Montague never felt more keenly the pitiful quality of the people among whom he found himself than when he stood upon the portico of this house a portico huge enough to belong to some fairy palace in a dream and gazed at the sweeping vista of the Hudson over the heads of missus Billy Alden and several of her cronies playing bridge After luncheon he went for a stroll with Alice and she told him how she had been passing the time Young Curtiss was here for a couple of days she said General Prentice s nephew he asked Yes He told me he had met you said she What do you think of him He struck me as a sensible chap said Montague I like him very much said Alice I think we shall be friends He is interesting to talk to you know he was in a militia regiment that went to Cuba and also he s been a cowboy and all sorts of exciting things We took a walk the other morning and he told me some of his adventures They say he s quite a successful lawyer He is in a very successful firm said Montague And he d hardly have got there unless he had ability He s a great friend of Laura Hegan s said Alice She was over here to spend the day She doesn t approve of many people so that is a compliment Montague spoke of a visit which he had paid to Laura Hegan at one of the neighbouring estates I had quite a talk with her said Alice And she invited me to luncheon and took me driving I like her better than I thought I would Don t you like her Allan I couldn t say that I really know her said Montague I thought I might like her but she did not happen to like me But how could that be asked the girl Montague smiled Tastes are different he said But there must be some reason protested Alice For she looks at many things in the same way that you do I told her I thought she would be interested to talk to you What did she say asked the other She didn t say anything answered Alice and then suddenly she turned to him I am sure you must know some reason I wish you would tell me I don t know anything definite Montague answered I have always imagined it had to do with missus Winnie With missus Winnie exclaimed Alice in perplexing wonder I suppose she heard gossip and believed it he added But that is a shame exclaimed the girl Why don t you tell her the truth I tell her laughed Montague I have no reason for telling her She doesn t care anything in particular about me He was silent for a moment or two I thought of it once or twice he said For it made me rather angry at first I saw myself going up to her and startling her with the statement What you believe about me is not true Then again I thought I might write her a letter and tell her But of course it would be absurd she would never acknowledge that she had believed anything and she would think I was impertinent I don t believe she would do anything of the sort Alice answered At least not if she meant what she said to me She was talking about people one met in Society and how tiresome and conventional it all was No one ever speaks the truth or deals frankly with you she said All the men spend their time in paying you compliments about your looks They think that is all a woman cares about The more I come to know them the less I think of them That s just it said Montague One cannot feel comfortable knowing a girl in her position Her father is powerful and some day she will be enormously rich herself and the people who gather about her are seeking to make use of her I was interested in her when I first met her But when I learned more about the world in which she lives I shrank from even talking to her But that is rather unfair to her said Alice Suppose all decent people felt that way And she is really quite easy to know She told me about some charities she is interested in She goes down into the slums on the East Side and teaches poor children It seemed to me a wonderfully daring sort of thing but she laughed when I said so She says those people are just the same as other people when you come to know them you get used to their ways and then it does not seem so terrible and far off I imagine it would be so said Montague with a smile Her father came over to meet her Alice added She said that was the first time he had been out of the city in six months Just fancy working so hard and with all the money he has What in the world do you suppose he wants more for I don t suppose it is the money said he It s the power And when you have so much money you have to work hard to keep other people from taking it away from you He certainly looks as if he ought to be able to protect himself said the girl His face is so grim and forbidding You would hardly think he could smile to look at him He is very pleasant when you know him said Montague He remembered you and asked about you said she Wasn t it he who was going to buy Lucy Dupree s stock I spoke to him about it he answered but nothing came of it 
4064_19132_000009_000000	train-clean-360	There was a moment s pause 
none	none	Allan said Alice suddenly what is this I hear about Lucy What do you mean he asked People are talking about her and mister Ryder I overheard missus Landis yesterday It s outrageous Montague did hot know what to say What can I do he asked I don t know said Alice but I think that Victoria Landis is a horrible woman I know she herself does exactly as she pleases And she tells such shocking stories Montague said nothing Tell me asked the other after a pause because you ve given up Lucy s business affairs are we to have nothing to do with her at all I don t know he answered I don t imagine she will care to see me I have told her about the mistake she s making and she chooses to go her own way So what more can I do That evening Montague found himself settled on a sofa next to missus Billy Alden What s this I hear about your friend missus Taylor she asked I don t know said he abruptly The fascinating widow seems to be throwing herself away continued the other What makes you say that he asked Vivie Patton told me said she She s an old flame of Stanley Ryder s you know and so I imagine it came directly from him Montague was dumb he could think of nothing to say It s too bad said missus Billy She is really a charming creature And it will hurt her you know she is a stranger and it s a trifle too sudden Is that the Mississippi way Montague forced himself to say Lucy is her own mistress But his feeble impulse toward conversation was checked by missus Billy s prompt response Vivie said she was Stanley Ryder s I understand how you feel continued the great lady after a pause Everybody will be talking about it Your friend Reggie Mann heard what Vivie said and he will see to that Reggie Mann is no friend of mine said Montague abruptly There was a pause How in the world do you stand that man he asked by way of changing the conversation Oh Reggie fills his place was the reply And missus Billy gazed about the room You see all these women she said Take them in the morning and put half a dozen of them together in one room they all hate each other like poison and there are no men around and there is nothing to do and how are you to keep them from quarrelling Is that Reggie s role asked the other Precisely He sees a spark fly and he jumps up and cracks a joke It doesn t make any difference what he does I ve known him to crow like a rooster or stumble over his own feet anything to raise a laugh Aren t you afraid these epigrams may reach your victim asked Montague with a smile That is what they are intended to do was the reply I judge you have not many enemies added missus Billy after a pause No especial ones said he Well said she you should cultivate some Enemies are the spice of life I mean it really she declared as she saw him smile I had never thought of it said he Have you never known what it is to get into a really good fight You see you are conventional and you don t like to acknowledge it But what is there that wakes one up more than a good vigorous hatred Some day you will realise it the chief zest in life is to go after somebody who hates you and to get him down and see him squirm But suppose he gets you down interposed Montague Ah said she you mustn t let him That is what you go into the fight for Get after him and do him first It sounds rather barbarous said he On the contrary was the answer it s the highest reach of civilisation That is what Society is for the cultivation of the art of hatred It is the survival of the fittest in a new realm You study your victim you find out his weaknesses and his foibles and you know just where to plant your sting You learn what he wants and you take it away from him You choose your allies carefully and you surround him and overwhelm him then when you get through with him you go after another And missus Billy glanced about her at the exquisite assemblage in missus Devon s Louis Seize drawing room What do you suppose these people are here for to night she asked CHAPTER IX A weekor two had passed when one day Oliver called his brother on the phone Have you or Alice any engagement this evening he asked I want to bring a friend around to dinner
4064_19132_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 Who is it inquired Montague 
none	none	Nobody you have heard of said Oliver But I want you to meet him You will think he s rather queer but I will explain to you afterwards 
4064_19132_000004_000003	train-clean-360	Tell Alice to take my word for him 
none	none	Montague delivered the message and at seven o clock they went downstairs In the reception room they met Oliver and his friend and it was all that Montague could do to repress a look of consternation The name of the personage was mister Gamble He was a little man a trifle over five feet high and so fat that one wondered how he could get about alone his chin and neck were a series of rolls of fat 
4064_19132_000006_000002	train-clean-360	His face was round like a full moon and out of it looked two little eyes like those of a pig 
none	none	It was only after studying them for a while that one discovered that they twinkled shrewdly mister Gamble was altogether the vulgarest looking personage that Alice Montague had ever met He put out a fat little hand to her and she touched it gingerly and then gazed at Oliver and his brother in helpless dismay Good evening Good evening he began volubly I am charmed to meet you mister Montague I have heard so much about you from your brother that I feel as if we were old friends There was a moment s pause Shall we go into the dining room asked Montague He did not much relish the stares which would follow them but he could see no way out of the difficulty They went into the room and seated themselves Montague wondering in a flash whether mister Gamble s arms would be long enough to reach to the table in front of him A warm evening he said puffing slightly I have been on the train all day
4064_19132_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 mister Gamble comes from Pittsburg interposed Oliver 
none	none	Indeed said Montague striving to make conversation
4064_19132_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 Are you in business there 
none	none	No I am out of business said mister Gamble with a smile
4064_19132_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 Made my pile so to speak and got out 
4064_19132_000014_000002	train-clean-360	I want to see the world a bit before I get too old 
none	none	The waiter came to take their orders in the meantime Montague darted an indignant glance at his brother who sat and smiled serenely Then Montague caught Alice s eye and he could almost hear her saying to him What in the world am I going to talk about 
4064_19132_000016_000000	train-clean-360	But it proved not very difficult to talk with the gentleman from Pittsburg 
none	none	He appeared to know all the gossip of the Metropolis and he cheerfully supplied the topics of conversation He had been to Palm Beach and Hot Springs during the winter and told about what he had seen there he was going to Newport in the summer and he talked about the prospects there If he had the slightest suspicion of the fact that all his conversation was not supremely interesting to Montague and his cousin he gave no hint of it After he had disposed of the elaborate dinner which Oliver ordered mister Gamble proposed that they visit one of the theatres He had a box all ready it seemed and Oliver accepted for Alice before Montague could say a word for her 
4064_19132_000017_000002	train-clean-360	He spoke for himself however he had important work to do and must be excused 
none	none	He went upstairs and shook off his annoyance and plunged into his work Sometime after midnight when he had finished he went out for a breath of fresh air and as he returned he found Oliver and his friend standing in the lobby of the hotel How do you do mister Montague said Gamble
4064_19132_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 Glad to see you again 
none	none	Alice has just gone upstairs said Oliver We were going to sit in the cafe awhile Will you join us
4064_19132_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes do said mister Gamble cordially 
none	none	Montague went because he wanted to have a talk with Oliver before he went to bed that night Do you know Dick Ingham asked mister Gamble as they seated themselves at a table The Steel man you mean asked Montague No I never met him We were talking about him said the other
4064_19132_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 Poor chap it really was hard luck you know 
4064_19132_000025_000002	train-clean-360	It wasn t his fault 
none	none	Did you ever hear the true story
4064_19132_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 No said Montague but he knew to what the other referred 
none	none	Ingham was one of the Steel crowd as they were called and he had been president of the Trust until a scandal had forced his resignation
4064_19132_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 He is an old friend of mine said Gamble he told me all about it 
none	none	It began in Paris some newspaper woman tried to blackmail him and he had her put in jail for three months And when she got out again then the papers at home began to get stories about poor Ingham s cutting up 
4064_19132_000027_000003	train-clean-360	And the public went wild and they made him resign just imagine it 
none	none	Gamble chuckled so violently that he was seized by a coughing spell and had to signal for a glass of water They ve got a new scandal on their hands now said Oliver
4064_19132_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 They re a lively crowd the Steel fellows laughed the other They want to make Davidson resign too but he ll fight them 
none	none	He knows too much 
4064_19132_000030_000002	train-clean-360	You should hear his story 
none	none	I imagine it s not a very savoury one said Montague for lack of something to say
4064_19132_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 It s too bad said the other earnestly 
4064_19132_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 I have talked to them sometimes but it don t do any good 
none	none	I remember Davidson one night Jim says he a fellow gets a whole lot of money and he buys him everything he wants until at last he buys a woman and then his trouble begins 
4064_19132_000032_000003	train-clean-360	If you re buying pictures there s an end to it you get your walls covered sooner or later 
none	none	But you never can satisfy a woman And mister Gamble shook his head
4064_19132_000032_000005	train-clean-360	 Too bad too bad he repeated 
none	none	Were you in the steel business yourself asked Montague politely No no oil was my line 
4064_19132_000034_000001	train-clean-360	I ve been fighting the Trust and last year they bought me out and now I m seeing the world 
4064_19132_000035_000000	train-clean-360	mister Gamble relapsed into thought again 
none	none	I never went in for that sort of thing myself he said meditatively I am a married man I am and one woman is enough for me Is your family in New York asked Montague in an effort to change the subject
4064_19132_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 No no they live in Pittsburg was the answer 
4064_19132_000037_000001	train-clean-360	 I ve got four daughters all in college 
4064_19132_000037_000002	train-clean-360	They re stunning girls I tell you I d like you to meet them mister Montague 
none	none	I should be pleased said Montague writhing inwardly But a few minutes later to his immense relief mister Gamble arose and bade him good night Montague saw him clamber laboriously into his automobile and then he turned to his brother Oliver he asked what in the devil does this mean What mean asked Oliver innocently
4064_19132_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 That man exclaimed the other 
4064_19132_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Why I thought you would like to meet him said Oliver he is an interesting chap 
none	none	I am in no mood for fooling said his brother angrily Why in the world should you insult Alice by introducing such a man to her
4064_19132_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Why you are talking nonsense exclaimed Oliver he knows the best people 
4064_19132_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Where did you meet him asked Montague 
none	none	missus Landis introduced him to me first She met him through a cousin of hers a naval officer 
4064_19132_000047_000002	train-clean-360	He has been living in Brooklyn this winter 
4064_19132_000047_000003	train-clean-360	He knows all the navy people 
none	none	What is it anyway demanded Montague impatiently Is it some business affair that you are interested in No no said Oliver smiling cheerfully purely social He wants to be introduced about you know Are you going to put him into Society by any chance asked the other sarcastically You are warm as the children say laughed his brother Montague stared at him
4064_19132_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 Oliver you don t mean it he said 
4064_19132_000052_000002	train-clean-360	 That fellow in Society 
none	none	Sure said Oliver if he wants to Why not
4064_19132_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 But his wife and his daughters exclaimed the other 
4064_19132_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh that s not it the family stays in Pittsburg 
none	none	It s only himself this time All the same Oliver added after a pause I d like to wager you that if you were to meet Jim Gamble s four prize daughters you d find it hard to tell them from the real thing They ve been to a swell boarding school and they ve had everything that money can buy them My God but I m tired of hearing about their accomplishments But do you mean to tell me the other protested that your friends will stand for a man like that Some of them will He s got barrels of money you know And he understands the situation perfectly he won t make many mistakes But what in the world does he want
4064_19132_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Leave that to him 
none	none	And you demanded Montague you are getting money for this Oliver smiled a long and inscrutable smile You don t imagine that I m in love with him I trust I thought you d be interested to see the game that s why I introduced him That s all very well said the other But you have no right to inflict such a man upon Alice
4064_19132_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh stuff said Oliver 
none	none	She ll meet him at Newport this summer anyway How could I introduce him anywhere else if I wasn t willing to introduce him here 
4064_19132_000063_000003	train-clean-360	He won t hurt Alice 
4064_19132_000063_000004	train-clean-360	He gave her a good time this evening and I wager she ll like him before he gets through He s really a good natured chap the chief trouble with him is that he gets confidential 
none	none	Montague relapsed into silence and Oliver changed the subject It seems too bad about Lucy he said
4064_19132_000064_000002	train-clean-360	 Is there nothing we can do about it 
none	none	Nothing said the other She is simply ruining herself said Oliver I ve been trying to get Reggie Mann to have her introduced to missus Devon but he says he wouldn t dare to take the risk No I presume not said Montague It s a shame said Oliver I thought missus Billy Alden would ask her to Newport this summer but now I don t believe she ll have a thing to do with her Lucy will find she knows nobody except Stanley Ryder and his crowd She has simply thrown herself away Montague shrugged his shoulders That s Lucy s way he said I suppose she ll have a good time added the other Ryder is generous at any rate
4064_19132_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 I hope so said Montague 
4064_19132_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 They say he s making barrels of money said Oliver then he added longingly My God I wish I had a trust company to play with 
4064_19132_000073_000000	train-clean-360	 Why a trust company particularly asked the other 
4064_19132_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 It s the easiest graft that s going said Oliver 
none	none	It s some dodge or other by which they evade the banking laws and the money comes rolling in in floods You ve noticed their advertisements I suppose I have noticed them said Montague He is adding something over a million a month I hear It sounds very attractive said the other and added drily I suppose Ryder feels as if he owned it all
4064_19132_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 He might just as well own it was the reply 
none	none	If I were going into Wall Street to make money I d rather have the control of fifty millions than the absolute ownership of ten
4064_19132_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 By the way Oliver remarked after a moment the Prentices have asked Alice up to Newport 
4064_19132_000079_000001	train-clean-360	Alice seems to be quite taken with that young chap Curtiss 
none	none	He comes around a good deal said Montague
4064_19132_000080_000001	train-clean-360	 He seems a very decent fellow 
4064_19132_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 No doubt said the other 
none	none	But he hasn t enough money to take care of a girl like Alice Well he replied that s a question for Alice to consider CHAPTER X ONE day a month or so later Montague to his great surprise received a letter from Stanley Ryder Could you make it convenient to call at my office sometime this afternoon it read I wish to talk over with you a business proposition which I believe you will find of great advantage to yourself I suppose he wants to buy my Northern Mississippi stock he said to himself as he called up Ryder on the phone and made an appointment It was the first time that he had ever been inside the building of the Gotham Trust Company and he gazed about him at the overwhelming magnificence huge gates of bronze and walls of exquisite marble Ryder s own office was elaborate and splendid and he himself a picture of aristocratic elegance He greeted Montague cordially and talked for a few minutes about the state of the market and the business situation in the meantime twirling a pencil in his hand and watching his visitor narrowly At last he began mister Montague I have for some time been working over a plan which I think will interest you I shall be very pleased to hear of it said Montague Of course you know said Ryder that I bought from missus Taylor her holdings in the Northern Mississippi Railroad I bought them because I was of the opinion that the road ought to be developed and I believed that I could induce someone to take the matter up I have found the right parties I think and the plans are now being worked out Indeed said the other with interest The idea mister Montague is to extend the railroad according to the old plan with which you are familiar Before we took the matter up we approached the holders of the remainder of the stock most of whom I suppose are known to you We made them through our agents a proposition to buy their stock at what we considered a fair price and we have purchased about five thousand shares additional The prices quoted on the balance were more than we cared to pay in consideration of the very great cost of the improvements we proposed to undertake Our idea is now to make a new proposition to these other shareholders The annual stockholders meeting takes place next month At this meeting will be brought up the project for the issue of twenty thousand additional shares with the understanding that as much of this new stock as is not taken by the present shareholders is to go to us As I assume that few of them will take their allotments that will give us control of the road you can understand of course that our syndicate would not undertake the venture unless it could obtain control Montague nodded his assent to this At this meeting said Ryder we shall propose a ticket of our own for the new board of directors We are in hopes that as our proposition will be in the interest of every stockholder this ticket will be elected We believe that the road needs a new policy and a new management entirely if a majority of the stockholders can be brought to our point of view we shall take control and put in a new president Ryder paused for a moment to let this information sink into his auditor s mind then fixing his gaze upon him narrowly he continued What I wished to see you about mister Montague was to make you a proposal to assist us in putting through this project We should like you in the first place to act as our representative in consultation with our regular attorneys We should like you to interview privately the stockholders of the road and explain to them our projects and vouch for our good intentions If you can see your way to undertake this work for us we should be glad to place you upon the proposed board of directors and as soon as we have matters in our hands we should ask you to become president of the road Montague gave an inward start but practice had taught him to keep from letting his surprise manifest itself very much He sat for a minute in thought mister Ryder he said I am a little surprised at such a proposition from you seeing that you know so little about me I know more than you suppose mister Montague said the other with a smile You may rest assured that I have not broached such a matter to you without making inquiries and satisfying myself that you were the proper person It is very pleasant to be told that said Montague But I must remind you also that I am not a railroad man and have had no experience whatever in such matters It is not necessary that you should be a railroad man was the answer One can hire talent of that kind at market prices What we wish is a man of careful and conservative temper and above all a man of thorough going honesty someone who will be capable of winning the confidence of the stockholders and of keeping it It seemed to us that you possessed these qualifications Also of course you have the advantage of being familiar with the neighbourhood and of knowing thoroughly the local conditions Montague thought for a while longer The offer is a very flattering one he said and I need hardly tell you that it interests me But before I could properly consider the matter there is one thing I should have to know that is who are the members of this syndicate Why would it be necessary to know that asked the other Because I am to lend my reputation to their project and I should have to know the character of the men that I was dealing with Montague was gazing straight into the other s eyes You will understand of course replied Ryder that in a matter of this sort it is necessary to proceed with caution We cannot afford to talk about what we are going to do We have enemies who will do what they can to check us at every step Whatever you tell me will of course be confidential said Montague I understand that perfectly well was the reply But I wished first to get some idea of your attitude toward the project whether or not you would be at liberty to take up this work and to devote yourself to it I can see no reason why I should not Montague answered It seems to me said Ryder that the proposition can be judged largely upon its own merits It is a proposition to put through an important public improvement a road which is in a broken down and practically bankrupt condition is to be taken up and thoroughly reorganised and put upon its feet It is to have a vigorous and honest administration a new and adequate equipment and a new source of traffic The business of the Mississippi Steel Company as you doubtless know is growing with extraordinary rapidity All this it seems to me is a work about the advisability of which there can be no question That is very true said Montague and I will meet the persons who are interested and talk out matters with them and if their plans are such as I can approve I should be very glad to join with them and to do everything in my power to make a success of the enterprise As you doubtless know I have five hundred shares of the stock myself and I should be glad to become a member of the syndicate That is what I had in mind to propose to you said the other I anticipate no difficulty in satisfying you the project is largely of my own originating and my own reputation will be behind it The Gotham Trust Company will lend its credit to the enterprise so far as possible Ryder said this with just a trifle of hauteur and Montague felt that perhaps he had spoken too strenuously No one could sit in Ryder s office and not be impressed by its atmosphere of magnificence after all it was here and its seventy or eighty million dollars of deposits were real and this serene and aristocratic gentleman was the master of them And what reason had Montague for his hesitation except the gossip of idle and cynical Society people Whatever doubts he himself might have he needed to reflect but a moment to realise that his friends in Mississippi would not share them If he went back home with the name of Stanley Ryder and the Gotham Trust Company to back him he would come as a conqueror with tidings of triumph and all the old friends of the family would rush to follow his suggestions Ryder waited awhile perhaps to let these reflections sink in Finally he continued I presume mister Montague that you know something about the Mississippi Steel Company The steel situation is a peculiar one Prices are kept at an altogether artificial level and there is room for large profits to competitors of the Trust But those who go into the business commonly find themselves unexpectedly handicapped They cannot get the credit they want orders overwhelm them in floods but Wall Street will not put up money to help them They find all kinds of powerful interests arrayed against them there are raids upon their securities in the market and mysterious rumours begin to circulate They find suits brought against them which tend to injure their credit And sometimes they will find important papers missing important witnesses sailing for Europe and so on Then their most efficient employees will be bought up their very bookkeepers and office boys will be bribed and all the secrets of their business passed on to their enemies They will find that the railroads do not treat them squarely cars will be slow in coming and all kinds of petty annoyances will be practised You know what the rebate is and you can imagine the part which that plays In these and a hundred other ways the path of the independent steel manufacturer is made difficult And now mister Montague this is a project to extend a railroad which will be of vast service to the chief competitor of the Steel Trust I believe that you are man of the world enough to realise that this improvement would have been made long ago if the Steel Trust had not been able to prevent it And now the time has come when that project is to be put through in spite of every opposition that the Trust can bring and I have come to you because I believe that you are a man to be counted on in such a fight I understand you said Montague quietly and you are right in your supposition Very well said Ryder Then I will tell you that the syndicate of which I speak is composed of myself and John S Price who has recently acquired control of the Mississippi Steel Company You will find out without difficulty what Price s reputation is he is the one man in the country who has made any real headway against the Trust The business of the Mississippi Company has almost doubled in the past year and there is no limit to what it can do except the size of the plant and the ability of the railroads to handle its product This new plan would have been taken up through the Company but for the fact that the Company s capital and credit is involved in elaborate extensions Price has furnished some of the capital personally and I have raised the balance and what we want now is an honest man to whom we can entrust this most important project a man who will take the road in hand and put it on its feet and make it of some service in the community You are the man we have selected and if the proposition appeals to you why we are ready to do business with you without delay For a minute or two Montague was silent then he said I appreciate your confidence mister Ryder and what you say appeals to me But the matter is a very important one to me as you can readily understand and so I will ask you to give me until to morrow to make up my mind Very well said Ryder Montague s first thought was of General Prentice Come to me any time you need advice the General had said so Montague went down to his office Do you know anything about John S Price he asked I don t know him very well personally was the reply I know him by reputation He is a daring Wall Street operator and he s been very successful I am told Price began life as a cowboy I understand continued the General after a pause Then he went in for mines Ten or fifteen years ago we used to know him as a silver man Several years ago there was a report that he had been raiding Mississippi Steel and had got control That was rather startling news for everybody knew that the Trust was after it He seems to have fought them to a standstill That sounds interesting said Montague Price was brought up in a rough school said the General with a smile He has a tongue like a whip lash I remember once I attended a creditors meeting of the American Stove Company which had got into trouble and Price started off from the word go mister Chairman he said when I come into the office of an industrial corporation and see a stock ticker behind the president s chair with the carpet worn threadbare in front of it I know what s the matter with that corporation without asking another word What do you want to know about him for asked the General after he had got through laughing over this recollection It s a case I m concerned in the other answered I tell you who knows about him said the General Harry Curtiss William E Davenant has done law business for Price Is that so said Montague Then probably I shall meet Harry I can tell you a better person yet said the other after a moment s thought Ask your friend missus Alden she knows Price intimately I believe So Montague sent up a note to missus Billy and the reply came Come up to dinner I am not going out And so late in the afternoon he was ensconced in a big leather armchair in missus Billy s private drawing room and listening to an account of the owner of the Mississippi Steel Company Johnny Price said the great lady Yes I know him It all depends whether you are going to have him for a friend or an enemy His mother was Irish and he is built after her If he happens to take a fancy to you he ll die for you and if you make him hate you you will hear a greater variety of epithets than you ever supposed the language contained I first met him in Washington missus Billy went on reminiscently that was fifteen years ago when my brother was in Congress I think I told you once how Davy paid forty thousand dollars for the nomination and went to Congress It was the year of a Democratic landslide and they could have elected Reggie Mann if they had felt like it I went to Washington to live the next winter and Price was there with a whole army of lobbyists fighting for free silver That was before the craze you know when silver was respectable and Price was the Silver King I saw the inside of American government that winter I can assure you Tell me about it said Montague The Democratic party had been elected on a low tariff platform said missus Billy and it sold out bag and baggage to the corporations Money was as free as water my brother could have got his forty thousand back three times over It was the Steel crowd that bossed the job you know William Roberts used to come down from Pittsburg every two or three days and he had a private telephone wire the rest of the time I have always said it was the Steel Trust that clamped the tariff swindle on the American people and that s held it there ever since What did Price do with his silver mines asked Montague He sold them said she and just in the nick of time He was on the inside in the campaign of ninety six and I remember one night he came to dinner at our house and told us that the Republican party had raised ten or fifteen million dollars to buy the election That s the end of silver he said and he sold out that very month and he s been freelancing it in Wall Street ever since Have you met him yet asked missus Billy after a pause Not yet he answered He s a character said she I ve heard Davy tell about the first time he struck New York as a miner with huge wads of greenbacks in his pockets He spent his money like a coal oil Johnny as the phrase is a hundred dollar bill for a shine and that sort of thing And he d go on the wildest debauches you can have no idea of it Is he that kind of a man said Montague He used to be said the other But one day he had something the matter with him and he went to a doctor and the doctor told him something I don t know what and he shut down like a steel trap Now he never drinks a drop and he lives on one meal a day and a cup of coffee But he still goes with the old crowd I don t believe there is a politician or a sporting man in town that Johnny Price does not know He sits in their haunts and talks with them until all sorts of hours in the morning but I can never get him to come to my dinner parties My people are human he will say yours are sawdust Sometime if you want to see New York just get Johnny Price to take you about and introduce you to his bookmakers and burglars Montague meditated for a while over his friend s picture Somehow or other he said it doesn t sound much like the president of a hundred million dollar corporation That s all right said missus Billy but Price will be at his desk bright and early the next morning and every man in the office will be there too And if you think he won t have his wits about him just you try to fool him on some deal and see Let me tell you a little that I know about the fight he has made with the Mississippi Steel Company And she went on to tell The upshot of her telling was that Montague borrowed the use of her desk and wrote a note to Stanley Ryder From my inquiries about John S Price I gather that he makes steel With the understanding that I am to make a railroad and carry his steel I have concluded to accept your proposition subject of course to a satisfactory arrangement as to terms CHAPTER XI THE next morning Montague had an interview with John S Price in his Wall Street office and was retained as counsel in connection with the new reorganisation He accepted the offer and in the afternoon he called by appointment at the law offices of William E Davenant The first person Montague met there was Harry Curtiss who greeted him with eagerness I was pleased to death when I heard that you were in on this deal said he we shall have some work to do together About the table in the consultation room of Davenant s offices were seated Ryder and Price and Montague and Curtiss and finally William E Davenant Davenant was one of the half dozen highest paid corporation lawyers in the Metropolis He was a tall lean man whose clothing hung upon him like rags upon a scare crow One of his shoulders was a trifle higher than the other and his long neck invariably hung forward so that his thin nervous face seemed always to be peering about One had a sense of a pair of keen eyes behind which a restless brain was constantly plotting Some people rated Davenant as earning a quarter of a million a year and it was his boast that no one who made money according to plans which he approved had ever been made to give any of it up In curious contrast was the figure of Price who looked like a well dressed pugilist He was verging on stoutness and his face was round but underneath the superfluous flesh one could see the jaw of a man of iron will It was easy to believe that Price had fought his way through life He spoke sharply and to the point and he laid bare the subject with a few quick strokes as of a surgeon s knife The first question was as to Montague s errand in the South There was no need of buying more stock of the road for if they got the new stock they would have control and that was all they needed Montague was to see those holders of the stock whom he knew personally and to represent to them that he had succeeded in interesting some Northern capitalists in the road and that they would undertake the improvements on condition that their board of directors should be elected Price produced a list of the new directors They consisted of Montague and Curtiss and Ryder and himself a cousin of the latter s and two other men who as he phrased it were accustomed to help me in that way That left two places to be filled by Montague from among the influential holders of the stock That always pleases said Price succinctly and at the same time we shall have an absolute majority There was to be voted an issue of a million dollars worth of bonds which the Gotham Trust Company would take also a new issue of twenty thousand shares of stock which was to be offered pro rata to the present stock holders at fifty cents on the dollar Montague was to state that his clients would take any which these stockholders did not want He was to use every effort to keep the plan secret and would make no attempt to obtain the stock holders list of the road The reason for this came out a little later when the subject of the old time survey was broached I must take steps to get hold of those plans said Price In this as well as everything else we proceed upon the assumption that the present administration of the road is crooked The next matter to be considered was the charter When I get a charter for a railroad said Price I get one that lets me do anything from building a toothpick factory to running flying machines But the fools who drew the charter of the Northern Mississippi got permission to build a railroad from Atkin to Opala So we have to proceed to get an extension While you are down there mister Montague you will see the job through with the Legislature Montague thought for a moment I don t believe that I have much influence with the Legislature he began That s all right said Price grimly We ll furnish the influence Here spoke Davenant It seems to me he said that we can just as well arrange this matter without mentioning the Northern Mississippi Railroad at all If the Steel people get wind of this we are liable to have all sorts of trouble the Governor is their man as you know The thing to do is to pass a blanket bill providing that any public service corporation whose charter antedates a certain period may extend its line within certain limits and under certain conditions and so on I think that I can draw a bill that will go through before anybody has an idea what it s about Very good said Price Do it that way And so they went from point to point Price laid down Montague s own course of procedure in a few brief sentences They had just two weeks before the stockholders meeting and it was arranged that he should start for Mississippi upon the following day When the conference was over Montague rode up town with Harry Curtiss What was that Davenant said about the Governor he asked when they were seated in the train Governor Hannis you mean said the other I don t know so very much about it but there s been some agitation down there against the railroads and Waterman and the Steel crowd put in Governor Hannis to do nothing It was rather staggering to me said Montague after a little thought I didn t say anything about it but you know Governor Hannis is an old friend of my father s and one of the finest men I ever knew Oh yes I don t doubt that said Curtiss easily They put up these fine respectable old gentlemen Of course he s simply a figure head he probably has no idea of what he s really doing You understand of course that Senator Harmon is the real boss of your State I have heard it said said Montague But I never took much stock in such statements Humph said Curtiss You d take it if you d been in my boots I used to do business for old Waterman s Southern railroads and I ve had occasion to take messages to Harmon once or twice New York is the place where you find out about this game It s not a very pleasant game said Montague soberly I didn t make the rules said Curtiss You find you either have to play that way or else get out altogether The younger man relapsed into silence for a moment then laughed to himself I know how you feel he said I remember when I first came out of college the twinges I used to have I had my head full of all the beautiful maxims of the old Professor of Ethics And they took me on in the legal department of the New York and Hudson Railroad and we had a case some kind of a damage suit and old Henry Corbin their chief counsel you know gave me the papers and then took out of his desk a typewritten list of the judges of the Supreme Court of the State Some of them are marked with red he said you can bring the case before any of them They are our judges Just fancy you know And I as innocent as a spring chicken I should think things like that would get out in the end said Montague Curtiss shrugged his shoulders How could you prove it he asked But if a certain judge always decided in favour of the railroad began Montague Oh pshaw said Curtiss Leave that to the judge Sometimes he ll decide against the railroad but he ll make some ruling that the higher courts will be sure to upset and by that time the other fellow will be tired out and ready to quit Or else here s another way I remember one case that I had that old Corbin told me I d be sure to win and I took eleven different exceptions and the judge decided against me on every single one I thought I was gone sure but by thunder he instructed the jury in my favour It took me a long time to see the shrewdness of that you see it goes to the higher courts and they see that the judge has given the losing side every advantage and has decided purely on the evidence And of course they haven t the witnesses before them and don t feel half so well able to judge of the evidence and so they let the decision stand There are more ways than one to skin a cat you see It doesn t seem to leave much room for justice said Montague To which the other responded Oh hell If you d been in this business as long as I have and seen all the different kinds of shysters that are trying to plunder the railroads you d not fret about justice The way the public has got itself worked up just at present you can win almost any case you can get before a jury and there are men who spend all their time hunting up cases and manufacturing evidence Montague sat for a while in thought He muttered half to himself Governor Hannis It takes my breath away Get Davenant to tell you about it said Curtiss with a laugh Maybe it s not so bad as I imagine Davenant is cynical on the subject of governors you know He had an experience a few years ago when he went up to Albany to try to get the Governor to sign a certain bill The Governor went out of his office and left him and Davenant noticed that a drawer of his desk was open and he looked in and there was an envelope with fifty brand new one thousand dollar bills in it He didn t know what they were there for but this was a mighty important bill and he concluded he d take a chance He put the envelope in his pocket and then the Governor came back and after some talk about the interests of the public he told him he d concluded to veto that bill Very well mister Governor said the old man I have only this to say and he took out the envelope I have here fifty new one thousand dollar bills which are yours if you sign that measure On the other hand if you refuse to sign it I will take the bills to the newspaper men and tell them what I know about how you got them And the Governor turned as white as a sheet and by God he signed the bill and sent it off to the Legislature while Davenant waited So you can see why he is sceptical about governors I suppose said Montague that was what Price meant when he said he d furnish the influence That was what he meant said the other promptly I don t like the prospect Montague responded The younger man shrugged his shoulders What are you going to do about it he asked Your political machines and your offices are in the hands of peanut politicians and grafters who are looking for what s coming to them If you want anything you have to pay them for it just the same as in any other business You face the same situation every hour Pay or quit Look Curtiss went on after a pause take our own case Here we are and we want to build a little railroad It s an important work it s got to be done But we might haunt the lobbies of your State legislature for fifty years and if we didn t put up we wouldn t get the charter And in the meantime what do you suppose the Steel Trust would be doing Have you ever thought what such things will lead to asked Montague I don t know said Curtiss I ve had a fancy that some day the business men of the country will have to go into politics and run it on business lines The other pondered the reply That sounds simple he said But doesn t it mean the overthrow of Republican institutions I am afraid it would said Curtiss But what s to be done There was no answer Do you know any remedy he persisted No I don t know any remedy said Montague but I am looking for one And I can tell you of this for a start I value this Republic more than I do any business I ever got into yet and if I come to that dilemma it will be the business that will give way Curtiss was watching him narrowly He put his hand on his shoulder That s all right old man he said But take my advice and don t let Davenant hear you say that Why not asked the other The younger man rose from his seat Here s my station he said The reason is it might unsettle his ideas He s a conservative Democrat you know and he likes to make speeches at banquets CHAPTER XII IN spite of his doubts Montague returned to his old home and put through the programme as agreed Just as he had anticipated he found that he was received as a conquering hero by the holders of the Northern Mississippi stock He talked with old mister Lee his cousin and two or three others of his old friends and he had no difficulty in obtaining their pledges for the new ticket They were all interested and eager about the future of the road He did not have to concern himself with the new charter Davenant drew up the bill and he wrote that a nephew of Senator Harmon s would be able to put it through without attracting any attention All that Montague knew was that the bill passed and was signed by the Governor And then came the day of the stockholders meeting He attended it presenting proxies for the stock of Ryder and Price and nominated his ticket greatly to the consternation of mister Carter the president of the road who had been a lifelong friend of his family s The new board of directors was elected by the votes of nearly three fourths of the stock and the new stock issue was voted by the same majority As none of the former stockholders cared to take the new stock Montague subscribed for the whole issue in the name of Ryder and Price and presented a certified check for the necessary deposit The news of these events of course created great excitement in the neighbourhood also it did not pass unobserved in New York Northern Mississippi was quoted for the first time on the curb and there was quite a little trading the stock went up nearly ten points in one day Montague received this information in a letter from Harry Curtiss You must be prepared to withstand the flatteries of the Steel crowd he wrote They will be after you before long Montague judged that he would not mind facing the Steel crowd but he was much troubled by an interview which he had to go through with on the day after the meeting Old mister Carter came to see him and gave him a feeble hand to shake and sat and gazed at him with a pitiful look of unhappiness Allan he said I have been president of the Northern Mississippi for fifteen years and I have served the road faithfully and devotedly And now I want you to tell me what does this mean Am I Montague could not remember a time when mister Carter had not been a visitor at his father s home and it was painful to see him in his helplessness But there was nothing that could be done about it he set his lips together I am very sorry mister Garter he said but I am not at liberty to say a word to you about the plans of my clients Am I to understand then that I am to be turned out of my position I am to have no consideration for all that I have done Surely I am very sorry Montague said again firmly but the circumstances at the present time are such that I must ask you to excuse me from discussing the matter in any way A day or two later Montague received a telegram from Price instructing him to go to Riverton where the works of the Mississippi Steel Company were located and to meet mister Andrews the president of the Company Montague had been to Riverton several times in his youth and he remembered the huge mills which were one of the sights of the State But he was not prepared for the enormous development which had since taken place The Mississippi Steel Company had now two huge Bessemer converters in which a volcano of molten flame roared all day and night It had bought up the whole western side of the town and cleared away half a hundred ramshackle dwellings and here were long rows of coke ovens and two huge rail mills and a plate mill from which arose sounds like the crashing of the day of doom Everywhere loomed rows of towering chimneys and pillars of rolling black smoke Little miniature railroad tracks ran crisscross about the yards and engines came puffing and clanking carrying blazing white ingots which the eye could not bear to face Opposite to the entrance of the stockaded yards the Company had put up a new office building and upon the top floor of this were the president s rooms mister Andrews will be in on the two o clock train said his secretary who was evidently expecting the visitor Will you wait in his office I think I should like to see the works if you can arrange it for me said Montague And so he was provided with a pass and an attendant and made a tour of the yards It was interesting to Montague to see the actual property of the Mississippi Steel Company Sitting in comfortable offices in Wall Street and exchanging pieces of paper one had a tendency to lose sight of the fact that he was dealing in material things and disposing of the destinies of living people But Montague was now to build and operate a railroad to purchase real cars and handle real iron and steel and the thought was in his mind that at every step of what he did he wished to keep this reality in mind It was a July day with not a cloud in the sky and an almost tropical sun blazed down upon the works The sheds and railroad tracks shimmered in the heat and it seemed as if the cinders upon which one trod had been newly poured from a fire In the rooms where the furnaces blazed Montague could not penetrate at all he could only stand in the doorway shading his eyes from the glare In each of these infernos toiled hundreds of grimy smoke stained men stripped to the waist and streaming with perspiration He gazed down the long rows of the blast furnaces great caverns through the cracks of which the molten steel shone like lightning Here the men who worked had to have buckets of water poured over them continually and they drank several gallons of beer each day He went through the rail mills where the flaming white ingots were caught by huge rollers and tossed about like pancakes and flattened and squeezed emerging at the other end in the shape of tortured red snakes of amazing length At the far end of the mill one could see them laid out in long rows to cool and as Montague stood and watched them the thought came to him that these were some of the rails which Wyman had ordered and which had been the cause of such dismay in the camp of the Steel Trust Then he went on to the plate mill where giant hammers resounded and steel plates of several inches thickness were chopped and sliced like pieces of cheese Here the spectator stared about him in bewilderment and clung to his guide for safety huge travelling cranes groaned overhead and infernal engines made deafening clatter upon every side It was a source of never ending wonder that men should be able to work in such confusion with no sense of danger and no consciousness of all the uproar Montague s eye roamed from place to place then suddenly it was arrested by a sight even unusually startling Across on the other side of the mill was a steel shaft which turned one of the largest of the rollers It was high up in the air and revolving with unimaginable speed and Montague saw a man with an oil can in his hand rest the top of a ladder upon this shaft and proceed to climb up He touched his guide upon the arm and pointed Isn t that dangerous he shouted It s against orders said the man But they will do it And even while the words of a reply were upon his lips something happened which turned the sound into a scream of horror Montague stood with his hand still pointing his whole body turned to stone Instantaneously as if by the act of a magician the man upon the ladder had disappeared and instead there was a hazy mist about the shaft and the ladder tumbling to the ground No one else in the mill appeared to have noticed it Montague s guide leaped forward dodging a white hot plate upon its journey to the roller and rushed down the room to where the engineer was standing by his machinery For a period which could not have been less than a minute Montague stood staring at the horrible sight and then slowly he saw what had been a mist beginning to define itself as the body of a man whirling about the shaft Then as the machinery moved more slowly yet and the din in the mill subsided he saw several men raise the ladder again to the shaft and climb up When the revolving had stopped entirely they proceeded to cut the body loose but Montague did not wait to see that He was white and sick and he turned and went outside He went away to another part of the yards and sat down in the shade of one of the buildings and told himself that that was the way of life All the while the din of the mills continued without interruption A while later he saw four men go past carrying a stretcher covered with a sheet It dropped blood at every step but Montague noticed that the men who passed it gave it no more than a casual glance When he passed the plate mill again he saw that it was busy as ever and when he went out at the front gate he saw a man who had been pointed out to him as the foreman of the mill engaged in picking another labourer from the group which was standing about He returned to the president s office and found that mister Andrews had just arrived A breeze was blowing through the office but Andrews who was stout was sitting in his chair with his coat and vest off vigorously wielding a palmleaf fan How do you do mister Montague he said Did you ever know such heat Sit down you look done up I have just seen an accident in the mills said Montague Oh said the other Too bad But one finds that steel can t be made without accidents We had a blast furnace explosion the other day and killed eight They are mostly foreigners though hunkies they call them Then Andrews pressed a button summoning his secretary Will you please bring those plans he said and to Montague s surprise he proceeded to spread before him a complete copy of the old reports of the Northern Mississippi survey together with the surveyor s original drawings Did mister Carter let you have them Montague asked and the other smiled a dry smile We have them he said And now the thing for you to do is to have your own surveyors go over the ground I imagine that when you get their reports the proposition will look very different These were the instructions which came in a letter from Price the next day and with the help of Andrews Montague made the necessary arrangements and the next night he left for New York He arrived upon a Friday afternoon He found that Alice had departed for her visit to the Prentices and that Oliver was in Newport also There was an invitation from missus Prentice to him to join them as Price was away he concluded that he would treat himself to a rest and accordingly took an early train on Saturday morning Montague s initiation into Society had taken place in the winter time and he had yet to witness its vacation activities When Society s belles and dames had completed a season s round of dinner parties and dances they were more or less near to nervous prostration and Newport was the place which they had selected to retire to and recuperate It was an old fashioned New England town not far from the entrance to Long Island Sound and from a village with several grocery shops and a tavern it had been converted by a magic touch of Society into the most famous and expensive resort in the world Estates had been sold there for as much as a dollar a square foot and it was nothing uncommon to pay ten thousand a month for a cottage The tradition of vacation and of the country was preserved in such terms as cottage You would be invited to a lawn party and you would find a blaze of illumination and potted plants enough to fill a score of green houses and costumes and jewelled splendour suggesting the Field of the Cloth of Gold You would be invited to a picnic at Gooseberry Point and when you went there you would find gorgeous canopies spread overhead and velvet carpets under foot and scores of liveried lackeys in attendance and every luxury one would have expected in a Fifth Avenue mansion You would take a cab to drive to this picnic and it would cost you five dollars yet you must on no account go without a cab Even if the destination was just around the corner a stranger would commit a breach of the proprieties if he were to approach the house on foot Coming to Newport as Montague did directly from the Mississippi Steel Mills produced the strangest possible effect upon him He had seen the social splurge in the Metropolis and had heard the fabulous prices that people had paid for things But these thousands and millions had seemed mere abstractions Now suddenly they had become personified he had seen where they came from where all the luxury and splendour were produced And with every glance that he cast at the magnificence about him he thought of the men who were toiling in the blinding heat of the blast furnaces Here was the palace of the Wymans upon the laying out of the grounds of which a half million dollars had been spent the stone wall which surrounded it was famous upon two continents because it had cost a hundred thousand dollars And it was to make steel rails for the Wymans that the slaves of the mills were toiling Here was the palace of the Eldridge Devons with a greenhouse which had cost one hundred and fifty thousand dollars and which merely supplied the daily needs of its owners Here was the famous tulip tree which had been dug up and brought a distance of fifty miles at a cost of a thousand dollars And Montague had seen in the making the steel for one of the great hotels of the Eldridge Devons And here was the Walling establishment the three million dollar palace on a desert as missus Billy Alden had described it Montague had read of the famous mantel in its entrance hall made from Pompeiian marble and costing seventy five thousand dollars And the Wallings were the railroad kings who transported Mississippi Steel And from that his thoughts roamed on to the slaves of other mills to the men and women and little children shut up to toil in shops and factories and mines for these people who flaunted their luxury about him They had come here from every part of the country with their millions drawn from every kind of labour Here was the great white marble palace of the Johnsons the ceilings floors and walls of its state apartments had all been made in France its fences and gates even its locks and hinges had been made from special designs by famous artists The Johnsons were lords of railroads and coal and ruled the state of West Virginia with a terrible hand The courts and the legislature were but branches of old Johnson s office and Montague knew of mining villages which were owned outright by the Company and were like stockaded forts the wretched toilers could not buy so much as a pint of milk outside of the Company store and even the country doctor could not enter the gates without a pass And beyond that was the home of the Warfields whose fortune came from great department stores in which young girls worked for two dollars and a half a week and eked out their existence by prostitution And this was the summer that Warfield s youngest daughter was launched and for her debutante dance they built a ballroom which cost thirty thousand dollars and was torn down the day afterwards And beyond this upon the cliffs was the castle of the Mayers whose fortunes came from coal Montague thought of the young man who had invented the device for the automatic weighing of coal as it was loaded upon steam ships Major Venable had hinted to him that the reason the Coal Trust would not consider it was because they were selling short weight and since then he had investigated the story and learned that this was true and that it was old Mayer himself who had devised the system And here was his palace and here were his sons and daughters among the most haughty and exclusive of Society s entertainers So you might drive down the streets and point out the mansions and call the roll of the owners kings of oil and steel and railroads and mines Here everything was beauty and splendour Here were velvet lawns and gardens of rare flowers and dancing and feasting and merriment It seemed very far from the sordid strife of commerce from poverty and toil and death But Montague carried with him the sight that he had seen in the plate mill the misty blur about the whirling shaft and the shrouded form upon the stretcher dripping blood He was so fortunate as to meet Alice and her friends upon the street and he drove with them to the bathing beach which Society had purchased and maintained for its own exclusive use The first person he saw here was Reggie Mann who came and took possession of Alice Reggie would not swim himself because he did not care to exhibit his spindle legs he was watching with disapproving eye the antics of Harry Percy his dearest rival Percy was a man about forty years of age a cotillion leader by profession and he caused keen delight to the spectators upon the beach by wearing a monocle in the water They had lunch at the Casino and then went for a sail in the Prentices new racing yacht It was estimated just at this time that there was thirty millions worth of steam and sailing pleasure craft in Newport harbour and the bay was a wonderful sight that afternoon They came back rather early however as Alice had an engagement for a drive at six o clock and it was necessary for her to change her costume before she went It was necessary to change it again before dinner which was at eight o clock and Montague learned upon inquiry that it was customary to make five or six such changes during the day The great ladies of Society were adepts in this art and prided themselves upon the perfect system which enabled them to accomplish it All of Montague s New York acquaintances were here in their splendour Miss Yvette Simpkins with her forty trunks of new Paris costumes missus Billy Alden who had just launched an aristocratic and exclusive bridge club for ladies missus Winnie Duval who had created a sensation by the rumour of her intention to introduce the simple life at Newport and missus Vivie Patton whose husband had committed suicide as the only means of separating her from her Count It chanced to be the evening of missus Landis s long expected dinner dance When you went to the Landis mansion you drove directly into the building which had a court so large that a coach and four could drive around it The entire ground floor was occupied by what were said to be the most elaborately equipped stables in the world Your horses vanished magically through sliding doors at one side and your carriage at the other side and in front of you was the entrance to the private apartments with liveried flunkies standing in state There were five tables at this dinner each seating ten persons There was a huge floral umbrella for the centrepiece and an elaborate colour effect in flowers During the dance screens were put up concealing this end of the ballroom and when they were removed sometime after midnight the tables were found set for the supper with an entirely new scenic effect They danced until broad daylight Montague was told of parties at which the guests had adjourned in the morning to play tennis All these people would be up by nine or ten o clock the next day and he would see them in the shops and at the bathing beach before noon And this was Society s idea of resting from the labours of the winter season After the supper Montague was taken in charge by missus Caroline Smythe the lady who had once introduced him to her cats and dogs missus Smythe had become greatly interested in missus Winnie s anti vivisection crusade and told him all about it while they strolled out upon the loggia of the Landis palace and stood and watched the sunrise over the bay Do you see that road back of us said missus Smythe That is the one the Landises have just succeeded in closing I suppose you ve heard the story No said Montague I haven t heard it It s the joke of Newport said the lady They had to buy up the town council to do it There was a sight seers bus that used to drive up that road every day and the driver would rein up his horses and stand up and point with his whip This ladies and gentlemen he d say is the home of the Landises and just beyond there is the home of the Joneses Once upon a time mister Smith had a wife and got tired of her and mister Jones had a wife and got tired of her so they both got divorces and exchanged and now missus Smith is living in mister Jones s house and missus Jones is living in mister Smith s Giddap CHAPTER XIII Alice was up early the next morning to go to church with Harry Curtiss but Montague who had really come to rest was later in arising Afterwards he took a stroll through the streets watching the people He was met by missus De Graffenried who after her usual fashion invited him to come round to lunch He went and met about forty other persons who had been invited in the same casual way including his brother Ollie and to his great consternation Ollie s friend mister Gamble Gamble was clad in a spotless yachting costume which produced a most comical effect upon his expansive person He greeted Montague with his usual effusiveness How do you do mister Montague how do you do he said I ve been hearing about you since I met you last In what way asked Montague I understand that you have gone with the Mississippi Steel Company said Gamble After a fashion the other assented You want to be careful you are dealing with a smooth crowd Smoother even than the men in the Trust I fancy And the little man added with a twinkle in his eye I m accustomed to say there are two kinds of rascals in the oil business there are the rascals who found they could rely upon each other and they are in the Trust and there are the rascals the devil himself couldn t rely upon and they re the independents I ought to know what I m talking about because I was an independent myself mister Gamble chuckled gleefully over this witticism which was evidently one which he relied upon for the making of conversation How do you do Captain he said to a man who was passing mister Montague let me introduce my friend Captain Gill Montague turned and faced a tall and dignified looking naval officer Captain Henry Gill of the Allegheny How do you mister Montague said the Captain Oliver Montague s brother added Gamble by way of further introduction And then espying someone else coming whom he knew he waddled off down the room leaving Montague in conversation with the officer Captain Gill was in command of one of the half dozen vessels which the government obligingly sent to assist in maintaining the gaieties of the Newport season He was an excellent dancer and a favourite with the ladies and an old crony of missus De Graffenried s Have you known mister Gamble long he asked by way of making conversation I met him once before said Montague My brother knows him Ollie seems to be a great favourite of his said the Captain Queer chap Montague assented readily I met him in Brooklyn continued the other seeming to feel that acquaintance with Gamble called for explanation He was quite chummy with the officers at the Navy Yard Retired millionaires don t often fall in their way I should imagine not said Montague smiling But I was surprised to meet him here You d meet him in heaven said the other with a laugh if he made up his mind that he wanted to go there He is a good natured personage but I can tell you that anyone who thinks that Gamble doesn t know what he s about will make a sad mistake Montague thought of this remark at lunch where he sat at table on the opposite side to Gamble Next to him sat Vivie Fatten who made the little man the victim of her raillery It was not particularly delicate wit but Gamble was tough and took it all with a cheerful grin He was a mystery which Montague could not solve To be sure he was rich and spent his money like water but then there was no scarcity of money in this crowd Montague found himself wondering whether he was there because missus De Graffenried and her friends liked to have somebody they could snub and wipe their feet upon His eye ran down the row of people sitting at the table and the contrast between them and Gamble was an amusing one missus De Graffenried was fond of the society of young people and most of her guests were of the second or even the third generation The man from Pittsburg seemed to be the only one there who had made his own money and who bore the impress of the money struggle upon him Montague smiled at the thought He seemed the very incarnation of the spirit of oil he was gross and unpleasant while in the others the oil had been refined to a delicate perfume Yet somehow he seemed the most human person there No doubt he was crudely egotistical and yet if he was interested in himself he was also interested in other people while among missus De Graffenried s intimates it was a sign of vulgarity to be interested in anything He seemed to have taken quite a fancy to Montague for reasons best known to himself He came up to him again after the luncheon This is the first time you ve been here Oliver tells me said he Montague assented and the other added You d better come and let me show you the town I have my car here Montague had no engagement and no excuse handy It s very good of you he began All right said Gamble Come on And he took him out and seated him in his huge red touring car which had a seat expressly built for its owner not too deep and very low so that his fat little legs would reach the floor Gamble settled back in the cushions with a sigh Rum sort of a place this ain t it said he It s interesting for a short visit said Montague You can count me out of it said the other I like to spend my summers in a place where I can take my coat off And I prefer beer to champagne in hot weather anyhow Montague did not reply Such an ungodly lot of snobs a fellow does meet remarked his host cheerily They have a fine time making fun of me it amuses them and I don t mind Sometimes it does make you mad though you feel you d like to make them swallow you anyway But then you think What s the use of going after something you don t want just because other people say you can t have it It was on Montague s lips to ask Then why do you come here But he forbore The car sped on down the stately driveway and his companion proceeded to point out the mansions and the people and to discuss them in his own peculiar style See that yellow brick house in there said he That belongs to Allis the railroad man He used to live in Pittsburg and I remember him thirty years ago when he had one carriage for his three babies and pushed them himself by thunder He was glad to borrow money from me then but now he looks the other way when I go by Allis used to be in the steel business six or eight years ago Gamble continued reminiscently Then he sold out it was the real beginning of the forming of the Steel Trust Did you ever hear that story Not that I know of said Montague Well said the other if you are going to match yourself against the Steel crowd it s a good idea to know about them Did you ever meet Jim Stagg The Wall Street plunger asked Montague He s a mere name to me His last exploit was to pull off a prize fight in one of the swell hotels in New York and one nigger punched the other through a plate glass mirror Stagg comes from the wild West you know and he s wild as they make em my God I could tell you some stories about him that d make your hair stand up Perhaps you remember some time ago he raided Tennessee Southern in the market and captured it and old Waterman testified that he took it away from him because he didn t consider he was a fit man to own it As a matter of fact that was just pure bluff for Waterman uses him in little jobs like that all the time Well six or eight years ago Stagg owned a big steel plant out West and there was a mill in Indiana belonging to Allis that interfered with their business One time Stagg and some of his crowd had been on a spree for several days and late one night they got to talking about Allis Let s buy the out said Stagg so they ordered a special and a load of champagne and away they went to the city in Indiana They got to Allis s house about four o clock in the morning and they rang the bell and banged on the door and after a while the butler came half awake Is Allis in asked Stagg and before the fellow could answer the whole crowd pushed into the hall and Stagg stood at the foot of the stairs and roared he s got a voice like a bull you know Allis Allis come down here Allis came to the head of the stairs in his nightshirt half frightened to death Allis we want to buy your steel plant said Stagg Buy my steel plant gasped Allis Sure buy it outright Spot cash We ll pay you five hundred thousand for it But it cost me over twelve hundred thousand said Allis Well then we ll pay you twelve hundred thousand said Stagg God damn you we ll pay you fifteen hundred thousand My plant isn t for sale said Allis We ll pay you two million shouted Stagg It isn t for sale I tell you We ll pay you two million and a half Come on down here Do you mean that gasped Allis He could hardly credit his ears Come downstairs and I ll write you a check said Stagg And so they hauled him down and they bought his mill Then they opened some more champagne and Allis began to get good natured too There s only one thing the matter with my mill said he and that s Jones s mill over in Harristown The railroads give him rebates and he undersells me Well damn his soul said Stagg we ll have his mill too And so they bundled into their special again and about six o clock in the morning they got to Harristown and they bought another mill And that started them you know They d never had such fun in their lives before It seems that Stagg had just cleaned up ten or twelve millions on a big Wall Street plunge and they blew in every dollar buying steel mills and paying two or three prices for every one of course Gamble paused and chuckled to himself What I m telling you is the story that Stagg told me said he And of course you ve got to make allowances He said he had no idea of what Dan Waterman had been planning but I fancy that was a lie Harrison of Pittsburg had been threatening to build a railroad of his own and take away his business from Waterman s roads and so there was nothing for Waterman to do but buy him out at three times what his mills were worth He took the mills that Stagg had bought at the same time Stagg had paid two or three prices and Waterman paid him a couple of prices more and then he passed them on to the American people for a couple of prices more than that Gamble paused That s where they get these fortunes he added waving his fat little hand Sometimes it makes a fellow laugh to think of it Every concern they bought was overcapitalised to begin with I doubt if two hundred million dollars worth of honest dollars was ever put into the Steel Trust properties and they capitalised it at a billion and now they ve raised it to a billion and a half The men who pulled it off made hundreds of millions and the poor public that bought the common stock saw it go down to six They gave old Harrison a four hundred million dollar mortgage on the property and he sits back and grins and wonders why a man can t die poor Gamble s car was opposite one of the clubs Suddenly he signalled his chauffeur to stop Hello Billy he called and a young naval officer who was walking down the steps turned and came toward him What have you been doing with yourself said Gamble mister Montague my friend Lieutenant Long of the Engineers Where are you going Billy Nowhere in particular said the officer Get in said Gamble pointing to the vacant seat between them I am showing mister Montague the town The other climbed in and they went on The Lieutenant has just come up from Brooklyn he continued Lively times we had in Brooklyn didn t we Billy Tell me what you have been doing lately I m working hard said the Lieutenant studying Studying here in Newport laughed Gamble That s easy enough when you belong to the Engineers said the other We are working men and they don t want us at their balls By the way Gamble he added after a moment I was looking for you I want you to help me Me said Gamble Yes said the other I have just had notice from the Department that I am one of a board of five that has been appointed to draw up specifications for machine oil for the Navy What can I do about it asked Gamble I want you to help me draw them up But I don t know anything about machine oil You cannot possibly know less than I do said the Lieutenant Surely if you have been in the oil business you can give me some sort of an idea about machine oil Gamble thought for a minute I might try he said But would it be the proper thing for me to do Of course I m out of the business myself but I have friends who might bid for the contract Well your friends can take their chances with the rest said the Lieutenant I am a friend too hang it And how in the world am I to find out anything about oil Gamble was silent again Well I ll do what I can for you he said finally I ll write out what I know about the qualities of good oil and you can use it as you think best All right said the Lieutenant with relief But you ll have to agree to say nothing about it said Gamble It s a delicate matter you understand You may trust me for that said the other laughing So the subject was dropped and they went on with their ride Half an hour later Gamble set Montague down at General Prentice s door and he bade them farewell and went in The General was coming down the stairs Hello Allan he said Where have you been Seeing the place a little said Montague Come into the drawing room said the General There s a man in there you ought to know One of the brainiest newspaper men in Wall Street he added as he went across the hall the financial man of the Express Montague entered the room and was introduced to a powerfully built and rather handsome young fellow who had not so long ago been centre rush upon a famous football team Well Bates said the General what are you after now I m trying to get the inside story of the failure of Grant and Ward said Bates I supposed you d know about it if anyone did I know about it said the General but the circumstances are such that I m not free to tell at least not for publication I ll tell you privately if you want to know No said Bates I d rather you didn t do that I can find it out somehow Did you come all the way to Newport to see me asked the General Oh no not entirely said Bates I m to get an interview with Wyman about the new bond issue of his road What do you think of the market General Things look bad to me said Prentice It s a good time to reef sail Then Bates turned to Montague I think I passed you a while ago in the street he said pleasantly You were with James Gamble weren t you Yes said Montague Do you know him Bates knows everybody put in the General that s his specialty I happen to know Gamble particularly well said Bates I have a brother in his office in Pittsburg What in the world do you suppose he is doing in Newport Just seeing the world so he told me said Montague He has nothing to do since his company sold out Sold out echoed Bates What do you mean Why the Trust has bought him out said Montague The other stared at him What makes you think that he asked He told me so himself was the answer Oh laughed the other Then it s just some dodge that he s up to You think he hasn t sold I don t think it I know it said Bates At any rate he hadn t sold three days ago I had a letter from my brother saying that they were expecting to land a big oil contract with the government that would put them on Easy Street for the next five years Montague said no more But he did some thinking Experience had sharpened his wits and by this time he knew a clew when he met it A while later when Bates had gone and his brother had come in with Alice he got Oliver off in a corner and demanded How much are you to get out of that oil contract The other stared at him in consternation Good heavens he exclaimed Did he tell you about it He told me some things said Montague and I guessed the rest Oliver was watching him anxiously See here Allan he said you ll keep quiet about it I imagine I will said the other It s none of my business that I can see Then suddenly Oliver broke into a smile of amusement Say Allan he exclaimed He s a clever dog isn t he Very clever admitted the other He s been after that thing for six months you know and just as smooth and quiet It s about the slickest game I ever heard of But how could he know what officers were to make out those specifications Oh that s easy said the other That was the beginning of the whole thing They got a tip that the contract was to be let and they had no trouble in finding out the names of the officers That kind of thing is common you know the bureaus in Washington are rotten I see said Montague Gamble s company is in a bad way Oliver continued The Trust just about had it in a corner But Gamble saw this chance and he staked everything on it But what s his idea asked the other What good will it do him to write the specifications There are five officers said Oliver and he s been laying siege to every one of them So now they are all his intimate friends and every one of them has come to him for help So there will go into Washington five sets of specifications all different but each containing one essential point You see Gamble s company has a peculiar kind of oil it contains some ingredient or other he told me the name but I don t remember it now It doesn t make it any better oil and it doesn t make it any worse but it s different from any other oil in the world And now don t you see whatever other requirements are specified this one quality will surely appear and there will be only one company in the world that can bid Of course they will name their own figure and get a five year contract I see said Montague drily It s a beautiful scheme And how much do you get out of it He paid me ten thousand at the start said Oliver and I am to get five per cent of the first year s contract whatever that may be Gamble says his bid won t be less than half a million so you see it was worth while And Oliver chuckled to himself He s going home to morrow he added So my job is done I ll probably never see him again until his four prize daughters get ready for the market CHAPTER XIV Montague returned to New York and plunged into his work The election at which he was scheduled to become president of the Northern Mississippi was not to come off for a month Meantime there was no lack of work for him to do It would of course be necessary for him to return to Mississippi to live and he had to close up his affairs in New York Also he wished to fit himself for the work of superintending a railroad Through the courtesy of General Prentice he was introduced to the president of one of the great transcontinental lines and made a study of that official s office system He went South again to inspect the work of the surveyors and to consult with the engineers who had been selected for the work Price went ahead with his arrangements to take over the control of the road without paying any attention to the old management He sent for Montague one day and introduced him to a mister Haskins who was to be elected vice president of the road Haskins he said had formerly been general manager of the Tennessee Southern and was a practical railroad man Montague was to rely upon him for all the details of his work Haskins was a wiry nervous little man with a bad temper and a sarcastic tongue he worshipped the gospel of efficiency and in the consultations with him Montague got many curious lights upon the management of railroads He learned for instance that a conspicuous item in the construction account was the money to be used in paying local government boards for right of way through towns and villages Apparently no one even considered the possibility of securing the privilege by any other methods Montague did not like the prospect but he said nothing Then again the road was to purchase its rails and other necessaries from the Mississippi Steel Company and apparently it was expected to pay a fancy price for these it was not to ask for any of the discounts which were customary Also Montague was troubled to learn that the secretary and treasurer of the road were to receive liberal salaries and that no questions were to be asked because they were relatives of Price All that he put up with but matters came to a head about ten days before the election when one day Haskins came to his office with the engineers estimates and with his own figures of the probable cost of the extension Most of the figures were much higher than those which Montague had worked out for himself We ought to do better on those contracts he said pointing to some of the items I dare say we might said Haskins but those contracts are to go to the Hill Manufacturing Company I don t understand you said Montague I thought that we were to advertise for bids Yes replied Haskins but that company is to get the contracts all the same You mean asked Montague that we are not to give them to the lowest bidder I m afraid not said the other Has Price said anything to you to that effect He has But I don t understand said Montague what is this Hill Manufacturing Company And Haskins smiled It s a concern that Price has organised himself he said Montague stared in amazement Price himself he gasped His nephew is president of the company added the other Is it a new company Montague asked Organised especially for the purpose smiled the other And what does it manufacture It doesn t manufacture anything it simply sells In other words said Montague it s a device whereby mister Price proposes to rob the stockholders of the Northern Mississippi Railroad You can phrase it that way if you choose said Haskins quietly but I wouldn t advise you to let Price hear you I thank you responded Montague and brought the interview to an end He took a day to think the matter over It was not his habit to act upon impulse He saw that the time had come for him to speak but he wished to be sure of his course of action before he began He had dinner at the Club that evening and seeing his friend Major Venable ensconced in a big leather chair in the reading room he went and sat down beside him How do you do Major he said I ve got another case that I want to ask you some questions about Always at your service said the Major It has to do with a railroad said Montague Did you ever hear of such a thing as a railroad president organising a company to sell supplies to his own road The Major smiled grimly Yes I have heard of it he said Is it common asked Montague Not so common as you might suppose answered the other A railroad president is commonly not an important enough man to be permitted to do it If it happens to be a big road and the president is a power in it why then he may do it I see said Montague That was Higgins s trick said the Major Higgins used to go around making speeches to Sunday schools he was the kind of man that the newspapers like to refer to as a model citizen and a leader of enterprise His brothers and his brothers in law and his cousins and all his family went into business in order to sell things to his railroads I heard of one story it has never come out but it s very amusing Every year the road would advertise its contract for stationery It used about a million dollars worth and there d be long and most elaborate specifications published columns and columns But sandwiched away somewhere in the middle of a paragraph was the provision that the paper must all bear a certain watermark and that watermark was patented by one of Higgins s companies It didn t even own so much as a mill it sublet all the contracts When Higgins died he left eighty million dollars but they juggled the records and you read in all the newspapers that he left a few millions That was in Philadelphia where you can do such things Montague sat thinking for a few moments But I can t see why they should do it in this case he said The men who are doing it own nearly all of the stock of the road What difference does that make asked the Major Why they are simply plundering their own property said Montague Tut was the reply What do they care about the value of the property They ll unload it before the public finds out and in the meantime they are probably manipulating the stock That s the scheme they re working with the street railroads over in Brooklyn for instance the more irregular the dividends are the more violently the stock fluctuates and the better they like it But this is the case of a railroad that is being built said Montague and they are putting up the money to build it Yes said the Major of course and then they are paying it back to themselves by this dodge and they ll still have the stock and whatever they can get for it will be profit And if the State Legislature comes along and asks any impertinent questions they can open their books and say See we have spent this much for improvements This is the cost of the road and if you reduce our freight rates you will cut off our dividends and confiscate our property And the Major gazed at Montague with a mischievous twinkle in his eye Besides he said another thing You say they are putting up the money Are you sure it s their own money Commonly the greater part of the cost of railroad building is paid by bonds and they work those bonds off on banks and insurance companies and trust companies Have you thought of that No I hadn t said Montague I know very few men in Wall Street who use their own money the Major added Take the case of Wyman for instance Wyman s railroad keeps a cash surplus of twenty or thirty millions and Wyman uses that in Wall Street And when he has made his profit he takes it and salts it away in village improvement bonds all over the country Do you see I see said Montague It s a bad game for the small stockholder It s a bad game for the small man of any sort said the Major When I was young I can remember a man would save a little money and put it into an enterprise of some sort and whatever the profits were he would get his share of them But now you see the big men have got control and they are greedier than they used to be There is nothing hurts them so much as to see the little fellow get any share of the profits and they ve all sorts of schemes for doing him out of it I could take a week off and tell you about them You are manufacturing soap we will say You find there are too many soap manufacturers and too much soap and so you propose to combine and put your rivals out of business and monopolise the soap market Your properties are already capitalised at twice what they cost you because you are naturally hopeful and that is what you expected they would earn but now for this new combination you issue stock to the amount of three times this imagined value Then you fill the street with rumours of the wonders of your soap combination and all the privileges and monopolies that you ve got and you unload your stock on the public we ll say at eighty You may have sold all your stock but you ve still got control of the corporation The public is helpless and unorganised and your men are in Then the Street begins to hear disturbing rumours about the soap trust and your board of directors meet and declare that it is impossible to pay any dividends There is great indignation among the stockholders and an opposition is organised but you set the clock an hour ahead and elect your ticket before the other fellow comes around Or perhaps the troubles have already knocked the stock down sufficiently low to satisfy you and you buy a majority of it back Then the public hears that a new interest has purchased the soap trust and that a new and honest administration is to be elected and once more there is hope for soap You buy a few more plants and issue more stocks and bonds and soap begins to boom and you sell once more You can work that regularly every two or three years for there is always a new crop of investors and nobody but a few people in Wall Street can possibly keep track of what you are doing The Major paused for a while and sat with a happy smile on his countenance You see he said there are floods and floods of wealth pouring into Wall Street from all over the country It comes to me like a vision The crops are growing the mines and the mills and the factories are working and here is all the money People don t like to take it and hide it up their chimneys few people have chimneys nowadays They want to invest it and so you prepare investments for them Take the street railroads here in New York for instance What could be a safer investment than the street railroads of the Metropolis An absolute monopoly and traffic growing so fast that construction can t keep up with it Profits are sure So people buy street railway stocks and bonds In this case it s the politicians who organise the construction companies that s their share in return for the franchises The insiders have a new scheme the best yet it s like a Gatling gun against bows and arrows They organise a syndicate and get the franchises for nothing and then sell them to the company for millions They ve even sold franchises they didn t own and railroad lines that hadn t been built You ll find some improvements charged for four or five times over and the improvements haven t yet been made First and last they have paid themselves about thirty million dollars And in the meantime the poor stockholder wonders why he doesn t get his dividends That s the investment market the Major continued after a pause but of course the biggest reservoirs of wealth are the insurance companies and the banks It s there the real fortunes are made you ll find you lose the greater part of your profits unless you ve got your own banks to take your bonds I heard an amusing story the other day of a man who was manufacturing electrical supplies He prides himself on being an honest business man and having nothing to do with Wall Street His company wanted to extend its business and it issued a couple of hundred thousand dollars worth of bonds and went to the Fidelity Insurance Company and offered them at ninety We aren t buying any bonds just at present said they but suppose you try the National Trust Company So the man went there and they offered him eighty for the bonds That was the best he could do and in the end he had to take it And then the trust company turns the bonds over to the insurance company at par I could name you half a dozen trust companies in New York that are simply syndicates of insurance people for the working of that little game The Major paused You see it he asked Yes I see Montague replied Is there a trust company by any chance back of this railroad you are talking of There is said Montague and the Major shrugged his shoulders There you have it he said By and by they will find their first bond issue inadequate to meet the cost of the proposed improvements The estimates of the engineers will be found too low and there will be another issue of bonds and your president s company will get another contract And then the first thing you know your president will organise a manufacturing enterprise along the line of his road and the road will give him secret rebates and practically carry his goods free or else he ll organise a private car line and make the road pay for the privilege of hauling his cars Or perhaps he s already got some industrial concern and is simply building the road as a side issue The Major stopped He saw that Montague was staring at him with an expression of perplexity What s the matter he asked Good heavens Major exclaimed the other Do you know what road I ve been talking about And the Major sank back in his chair and went into a fit of laughter He laughed until he was purple in the face and he could hardly find breath to speak I really thought you did Montague protested It s exactly the situation Oh dear me said the Major fishing for his pocket handkerchief to wipe the tears from his eyes Dear me It makes me think of our district attorney s lemon story Did you ever hear it No said Montague I never did It was one of the bright spots in a dreary reform campaign that we had a few years ago It seems that our young crusader was giving his audience a few illustrations of how dishonest officials could make money in this city Let us imagine a case he said You are an inspector of fruit and there is a scarcity of lemons in New York There are two ships full of lemons on the way and one ship gets in twenty four hours ahead Now the law requires that the fruit be carefully inspected If you are too careful about it it will take more than twenty four hours and the owner of the cargo will lose a small fortune So he comes to you and offers you a thousand or two and you don t stop to open every crate of his lemons The district attorney told that story at a meeting and the next morning the newspapers published it That afternoon he happened to meet a fruit inspector who was an old friend of his Say old man said the inspector who the devil told you about those lemons The next morning Montague called at Price s office mister Price he said a matter has come up in my discussions with mister Haskins about which I thought it necessary to consult you immediately What is it asked Price mister Haskins informs me that it is understood that the Hill Manufacturing Company is to be favoured in the matter of contracts Montague was watching Price narrowly and he saw his jaw set grimly and a hostile look come upon his features Price had been lounging back in his chair now slowly he straightened himself up as if to receive an attack Well he asked Is mister Haskins correct asked the other He is correct He also stated that you are interested in the company Is that true That is true He also stated that the company did not manufacture but simply sold Is that true Yes that is true Very well mister Price said Montague This is a matter about which we must have an understanding without delay In my preliminary talks with you I was informed that it was your wish to find a man who should run the road honestly The situation which you have just outlined to me does not seem to me consistent with that programme Montague was prepared for an angry response but he saw the other make an effort and control himself You must realise mister Montague he said that you are not very familiar with methods in the railroad world This company of which you speak possesses advantages it can secure better terms Price stopped You mean that it can purchase goods more cheaply than the railroad itself can demanded Montague In some cases began the other Very well then he answered In any case where it can obtain better terms there can be no objection to its receiving the contract But that does not agree with what mister Haskins told me he gave me to understand that we were to prepare to pay a much higher price because it would be necessary to give the contracts to the Hill Manufacturing Company and that was my reason for coming to see you I wish to have a distinct understanding with you upon this point While I am president of the Northern Mississippi Railroad everything that is purchased by the road will be purchased in fair competition and the concern which will give us the lowest price for the quality of goods we need will receive our order That is a matter about which there must be left no possible room for misunderstanding I trust I have made myself clear You have made yourself clear said Price and so the interview terminated CHAPTER XV Montague went back to his work but with a heart full of misgivings He would have liked to persuade himself that that was the end of the episode but he could not do it He foresaw that his job as president of a railroad would not be a sinecure With all his forebodings however he was unprepared for the development which came the next day Young Curtiss called him up early in the morning and asked him to wait at his office A few minutes later he came in with evident agitation upon his countenance Montague he said I have something important to tell you I cannot leave you in ignorance about it But before I begin you must understand one thing that I am taking my future in my hands by telling you And you must promise me that you will never give the slightest hint that I have spoken to you I will promise said Montague What is it You must not even let on that you know added the other Price would know that I told you Oh it s Price said Montague I ll promise to protect you What is it He called up Davenant yesterday afternoon and told him that you were not to be elected president of the road Montague gazed at him in dismay He says you are to be dropped entirely said the other Haskins is to be president Davenant had to tell me because I am one of the directors So that s it Montague whispered to himself Do you know what s the matter asked Curtiss Yes I do said Montague What is it It s a long story just some graft that I wouldn t stand for Oh cried Curtiss with sudden light Is it the Hill Manufacturing Company It is said Montague It was Curtiss s turn to stare in amazement My God he gasped Do you mean that you have thrown up the sponge for that I haven t thrown up the sponge by any means was the answer But that s why Price wants to get rid of me But man cried the other How perfectly absurd Montague fixed his glance upon him Would you advise me to stand for it he asked But my dear fellow said Curtiss I ve got some stock in that company myself Montague sat in silence he could think of nothing to say after that What in the world do you suppose you have gone into protested the other A charity enterprise Then he stopped seeing the look of pain upon his friend s face He put a hand upon his arm See here old man he said this is too bad honestly I understand how you feel and it s a great credit to you but you are living in the world and you have got to be practical You can t expect to take a railroad and run it as if it were an orphan asylum You can t expect to do business if you re going to have notions like that It s really a shame to give up a work like this for such a reason Montague stiffened I assure you I haven t given up yet he replied grimly But what are you going to do protested the other I am going to fight said he Fight echoed Curtiss But man you are perfectly helpless Price and Ryder own the road and they will do as they please with it You are one of the directors of the road said Montague And you know the situation You know the pledges upon which the election of the new board was secured Will you vote for Haskins as president My God Montague protested the other What a thing to ask of me You know perfectly well that I have no power in the road All the stock I own Price gave me and what can I do Why my whole career would be ruined if I were to oppose him In other words said Montague you are a dummy You are willing to sell your name and your character for a block of stock You take a position of trust and you betray it The other s face hardened Oh well he said if that s the way you put it That s not the way I put it said Montague That is simply the fact But cried the other don t you realise that they have a majority even without me Perhaps they have said Montague but that is no reason why you should not do what is right Curtiss arose There is nothing more to be said he remarked I am sorry you take it that way I tried to do you a service I appreciate that said Montague promptly For that I shall always be obliged to you In this fight that you propose to make said the other you must not forget that it is I who have brought you this information Do not trouble about that said Montague I will protect you No one shall ever know that I had the information Montague spent a half an hour pacing up and down his office in thought Then he called his stenographer and dictated a letter to his cousin mister Lee and to each of the three other persons whom he had approached in relation to their votes at the stockholders meeting Certain matters have developed he wrote in connection with the affairs of the Northern Mississippi Railroad which make me unwilling to accept the position of president It is also my intention to resign from the board of directors of the road in which I find myself powerless to prevent the things of which I disapprove And then he went on to outline the plan which he intended to carry out explaining that he offered to those whom he had been the means of influencing the opportunity to go in with him upon equal terms He requested them to communicate their decisions by telegraph and two days later he had heard from them all and was ready for business He called up Stanley Ryder and made an appointment for an interview mister Ryder he said a few weeks ago you talked with me in this office and asked me to assist you in electing your ticket for the Northern Mississippi Railroad You said that you wished me to become president of the road and that the reason for the request was that you wanted a man whom you could depend upon for efficient and honest management I accepted your offer in good faith and I have made all arrangements and put in a great deal of hard work at the task of fitting myself for the position Now I have learned from mister Price s own lips that he has organised a company for the purpose of exploiting the road for his own private benefit I told him that I was unwilling to stand for anything of the sort Since then I have been thinking the matter over and I have concluded that this situation will make it impossible for me to cooperate with mister Price I have concluded therefore that it would be best for me to resign my position as a member of the board of directors and also to withdraw my candidacy as president Ryder had avoided Montague s gaze he sat staring in front of him and tapping nervously with a pencil upon his desk It was some time before he answered mister Montague he said finally I am very sorry indeed to hear your decision But taking all the circumstances into consideration it seems to me that perhaps it is a wise one Again there was a pause You must permit me to thank you for what you have done Ryder added And I trust that this unfortunate episode will not alter our personal relationship Thank you said Montague coldly He had waited to see what Ryder would say He waited again having no mind to help him in his embarrassment As I say Ryder repeated I am very much obliged to you I have no doubt of it said Montague But I trust that you do not expect to end our relationship in any such simple way as that He saw Ryder s expression change What do you mean he asked There is a matter of grave importance which has to be settled before we can part As you know I am personally the holder of five hundred shares of Northern Mississippi stock and to that extent I am interested in the affairs of the road Most certainly said Ryder quietly but I have nothing to do with that As a stockholder of the road you look to the board of directors Besides being a stockholder myself continued Montague without heeding this remark I have also to consider the interests of the three persons whom I interviewed in your behalf I was the means of inducing these people to vote for the board which you named I was the means of inducing them to place themselves in the power of mister Price and yourself This being the case I consider that my honour is involved and that I am responsible to them What do you expect to do asked Ryder I have written to them informing them of my intention to withdraw I have not told them the circumstances but have simply indicated that I find myself powerless to prevent certain things to which I object I have told them the course I intend to take and offered them the opportunity to get out upon the same terms as myself They have accepted the offer and to morrow I should receive their stock certificates and their authorisation to dispose of them I have my own certificates here and I have to say that I consider you are under obligation to purchase this stock at the same price which you paid for the new stock namely fifty dollars a share Ryder stared at him mister Montague you amaze me he said I am sorry for that said Montague His voice was hard and there was a grim look upon his face He fixed his eyes upon Ryder Nevertheless he said it will be necessary for you to take the stock I am sorry to have to say it said Ryder but this seems to me impertinent The total number of shares said Montague is thirty five hundred and the price of them is one hundred and seventy five thousand dollars The two gazed at each other Ryder saw the look in Montague s eyes and he did not repeat his sneer May I ask he inquired in a low voice what reason you have to believe that I will comply with this extraordinary request I have a very good reason as I believe you will perceive said Montague You and mister Price have purchased this railroad and you wish to plunder it That is your privilege apparently it is the custom here in Wall Street to play tricks upon the investing public But you cannot play them upon me because I know too much May I know what you propose to do asked Ryder You certainly may said the other I propose to fight Until you have purchased my stock and the stock of my friends I shall remain a director in the railroad and also a candidate for the position of president I shall make a contest at the next directors meeting and if I fail in my purpose there I shall carry the fight before the public I flatter myself that my reputation will count for something in my old home you will not be able to carry matters with quite the same high hand in Mississippi as you are accustomed to in New York Also I shall fight you in the courts I don t happen to know just what is the law in regard to the plundering of a public service corporation by its own directors but I shall be very much surprised if I cannot find some ground upon which to put a stop to it Also as you know I am in possession of facts regarding the means whereby you got your new privileges from the State Legislature Ryder was glaring at him in rage mister Montague he cried this is blackmail You may call it that if you please said the other I shall not be afraid to face the charge if you should see fit to bring it in the courts Ryder started to reply then caught his breath and gasped When he spoke again he had mastered himself It seems to me a most extraordinary thing he said Surely mister Montague you cannot feel at liberty to make public what you learned from mister Price and myself while you were acting as our confidential adviser Surely you cannot have forgotten the pledge of secrecy which you gave me here in this office I have not forgotten it answered Montague And I have considered the matter with the greatest care I consider that it is you who have violated a pledge I believe that your violation was a deliberate one that you had intended it from the very beginning You assured me that you wished an honest administration of the road I don t believe that you ever did wish it I believe that you had no thought whatever except to use me as your tool to secure the control of the railroad without buying out the remaining stockholders Having accomplished that purpose you are perfectly willing to have me retire In fact I have made up my mind that you never intended that I should be president I have all along been suspicious about it But I can assure you that you have struck the wrong man you cannot play with me in any such manner I have no idea whatever of retiring from the railroad and permitting you and mister Price to exploit it and to deprive me of the value of my holdings Montague was going on but the other interrupted him quickly I recognise the justice of what you say there mister Montague said he So far as your own shares are concerned you are entitled to be bought out I am sure that that is a fair basis On the contrary said Montague it s a basis the suggestion of which I take as an insult I have been the means of placing other people at your mercy My reputation and my promises were used for that purpose and to whatever I am entitled they are entitled equally There can be no possible settlement except the one which I have offered you Ryder could think of nothing more to say He sat staring at the other And Montague who had no desire to prolong the interview arose abruptly I do not expect you to decide this matter immediately he said I presume that you will wish to consult with mister Price I have made known my terms to you and I have nothing more to say Either you will accept the terms or I shall drop everything else and prepare to fight you at every step I expect to receive the stock by this evening s mail and I am obliged to ask you to favour me with a decision by to morrow noon so that we can close the matter up without delay And with that he bowed formally and took his departure The next morning s mail brought him a letter from William E Davenant My dear mister Montague it read It is reported to me that you have thirty five hundred shares of the stock of the Northern Mississippi Railroad which you desire to sell at fifty dollars a share If you will bring the stock to my office to day I shall be glad to purchase it Having received the letters from the South Montague went immediately Davenant was formal but Montague could catch a humorous twinkle in his eye which seemed to say quite confidentially that he appreciated the joke That ends the matter he said as he blotted the last of Montague s signatures And I trust you will permit me to say mister Montague that I consider you an exceedingly capable business man I appreciate the compliment replied Montague drily CHAPTER XVI Montague was now a gentleman of leisure comparatively speaking He had two cases on his hands but they did not occupy his time as had the prospect of running a railroad They were contingency cases and as they were against large corporations Montague saw a lean year ahead of him He smiled bitterly to himself as he realised that the only thing which had given him the courage to break with Price and Ryder had been the money which he and his brother Oliver had won by means of a Wall Street tip He received a letter from Alice I am going to remain a couple of weeks longer in Newport she wrote Who do you think has invited me Laura Hegan She has been perfectly lovely to me and I go to her place next week You will be interested to know that I had a long talk with her about you I took occasion to tell her a few things that she ought to know She was very nice about it I am hoping that you will come up for another week end before I leave here Harry Curtiss is going to spend his vacation here you might come with him Montague smiled to himself as he read this letter He did not go with Curtiss But the heat of the city was stifling and the thought of the surf and the country was alluring and he went up by way of the Sound one Friday night He was invited to dinner at the Hegans Jim Hegan was there himself for the first occasion in three years missus Hegan declared that it was only because she had gone down to New York and fetched him It was the first time that Montague had ever been with Hegan for any length of time He watched him with interest for the man was a fascinating problem to him He was so calm and serene always courteous and friendly But what was there behind the mask Montague wondered For forty years this man had toiled and fought in the arena of Wall Street and with only one purpose and one thought in life so far as Montague knew the piling up of money Jim Hegan indulged himself in none of the pleasures of rich men He had no hobbies and he seldom went into company In his busy times it was said that he would use a dozen secretaries and wear them all out He was a gigantic engine which drove all day and all night a machine for the making of money Montague did not care much for money himself and he wondered about it What did the man want it for What did he expect to accomplish by it What was the moral code the outlook upon life of a man who gave all his time to heaping up money What reason did he give to himself for his own career Some reason he must have or he could not be so calm and cheerful Or could it be that he had no thoughts about it at all Was it simply a blind instinct with him Was he an animal whose nature it was to make money and who was untroubled by any scruples This last idea seemed rather uncanny to Montague he found himself watching Jim Hegan with a kind of awe thinking of him as some terrible elemental force blind and unconscious like the lightning or the tornado For Jim Hegan was one of the wreckers His fortune had been made by the methods which Major Venable had outlined by buying aldermen and legislatures and governors by getting franchises for nothing and selling them for millions by organising huge swindles and unloading them upon the public And here he sat upon the veranda of his home in the twilight of an August evening smoking a cigar and telling about an orphan asylum he had founded He was cheerful and kindly he was even benevolent And could it be that he had no idea of the trail of ruin and distress which he had left behind him Montague found himself possessed by a sudden desire to penetrate beneath that reserve to spring at the man and surprise him with some sudden question to get at the reality of him to know him as he was This air of power and masterfulness surely that must be the mask that he wore And how was he to himself When he was alone with his own conscience Surely there must come doubt and wonder unhappiness and loneliness Surely then the lives that he had wrecked must come back to plague him Surely the memories of treachery and cruelty must make him wince And from Hegan Montague s thoughts went to his daughter She too was serene and stately Montague wondered what was in her mind How much did she know about her father s career Surely she could not have persuaded herself that all that she had heard was calumny There might be question about this offence or that but of the great broad facts there could be no question And did she justify it and excuse it or was she too secretly unhappy And was this the reason for her pride and for her bitter speeches It was a continual topic of chatter in Society how Laura Hegan had withdrawn herself from all of her mother s affairs and was interesting herself in work in the slums Could it be that Nemesis had overtaken Jim Hegan in the form of his daughter That she was the conscience by which he was to be tormented Jim Hegan never talked about his affairs In all the time that Montague spent with him during his two days at Newport he gave just one hint for the other to go upon Money he remarked that evening I don t care about money Money is just chips to me Life was a game and the chips were dollars What he had played for was power And suddenly Montague seemed to see the career of this man unrolled before him like a panorama He had begun life as an office boy and above him were all the heights of business and finance and the ladder by which to scale them was money There were rivals with whom he fought and the overcoming of these rivals had occupied all his time and his thought If he had bought legislatures it was because his rivals were trying to buy them And perhaps then he did not even know that he was a wrecker perhaps he would not have believed it if anyone had told him He had travelled all the long journey of his life trampling out opposition and crushing everything before him nourishing in his heart the hope that some day when he had attained to mastery when there were no more rivals to oppose and thwart him then he would be free to do good Then he would no longer have to be a wrecker And perhaps that was the meaning of his pitiful little effort an orphan asylum It seemed to Montague that the gods must shake with Olympian laughter when they contemplated the spectacle of Jim Hegan and his orphan asylum Jim Hegan who could have filled a score of orphan asylums with the children of the men whom he had driven to ruin and suicide These thoughts were seething in Montague s mind and they would not let him rest Perhaps it was just as well that he did not stay too long that evening After all what was the use Jim Hegan was what circumstances had made him Vain was the dream of peace and well doing there was always another rival There was a new battle on just at present if one might believe the gossip of the Street Hegan and Wyman were at each other s throats They would fight out their quarrel and there was no way to prevent them even though they pulled down the pillars of the nation about each other s heads As to just what these men were doing in their struggles Montague got new information every day The next morning while he was sitting on the piazza of one of the hotels watching the people he recognised a familiar face and greeted the young engineer Lieutenant Long who came and sat down beside him Well said Montague have you heard anything from our friend Gamble He s back in the bosom of his family again said the young officer He got tired of the splurge Great fellow Gamble said Montague I liked him very much said the Lieutenant He s not beautiful to look at but his heart s in the right place Montague thought for a moment then asked Did he ever send you your oil specifications You bet he did said the other And say they were great The Department will think I m an expert Indeed said Montague It was a precious lucky thing for me said the officer I d have been in quite a predicament you know He paused for a moment You cannot imagine he said the position that we naval officers are in Do you know I think some word must have got out about that contract You don t say so said Montague with interest I do By gad I thought of writing to headquarters about it I was approached no less than three times Indeed Fancy said the officer A young chap got himself introduced to me by one of my friends here He stuck by me the whole evening and afterwards as we were strolling home he opened up on me in this fashion He d heard from a friend in Washington that I was one of those who had been asked to write specifications for the oil contracts of the Navy and he had some friends who were interested in oil and who might be able to advise me He hinted that it might be a good thing for me Just think of it I can imagine it was unpleasant I tell you it sets a man to thinking said the Lieutenant You know the men in our service are exposed to that sort of thing all the time and some of them are trying to live a good deal higher than their incomes warrant It s a thing that we ve all got to look out for I can stand graft in politics and in business but when it comes to the Army and Navy I tell you that s where I m ready to fight Montague said nothing He could think of nothing to say Gamble said something about your being interested in a fight against the Steel Trust said the other Is that so It was so replied Montague I m out of it now What we were saying made me think of the Steel Trust said the Lieutenant We get some glimpses of that concern in the Navy you know I hadn t thought of that said Montague Ask any man in the service about it said the Lieutenant It s an old scar that we carry around in our souls it won t heal I mean the armour plate frauds Sure enough said Montague He carried a long list of indictments against the steel kings in his mind but he had forgotten this one I know about it particularly the other continued because my father was on the board of investigation fifteen years ago I am disposed to be a little keen on the subject because what he found out at that time practically caused his death Montague darted a keen glance at the young officer who sat gazing ahead in sombre thought Fancy how a naval man feels he said We are told that our ships are going to the Pacific and any hour the safety of the nation may depend upon them And they are covered with rotten armour plate that was made by old Harrison and sold to the Government for four or five times what it cost Take one case that I know about the Oregon I ve got a brother on board her to day During the Spanish War the whole country was watching her and praying for her And I could go on board that battleship and put my finger on the spot in her conning tower that has a series of blow holes straight through the middle of it holes that old Harrison had drilled through and plugged up with an iron bar If ever that plate was struck by a shell it would splinter like so much glass Montague listened half dazed Can one see that he cried See it No said the officer It s all on the inside of the plate of course When they got through with their dirty work they would treat the surface and who would ever know the difference But then how can YOU know it asked Montague I said the other Because my father had laid before him the history of that plate from the hour it was made until it was put in the original copies of the doctored shop records and the affidavits of the man who did the work He had the same thing in a hundred other cases I know the man who has the papers at this day You see continued the Lieutenant after a pause the Government s specifications required that each plate should undergo an elaborate set of treatments and the shop records of each plate were kept But of course it cost enormous sums to get these treatments right and even then hundreds of the plates would be bad So when the shop records came up to the office young Ingham and Davidson would go over them and edit them and bring them up to standard that s the way those brilliant young fellows made all the money that they are spending on chorus girls and actresses to day They would have these shop records recopied but they did not always tear up the old ones and somebody in the office hid them and that was how the Government got hold of the story It sounds almost incredible exclaimed Montague Take the story of plate Hsix hundred nineteen of the Oregon said the Lieutenant That was one of a whole group of plates which was selected for the ballistic tests at Indian Head After it had been selected it was taken back into the company s shops at night and secretly retreated three times And then of course it passed the tests and the whole group was passed with it What was done about it Montague asked Nothing much was ever done about it said the other The Government could not afford to let the real facts get out But of course the insiders in the Navy knew it and the memory will last as long as the ships last As I say it killed my father But weren t the men punished at all There was a Board appointed to try the case and they awarded the Government about six hundred thousand dollars damages There s a man here in this hotel now who could tell you that story straight from the inside And the Lieutenant paused and looked about him Suddenly he stood up and went to the railing and called to a man who was passing on the other side of the street Hello Bates he said come here Oh Bates of the Express said Montague You know him do you asked the Lieutenant Hello Bates Have they put you on the Society notes I m hunting interviews replied the other How do you do mister Montague Glad to see you again Come up said the Lieutenant and have a seat I was talking to mister Montague about the armour plate frauds he added when the other had drawn up a chair I told him you knew the story of the Government s investigation Bates comes from Pittsburg you know Yes I know it Montague replied That was the first newspaper story I ever worked on said Bates Of course the Pittsburg papers didn t print the facts but I got them all the same And afterwards I came to know intimately a lawyer in Pittsburg who had charge of a secret investigation and every time I read in the newspapers that old Harrison has given a new library it sets my blood to boiling all over again I sometimes think put in the other that if somebody could be found to tell that story to the American people they would rise up and drive the old scoundrel out of the country You could never bring it home to him said Bates he s too cunning for that He has always turned his dirty work over to other people You remember during the big strike how he ran away and left the job to William Roberts and after it was all over he came back smiling And then buying out the Government to keep himself from being punished said the Lieutenant savagely Montague turned and looked at him What is that That is the story that Bates s lawyer friend can tell was the reply The board of officers awarded six hundred thousand dollars damages to the Government and the case was appealed to the President of the United States and he sold out the Navy Sold it out gasped Montague The officer shrugged his shoulders That s what I call it he said One day old Harrison startled the country by making a speech in support of the President s policy of tariff reform and the next day the lawyer got word that the award was to be scaled down about seventy five per cent And then added Bates William Roberts came down from Pittsburg and bought up the Democratic party in Congress and so the country got neither the damages nor the tariff reform And then a few years later old Harrison sold out to the Steel Trust and got off with a four hundred million dollar mortgage on the American people Bates sank back in his chair It s not a very pleasant topic for a holiday afternoon he said But I can t forget about it It s this kind of thing that does it you know this And he waved his hand about at the gay assemblage The women spending their money on dresses and diamonds and the men tearing the country to pieces to get it You ll hear people talk about it they say these idle rich harm nobody but themselves but I tell you they spread a trail of corruption wherever they go Don t you believe that mister Montague I believe it said he Take these New England towns said Bates and look at the people in them The ones who had any energy got up and went West years ago and those who are left haven t any jaw bones Did you ever notice it And it s just the same wherever this pleasure crowd comes it turns the men into boarding house keepers and lackeys and the girls into waitresses and prostitutes They learn to take tips put in the Lieutenant Everything they ve got is for sale to city people said Bates Politically there isn t a rottener little corner in the whole United States of America than this same Rhode Island and how much that s saying you can imagine You can buy votes on election day as you d buy herrings and there s not the remotest effort at reform nor any hope of it You speak bitterly said Montague I am bitter said Bates But it doesn t often break out I hold my tongue and stew in my own juice We newspaper men see the game you know We are behind the scenes and we see the sawdust put into the dolls We have to work in this rottenness all the time and some of us don t like it I can tell you But what can we do He shrugged his shoulders I spend my time getting facts together and nine times out of ten my newspaper won t print them I should think you d quit said the other in a low voice What better can I do asked the reporter I have the facts and once in a while there comes an explosion and I get my chance So I stick at the job I can t but believe that if you keep putting these things before the people sometime sooner or later they will do something Sometime there will come a man who has a conscience and a voice and who won t sell out Don t you think so mister Montague Yes said Montague I think so CHAPTER XVII The summer wore on At the end of August Alice returned from Newport for a couple of days having some shopping to do before she joined the Prentices at their camp in the Adirondacks Society had here a new way of enjoying itself People built themselves elaborate palaces in the wilderness and lived in a fantastic kind of rusticity with every luxury of civilisation included For this life one needed an entirely separate wardrobe with doeskin hunting boots and mountain climbing skirts all very picturesque and expensive It reminded Montague of a jest that he had heard about missus Vivie Patton whose husband had complained of the expensiveness of her costumes and requested her to wear simpler dresses Very well she said I will get a lot of simple dresses immediately Alice spent one evening at home and she took her cousin into her confidence I ve an idea Allan that Harry Curtiss is going to ask me to marry him I thought it was right to tell you about it I ve had a suspicion of it said Montague smiling Harry has a feeling you don t like him said the girl Is that true No replied Montague not precisely that He hesitated I don t understand about it she continued Do you think I ought not to marry him Montague studied her face Tell me he said have you made up your mind to marry him No she answered I cannot say that I have If you have he added of course there is no use in my talking about it I wish you would tell me just what happened between you and him exclaimed the girl It was simply said Montague that I found that Curtiss was doing in a business way something which I considered improper Other people are doing it of course he has that excuse Well he has to earn a living said Alice I know said the other and if he marries he will have to earn still more of a living He will only place himself still tighter in the grip of these forces of corruption But what did he do asked Alice anxiously Montague told her the story But Allan she said I don t see what there is so very bad about that Don t Ryder and Price own the railroad They own some of it said Montague Other people own some But the other people have to take their chances protested the girl if they choose to have anything to do with men like that You are not familiar with business said the other and you don t appreciate the situation Curtiss was elected a director he accepted a position of trust He simply did it as a favour to Price said she If he hadn t done it Price would only have got somebody else As you say Allan I don t understand much about it but it seems to me it isn t fair to blame a young man who has to make his way in the world and who simply does what he finds everybody else doing Of course you know best about your own affairs but it always did seem to me that you go out of your way to look for scruples Montague smiled sadly That sounds very much like what he said Alice I guess you have made up your mind to marry him after all Alice set out accompanied by Oliver who was bound for Bertie Stuyvesant s imitation baronial castle in another part of the mountains Betty Wyman was also to be there and Oliver was to spend a full month But three days later Montague received a telegram saying that his brother would arrive in New York shortly after eight that morning and to wait at his home for him Montague suspected what this meant and he had time enough to think it over and make up his mind Well he said when Oliver came in It s come again has it Yes said Oliver it has Another sure thing Dead sure Are you coming in Oliver asked after a moment Montague shook his head No he said I think once was enough for me You don t mean that Allan protested the other I mean it was the reply But my dear fellow that is perfectly insane I have information straight from the inside it s as certain as the sunrise I have no doubt of that responded Montague But I am through with gambling in Wall Street I ve seen enough of it Oliver and I m sick of it I don t like the emotions it causes in me I don t like the things it makes me do You found the money came in useful didn t you said Oliver sarcastically Yes I can use what I ve got And when that s gone I don t know about that yet But I ll find some way that I like better All right said Oliver it s your own lookout I will make my own little pile They rode down town in a cab together Where does your information come from this time asked Montague The same source was the reply And is it Transcontinental again No said Oliver it s another stock What is it It s Mississippi Steel was the answer Montague turned and stared at him Mississippi Steel he gasped Why yes said Oliver What s that to you he added in perplexity Mississippi Steel Montague ejaculated again Why didn t you know about my relations with the Northern Mississippi Railroad Of course said Oliver but what s that got to do with Mississippi Steel But it s Price who is managing the deal the man who owns the Mississippi Steel Company Oh said the other I had forgotten that Oliver s duties in Society did not give him much time to ask about his brother s affairs Allan he added quickly you won t say anything about it It s none of my business now answered the other I m out of it But naturally I am interested to know What is it a raid on the stock It s going down said Oliver Montague sat staring ahead of him It must be the Steel Trust he whispered half to himself Nothing more likely was the reply My tip comes from that direction Do you suppose they are going to try to break Price I don t know I guess they could do it if they made up their mind to But he owns a majority of the stock said Montague They can t take it away from him outright Not if he s got it locked up in his safe was the reply and if he s got no debts or obligations But suppose he s overextended and suppose some bank has loaned him money on the stock what then Montague was now keenly interested He went with his brother while the latter drew his money from the bank and called at his brokers and ordered them to sell Mississippi Steel The other was called away then by an engagement in court which occupied him for several hours when he came out he made for the nearest ticker and the first figures he saw were Mississippi Steel quoted at nearly twenty points below the price of the morning The bare figures were eloquent to him of many tragedies they brought before him half a dozen different personalities with their triumphs and despairs He could read in them the story of a Titan struggle Oliver had made his killing but what of Price and Ryder Montague knew that most of Price s stock was hypothecated at the Gotham Trust And now what would become of it And what would become of the Northern Mississippi He bought the afternoon papers Their columns were full of the sensational events of the day The bottom had dropped out of Mississippi Steel as they phrased it The wildest rumours were afloat The Company was known to be making enormous extensions and it was said to have overreached itself there were whispers that its officers had been speculating that the Company would be unable to meet the next quarterly payment upon its bonds that a receivership would be necessary There were hints that the concern was to be taken over by the Trust but this was vigorously denied by officers of the latter All of which had come like a bolt out of the blue To Montague it was an amazing and terrible thing It counted little to him that he was out of the struggle himself that he no longer had anything to lose personally He was like a man who had been through an earthquake and who stood and stared at a gaping crack in the ground Even though he was safe at the moment he could not forget that this was the earth upon which he had to spend the rest of his life and that the next crack might open where he stood Montague could not see that there was the least chance for Price and Ryder he pictured them bowled clean out and he would not have been surprised to read that they were ruined But apparently they weathered the storm The episode passed with no more than a crop of rumours Mississippi Steel did not go back however and he noticed that Northern Mississippi stock had also gone off eight or ten points on the curb It was a period of great anxiety in the financial world Men felt the unrest even though they could not give definite reasons There had been several panics in the stock market throughout the summer and leading financiers and railroad presidents seemed to have got the habit of prognosticating the ruin of the country every time they made a speech at a banquet But apparently men could not agree about the causes of the trouble Some insisted that it was owing to the speeches of the President to his attacks upon the great business interests of the country Others maintained that the world s supply of capital was inadequate and pointed out the destruction of great wars and earthquakes and fires Others argued that there was not enough currency to do the country s business Now and again there rose above the din the shrill voice of some radical who declared that the stock collapses had been brought about deliberately but such statements seemed so preposterous that they were received with ridicule whenever they were heeded at all To Montague the idea that there were men in the country sufficiently powerful to wreck its business and sufficiently unscrupulous to use their power the idea seemed to him sensational and absurd But he had a talk about it one evening with Major Venable who laughed at him The Major named half a dozen men Waterman and Duval and Wyman among them who controlled ninety per cent of the banks in the Metropolis They controlled all three of the big insurance companies with their resources of four or five hundred million dollars one of them controlled a great transcontinental railroad system which alone kept a twenty or thirty million dollar surplus for stock gambling purposes If any two or three of those men were to make up their minds declared the Major they could wreck the business of this country in a day If there were stocks they wanted to pick up they could knock them to any price they chose How would they do it asked the other There are many ways You noticed that the last big slump began with the worst scarcity of money the Street has known for years Now suppose those men should gradually accumulate a lot of cash in the banks and make an agreement to withdraw it at a certain hour Suppose that the banks that they own and the banks where they own directors and the insurance companies which they control suppose they all did the same Can t you imagine the scurrying around for money the calling in of loans the rush to realise on holdings And when you have a public as nervous as ours is when you have credit stretched to the breaking point and everybody involved don t you see the possibilities It seems like playing with dynamite said Montague It s not as bad as it might be was the answer We are saved by the fact that these big men don t get together There are too many jealousies and quarrels Waterman wants easy money and gets the Treasury Department to lend ten millions Wyman on the other hand wants high prices and he goes into the Street and borrows fifteen millions and so it goes There are a half dozen big banking groups in the city They are still competing then asked Montague Oh yes said the Major For instance they fight for the patronage of the out of town banks The banks all over the country send their reserves to New York it s a matter of four or five hundred million dollars and that s an enormous power Some of the big banks are agents for one or two thousand institutions and there s the keenest kind of struggle going on It s not an easy thing to follow of course but they offer all kinds of secret advantages there s more graft in it than you d find in Russia I see said Montague There s only one thing about which the banks are agreed continued the other That is their hatred of the independent trust companies You see the national banks have to keep twenty five per cent reserve while the trust companies only keep five per cent Consequently they do a faster business and they offer four per cent and advertise widely and they are simply driving the banks to the wall There are over fifty of them in this city alone and they ve got over a billion of the people s money And mark my word that is where you ll see blood spilled before long And Montague was destined to remember the prophecy A couple of days later occurred an incident which gave him a new light upon the situation His brother came around one afternoon with a letter in his hand Allan he said what do you make of this Montague glanced at it and saw that it was from Lucy Dupree My dear Ollie it read I find myself in an embarrassing position owing to the fact that some business arrangements upon which I had counted have fallen through The money which I brought with me to New York is nearly all gone and as you can understand my position as a stranger is a difficult one I have a note which Stanley Ryder gave me for my stock It is for a hundred and forty thousand dollars and is due in three months It occurred to me that you might know someone who has some ready cash and who would like to purchase the note I should be very glad to sell it for a hundred and thirty thousand Please do not mention it except in confidence Now what in the world do you suppose that means said Oliver The other stared at him I am sure I can t imagine he replied How much money did Lucy have when she came here She had three or four thousand dollars But then she got ten thousand from Stanley Ryder when he bought that stock She can t have spent any such sum of money exclaimed Oliver She may have invested it said the other thoughtfully Invested nothing exclaimed Oliver But that s not what puzzles me said Montague Why doesn t Ryder discount the note himself That s just it What business has he letting Lucy hawk his notes about the town Maybe he doesn t know it Maybe she s trying to keep her affairs from him Nonsense Oliver replied I don t believe anything of the sort What I think is that Stanley Ryder is doing it himself How do you mean asked Montague in perplexity I believe that he is trying to get his own note discounted I don t believe that Lucy would ever come to us of herself She d starve first She s too proud But Stanley Ryder protested Montague The president of the Gotham Trust Company That s all right said Oliver It s his own note and not the Trust Company s and I ll wager you he s hard up for cash There was a big realty company that failed the other day and I saw that Ryder was one of the stockholders And he s been hit by that Mississippi Steel slump and I ll wager you he s scurrying around to raise money It s just like Lucy too Before he gets through he ll take every dollar she owns Montague said nothing for a minute or two Suddenly he clenched his hands I must go up and see her he said Lucy had moved from the expensive hotel to which Oliver had taken her and rented an apartment on Riverside Drive Montague went up early the next morning She came and stood in the doorway of the drawing room and looked at him He saw that she was paler than she had been and with lines of pain upon her face Allan she said I thought you would come some day How could you stay away so long I didn t think you would care to see me he said She did not answer She came and sat down continuing to gaze at him with a kind of fear in her eyes Suddenly he stretched out his hands to her Lucy he exclaimed Won t you come away from here Won t you come before it is too late Where can I go she asked Anywhere he said Go back home I have no home she answered Go away from Stanley Ryder said Montague He has no right to let you throw yourself away He has not let me Allan said Lucy You must not blame him I cannot bear it She stopped Lucy he said after a pause I saw that letter you wrote to Oliver I thought so said she I asked him not to It wasn t fair Listen he said Will you tell me what that means Will you tell me honestly Yes I will tell you she said in a low voice I will help you if you are in trouble he continued but I will not help Stanley Ryder If you are permitting him to use you Allan she gasped in sudden excitement You don t think that he knew I wrote Yes I thought it said he Oh how could you she cried I knew that he was in trouble Yes he is in trouble and I wanted to help him if I could It was a crazy idea I know but it was all I could think of Oh I understand said Montague And don t you see that I cannot leave him exclaimed Lucy Now of all times when he needs help when his enemies have surrounded him I m the only person in the world who cares anything about him who really understands him Montague could think of nothing to say I know how it hurts you said Lucy and don t think that I have not cared It is a thought that never leaves me But some day I know that you will understand and the rest of the world I don t care what the world says All right Lucy he answered sadly I see that I can t be of any help to you I won t trouble you any more CHAPTER XVIII Another month passed by Montague was buried in his work and he caught but faint echoes of the storm that rumbled in the financial world It was a thing which he thought of with wonder in future times that he should have had so little idea of what was coming He seemed to himself like some peasant who digs with bent head in a field while armies are marshalling for battle all around him and who is startled suddenly by the crash of conflict and the bursting of shells about his head There came another great convulsion of the stock market Stewart the young Lochinvar out of the West made an attempt to corner copper One heard wild rumours in relation to the crash which followed Some said that a traitor had sold out the pool others that there had been a quarrel among the conspirators However that might be copper broke and once more there were howling mobs on the curb and a shudder throughout the financial district Then suddenly like a thunderbolt came tidings that a conference of the big bankers had decreed that the young Lochinvar should be forced out of his New York banks There were rumours that other banks were involved and that there were to be more conferences Then a couple of days later came the news that all the banks of Cummings the Ice King were in trouble and that he too had been forced from the field Montague had never seen anything like the excitement in Wall Street Everyone he met had a new set of rumours wilder than the last It was as if a great rift in the earth had suddenly opened before the eyes of the banking community But Montague was at an important crisis in a suit which he had taken up against the Tobacco Trust and he had no idea that he was in any way concerned in what was taking place The newspapers were all making desperate efforts to allay the anxiety they said that all the trouble was over that Dan Waterman had come to the rescue of the imperilled institutions And Montague believed what he read and went his way Three or four days after the crisis had developed he had an engagement to dine with his friend Harvey Montague was tired after a long day in court and as no one else was coming and he did not intend to dress he walked up town from his office to Harvey s hotel a place of entertainment much frequented by Society people Harvey rented an entire floor and had had it redecorated especially to suit his taste How do you do mister Montague said the clerk when he went to the desk mister Harvey left a note for you Montague opened the envelope and read a hurried scrawl to the effect that Harvey had just got word that a bank of which he was a director was in trouble and that he would have to attend a meeting that evening He had telephoned both to Montague s office and to his hotel without being able to find him Montague turned away He had no place to go for his own family was out of town consequently he strolled into the dining room and ate by himself Afterwards he came out into the lobby and bought several evening papers and stood glancing over the head lines Suddenly a man strode in at the door and he looked up It was Winton Duval the banker Montague had never seen him since the time when they had parted in missus Winnie s drawing room He did not see Montague but strode past his brows knit in thought and entered one of the elevators A moment later Montague heard a voice at his side How do you do mister Montague He turned It was mister Lyon the manager of the hotel whom Siegfried Harvey had once introduced to him Have you come to attend the conference said he Conference said Montague No There s a big meeting of the bankers here to night remarked the other It s not supposed to be known so don t mention it How do you do mister Ward he added to a man who went past That s David Ward Ah said Montague Ward was known in the Street by the nickname of Waterman s office boy He was a high salaried office boy Waterman paid him a hundred thousand a year to manage one of the big insurance companies for him So he s here is he said Montague Waterman is here himself said Lyon He came in by the side entrance It s something especially secret I gather they ve rented eight rooms upstairs all connecting Waterman will go in at one end and Duval at the other and so the reporters won t know they re together So that s the way they work it said Montague with a smile I ve been looking for some of the newspaper men Lyon added But they don t seem to have caught on He strolled away and Montague stood watching the people in the lobby He saw Jim Hegan come and enter the elevator in company with an elderly man whom he recognised as Bascom the president of the Empire Bank Waterman s own institution He saw two other men whom he knew as leading bankers of the System and then as he glanced toward the desk he saw a tall broad shouldered man who had been talking to the clerk turn around and reveal himself as his friend Bates of the Express Humph thought Montague The newspaper men are on after all He saw Bates s glance sweep the lobby and rest upon him Montague made a movement of greeting with his hand but Bates did not reply Instead he strolled toward him went by without looking at him and as he passed whispered in a low quick voice Please come into the writing room Montague stood for a moment wondering then he followed Bates went to a corner of the room and seated himself Montague joined him The reporter darted a quick glance about then began hastily Excuse me mister Montague I didn t want anyone to see us talking I want to ask you to do me a favour What is it I m running down a story It is something very important I can t explain it to you now but I want to get a certain room in this hotel You have an opportunity to do me the service of a lifetime I ll explain it to you as soon as we are alone What do you want me to do asked Montague I want to rent room four hundred and seven said Bates If I can t get four hundred and seven I want five hundred and seven or six hundred and seven I daren t ask for it myself because the clerk knows me But he ll let you have it But how shall I ask for it said Montague Just ask said Bates it will be all right Montague looked at him He could see that his friend was labouring under great excitement Please please he whispered putting his hand on Montague s arm And Montague said All right He got up and strolled into the lobby again and went to the desk Good evening mister Montague said the clerk mister Harvey hasn t returned I know it said Montague I would like to get a room for the evening I would like to be near a friend Could I get a room on the fourth floor Fourth said the clerk and turned to look at his schedule on the wall Whereabouts front or back Have you four hundred and five asked Montague Four hundred and five No that s rented We have four hundred and one four hundred and six on the other side of the hall four hundred and seven I ll take four hundred and seven said Montague Four dollars a day said the clerk as he took down the key Not having any baggage Montague paid in advance and followed the boy to the elevator Bates followed him and another man a little wiry chap carrying a dress suit case also entered with them and got out at the fourth floor The boy opened the door and the three men entered the room The boy turned on the light and proceeded to lower the shades and the windows and to do enough fixing to earn his tip Then he went out closing the door behind him and Bates sank upon the bed and put his hands to his forehead and gasped Oh my God The young man who accompanied him had set down his suit case and he now sat down on one of the chairs and proceeded to lean back and laugh hilariously Montague stood staring from one to the other My God my God said Bates again I hope I may never go through with a job like this I believe my hair will be grey before morning You forget that you haven t told me yet what s the matter said Montague Sure enough said Bates And suddenly he sat up and stared at him mister Montague he exclaimed don t go back on us You ve no idea how I ve been working and it will be the biggest scoop of a lifetime Promise me that you won t give us away I cannot promise you said Montague laughing in spite of himself until you tell me what it is I m afraid you are not going to like it said Bates It was a mean trick to play on you but I was desperate I didn t dare take the risk myself and Rodney wasn t dressed for the occasion You haven t introduced your friend said Montague Oh excuse me said Bates mister Rodney one of our office men And now tell me about it said Montague taking a seat It s the conference said Bates We got a tip about it an hour or so ago They meet in the room underneath us What of it asked Montague We want to find out what s going on said Bates But how Through the window We ve got a rope here And Bates pointed toward the suitcase Montague stared at him dumfounded A rope he gasped You are going to let him down from the window Sure thing said Bates it s a rear window and quite safe But for Heaven s sake man gasped the other suppose the rope breaks Oh it won t break was the reply we ve got the right sort of rope But how will you ever get him up again Montague exclaimed That s all right said Bates he can climb up or else we can let him down to the ground We ve got rope enough But suppose he loses his grip Suppose That s all right said Bates easily You leave that to Rodney He s nimble he began life as a steeple jack That s why I picked him Rodney grinned I ll take my chances he said Montague gazed from one to the other unable to think of another word to say Tell me mister Bates he asked finally do you often do this in your profession I ve done it once before was the reply I wanted some photographs in a murder case I ve often tried back windows and fire escapes and such things I used to be a police reporter you know and I learned bad habits But said Montague suppose you were caught Oh pshaw said he The office would soon fix that up The police never bother a newspaper man There was a pause mister Montague said Bates earnestly I know this is a tough proposition but think what it means We get word about this conference Waterman is here and Duval think of that Dan Waterman and the Oil Trust getting together The managing editor sent for me himself and he said Bates get that story And what am I to do There s about as much chance of my finding out what goes on in that conference He stopped Think of what it may mean mister Montague he cried They will decide on to morrow s moves It may turn the stock market upside down Think of what you could do with the information No said Montague shaking his head don t go at me that way Bates was gazing at him I beg your pardon he said but then maybe you have interests of your own or your friends surely this situation No not that either said Montague smiling and Bates broke into a laugh Well then he said just for the sport of it Just to fool them That s more like it said Montague Of course it s your room said Bates You can stop us if you insist But you needn t stay if you don t want to We ll take all the risk and you may be sure that if we were caught the hotel would suppress it You can trust me to clear your name I ll stay said Montague I ll see it through Bates jumped up and stretched out his hand Good he cried Put it there In the meantime Rodney pounced upon the dress suit case and opened it taking out a coil of wire rope very light and flexible and a short piece of board He proceeded to make a loop with the rope and in this he fixed the board for a seat He then took the blankets from the bed and folded them He took out a pair of heavy calfskin gloves which he tossed to Bates and a ball of twine one end of which he tied about his wrist He tossed the ball on the floor and then turned out the lights in the room raised the shade of the window and placed the bundle of blankets upon the sill All ready he said Bates put on the gloves and seized the rope and Rodney adjusted the seat under his thighs You hold the blankets if you will be so good mister Montague and keep them in place if you can And Bates uncoiled some of the rope and passed it over the top of the large bureau which stood beside the window He brought the rope down to the middle of the body of the bureau so that by this means he could diminish the pull of Rodney s weight Steady now said the latter and he climbed over the sill and holding on with his hands gradually put his weight against the rope Now All ready he whispered Bates grasped the line and bracing his knees against the bureau paid the rope out inch by inch Montague held the blankets in place in the corner and Rodney s shoulders and head gradually disappeared below the sill He was still holding on with his hands however All right he whispered and let go and slowly the rope slid past Montague s heart was beating fast with excitement but Bates was calm and businesslike After he had let out several turns of the rope he stopped and whispered Look out now Montague leaned over the sill He could see a stream of light from the window below him Rodney was standing upon the cornice at the top of the window Lower said Montague as he drew in his head and once more Bates paid out Now he whispered and Montague looked again Rodney had cleverly pushed himself by the corner of the cornice and kept himself at one side of the window so that he would not be visible from the inside of the room He made a frantic signal with his hand and Montague drew back and whispered Lower The next time he looked out Rodney was standing upon the sill of the window leaning to one side Now make fast muttered Bates And while he held the rope Montague took it and wound it again around the bureau and then carried it over and made it fast to the leg of the bath tub I guess that will hold all right said Bates and he went to the window and picked up the ball of cord the other end of which was tied around Rodney s wrist This is for signals he said Morse telegraph Good heavens gasped Montague You didn t leave much to chance Couldn t afford to said Bates Keep still Montague saw that the hand which held the cord was being jerked W i n d o w o p e n said Bates and added By the Lord we ve got them CHAPTER XIX Montague brought a couple of chairs and the two seated themselves at the window for a long wait How did you learn about this conference asked Montague Be careful whispered the other in his ear We mustn t make a noise because Rodney will need quiet to hear them Montague saw that the cord was jerking again Bates spelled out the letters one by one W a t e r m a n D u v a l He s telling us who s there David Ward Hegan Prentice Prentice whispered Montague Why he s up in the Adirondacks He came down on a special train to day whispered the other Ward telegraphed him I think that s where we got our tip Henry Patterson He s the real head of the Oil Trust now Bascom of the Empire Bank He s Waterman s man You can imagine from that list that there s something big going on Bates muttered and he spelled the names of several other bankers heads of the most important institutions in Wall Street Talking about Stewart spelled out Rodney That s ancient history muttered Bates He s a dead one P r i c e spelled Rodney Price exclaimed Montague Yes said the other I saw him down in the lobby I rather thought he d come But to a conference with Waterman exclaimed Montague That s all right said Bates Why not But they are deadly enemies Oh said the other you don t want to let yourself believe things like that What do you mean protested Montague Do you suppose they re not enemies I certainly do suppose it said Bates But man I can give you positive facts that prove they are For every fact that you bring laughed the other I can bring half a dozen to show you they are not But that is perfectly absurd began Montague Hush said Bates and he waited while the string jerked I c e spelled Rodney That s Cummings another dead one said Bates My Lord but they did him up brown Who did it asked Montague Waterman answered the other The Steamship Trust was competing with his New England railroads and now it s in the hands of a receiver Before long you ll hear that he s gathered it in Then you think this last smash up was planned said he Planned My Heavens man it was the greatest gobbling up of the little fish that I have ever known since I ve been in Wall Street And it was Waterman With the Oil Trust They were after young Stewart You see he beat them out in Montana and they had to buy him off for ten million dollars But he was fool enough to come to New York and go in for banking and now they ve got his banks and a good part of his ten millions as well It takes a man s breath away said Montague Just save your breath you ll need it to night said Bates drily The other sat in thought for a moment We were talking about Price he whispered Do you mean John S Price There is only one Price that I know of was the reply And you don t believe that he and Waterman are enemies I mean that Price is simply one of Waterman s agents in every big thing he does But man Doesn t he own the Mississippi Steel Company He owns it for Waterman said Bates But that is impossible cried Montague Isn t Waterman interested in the Steel Trust And isn t Mississippi Steel its chief competitor It is supposed to be said the other But that is simply a bluff to fool the public There has been no real competition between them ever since four years ago when Price raided the stock and captured it for Waterman Montague was staring at his friend almost speechless with amazement mister Bates he said it happens that I was very recently connected with Price and the Mississippi Steel Company in a very intimate way and I know most positively that what you say is not true It s very hard to answer a statement like that Bates responded I d have to know just what your facts are But they d have to be very convincing indeed to make an impression upon me for I ran that story down pretty thoroughly I got it straight from the inside and I got all the details of it I nailed Price down right in his own office The only trouble was that my people wouldn t print the facts It was some time before Montague spoke again He was groping around in his own mind trying to grasp the significance of what Bates had said But Price was fighting Waterman he whispered The whole crowd were fighting him That was the whole purpose of what they were doing It had no sense otherwise But are you sure asked the other Think it over Suppose they were only pretending to fight There was a silence again Mind you Bates added I am only speaking about Price himself I don t know about any people he may have been with He may have been deceiving them he may have been leading them into a trap And suddenly Montague clutched the arms of his chair He sat staring ahead of him struck dumb by the thought which the other s words had brought to him My God he gasped and again and yet again My God It seemed to unroll before him in vista after vista Price deceiving Ryder leading him into that Northern Mississippi deal getting him to lend money upon the stock of the Mississippi Steel Company promising perhaps to support the stock in the market and helping to smash it instead Twisting Ryder around his finger crushing him and why And why Montague s thoughts stopped still It was as if he had found himself suddenly confronted by a bottomless abyss He shrank back from it He could not face the thought in his own mind Waterman It was Dan Waterman It was something which he had planned It was the vengeance that he had threatened He had been all this time plotting it setting his nets about Ryder s feet It was an idea so wild and so horrible that Montague fought it off He pushed it away from him again and again No no it could not be And yet why not He had always felt certain in his own mind that that detective had come from Waterman The old man had set to work to find out about Lucy and her affairs the first time that he had ever laid eyes on her And then suddenly Montague saw the face of volcanic fury that had flashed past him on board the Bruennhilde You will hear from me again the old man had said and now all these months of silence and at last he heard Why not Why not Montague kept asking himself After all what did he know about the Mississippi Steel Company What had he ever seen to prove that it was actually competing with the Trust What had he even heard except what Stanley Ryder had told him and what more likely than that Ryder was simply repeating what Price had said Montague had forgotten all about his present situation in the rush of thoughts which had come to him The cord had been jerking again and had spelled out the names of several more of the masters of the city who had arrived but he had not heard their names What object would there be he asked in keeping the fact a secret I mean that Price was Waterman s agent Object exclaimed Bates Good Heavens and with the public half crazy about monopolies and the President making such a fight If it were known that the Steel Trust had gathered in its last big competitor you can t tell what the Government might do I see said Montague And how long has this been Four years was the reply all they re waiting for is some occasion like this when they can put the Company in a hole and pose as benefactors in taking it over I see said Montague again Listen said Bates and leaned out of the window He could catch faintly the sounds of a deep voice in the consultation room W a t e r m a n spelled Rodney I guess business has begun whispered Bates Situation intolerable spelled Rodney End wildcat banking That means end of opposition to me was the other s comment Duval assents continued Rodney The two in the window were on edge by this time It was tantalising to have to wait several minutes and then get only such snatches But they ll get past the speech making pretty soon whispered Bates and indeed they did The next two words which the cord spelled out made Montague sit up and clutch the arms of his chair again Gotham Trust Ah whispered Bates Montague made not a sound Ryder misusing spelled the cord Bates seized his companion by the arm and leaned close to him By the Lord he whispered breathlessly I wonder if they re going to smash the Gotham Trust Refuse clearing spelled Rodney and Montague felt Bates s hand trembling They refuse to clear for Ryder he panted Montague was beyond all speech he sat as if turned to stone To morrow morning spelled the cord Bates could hardly keep still for his excitement Do you catch what that means he whispered The Clearing house is to throw out the Gotham Trust Why they ll wreck it panted the other My God my God they re mad cried Bates Don t they realise what they ll do There ll be a panic such as New York has never seen before It will bring down every bank in the city The Gotham Trust Think of it the Gotham Trust Prentice objects came Rodney s next message Objects exclaimed Bates striking his knee in repressed excitement I should think he might object If the Gotham Trust goes down the Trust Company of the Republic won t live for twenty four hours Afraid spelled the cord Patterson angry Much he has to lose muttered Bates Montague started up and began to pace the room Oh this is horrible horrible he exclaimed Through all the images of the destruction and suffering which Bates s words brought up before him his thoughts flew back to a pale and sad faced little woman sitting alone in an apartment up on the Riverside It was to her that it all came back it was for her that this terrible drama was being enacted Montague could picture the grim hawk faced old man sitting at the head of the council board and laying down the law to the masters of the Metropolis And this man s thoughts too went back to Lucy his and Montague s alone of all those who took part in the struggle Waterman protect Prentice spelled Rodney Insist turn out Ryder Withdraw funds There s no doubt of it whispered Bates they can finish him if they choose But oh my Lord what will happen in New York to morrow Ward protect legitimate banks was the next message The little whelp sneered Bates By legitimate banks he means those that back his syndicates A lot of protecting he will do But then the newspaper man in Bates rose to the surface Oh what a story he whispered clenching his hands and pounding his knees Oh what a story Montague carried away but a faint recollection of the rest of Rodney s communications he was too much overwhelmed by his own thoughts Bates however continued to spell out the words and he caught the statement that General Prentice who was a director in the Gotham Trust was to vote against any plan to close the doors of that institution While they were after it they were going to finish it Also he caught the sentence Panic useful curb President And he heard Bates s excited exclamations over that Did you catch that he cried That s Waterman Oh the nerve of it We are in at the making of history to night mister Montague Perhaps half an hour later Montague standing beside Bates saw his hand jerked violently several times That means pull up cried he Quick And he seized the rope Put your weight on it he whispered It will hold They proceeded to haul Rodney helped them by catching hold of the cornice of the window and lifting himself Then there was a moment of great straining during which Montague held his breath after which the weight grew lighter again Rodney had got his knees upon the cornice A few moments later his fingers appeared clutching the edge of the sill He swung himself up and Montague and Bates grasped him under the arms and fairly jerked him into the room He staggered to his feet and there was a moment s pause while all three caught their breath Then Rodney leaped at Bates and grasped him by the shoulders Old man he cried We landed them We landed them We landed them laughed the other in exultation Oh what a scoop shouted Rodney There was never one like it The two were like schoolboys in their glee They hugged each other and laughed and danced about But it was not long before they became serious again Montague turned on the lights and pulled down the window and Rodney stood there with his clothing dishevelled and his face ablaze with excitement and talked to them Oh you can t imagine that scene he said It makes my hair stand on end to think of it Just fancy I was not more than twenty feet from Dan Waterman and most of the time he seemed to be glaring right at me I hardly dared wink for fear he d notice and I thought every instant he would jump up and run to the window But there he sat and pounded on the table and glared about at those fellows and laid down the law to them I ve heard him talk said Bates I know how it is Why he fairly knocked them over said the other You could have heard a pin drop when he got through Oh it was a mad thing to see I ve hardly been able to get my breath said Bates I can t believe it They have no idea what it will mean said Montague They know said Rodney but they don t care They ve smelt blood That s about the size of it they were like a lot of hounds on the trail You should have seen Waterman with that lean hungry face of his The time has come said he There s no one here but has known that sooner or later this work had to be done We must crush them once and for all time And you should have seen him turn on Prentice when he ventured a word Prentice doesn t like it then asked Montague I should think he wouldn t put in Bates Waterman said he d protect him said Rodney But he must place himself absolutely in their hands It seems that the Trust Company of the Republic has a million dollars with the Gotham Trust and that s to be withdrawn Imagine it gasped Bates And wait exclaimed the other then they got on to politics I would have given one arm if I could have got a photograph of Dan Waterman at that moment just to spread it before the American people and ask them what they thought of it David Ward had made the remark that A little trouble mightn t have a bad effect just now And Waterman brought down his fist on the table This country needs a lesson he cried There s been too much abuse of responsible men and there s been too much wild talk in high places If the people get a little taste of hard times they ll have something else to think about besides abusing those who have made the prosperity of the country and it seems to me gentlemen that we have it in our power to put an end to this campaign of radicalism Think of it think of it gasped Bates The old devil And then Duval chimed in with a laugh To put it in a nutshell gentlemen we are going to smash Ryder and scare the President Was the conference over asked Bates after a moment s pause All but the hand shakes said the other I didn t dare to stay while they were moving about And Bates started suddenly to his feet Come he said We haven t any time to waste Our work isn t done yet by a long sight He proceeded to untie the rope and coil it up Rodney took the blanket and put it on the bed covering it with the spread so as to conceal the holes which had been worn by the rope He wound up the ball of cord and dropped it into the bag with the rest of the stuff Bates took his hat and coat and started for the door You will excuse us mister Montague he said You can understand that this story will need a lot of work I understand said Montague We ll try to thank you by and by added the other Come around after the paper goes to press and we ll have a celebration CHAPTER XX They went out and Montague waited a minute or two to give them a chance to get out of the way and then he rang the elevator bell and entered the car It stopped again at the next floor and he gave a start of excitement As the door opened he saw a group of men with Duval Ward and General Prentice among them He moved behind the elevator man so that none of them should notice him Montague had caught one glimpse of the face of General Prentice It was deathly pale The General said not a word to anyone but went out into the corridor The other hesitated for a moment then with a sudden resolution he turned and followed As his friend passed out of the door he stepped up beside him Good evening General he said The General turned and stared at him half in a daze Oh Montague he said How are you Very well said Montague In the street outside among a group of half a dozen automobiles he recognised the General s limousine car Where are you going he asked Home was the reply I ll ride with you if you like said Montague I ve something to say to you All right said the General He could not very well have refused for Montague had taken him by the arm and started toward the car he did not intend to be put off He helped the General in got in himself and shut to the door behind him Prentice sat staring in front of him still half in a daze Montague watched him for a minute or so Then suddenly he leaned toward him and said General why do you let them persuade you to do it Hey said the other I say repeated Montague why do you let them persuade you The other turned and stared at him with a startled look in his eyes I know all about what has happened said Montague I know what went on at that conference What do you mean gasped the General I know what they made you promise to do They are going to wreck the Gotham Trust Company The General was dumfounded Why he gasped How Who told you How could you Montague had to wait a minute or two until his friend had got over his dismay I cannot help it he burst out finally What can I do You can refuse to play their game exclaimed Montague But don t you suppose that they would do it just the same And how long do you suppose that I would last if I refused them But think of what it means cried Montague Think of the ruin You will bring everything about your head I know I know cried the General in a voice of anguish Don t think that I haven t realised it don t think that I haven t fought against it But I am helpless utterly helpless He turned upon Montague and caught his sleeve with a trembling hand I never thought that I would live to face such an hour he exclaimed To despise myself to be despised by all the world To be browbeaten and insulted and dragged about The old man paused choking with excess of emotion Look at me he cried with sudden vehemence Look at me You think that I am a man a person of influence in the community the head of a great institution in which thousands of people have faith But I am nothing of the kind I am a puppet I am a sham I am a disgrace to myself and to the name I bear And suddenly he clasped his hands over his face and bowed his head so that Montague should not see his grief There was a long silence Montague was dumb with horror He felt that his mere presence was an outrage Finally the General looked up again He clenched his hand and mastered himself I have chosen my part he said I must play it through What I feel about it makes no difference Montague again said nothing I have no right to inflict my grief upon you the General continued I have no right to try to excuse myself There is no turning back now I am Dan Waterman s man and I do his bidding But how can you have got into such a position asked Montague A friend of mine organised the Trust Company of the Republic He asked me to become president because I had a name that would be useful to him I accepted he was a man I knew I could trust I managed the business properly and it prospered and then three years ago the control was bought by other men That was when the crisis came I should have resigned But I had my family to think of I had friends who were involved I had interests that I could not leave And I stayed and that is all I found that I had stayed to be a puppet a figurehead And now it is too late But can t you withdraw now asked Montague Now echoed the General Now in the most critical moment when all my friends are hanging upon me There is nothing that my enemies would like better for they could lay all their sins at my door They would class me with Stewart and Ryder I see said Montague in a low voice And now the crisis comes and I find out who my real master is I am told to do this and do that and I do it There are no threats I understand without any Oh my God mister Montague if I should tell you of some of the things that I have seen in this city of the indignities that I have seen heaped upon men of the deeds to which I have seen them driven Men whom you think of as the most honourable in the community men who have grown grey in the service of the public It is too brutal too horrible for words There was a long silence And there is nothing you can do asked Montague Nothing he answered Tell me General is your institution sound Perfectly sound And you have done nothing improper Nothing Then why should you fear Waterman Why exclaimed the General Because I am liable for eighty per cent of my deposits and I have only five per cent of reserves I see said Montague It is a choice between Stanley Ryder and myself added the other And Stanley Ryder will have to fight his own battle There was nothing more said Each of the men sat buried in his own thoughts and the only sound was the hum of the automobile as it sped up Broadway Montague was working out another course of action He moved to another seat in the car where he could see the numbers upon the street lamps as they flashed by and at last he touched the General upon the knee I will leave you at the next corner he said The General pressed the button which signalled his chauffeur and the car drew up at the curb Montague descended Good night General he said Good night said the other in a faint voice He did not offer to take Montague s hand The latter closed the door of the car and it sped away up the street Then he crossed over and went down to the River drive and entered Lucy s apartment house Is missus Taylor in he asked of the clerk I ll see said the man Montague gave his name and added Tell her it is very important Lucy came to the door herself clad in an evening gown One glance at his haggard face was enough to tell her that something was wrong What is it Allan she cried He hung up his hat and coat and went into the drawing room What is it Allan she cried again Lucy do you know where Stanley Ryder is he asked Yes she answered and added quickly Oh it s some bad news It is said he He must be found at once She stared at him for a moment hesitating then her anxiety overcoming every other emotion she said He is in the next room Call him said Montague Lucy ran to the door Come in Quickly she called and Ryder appeared Montague saw that he was very pale and there was nothing left of his air of aristocratic serenity mister Ryder he began I have just come into possession of some news which concerns you very closely I felt that you ought to know There is to be a directors meeting to morrow morning at which it is to be decided that the bank which clears for the Gotham Trust Company will discontinue to do it Ryder started as if he had been shot his face turned grey There was no sound except a faint cry of fright from Lucy My information is quite positive continued Montague It has been determined to wreck your institution Ryder caught at a chair to support himself Who Who he stammered It is Duval and Waterman said Montague Dan Waterman It was Lucy who spoke Montague turned to look at her and saw her eyes wide open with terror Yes Lucy he said Oh oh she gasped choking then suddenly she cried wildly Tell me I don t understand what does it mean It means that I am ruined exclaimed Ryder Ruined she echoed Absolutely he said They ve got me I knew they were after me but I didn t think they d dare He ended with a furious imprecation but Montague had kept his eyes fixed upon Lucy It was her suffering that he cared about He heard her whisper under her breath It s for me And then again It s for me Lucy he began but suddenly she put up her hand and rushed toward him Hush he doesn t know she panted breathlessly I haven t told him And then she turned toward Ryder again Oh surely there must be some way she cried wildly Surely Ryder had sunk down in a chair and buried his face in his hands Ruined he exclaimed Utterly ruined I won t have a dollar left in the world No no cried Lucy it cannot be And she put her hands to her forehead striving to think It must be stopped I ll go and see him I ll plead with him You must not Lucy cried Montague starting toward her But again she whirled upon him Not a word she whispered with fierce intensity Not a word And she rushed into the next room and half a minute later came back with her hat and wrap Allan she said tell them to call me a cab He tried to protest again but she would not hear him You can ride with me she said You can talk then Call me a cab Please save me that trouble He gave the message and Lucy meanwhile stood in the middle of the room twisting her hands together nervously Now Allan go downstairs she said wait for me there And after another glance at the broken figure of Ryder he took his hat and coat and obeyed Montague spent his time pacing back and forth in the entrance hall The cab arrived and a minute later Lucy appeared wearing a heavy veil She went straight to the vehicle and sprang in and Montague followed She gave the driver the address of Waterman s great marble palace over by the park and the cab started Then suddenly she turned upon Montague speaking swiftly and intensely I know what you are going to say she cried But you must spare me and you must spare yourself I am sorry that you should have to know this God knows that I could not help it But it cannot be undone And there is no other way out of it I must go to him and try to save Ryder Lucy he began listen to me I don t want to listen to you she cried wildly almost hysterically I cannot bear to be argued with It is too hard for me as it is But think of the practical side of it he cried Do you imagine that you can stop this huge machine that Waterman has set in motion I don t know I don t know she exclaimed choking back a sob I can only do what I can If he has any spark of feeling in him I ll get down on my knees to him I will beg him But Lucy think of what you are doing You go there to his house at night You put yourself into his power I don t care Allan I am not afraid of him I have thought about myself too long Now I must think about the man I love Montague did not answer for a moment Lucy he said at last will you tell me how you have thought of yourself in one single thing Yes yes I will she cried vehemently I have known all along that Waterman was following me I have been haunted by the thought of him I have felt his power in everything that has befallen us And I have never once told Ryder of his peril That was more a kindness to him began the other No no panted Lucy and she caught his coat sleeve in her trembling hands You see you see you cannot even imagine it of me I kept it a secret because I was afraid Afraid he echoed I was afraid that Ryder would leave me I was afraid that he would give me up And I loved him too much Now she rushed on you see what kind of a person I have been And I can sit here and tell you that Is there anything that can make me ashamed after that Is there anything that can degrade me after that And what is there left for me to do but go to Waterman and try to undo what I have done Montague was speechless before the agony of her humiliation You see she whispered Lucy he began protesting But suddenly she caught him by the arm Allan she whispered I know that you have to try to stop me But it is no use and I must do it And I cannot bear to hear you it makes it too hard for me My course is chosen and nothing in the world can turn me and I want you to go away and leave me I want you to go right now I am not afraid of Waterman I am not afraid of anything that he can do I am only afraid of you and your unhappiness I want you to leave me to my fate I want you to stop thinking about me I cannot do it Lucy he said She reached up and pulled the signal cord and the cab came to a halt I want you to get out Allan she cried wildly Please get out and go away He started to protest again but she pushed him away in frenzy Go go she cried and half dazed and scarcely realising what he did he gave way to her and stepped out into the street Drive she called to the man and shut the door and Montague found himself standing on a driveway in the park with the lights of the cab disappearing around a turn CHAPTER XXI Montague started to walk He had no idea where he went his mind was in a whirl and he was lost to everything about him He must have spent a couple of hours wandering about the park and the streets of the city when at last he stopped and looked about him he was on a lighted thoroughfare and a big clock in front of a jewellery store was pointing to the hour of two He looked around Immediately across the street was a building which he recognised as the office of the Express and in a flash he thought of Bates Come in after the paper has gone to press the latter had said He went in and entered the elevator I want to see mister Bates a reporter he said City room said the elevator man eleventh floor Montague confronted a very cross and sleepy looking office boy Is mister Bates in he asked I dunno said the boy and slowly let himself down from the table upon which he had been sitting Montague produced a card and the boy disappeared This way he said when he returned and Montague found himself in a huge room crowded with desks and chairs Everything was in confusion the floor was literally buried out of sight in paper Montague observed that there were only about a dozen men in the room and several of these were putting on their coats There he is over there said the office boy He looked and saw Bates sitting at a desk with his head buried in his arms Tired he thought to himself Hello Bates he said then as the other looked up he gave a start of dismay What s the matter he cried It was half a minute before Bates replied His voice was husky They sold me out he whispered What gasped the other They sold me out repeated Bates and struck the table in front of him Cut out the story by God Did me out of my scoop Look at that sir he added and shoved toward Montague a double column of newspaper proofs with a huge head line Gotham Trust Company to be Wrecked and the words scrawled across in blue pencil Killed by orders from the office Montague could scarcely find words to reply He drew up a chair and sat down Tell me about it he said There s nothing much to tell said Bates They sold me out They wouldn t print it But why didn t you take it elsewhere asked the other Too late said Bates the scoundrels they never even let me know He poured out his rage in a string of curses Then he told Montague the story I was in here at half past ten he said and I reported to the managing editor He was crazy with delight and told me to go ahead front page double column and all the rest So Rodney and I set to work He did the interview and I did all the embroidery oh my God but it was a story And it was read and went through and then an hour or two ago just when the forms were ready in comes old Hodges he s one of the owners you know and begins nosing round What s this he cries and reads the story and then he goes to the managing editor They almost had a fight over it No paper that I am interested in shall ever print a story like that says Hodges and the managing editor threatens to resign but he can t budge him The first thing I knew of it was when I got this copy and the paper had already gone to press What do you suppose was the reason for it asked Montague in wonder Reason echoed Bates The reason is Hodges he s a crook If we publish that story he said the directors of the bank will never meet and we ll bear the onus of having wrecked the Gotham Trust Company But that s all a bluff and he knew it we could prove that that conference took place if it ever came to a fight You were quite safe it seems to me said Montague Safe echoed Bates We had the greatest scoop that a newspaper ever had in this country if only the Express were a newspaper But Hodges isn t publishing the news you see he s serving his masters whoever they are I knew that it meant trouble when he bought into the Express He used to be managing editor of the Gazette you know and he made his fortune selling the policy of that paper its financial news is edited to this very hour in the offices of Wyman s bankers and I can prove it to anybody who wants me to That s the sort of proposition a man s up against and what s the use of gathering the news And Bates rose up with an oath kicking away the chair behind him Come on he said let s get out of here I don t know that I ll ever come back Montague spent another hour wandering about with Bates listening to his opinion of the newspapers of the Metropolis Then utterly exhausted he went home but not to sleep He sat in a chair for an hour or two his mind besieged by images of ruin and destruction At last he lay down but he had not closed his eyes when daylight began to stream into the room At eight o clock he was up again and at the telephone He called up Lucy s apartment house I want to speak to missus Taylor he said She is not in was the reply Will you ring up the apartment asked Montague I will speak to the maid This is mister Montague he said when he heard the woman s voice Where is missus Taylor She has not come back sir was the reply Montague had some work before him that day which could not be put off Accordingly he bathed and shaved and had some coffee in his room and then set out for his office Even at that early hour there were crowds in the financial district and another day s crop of rumours had begun to spring He heard nothing about the Gotham Trust Company but when he left court at lunch time the newsboys on the street were shouting the announcement of the action of the bank directors Lucy had failed in her errand then the blow had fallen There was almost a panic on the Exchange that day and the terror and anxiety upon the faces of the people who thronged the financial district were painful to see But the courts did not suspend even on account of the Gotham Trust and Montague had an important case to argue He came out on the street late in the afternoon and though it was after banking hours he saw crowds in front of a couple of the big trust companies and he read in the papers that a run upon the Gotham Trust had begun At his office he found a telegram from his brother Oliver who was still in the Adirondacks Money in Trust Company of the Republic Notify me of the slightest sign of trouble He replied that there was none and as he rode up in the subway he thought the problem over and made up his own mind He had a trifle over sixty thousand dollars in Prentice s institution more than half of all he owned He had Prentice s word for it that the Company was in a sound condition and he believed it He made up his mind that he would not be one of those to be stampeded whatever might happen He dined quietly at home with his mother then he took his way up town again to Lucy s apartment for he was haunted by the thought of her and could not rest He had read in the late evening papers that Stanley Ryder had resigned from the Gotham Trust Company Is missus Taylor in he asked and gave his name missus Taylor says will you please to wait sir was the reply And Montague sat down in the reception room A couple of minutes later the hall boy brought him a note He opened it and read these words in a trembling hand Dear Allan It is good of you to try to help me but I cannot bear it Please go away I do not want you to think about me Lucy Montague could read the agony between those lines but there was nothing he could do about it He went over to Broadway and started to walk down town He felt that he must have someone to talk to to take his mind off these things He thought of the Major and went over to the club but the storm had routed out even the Major it appeared He was just off to attend some conference and had only time to shake hands with Montague and tell him to trim sail Then he thought of Bates and went down to the office of the Express He found Bates hard at work seated at a table in his shirt sleeves and with stacks of papers around him I can always spare time for a chat he said as Montague offered to go I see you came back observed the other I m like an old horse in a tread mill answered Bates What else is there for me to do He leaned back in his chair and put his thumbs in his armholes Well he remarked they made their killing They did indeed said Montague And they re not satisfied yet exclaimed the other They re on another trail What cried Montague Listen said Bates I went in to see David Ward about the action of the Clearinghouse Committee Gary he s the Despatch man was with me Ward talked for half an hour as he always does he told us all about the gallant efforts which the bankers were making to stem the tide and he told us that the Trust Company of the Republic was in danger and that an agreement had been made to try to save it Mind you there s not been the least sign of trouble for the company Shall we print that asked Gary Surely said Ward But it will make trouble said Gary That s all right said Ward It s a fact So print it Now what do you think of that Montague sat rigid But I thought they had promised to protect Prentice he exclaimed Yes said Bates grimly and now they throw him down Do you suppose Waterman knew that Why of course Ward is no more than one of his clerks And will the Despatch print it do you suppose I don t know why not said the other I asked Gary if he was going to put it in and he said Yes It will make another panic I said and he answered Panics are news Montague said nothing for a minute or two Finally he remarked I have good reason to believe that the Trust Company of the Republic is perfectly sound I have no doubt of it was the reply Then why He stopped Bates shrugged his shoulders Ask Waterman he said It s some quarrel or other he wants to put the screws on somebody Perhaps it s simply that two trust companies will scare the President more than one or perhaps it s some stock he wants to break I ve heard it said that he has seventy five millions laid by to pick up bargains with and I shouldn t wonder if it was true There was a moment s pause And by the way Bates added the Oil Trust has made another haul The Electric Manufacturing Company is in trouble that s a rival of one of their enterprises Doesn t it all fit together beautifully Montague thought for a moment or two This is rather important news to me he said I ve got money in the Trust Company of the Republic Do you suppose they are going to let it go down I talked it over with Rodney the other replied He says Waterman was quite explicit in his promises to see Prentice through And there s one thing you can say about old Dan for all his villainies he never breaks his word So I imagine he ll save it But then why give out this report exclaimed the lawyer Don t you see said Bates He wants a chance to save it Montague s jaw fell Oh he said It s as plain as the nose on your face said Bates That story will come out to morrow morning and everybody will say it was the blunder of a newspaper reporter and then Waterman will come forward and do the rescue act It ll be just like a play It s taking a long chance said Montague and added I had thought of telling Prentice who s an intimate friend of mine but I don t suppose it will do him any good Poor old Prentice can t help himself was the reply All you can do is to make him lose a night s sleep Montague went out with a new set of problems to ponder As he went home he passed the magnificent building of the Gotham Trust Company where there stood a long line of people who had prepared to spend the night All the afternoon a frantic mob had besieged the doors and millions of dollars had been withdrawn in a few hours Montague knew that by the time he got down town the next morning there would be another such mob in front of the Trust Company of the Republic but he was determined to stand by his own resolve However he had sent a telegram to Oliver warning him to return at once He went home and found there another letter from Lucy Dupree Dear Allan she wrote No doubt you have heard the news that Ryder has been forced out of the Gotham Trust But I have accomplished part of my purpose Waterman has promised that he will put him on his feet again after this trouble is over In the meantime I am told to go away This is for the best you will remember that you yourself urged me to go Ryder cannot see me because the newspaper reporters are following him so closely I beg of you not to try to find me I am hateful in my own sight and you will never see me again There is one last thing that you can do for me Go to Stanley Ryder and offer him your help I mean your advice in straightening out his affairs He has no friends now and he is in a desperate plight Do this for me Lucy CHAPTER XXII At eight the next morning the train from the Adirondacks arrived and Montague was awakened by his brother at the telephone Have you seen this morning s Despatch was Oliver s first word I haven t seen it said Montague but I know what s in it About the Trust Company of the Republic asked Oliver Yes said the other I was told the story before I telegraphed you But my God man cried Oliver then why aren t you down town I m going to let my money stay What I believe that the institution is sound and I am not going to leave Prentice in the lurch I telegraphed you so that you could do as you chose It was a moment or two before Oliver could find words to reply Thanks he said You might have done a little more sent somebody down to keep a place in line for me You re out of your mind but there s no time to talk about it now Good by And so he rang off Montague dressed and had his breakfast in the meantime he glanced over a copy of the Despatch where in the account of the day s events he found the fatal statements about the Trust Company of the Republic It was very interesting to Montague to read these newspapers and see the picture of events which they presented to the public They all told what they could not avoid telling that is the events which were public matters but they never by any chance gave a hint of the reasons for the happenings you would have supposed that all these upheavals in the banking world were so many thunderbolts which had fallen from the heavens above And each day they gave more of their space to insisting that the previous day s misfortunes were the last that by no chance could there be any more thunderbolts to fall When he went down town he rode one station farther than usual in order to pass the Trust Company of the Republic He found a line of people extending halfway round the block and in the minute that he stood watching there were a score or more added to it Police were patrolling up and down it was not many hours later that they were compelled to adopt the expedient of issuing numbered tickets to those who waited in the line Montague walked on toward the front looking for his brother But he had not gone very far before he gave an exclamation of amazement He saw a short stout grey haired figure which he recognised even by its back Major Venable he gasped The Major whirled about Montague he exclaimed My God you are just in time to save my life What do you want asked the other I want a chair gasped the Major whose purple features seemed about to burst with his unwonted exertions I ve been standing here for two hours In another minute more I should have sat down on the sidewalk Where can I get a chair asked Montague biting his tongue in order to repress his amusement Over on Broadway said the Major Go into one of the stores and make somebody sell you one Pay anything I don t care So Montague went back and entered a leather goods store where he saw several cane seated chairs He was free to laugh then all he pleased and he explained the situation to one of the clerks who demurred at five dollars but finally consented for ten dollars to take the risk of displeasing his employer For fifty cents more Montague found a boy to carry it and he returned in triumph to his venerable friend I never expected to see you in a position like this he remarked I thought you always knew things in advance By the Lord Montague muttered the other I ve got a quarter of a million in this place I ve got about one fourth as much myself said Montague What cried the Major Then what are you doing I m going to leave it in said Montague I have reason to know that that report in the Despatch is simply a blunder and that the institution is sound But man there ll be a run on it sputtered the old gentleman There will if everybody behaves like you You don t need your quarter of a million to pay for your lunch do you The Major was too much amazed to find a reply You put your money in a trust company the other continued and you know that it only keeps five per cent reserve and is liable to pay a hundred per cent of its deposits How can you expect it to do that I don t expect it said the Major grimly I expect to be among the five per cent And he cast his eye up the line and added I rather think I am Montague went on ahead and found his brother with only about a score of people ahead of him Apparently not many of the depositors of the Trust Company read their newspapers before eight o clock in the morning Do you want a chair too asked Montague I just got one for the Major Is he here too exclaimed Oliver Good Heavens No I don t want a chair he added I ll get through early But Allan tell me what in the world is the matter Do you really mean that your money is still in here It s here the other answered There s no use arguing about it come over to the office when you get your money I got the train just by half a minute said Oliver Poor Bertie Stuyvesant didn t get up in time and he s coming on a special he s got about three hundred thousand in here It was to pay for his new yacht I guess some of the yacht makers won t be quite so busy from now on remarked the other as he moved away That afternoon he heard the story of how General Prentice as a director of the Gotham Trust had voted that the institution should not close its doors and then as president of the Trust Company of the Republic had sent over and cashed a check for a million dollars None of the newspapers printed that story but it ran from mouth to mouth and was soon the jest of the whole city Men said that it was this act of treachery which had taken the heart out of the Gotham Trust Company directors and led to the closing of its doors Such was the beginning of the panic as Montague saw it It had all worked out beautifully according to the schedule The stock market was falling to pieces some of the leading stocks were falling several points between transactions and Wyman and Hegan and the Oil and Steel people were hammering the market and getting ready for the killing And at the same time representatives of Waterman in Washington were interviewing the President and setting before him the desperate plight of the Mississippi Steel Company Already the structure of the country s finances was tottering and here was one more big failure threatening Realising the desperate situation the Steel Trust was willing to do its part to save the country it would take over the Mississippi Steel Company provided only that the Government would not interfere The desired promise was given and so that last of Waterman s purposes was accomplished But there was one factor in the problem upon which few had reckoned and that was the vast public which furnished all the money for the game the people to whom dollars were not simply gamblers chips but to whom they stood for the necessities of life business men who must have them to pay their clerks on Saturday afternoon working men who needed them for rent and food helpless widows and orphans to whom they meant safety from starvation These unhappy people had no means of knowing that financial institutions which were perfectly sound and able to pay their depositors might be wrecked deliberately in a gamblers game When they heard that banks were tottering and were being besieged for money they concluded that there must be real danger that the long predicted crash must be at hand They descended upon Wall Street in hordes the whole financial district was packed with terrified crowds and squads of policemen rode through upon horseback in order to keep open the streets Somebody asked for a dollar was the way one banker phrased it Wall Street had been doing business with pieces of paper and now someone asked for a dollar and it was discovered that the dollar had been mislaid It was an experience for which the captains of finance were not entirely prepared they had forgotten the public It was like some great convulsion of nature which made mockery of all the powers of men and left the beholder dazed and terrified In Wall Street men stood as if in a valley and saw far up above them the starting of an avalanche they stood fascinated with horror and watched it gathering headway saw the clouds of dust rising up and heard the roar of it swelling and realised that it was a matter of only a second or two before it would be upon them and sweep them to destruction The lines of people before the Gotham Trust and the Trust Company of the Republic were now blocks in length and every hour one heard of runs upon new institutions There were women wringing their hands and crying in nervous excitement there were old people scarcely able to totter there were people who had risen from sick beds and who stood all through the day and night shivering in the keen October winds Runs had begun on the savings banks also over on the East Side the alarm had reached the ignorant foreign population It had spread with the speed of lightning all over the country already there were reports of runs in other cities and from thousands and tens of thousands of banks in East and South and West came demands upon the Metropolis for money And there was no money anywhere And so the masters of the Banking Trust realised to their annoyance that the monster which they had turned loose might get beyond their control Runs were beginning upon institutions in which they themselves were concerned In the face of madness such as this even the twenty five per cent reserves of the national banks would not be sufficient The moving of the cotton and grain crops had taken hundreds of millions from New York and there was no money to be got by any chance from abroad Everywhere they turned they faced this appalling scarcity of money nothing could be sold no money could be borrowed The few who had succeeded in getting their cash were renting safe deposit boxes and hiding the actual coin And so all their purposes having been accomplished the bankers set to work to stem the tide Frantic telegrams were sent to Washington and the Secretary of the Treasury deposited six million dollars in the national banks of the Metropolis and then came on himself to consult Men turned to Dan Waterman who was everywhere recognised as the master of the banking world The rivalry of the different factions ceased in the presence of this peril and Waterman became suddenly a king with practically absolute control of the resources of every bank in the city Even the Government placed itself in his hands the Secretary of the Treasury became one of his clerks and bank presidents and financiers came crowding into his office like panic stricken children Even the proudest and most defiant men like Wyman and Hegan took his orders and listened humbly to his tirades All these events were public history and one might follow them day by day in the newspapers Waterman s earlier acts had been planned and carried out in darkness No one knew no one had the faintest suspicion But now newspaper reporters attended the conferences and trailed Waterman about wherever he went and the public was invited to the wonderful spectacle of this battle worn veteran rousing himself for one last desperate campaign and saving the honour and credit of the country The public hung upon his lightest word praying for his success The Secretary of the Treasury sat in the Sub Treasury building near his office and poured out the funds of the Government under his direction Thirty two million dollars in all were thus placed with the national banks and from all these institutions Waterman drew the funds which he poured into the vaults of the imperilled banks and trust companies It was a time when one man s peril was every man s and none might stand alone And Waterman was a despot imperious and terrible I have taken care of my bank said one president and I intend to shut myself up in it and wait until the storm is over If you do Waterman retorted I will build a wall around you and you will never get out of it again And so the banker contributed the necessary number of millions The fight centred around the imperilled Trust Company of the Republic It was recognised by everyone that if Prentice s institution went down it would mean defeat Longer and longer grew the line of waiting depositors the vaults were nearly empty The cashiers adopted the expedient of paying very slowly they would take half an hour or more to investigate a single check and thus they kept going until more money arrived The savings banks of the city agreed unanimously to close their doors availing themselves of their legal right to demand sixty days before paying The national banks resorted to the expedient of paying with clearing house certificates The newspapers preached confidence and cheered the public even the newsboys were silenced so that their shrill cries might no longer increase the public excitement Groups of mounted policemen swept up and down the streets keeping the crowds upon the move And so at last came the fateful Thursday the climax of the panic A pall seemed to have fallen upon Wall Street Men ran here and there bareheaded and pale with fright Upon the floor of the Stock Exchange men held their breath The market was falling to pieces All sales had stopped one might quote any price one chose for it was impossible to borrow a dollar Interest rates had gone to one hundred and fifty per cent to two hundred per cent a man might have offered a thousand per cent for a large sum and not obtained it The brokers stood about gazing at each other in utter despair Such an hour had never before been known All this time the funds of the Government had been withheld from the Exchange The Government must not help the gamblers everyone insisted But now had come the moment when it seemed that the Exchange must be closed Thousands of firms would be ruined the business of the country would be paralysed There came word that the Pittsburg Exchange had closed So once more the terrified magnates crowded into Waterman s office Once more the funds of the Government were poured into the banks and from the banks they came to Waterman and within a few minutes after the crisis had developed the announcement was made that Dan Waterman would lend twenty five million dollars at ten per cent So the peril was averted Brokers upon the floor wept for joy and cheers rang through all the Street A mob of men gathered in front of Waterman s office singing a chorus of adulation All these events Montague followed day by day He was passing through Wall Street that Thursday afternoon and he heard the crowds singing He turned away bitter and sick at heart Could a more tragic piece of irony have been imagined than this that the man who of all men had been responsible for this terrible calamity should be heralded before the whole country as the one who averted it Could there have been a more appalling illustration of the way in which the masters of the Metropolis were wont to hoodwink its blind and helpless population There was only one man to whom Montague could vent his feelings only one man besides himself who knew the real truth Montague got the habit when he left his work of stopping at the Express building and listening for a few minutes to the grumbling of Bates Bates would have each day s news fresh from the inside not only the things which would be printed on the morrow but the things which would never be printed anywhere And he and Montague would feed the fires of each other s rage One day it would be one of the Express s own editorials in which it was pointed out that the intemperate speeches and reckless policies of the President were now bearing their natural fruit another day it would be a letter from a prominent clergyman naming Waterman as the President s successor Men were beside themselves with wonder at the generosity of Waterman in lending twenty five millions at ten per cent But it was not his own money it was the money of the national banks which he was lending and this was money which the national banks had got from the Government and for which they paid the Government no interest at all There was never any graft in the world so easy as the national bank graft declared Bates These smooth gentlemen got the people s money to build their institutions They got the Government to deposit money with them and they paid the Government nothing and charged the people interest for it They had the privilege of issuing a few hundred millions of bank notes and they charged interest for these and paid the Government nothing And then to cap the climax they used their profits to buy up the Government They filled the Treasury Department with their people and when they got into trouble the Sub Treasury was emptied into their vaults And in the face of all this the people agitated for postal savings banks and couldn t get them In other countries the people had banks where they could put their money with absolute certainty for no one had ever known such a thing as a run upon a postal bank Sometimes said Bates it seems almost as if our people were hypnotised You saw all this life insurance scandal mister Montague and there s one simple and obvious remedy for all the evils if we had Government life insurance it could never fail and there d be no surplus for Wall Street gamblers It sounds almost incredible but do you know I followed that agitation as I don t believe any other man in this country followed it and from first to last I don t believe that one single suggestion of that remedy was ever made in print A startled look had come upon Montague s face as he listened I don t believe I ever thought of it myself he exclaimed And Bates shrugged his shoulders You see he said So it goes CHAPTER XXIII Montague had taken a couple of days to think over Lucy s last request It was a difficult commission but he made up his mind at last that he would make the attempt He went up to Ryder s home and presented his card mister Ryder is very much occupied sir began the butler apologetically This is important said Montague Take him the card please He waited in the palatial entrance hall decorated with ceilings which had been imported intact from old Italian palaces At last the butler returned mister Ryder says will you please see him upstairs sir Montague entered the elevator and was taken to Ryder s private apartments In the midst of the drawing room was a great library table covered with a mass of papers and in a chair in front of it sat Ryder Montague had never seen such dreadful suffering upon a human countenance The exquisite man of fashion had grown old in a week mister Ryder he began when they were alone I received a letter from missus Taylor asking me to come to see you I know said Ryder It was like her and it is very good of you If there is any way that I can be of assistance the other began But Ryder shook his head No he said there is nothing If I could give you my help in straightening out your own affairs They are beyond all help said Ryder I have nothing to begin on I have not a dollar in the world That is hardly possible objected Montague It is literally true he exclaimed I have tried every plan I have been over the thing and over it until I am almost out of my mind And he glanced about him at the confusion of papers and leaned his forehead in his hands in despair Perhaps if a fresh mind were to take it up suggested Montague It is difficult to see how a man of your resources could be left without anything Everything I have is mortgaged said the other I have been borrowing money right and left I was counting on profits I was counting on increases in value And now see everything is wiped out There is not value enough left in anything to cover the loans But surely mister Ryder this slump is merely temporary Values must be restored It will be years it will be years And in the meantime I shall be forced to sell They have wiped me out they have destroyed me I have not even money to live on Montague sat for a few moments in thought missus Taylor wrote me that Waterman he began I know I know cried the other He had to tell her something to get what he wanted Montague said nothing And suppose he does what he promised continued the other He has done it before but am I to be one of Dan Waterman s lackeys There was a silence Like John Lawrence continued Ryder in a low voice Have you heard of Lawrence He was a banker one of the oldest in the city And Waterman gave him an order and he defied him Then he broke him took away every dollar he owned And the man came to him on his knees I ve taught you who is your master said Waterman Now here s your money And now Lawrence fawns on him and he s got rich and fat But all his bank exists for is to lend money when Waterman is floating a merger and call it in when he is buying Montague could think of nothing to reply to that mister Ryder he began at last I cannot be of much use to you now because I haven t the facts All I can tell you is that I am at your disposal I will give you my best efforts if you will let me That is all I can say And Ryder looked up the light shining on his white wan face Thank you mister Montague he said It is very good of you It is a help at least to hear a word of sympathy I I will let you know All right said Montague rising He put out his hand and Ryder took it tremblingly Thank you he said again And the other turned and went out He went down the great staircase by himself At the foot he passed the butler carrying a tray with some coffee He stopped the man mister Ryder ought not to be left alone he said He should have his physician Yes sir began the other and then stopped short From the floor above a pistol shot rang out and echoed through the house Oh my God gasped the butler staggering backward He half dropped and half set the tray upon a chair and ran wildly up the steps Montague stood for a moment or two as if turned to stone He saw another servant run out of the dining room and up the stairs Then with a sudden impulse he turned and went to the door I can be of no use he thought to himself I should only drag Lucy s name into it And he opened the door and went quietly down the steps In the newspapers the next morning he read that Stanley Ryder had shot himself in the body and was dying And that same morning the newspapers in Denver Colorado told of the suicide of a mysterious woman a stranger who had gone to a room in one of the hotels and taken poison She was very beautiful it was surmised that she must be an actress But she had left not a scrap of paper or a clew of any sort by which she could be identified The newspapers printed her photograph but Montague did not see the Denver newspapers and so to the day of his death he never knew what had been the fate of Lucy Dupree The panic was stopped but the business of the country lay in ruins For a week its financial heart had ceased to beat and through all the arteries of commerce and every smallest capillary there was stagnation Hundreds of firms had failed and the mills and factories by the thousands were closing down There were millions of men out of work Throughout the summer the railroads had been congested with traffic and now there were a quarter of a million freight cars laid by Everywhere were poverty and suffering it was as if a gigantic tidal wave of distress had started from the Metropolis and rolled over the continent Even the oceans had not stopped it it had gone on to England and Germany it had been felt even in South America and Japan One day while Montague was still trembling with the pain of his experience he was walking up the Avenue and he met Laura Hegan coming from a shop to her carriage mister Montague she exclaimed and stopped with a frank smile of greeting How are you I am well he answered I suppose she added you have been very busy these terrible days I have been more busy observing than doing he replied And how is Alice She is well I suppose you have heard that she is engaged Yes said Miss Hegan Harry told me the first thing I was perfectly delighted Are you going up town she added Get in and drive with me He entered the carriage and they joined the procession up the Avenue They talked for a few minutes then suddenly Miss Hegan said Won t you and Alice come to dinner with us some evening this week Montague did not answer for a moment Father is home now Miss Hegan continued We should like so much to have you He sat staring in front of him No he said at last in a low voice I would rather not come His manner even more than his words struck his companion She glanced at him in surprise Why she began and stopped There was a silence Miss Hegan he said at last I might make conventional excuses I might say that I have engagements that I am very busy Ordinarily one does not find it worth while to tell the truth in this social world of ours But somehow I feel impelled to deal frankly with you He did not look at her Her eyes were fixed upon him in wonder What is it she asked And he replied I would rather not meet your father again Why Has anything happened between you and father she exclaimed in dismay No he answered I have not seen your father since I had lunch with you in Newport Then what is it He paused a moment Miss Hegan he began I have had a painful experience in this panic I have lived through it in a very dreadful way I cannot get over it I cannot get the images of suffering out of my mind It is a very real and a very awful thing to me this wrecking of the lives of tens of thousands of people And so I am hardly fitted for the amenities of social life just at present But my father gasped she What has he to do with it Your father he answered is one of the men who were responsible for that panic He helped to make it and he profited by it She started forward clenching her hands and staring at him wildly mister Montague she exclaimed He did not reply There was a long pause He could hear her breath coming quickly Are you sure she whispered Quite sure said he Again there was silence I do not know very much about my father s affairs she began at last I cannot reply to what you say It is very dreadful Please understand me Miss Hegan said he I have no right to force such thoughts upon you and perhaps I have made a mistake I should have preferred that you should tell me the truth she said quickly I believed that you would he answered That was why I spoke Was what he did so very dreadful asked the girl in a low voice I would prefer not to answer said he I cannot judge your father I am simply trying to protect myself I m afraid of the grip of this world upon me I have followed the careers of so many men one after another They come into it and it lays hold of them and before they know it they become corrupt What I have seen here in the Metropolis has filled me with dismay almost with terror Every fibre of me cries out against it and I mean to fight it to fight it all my life And so I do not care to make terms with it socially When I have seen a man doing what I believe to be a dreadful wrong I cannot go to his home and shake his hand and smile and exchange the commonplaces of life with him It was a long time before Miss Hegan replied Her voice was trembling mister Montague she said you must not think that I have not been troubled by these things But what can one do What is the remedy I do not know he answered I wish that I did know I can only tell you this that I do not intend to rest until I have found out What are you going to do she asked He replied I am going into politics I am going to try to teach the people End of the Project
