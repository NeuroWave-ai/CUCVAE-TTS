1841_159771_000036_000001	train-clean-100	the snow was deep 
none	none	he made tunnels beneath it and a nest too which was snug and warm under the thick white blanket that covered it The only time Master Meadow Mouse was ever known to lose his temper was when Farmer Green mowed the meadow Under the high grass Master Meadow Mouse had been able to run about his well beaten paths unseen by hawks But with the grass cut and raked leaving only naked stubble he couldn t hide even from old mister Crow It was no wonder that he agreed with Bobby Bobolink s wife The Bobolink family were so upset by haying that they moved to Cedar Swamp at the very first clatter of the mowing machine And when Master Meadow Mouse bade them good by missus Bobolink said to him What a shame that Farmer Green should break up a happy home like ours And Master Meadow Mouse remarked that it was very careless of Farmer Green He might have waited till the snow comes at least before cutting the grass said Master Meadow Mouse You d better move to Cedar Swamp with us missus Bobolink suggested It s a fine place I know for we lived there last fall But Master Meadow Mouse didn t want to move The grass will grow again he explained Farmer Green can t stop the grass from growing no matter how often he cuts it And of course that was quite true After haying Master Meadow Mouse had to be more careful than ever He knew that the hawks would scan the meadow many times a day in hopes of catching a glimpse of his reddish brown back Luckily he succeeded in dodging them And he dodged a good many other fierce rascals long after winter with its snow had descended on Pleasant Valley Yet he never complained He said that danger kept the days and nights too from being dull Illustration Illustration two A Peep at the World WHAT is the earliest thing you can remember Master Meadow Mouse s earliest memory was of lying in a soft nest of dried grasses Sometimes the nest was in inky darkness and then it was night Sometimes a shaft of light fell upon the nest through a round hole just above his head and then it was daytime That round hole went upwards straight upwards for about a foot And when Master Meadow Mouse looked through it he could see on pleasant days a patch of brilliant blue which was a bit of sky One day a desire seized him to touch that round blue spot So when his mother was away he crawled up through the hole But when he reached the other end of it he found to his great surprise that the blue disk was ever so much bigger than he had thought it and seemed further away than it had when he gazed at it through the round tunnel All this was very puzzling And he stood in the meadow near the mouth of the tunnel peering around and wondering what this that and the other strange thing might be For he saw many wonderful new sights If his mother hadn t come home and found him out of the nest there s no telling what would have happened to him Get back she cried pushing him towards the mouth of the tunnel their doorway It s a mercy Henry Hawk hasn t spied you Master Meadow Mouse hung back He didn t want to be hurried away from the new world that he had just discovered I don t see Henry Hawk he squeaked missus Meadow Mouse gave a sort of grunt Humph You wouldn t know him if you saw him she retorted Besides he could see you long before you could see him for his eyes are wonderfully keen Then she gave her son a poke that sent him into the tunnel and bouncing down upon the soft nest at the bottom of it You stay there until I come home again she called Do you want to go where your two brothers and your three sisters went missus Meadow Mouse did not wait for her son s answer She went off again and left him to ponder over her question Master Meadow Mouse decided to mind his mother Although he didn t know what had become of his squirming companions who had already begun to crowd the nest somehow his mother s query carried something of a threat He wondered if the mysterious Henry Hawk had had anything to do with the vanishing of the rest of the children Master Meadow Mouse proved to be a hearty eater And since he no longer had to share with others the food that his mother brought home to him he grew fast It wasn t long before missus Meadow Mouse took him above ground with her and let him play near home She taught him many things how to find ripe seeds to eat how to keep still as a mouse and not squeak when there was danger of any kind and how to dodge into their tunnel when there was need Little by little Master Meadow Mouse wandered further from his own dooryard And he began to think that his mother was too careful There seemed to be no need of heeding all her warnings Then came the day when he met the kitten from the farmhouse Illustration Illustration three The Kitten MASTER MEADOW MOUSE had rambled about the meadow without paying much heed to safety Although he still seemed to listen politely whenever his mother gave him a lecture on dangerous birds or beasts half the time he didn t know what she was saying He had decided that her fears were foolish He was sure that nothing could harm him He was thinking that very thought one day when he came face to face suddenly with a huge furry creature At least the stranger seemed terribly big in the eyes of Master Meadow Mouse though it was only a kitten belonging to Miss Kitty Cat who lived at Farmer Green s house Like Master Meadow Mouse the kitten was exploring the meadow To her as to him it was a new world It would be hard to say which of the two was the more surprised Oh Master Meadow Mouse squeaked right out loud I I I wish I d stayed at home Ho the kitten mewed I m glad I came a hunting The kitten sprang at Master Meadow Mouse But when he didn t run she stopped in her tracks and stared at him She had expected him to flee as the mice at the farmhouse always did whenever a body met them What s the matter with you the kitten asked him Don t you know that you ought to run when I jump at you Master Meadow Mouse made no reply How could he know that the mice at the farmhouse were ever so much sprier than he was and that they always trusted to their legs to get them out of harm s way His family had always done differently Unless there was a hole near by big enough for them but too small for a pursuer they had ever stood their ground when attacked and fought while they could Master Meadow Mouse knew no other way It was something that had been handed down to him along with his short tail and his reddish brown back Somehow as she stood and gazed at Master Meadow Mouse the kitten thought he was growing bigger every moment She began to feel uneasy about pouncing on him It was one thing to clap a paw down on the back of somebody that was running away from her And it was an entirely different matter to seize a person that didn t try to escape but faced her almost boldly Hunting isn t so much fun as I expected she muttered For a moment or two she was tempted to scamper back to the farmhouse And then she thought how pleased her mother would be if she brought that fat fellow home in her mouth and laid him at her mother s feet how pleased and how proud To help her courage the kitten began to lash her tail jerking it from side to side as she had seen her mother move her own And she crouched her chubby body lower in the grass Then the kitten jumped And the moment she was within his reach Master Meadow Mouse gave her a smart nip on the nose with his sharp little teeth The kitten squalled And she backed hastily away You d better run she advised Master Meadow Mouse I shall not give you another chance But he stood fast And the kitten didn t give him another chance either to run from her or to bite her nose again She fell into a sudden panic and bounded awkwardly away toward the farmhouse And then Master Meadow Mouse ran He ran home as fast as he could go Illustration Illustration four A Pleasant Stranger THE whole Meadow Mouse family enjoyed swimming They liked to live near water That was why they made their home in the low meadow where Broad Brook ran deeper and more quietly than in the hillside pasture And Black Creek too was near by So the Meadow Mouse family never had to travel far when they wanted a cool dip Almost as soon as he was able to wander about the meadow alone Master Meadow Mouse began to swim He didn t have to be taught any more than he had to be taught how to walk Swimming came to him as easily as eating And his mother never worried about his being drowned But when he went for his first swim in Black Creek missus Meadow Mouse couldn t help feeling a bit anxious Look out she warned her son Look out for the Pickerel tribe They re the most dangerous fish in the creek

none	none	said Master Meadow Mouse I know that I ve been told about them already You have his mother exclaimed Who told you A greenish gentleman with a very wide smile and queer bulging eyes Master Meadow Mouse replied That s Ferdinand Frog missus Meadow Mouse cried He s as dangerous as any Pickerel that ever swam Where did you meet him I stood on the bank of the creek one day and saw him among the lily pads her son explained We had quite a long talk together I forgot to mention it to you he added The news made missus Meadow Mouse turn slightly pale She shuddered although the day was warm for she feared and detested Ferdinand Frog Don t ever go near that slippery villain she warned her son If you ever see him when you are swimming in the creek make for the shore at once Now Master Meadow Mouse sometimes thought that he knew more than his mother about certain matters And he was inclined to take her advice lightly Ferdinand Frog was very pleasant when I met him he remarked He cracked jokes And he laughed at them himself Oh he s pleasant enough missus Meadow Mouse agreed He d grin and swallow you at the same time with that great mouth of his That s what makes him so dangerous Well he s a fine swimmer anyhow her son declared Another reason why you should avoid him his mother retorted You ought to see him dive said Master Meadow Mouse He promised to teach me to dive if I d join him in the water It s a mercy you didn t missus Meadow Mouse gasped I m glad you had sense enough to stay on the bank Oh I knew better than to take a swim in the creek that day Master Meadow Mouse said The Pickerel family were nosing about among the pickerel weeds around the bend of the creek I saw them myself And mister Frog told me I ought to beware of them He was very anxious so he said about me and the Pickerel He said he didn t want them to catch me He was very kind I thought Kind missus Meadow Mouse spluttered He didn t want them to catch you because he hopes to catch you himself Illustration Illustration five mister Frog Insists MASTER MEADOW MOUSE had come to Black Creek to enjoy his first swim in its dark sluggish water But when he arrived on the bank he changed his mind about swimming there that day For whom should he see but Ferdinand Frog sitting on a rock at the edge of the creek For once Master Meadow Mouse was ready to take his mother s advice She had told him to beware of Ferdinand Frog and never never never to enter the water when that pleasant gentleman was in it Ferdinand Frog proved to be as agreeable as ever When he caught sight of Master Meadow Mouse mister Frog bade him a hearty good morning in a deep voice which was vastly different from the tiny squeak of the small person on the bank You ve come for a swim haven t you said Ferdinand Frog Master Meadow Mouse admitted that he had intended to swim But he explained that the water looked wetter than usual and he thought he d wait till another day Besides he added the sun has gone under a cloud and my suit wouldn t dry quickly enough Come right in and have your swim mister Frog urged him You can change your clothes as soon as you get home Oh no I can t said Master Meadow Mouse Why not mister Frog asked him Because I haven t any more Now that s a pity Ferdinand Frog told him A handsome youngster like you ought to have a best suit to wear on special occasions Master Meadow Mouse looked interested I d like a nice new suit he replied But where am I going to get it You ve come to the right place mister Frog cried Maybe you didn t know that I m a tailor I ll make you a new suit myself That s very kind of you said Master Meadow Mouse a bit doubtfully But I don t know how I could pay you The tailor laughed merrily Don t you worry about that he exclaimed I ll get my pay somehow And now you must come to my shop at once I want to take your measure mister Meadow Mouse shook his head No he told mister Frog I m not going to your shop I m not going a single step nearer to you than I am now I ve taken your measure already mister Frog I know your game And you can t catch me that way For once Ferdinand Frog forgot to laugh He was so surprised that his mouth fell wide open as he stared at Master Meadow Mouse He had an enormous mouth Master Meadow Mouse shivered slightly as he looked down mister Frog s throat The tailor closed his mouth almost immediately For a huge pickerel came nosing among the lily pads And spying mister Frog he at once darted towards him mister Frog swam off in great haste That Pickerel person said mister Meadow Mouse aloud means to take mister Frog s measure if he can Illustration six Meeting mister Crow DURING his first summer in Pleasant Valley Master Meadow Mouse had often noticed old mister Crow flying from the woods to the cornfield Once in a while mister Crow dropped down into the meadow on some business or other But Master Meadow Mouse did not fear him The grass was high in the meadow screening the goings and comings of Master Meadow Mouse from prying eyes But after haying time the meadow was a different place There was no cover over Master Meadow Mouse s paths He had to be watchful all the time because Henry Hawk had an unpleasant habit of sailing high up in the sky and dropping down like lightning when he saw anybody like Master Meadow Mouse stirring Old mister Crow continued to journey daily between the cornfield and the woods But Master Meadow Mouse paid little heed to him He believed mister Crow to be harmless so long as he didn t catch small folk in the cornfield The old gentleman was very touchy about corn He flew into a rage when anybody but himself ate even one kernel Though Master Meadow Mouse would have liked a taste of corn as much as anybody else he was careful to keep away from the cornfield in the daytime He didn t wish to bring down mister Crow s wrath upon his small head Never let mister Crow catch you taking any corn missus Meadow Mouse had told her son during one of the daily lessons that she gave him If you must have corn wait until after sunset mister Crow goes to bed early Now it happened that just before haying time missus Meadow Mouse had stopped giving her son lessons She said that she had told him everything she knew She had told him everything at least a hundred times And she declared that if he hadn t learned what he needed to know he never would missus Meadow Mouse however had forgotten one thing one very important thing There was a little trick of old mister Crow s that she had never mentioned to her son So it wasn t his fault that he was caught unawares one day soon after Farmer Green cut the grass in the meadow Master Meadow Mouse was tripping homewards one day after a little excursion He was traveling fast for he felt amidst the short stubble as if all the world were watching him And he kept a sharp eye cocked upwards at the sky lest Henry Hawk should surprise him Besides he had heard the boom of a bittern that morning And the day before he had seen a butcher bird skimming low over the meadow Those two he knew were every bit as dangerous as Henry Hawk You see Master Meadow Mouse had learned to expect birds to descend upon him from the air It had never occurred to him that a bird would lurk on the ground in wait for him So he had a sudden fright almost at his doorway when he ran plump upon a big black person standing behind a knoll Illustration Master Meadow Mouse ran plump into old mister Crow It was old mister Crow And Master Meadow Mouse thought he had an odd glitter in his snapping eyes I I haven t been taking any corn Master Meadow Mouse stammered Illustration Illustration seven Nothing but Air OLD mister Crow didn t say a single word when Master Meadow Mouse met him face to face in the meadow But a wicked glitter in mister Crow s eyes warned Master Meadow Mouse that there was trouble ahead for him If the hole leading to his home hadn t been close at hand there s no telling what would have happened to him Anyhow just as mister Crow lunged at him with a wild flapping of his broad wings Master Meadow Mouse slipped to one side and whisked through his doorway Old mister Crow coughed hoarsely What s your hurry he cried I ve been waiting around here for you for a long while Can t you spend a few moments of your valuable time with me Now it was true that the old gentleman had been lingering in the neighborhood The corn wasn t quite ripe enough to suit him So he had decided to go a mousing that morning His way of hunting however was not like that of other birds mister Crow chose to do his hunting afoot He was too wise to waste any effort looking for mice when the grass was high But after haying he had often gone a mousing in years past And he had found the sport to be quite worth while Stalking about the close cropped meadow he had surprised many distant cousins of Master Meadow Mouse who never returned home to tell the story of their meetings with the black scamp Maybe mister Crow was getting slow in his old age He had never come so near to catching a Meadow Mouse before only to be disappointed It was no wonder that he felt peevish At first Master Meadow Mouse did not answer mister Crow when the old gentleman called down the tunnel that led to the nest beneath the sod But soon Master Meadow Mouse remembered that mister Crow could get no more than his bill inside the hole And then Master Meadow Mouse found his voice again I don t want to go above ground he said Can t you talk to me where I am It s not easy to do that mister Crow grumbled I have to speak too loud and my voice is hoarse to day Stick your bill into my tunnel as far as it will go Master Meadow Mouse suggested Then you won t have to shout I could hear a whisper if you d do as I say Old mister Crow thrust his bill down the hole I don t like this he croaked I can t see you That s because you re shutting out all the light Master Meadow Mouse explained I doubt it said mister Crow angrily I believe you ve drawn a curtain across the other end of this tunnel And I can t talk to anybody through a curtain I refuse to injure my voice trying to talk with anybody that won t give me a more friendly welcome when I call on him Talk away Master Meadow Mouse urged his caller There s nothing between us to keep me from hearing you Nothing but a foot of air Ah mister Crow cried I knew you had something in that tunnel Remove the air at once sir or I ll go away and leave you If his bill wasn t so hard if it was as soft as the Kitten s nose I d bite it Master Meadow Mouse thought And while he was thinking all at once a shaft of light trickled inside his house Old mister Crow had gone grumbling on his way Illustration Illustration eight Moses Mouse MASTER MEADOW MOUSE felt ill at ease Now that the grass had been cut from the meadow he began to think he didn t care to live there any longer After his adventure with old mister Crow Master Meadow Mouse scarcely dared stray from his dooryard in the daytime Anybody almost could see him as he crept through the stubble At night he ventured further from home And once he went even as far as the farmyard To his surprise he found that the grass in Farmer Green s yard was longer than he had ever seen it Earlier in the summer when Master Meadow Mouse visited that spot he had been afraid to cross the lawn because it was clipped so short But now he could creep through the thick green carpet and nobody could see him unless a waving grass blade happened to catch somebody s eye Everybody at the farmhouse had been too busy with haying to spend any time running a lawn mower Why not move to the farmyard The thought came into Master Meadow Mouse s head It seemed to him that the farmyard would be a fine place to live There was grain scattered here and there where somebody had fed the hens There was the duck pond near by when he wanted a swim I ll come Master Meadow Mouse decided I ll come if I can find a good place for a nest Thereupon he began to look about for a site for his new home And it wasn t long before he had found one that suited him When he saw the woodpile he squeaked with delight The very place he cried I ll begin to built my nest to night So he set to work He carried dead leaves and dried grass to the woodpile and started to make a snug home for himself in a space between the logs well inside the heap of wood And he had just crept from a chink and stood under the stars when a tiny voice greeted him with a cry What ho stranger Master Meadow Mouse looked around And there on a stick of wood just behind him was a plump gray person The newcomer looked the least bit like Master Meadow Mouse himself except that his tail was ever so much longer I m Moses Mouse and I live in the farmhouse said the gray gentleman I m Master Meadow Mouse and I m going to live in this woodpile said the reddish brown chap in reply That s good news Moses Mouse remarked But you must look out for Miss Snooper he added Who is she Master Meadow Mouse asked his new friend Miss Snooper Moses Mouse explained Miss Snooper is our name for Miss Kitty Cat She lives in the farmhouse And when she isn t indoors she s usually prowling about the yard To the great astonishment of Moses Mouse the short tailed stranger seemed in no wise startled by his news Huh Master Meadow Mouse exclaimed If this Miss Snooper as you call her bothers me I ll serve her as I did one of her kittens What did you do to the kitten Moses Mouse inquired with great interest I bit her nose said Master Meadow Mouse Moses Mouse gazed at him with horror Don t try that on the old lady he cried If you do you ll be sorry Illustration Illustration nine Miss Snooper MOSES MOUSE who lived in the farmhouse had warned Master Meadow Mouse He had warned him to look out for Miss Snooper s nose Master Meadow Mouse did not pay any great attention to his new friend s advice He was building himself a new home in Farmer Green s woodpile And he went about his work as if there wasn t a cat within a hundred miles Then one day he caught a glimpse of Miss Snooper He peeped out from a chink in the woodpile and saw her sitting on a stick of wood She was so near him that Master Meadow Mouse could have leaped upon her back in one spring But he didn t do that He gazed at her with round eyes for Miss Snooper looked very fierce especially when she opened her mouth and showed her sharp teeth as she yawned Master Meadow Mouse saw that she was a quite different creature from the awkward kitten whom he had bitten on the nose earlier in the summer Goodness thought Master Meadow Mouse staring at Miss Snooper with great awe Goodness Her whiskers are longer than mine And then he drew back very softly and crept to his nest in the woodpile That night Moses Mouse came to make another call And he brought his wife with him so that she might see the stranger with the short tail who was going to live in Farmer Green s woodpile I saw Miss Snooper to day Master Meadow Mouse told them Did you bite her nose missus Mouse asked him eagerly for her husband had told her all about the newcomer No said Master Meadow Mouse No I was too busy building my new home to stop and bite her Isn t he brave whispered missus Moses Mouse to her husband From where they sat on the top of the woodpile Master Meadow Mouse and his callers caught sight of a dark shape that moved stealthily towards them through the shadows It s Miss Snooper herself missus Mouse cried And quick as a wink she dived down among the sticks of wood with her husband following close behind her Probably Master Meadow Mouse will bite Miss Snooper s nose this time she said to Moses when she had reached a safe retreat He isn t biting it now Moses Mouse replied because he s crowding right behind me Miss Snooper has come missus Mouse said to Master Meadow Mouse Maybe you didn t understand that it was she Let her come Master Meadow Mouse squeaked Isn t he brave missus Moses Mouse murmured I ll bite her nose if she sticks it into this crevice Master Mouse declared Isn t he brave she breathed into her husband s ear I m not so sure of that said Moses Mouse in an undertone He talks a good deal about nose biting I should like to see him do it I knew Miss Snooper was skulking around the yard to night That s why I came to call on this chap I wanted to see whether he d fight or run Meanwhile Miss Snooper climbed all over the woodpile She could hear faint squeaks somewhere And she was almost frantic because she couldn t squirm under the wood and find whoever was talking It was almost morning before Moses Mouse and his wife dared to steal back to the farmhouse When they left the woodpile Master Meadow Mouse left it too He had decided during the night that he wouldn t live in the farmyard I ve become very tired of this old Cat he told his companions mister and missus Moses Mouse I shouldn t care to stay where I had to see her often Illustration Illustration ten A Handy Sign HUNTING played a great part in the life of Master Meadow Mouse Somebody or other was always hunting him And he was always hunting for something to eat He spent a good deal of his time away from home looking for seeds and grain On the other hand he spent a good deal of his time in his house for Master Meadow Mouse liked to take naps especially in the daytime After he started to live in Farmer Green s woodpile but moved away from it before he had finished building his nest there Master Meadow Mouse settled near the fence between the meadow and the pasture The mowing machine hadn t cut the weeds and grass that grew close to the fence He found shelter there from the sharp eyes of birds that would have caught him had they been able to This time Master Meadow Mouse didn t live underground He made a sort of little hut for himself which kept out the cold in chilly weather and shed the rain when it didn t pour down too hard It was a good home But it had one drawback If anybody came along when its owner was asleep in it Well Master Meadow Mouse didn t like to think about that The little nest at the end of the tunnel where he had once lived had been far safer I know what I ll do he cried at last as a happy thought came to him I ll hang a sign outside my door He set to work And soon he had printed a sign On one side of this was the notice Gone to Lunch Back To morrow And on the other side were the words At Home Don t Knock Walk In There said Master Meadow Mouse as he stood off a few paces and looked at his handiwork That ought to do the trick Then he hung the sign outside his door and went into his house to enjoy a nap And the side of the sign that was turned outward said Gone to Lunch Back To morrow Master Meadow Mouse slept late into the afternoon And towards sunset while he was still asleep Tommy Fox slipped through the pasture fence Hullo he murmured softly as his eyes fell on Master Meadow Mouse s dwelling Here s a bit of luck I smell a Mouse And he must be taking a nap inside his house Tommy Fox crept closer to the little hut Then all at once he straightened up with a look of displeasure on his sharp face He had just noticed the sign He s away from home Tommy exclaimed That s a pity He can t have been gone long Maybe I can catch him near by But he couldn t find Master Meadow Mouse anywhere He looked all around except inside the shelter where Master Meadow Mouse was fast asleep Tommy Fox came back and read the sign once more Back To morrow he muttered Very well I ll come back here to morrow For that s what the sign tells me to do And the next day he returned He grinned from ear to ear as he read what the sign said At Home Don t Knock Walk In Then he thrust his long sharp nose right through Master Meadow Mouse s doorway There was nobody there And Tommy Fox looked silly as anything Fooled he growled Fooled by a Meadow Mouse I hope nobody ever finds it out Illustration Illustration eleven A Castle in the Air IT seemed as if Master Meadow Mouse was always moving Perhaps the pleasantest move he ever made was when he went to the cornfield to live When autumn came Farmer Green shocked the corn All over the field bundles of cornstalks stood in rows like soldiers And what suited Master Meadow Mouse especially was the ripe ears in the shocks which Farmer Green had not yet gathered For some weeks past Master Meadow Mouse had been living in a rude shelter which he had built for himself near the fence between the pasture and the meadow Though he had been quite comfortable there during the hot weather there were days now when a chilly wind swept through Pleasant Valley and made him shiver slightly as he thought of the frosts which his neighbors told him were on the way He had made up his mind to seek some snugger home But not until he saw what Farmer Green was doing with the cornstalks did Master Meadow Mouse decide on his new dwelling What a fine idea of Farmer Green s he cried when he first looked upon the shocked corn I never dreamed that he had been raising corn to make homes for our family He changed his opinion of Farmer Green Master Meadow Mouse had been much upset when Farmer Green cut the grass in the meadow at haying time All the birds in the air could see him whenever he crossed the bare field Now however he forgot his displeasure in the joy that Farmer Green s latest move gave him That night Master Meadow Mouse crept into the cornfield The round yellow harvest moon shone down on the field bathing the shocks of corn in a flood of light and making the pumpkins that lay on every side look almost as golden as they appeared under the midday sun Master Meadow Mouse was surprised to find that many of his cousins had had the same happy thought about moving that had come to him He met dozens of the big Meadow Mouse family that night And every one of them was intent on picking out a shock of corn to live in Luckily there were shocks enough for all and more And no disputes arose Some wanted to settle near the fence Some preferred to live in the middle of the field Many decided to make their new homes near Broad Brook so they could enjoy a swim now and then without having to travel far to get to the water Master Meadow Mouse was one of the best swimmers He found a huge shock that stood near the bank of the brook Crawling through it he discovered at least two dozen ears of ripe corn there I won t look any further he exclaimed Here s food enough to last for months all stored for me and ready to be eaten whenever I m hungry Then he set to work And high in the top of the shock he made himself a nest of dry husks which he stripped off some of the ears It was an easy matter to build that home Everything that he needed was right at hand And it was no time at all before Master Meadow Mouse had his house in order Then he was ready for a nap But first he made a hearty meal of corn because as he said he always slept better on a full stomach As he settled himself at last in his new quarters just before he dozed off Master Meadow Mouse murmured happily to himself I never thought he said that I d sleep in a castle in the air Illustration Illustration twelve A Midnight Frolic MASTER MEADOW MOUSE had always been pudgy Before he went to the cornfield to live he had been fat enough And after he had spent two weeks in and out of his new nest in the cornshock he was a sight to see His sides bulged And he had a look as if his skin weren t big enough for him Life had become very easy for Master Meadow Mouse He didn t even have to leave home to get all the corn he could eat He simply crept out of his nest and right there in his cornshock he had two dozen ears of ripe corn He didn t need to set foot to the ground unless he wanted a drink Of course Master Meadow Mouse wasn t content to stay at home morning noon and night He scampered away whenever he pleased Sometimes he went for a swim in Broad Brook Sometimes he visited his cousins who dwelt in other shocks in the cornfield And every night he joined the big Meadow Mouse family in a frolic They chased one another around the pumpkins that strewed the ground dodged behind the shocked corn or ran along the rail fence During the daytime Master Meadow Mouse and his companions lay low When they went abroad they kept a close watch for mister Crow Late as it was the old gentleman still lingered in Pleasant Valley Although his cronies had started on their yearly journey to the South he let it be known that he was expecting to spend the winter in the North I ve noticed signs he had said that tell me we re going to have a mild winter Whenever mister Crow visited the cornfield the Meadow Mouse family hastened to hide They didn t try to go to their own homes but plunged inside the nearest shocks of corn mister Crow was far from stupid He knew what was going on right under his nose or his bill Flapping towards the cornfield from the woods he could see a great scurrying of small reddish brown persons But when he settled down in the field there was never a Meadow Mouse anywhere in sight They re stealing corn the old gentleman spluttered I d stop them if I could But what can I do when they hide the moment they see me coming The old fellow pondered over the question Somebody he said will have to tear these shocks apart in order to catch the Meadow Mouse people And I don t know anyone that could do it better than Fatty Coon Now mister Crow knew where Fatty Coon lived in a hollow tree in Cedar Swamp And he actually started to fly over to the Swamp and ask Fatty Coon to rid the cornfield of the Meadow Mouse family But on the way to Cedar Swamp mister Crow happened to think of something He happened to think that Fatty Coon had an enormous appetite and was very fond of corn mister Crow suddenly veered off his straight course and alighted in a tree That will never do he croaked Fatty would eat more than all the Meadow Mice in Pleasant Valley Little did mister Crow know that Fatty Coon was already planning to visit the cornfield as soon as it grew dark Nor did Master Meadow Mouse and his cousins guess that they were to have an unwelcome guest that night As usual after dark they poured out of their castles in the air to enjoy their nightly frolic And they were having what they called high jinks when the word went around to hide For somebody squeaked in a frightened voice Fatty Coon is crawling through the pasture fence Illustration Illustration thirteen A Moonlight Raid THE Meadow Mouse party in the cornfield vanished as if by magic Not one of the merrymakers lingered an instant after hearing that Fatty Coon was entering the field And since Master Meadow Mouse happened to be near the shock where he lived he ran up it in a twinkling and crept inside it to curl up in his nest and try to catch forty winks He felt safe enough Hadn t old mister Crow come to the cornfield every day He had never even poked into a shock to disturb Master Meadow Mouse or one of his cousins mister Crow had eaten corn to be sure But he hadn t bothered anybody And now Master Meadow Mouse thought that as soon as Fatty Coon had stuffed himself with corn he would stroll back to Cedar Swamp Master Meadow Mouse had fallen into a doze when a sharp rustle waked him Ho ho he chuckled There s Fatty Coon now He s pulling an ear of corn off my shock Well I don t believe I ll miss it There s corn enough in this field for everybody Master Meadow Mouse tried to go to sleep again I wish Fatty Coon wouldn t make so much noise said Master Meadow Mouse grumbling a little because he was very drowsy and didn t like to be disturbed There he exclaimed after a few moments He s gone thank goodness But Fatty Coon had only carried his ear of corn to Broad Brook to wash it before he gobbled the kernels He was very particular to wash almost everything he ate But that was about the only way in which he was fussy There was nothing almost that he wouldn t bolt greedily After he had devoured the first ear of corn Fatty Coon went back and pulled another off the same shock Again he roused Master Meadow Mouse from his slumbers He s at it again Master Meadow Mouse complained I wish he d go to some other shock The third time that Fatty Coon wrenched an ear of corn from the shock where Master Meadow Mouse lived he paused and cocked an ear towards the top of the shock Was that a squeak he asked himself And then he sniffed Ha he cried Do I smell a Meadow Mouse Fatty Coon was not mistaken When he rustled the dried cornstalks the third time Master Meadow Mouse had cried right out in his sleep And he waked up just soon enough to hear Fatty Coon s remarks Maybe you do smell a Meadow Mouse he replied under his breath so Fatty Coon couldn t hear him But it won t do you any good for I m not coming out of my castle until you go away It soon appeared that Fatty Coon did not intend to leave For Fatty began to pull at the cornstalks with his claws Although Farmer Green had bound the stalks together tightly one by one Fatty tore them loose and let them fall upon the ground And inside the shock Master Meadow Mouse suddenly started up in alarm Illustration fourteen The Masked Bandit IT was no wonder that Master Meadow Mouse was startled He cowered inside his nest in the top of the shock of corn The whole shock shook There was a terrible rustle of dry leaves as Fatty Coon tore away stalk after stalk Old mister Crow never did this Master Meadow Mouse stammered He never disturbed my rest But this awful Fatty Coon means to catch me And I don t know what to do Meanwhile Fatty Coon was muttering horribly to himself as he worked This fellow must be fat he grunted as he wrenched at a stubborn stalk with claws and teeth With all this corn to feast on he must be in fine trim Mm He ought to be just right to top off a good meal of corn My goodness Master Meadow Mouse gasped How annoying He intends to eat me For a few moments Master Meadow Mouse wondered whether he ought to fight or run I wish he thought that I d brought my old sign with me when I moved to this new home If I had hung it outside my door Fatty Coon wouldn t have bothered me When he read that notice Gone to lunch Back To morrow he would have shuffled off about his business But idle thoughts and wishes were of no use at a time like that Master Meadow Mouse soon realized that he must act and act quickly Maybe I ll bite his nose he said to himself But I want to peep at him first So Master Meadow Mouse left his nest and crept a short distance until he could peer out from a chink between two cornstalks In the moonlight he had a fine view of Fatty Coon And as he stared at the intruder Meadow Mouse shuddered No he exclaimed No I never could fight him I wouldn t dare bite his nose He s far far too big for me to tackle There was no denying that Fatty Coon looked both huge and dangerous Across his face was a black mask which only added to his horrid appearance And through the mask his eyes shone green and greedy right into the frightened ones of Master Meadow Mouse One good look was enough for Master Meadow Mouse He drew back hurriedly Through his mind there flashed a saying of his mother s that he had not thought of for a long time He that fights and runs away will live to fight another day I ll run first Master Meadow Mouse decided Then perhaps I shan t have to fight at all Then he stole out of the shock of corn on the opposite side And when Fatty Coon pawed his way through to the nest he found it empty He gave a wail of anger and dismay He s gone The Meadow Mouse has gone Fatty bawled And I ll warrant he was a fat one too It s always the fattest ones that get away And nobody can deny that this one was living high Illustration Illustration fifteen The Flood THIS means another move for me said Master Meadow Mouse Fatty Coon had broken into the house in the shock of corn where Master Meadow Mouse had been living And Master Meadow Mouse had fled Somehow he felt that a change of scene would be good for him Although he had dwelt but a short time in the cornfield he had no longer any desire to stay there For Fatty Coon had given him a great fright There was no denying that It seems as if I were always moving Master Meadow Mouse mused It s lucky for me the world is wide Thank goodness there s plenty of places left where I can go I ve tried the meadow Farmer Green s woodpile the tangle beside the pasture fence and the cornfield And now now let me see I believe I ll settle along Black Creek under the bank He was talking with Long Bill Wren who had a nest in a marshy spot near the creek Oh don t make yourself a home under the bank Long Bill cried The fall rains will come soon The creek is sure to rise And then where will you be I ll be in the water I suppose Master Meadow Mouse answered Correct said Long Bill Wren And you want to avoid that Maybe you ve noticed that my wife and I built our nest off the ground We fasten it to the reeds so we ll be dry no matter if there s a freshet in midsummer Ah Master Meadow Mouse exclaimed with a smile I see you don t like water as much as I do The fall rains won t trouble me If the creek rises as high as my house it will be all the more fun Long Bill Wren gave him an odd look You re a queer one he remarked Anyhow you can t say I didn t warn you If there s a flood when the fall rains come and you get drowned out you can t say it s my fault Certainly not cried Master Meadow Mouse And I thank you for your kind advice But I m not going to be drowned out I can swim Long Bill Wren shook his head I hope you ll escape he said I shall not be here to know whether you do or not For we re starting for the South to morrow But I hope to find you safe and sound next May when I return And then he went home to tell his wife that Master Meadow Mouse was a very daring young fellow Master Meadow Mouse built himself a house under the bank of Black Creek And later the rain fell heavily for several days and nights just as Long Bill Wren had expected The creek rose fast Yet Master Meadow Mouse didn t worry When the water lapped at his doorway he only laughed And when it caught at his house and bore it downstream Master Meadow Mouse held his fat sides and roared The flood brought much rubbish with it But Master Meadow Mouse saw nothing that took his fancy until at last a floating board caught his eye Master Meadow Mouse swam out to it and scrambled upon it Hurrah he squeaked as the board carried him along with the current This is fine I ve got a raft And I ll go a traveling Illustration Illustration sixteen On the Raft A BOARD was floating along on the swollen waters of Black Creek On it sat Master Meadow Mouse He was very happy He was having his first ride of any sort This raft he said to himself proudly this raft belongs to me I ll be a traveler I ll see the world at least as far as the big willow at the lower end of the meadow He scarcely cared to go beyond the big willow Beyond it lay another farm And Master Meadow Mouse had never been off Farmer Green s place in his whole life He feared that he might not be able to find his way back if he ventured too far from home Soon he spied a friend on the bank of the creek Master Meadow Mouse cried Good by and waved a paw at him The person on the bank was one of his many cousins And when he caught sight of Master Meadow Mouse he stared hard for a few moments Then he shouted Don t jump I ll rescue you He was already running to the water s edge when Master Meadow Mouse stopped him I don t want to be rescued he called I m seeing the world His cousin hurried along the bank still watching the strange sight It seems to me he told Master Meadow Mouse it seems to me that the world is seeing you Where would you hide if Henry Hawk discovered you Illustration Master Meadow Mouse drifted toward mister Heron Master Meadow Mouse did not answer To tell the truth the question set him to thinking He had to admit that it might be a bit awkward to find any cover in case somebody or other made a sudden swoop at him Oh well he said at last It can t be helped There s always some danger in traveling so I ve heard His cousin on the bank had stopped running and now stood still and watched him anxiously until the raft had borne Master Meadow Mouse out of sight around a bend As the flood swung the craft toward the further side of the creek Master Meadow Mouse beheld a long legged fisherman standing in the water Not only did the fisherman have long legs He had a long bill as well And he was standing like a statue waiting for a fish to swim past him A fish or a frog or a mouse He didn t care which Master Meadow Mouse knew him at once He was mister Great Blue Heron or plain G B as he preferred to be called While Master Meadow Mouse gazed at him in horror mister Heron swiftly thrust his spearlike bill into the water Even his head went out of sight for a moment mister Heron did not do that in order to cool his head Ah no When he pulled his bill out of the creek a pickerel came with it And the pickerel vanished very quickly down mister Heron s long neck It was not a nice sight for Master Meadow Mouse to see especially when he was on a pleasure trip Besides he noticed with dismay that his raft was bearing him straight towards the fisherman If I only had some oars or a rudder I could steer this old raft away from him Master Meadow Mouse thought But he had nothing of the sort Master Meadow Mouse groaned I wish I d never gone a traveling Illustration Illustration seventeen A Lucky Escape NEARER and nearer the board with Master Meadow Mouse upon it drifted around the bend of the creek toward mister Great Blue Heron And at last mister Heron noticed it And he noticed its passenger too Ahem he said softly to himself Except for swallowing once or twice he never made a move but stood there in the water and waited He waited for Master Meadow Mouse s raft to drift closer for it was plain to him as to Master Meadow Mouse that the current of Black Creek was slowly bearing the board straight down upon him When it gets near enough I ll just reach out and pluck that fellow off mister Heron promised himself with a sort of silent chuckle Meanwhile Master Meadow Mouse was having a very bad quarter of an hour Slowly though his craft moved to him it seemed to travel with lightning speed I ll pass him soon Master Meadow Mouse thought If I crouch down and make myself as small as possible perhaps he won t see me So he hugged the board tight But the closer he came to mister Heron the bigger and fiercer that gentleman looked Suddenly Master Meadow Mouse s courage oozed out through his toes He couldn t stay on his raft another second Springing to his feet he scurried to the edge of the board and slipped off it into the water At his first move mister Heron moved too He lifted his great wings and flapped them tucking his legs under his body at the same time A half dozen flaps carried him abreast of the floating board And there mister Heron let his long legs down into the water until he stood again upon the bottom of the creek He scanned the water eagerly even plunging his head into it and looking all around But he couldn t see Master Meadow Mouse anywhere This is queer he mumbled I knew those fellows were good swimmers But I didn t think this one could get away from me so quickly mister Great Blue Heron waded about the creek for some time searching everywhere or almost everywhere And while he was searching the deserted raft swung off down the creek hung for a few moments at the edge of the channel and then drifted lazily toward shore where it lodged at last among the reeds The disappointed fisherman returned to his fishing But it seemed as if his luck had turned Not another fish came his way And being too wise to expect that another Meadow Mouse would come traveling down the creek on a raft mister Great Blue Heron at last forsook his sport and sailed away through the air towards the lake on the other side of Blue Mountain He hadn t been gone a great while when Master Meadow Mouse might have been seen picking his way along the bank He was journeying upstream on his way home It was lucky for me he explained to his cousin whom he met later it was lucky for me that I could swim under water Otherwise I shouldn t have been able to hide beneath the board and stay there until it swung into the rushes You had a narrow escape his cousin told him Don t say that I didn t warn you That cousin was one of those persons that always exclaim I told you so Illustration Illustration eighteen Under the Snow WINTER had come The snow lay deep over Pleasant Valley But Master Meadow Mouse didn t object to that On the contrary he had welcomed the snow Even Johnnie Green peeping out of his chamber window at the first snowfall of the season hadn t been any happier over it than Master Meadow Mouse was To Johnnie Green the snow meant fun To Master Meadow Mouse it meant fun and something more At last he could scamper about the meadow without being seen by everybody For he set to work at once to make tunnels beneath the snow They ran in every direction from his house And he was forever pushing them further and further Through those tunnels Master Meadow Mouse could look for seeds and grain in the stubble And while he was rambling along his network of halls he didn t have to worry about anybody s making trouble for him unless it was Peter Mink perhaps or Grumpy Weasel Of course Master Meadow Mouse didn t stay under the snow all the time Now and then he liked to climb up into the open air And he made many shafts that led to the world above Although most of the birds had gone South to spend the winter there were still some that Master Meadow Mouse had to shun Old mister Crow was spending the winter on the farm And there were Solomon Owl and his cousin Simon Screecher who hunted over the meadow nightly And at dusk sometimes a fierce hawk known as Rough leg would beat his way back and forth across the snow covered stretches in the hope of catching one of the Meadow Mouse family unawares In spite of such unpleasant neighbors the big Meadow Mouse family managed to have many a gay frolic under the stars on crisp winter nights Sometimes Johnnie Green wandering over the fields on snow shoes by day noticed a lacy tracery on the snow It was the tracks of the tiny toes of Master Meadow Mouse and his dozens of cousins At first Johnnie almost thought that he had stumbled upon the scene of a revel of fairy mice He did not know then that the Meadow Mouse family had a village of their own right under his feet But Solomon Owl and Simon Screecher and old Rough leg the hawk knew all about the habits of the villagers In fact they sometimes complained about the way the Meadow Mouse family had built their tunnels They agreed that there were too many holes leading down to the village streets It gave the Meadow Mouse people too many openings into which to dive in case of a sudden surprise when they were having a moonlight party If they ever invited me to one of their affairs I wouldn t care what they did Solomon Owl remarked one evening to his whistling cousin Simon Screecher If they d welcome me just once to one of their dances I d be satisfied It s plain that they don t like you his cousin remarked Nor you either Solomon Owl boomed And then all at once he burst forth with a peal of ghostly laughter Wha wha whoo ah Now Master Meadow Mouse had just crept out of one of his doorways and was looking up at the stars when that shivery sound came rolling out of the woods When he heard it he turned quickly and hurried back where he came from There won t be any fun to night he grumbled Illustration Illustration nineteen Owl Friends
1841_159771_000005_000000	train-clean-100	 THERE S no sense in wasting our time here said Solomon Owl to his small cousin Simon Screecher 
1841_159771_000005_000001	train-clean-100	 It s a fine night 
1841_159771_000005_000002	train-clean-100	The Mice will all be out sooner or later 
1841_159771_000005_000003	train-clean-100	Let s go over and sit in that old oak on the edge of the meadow 
1841_159771_000006_000000	train-clean-100	Simon Screecher was more than willing 
none	none	And they had no sooner settled themselves among the bare branches of the oak when Simon started to amuse himself by giving his well known quavering whistle 
1841_159771_000007_000000	train-clean-100	Solomon Owl stopped him quickly 
1841_159771_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 Don t do that he said sharply 
1841_159771_000008_000001	train-clean-100	 Do you want to scare the Mice Simon Screecher cut his whistle off right in the middle of it 
1841_159771_000009_000000	train-clean-100	 I forgot he murmured 
none	none	But I don t believe my whistling would do any harm 
1841_159771_000009_000002	train-clean-100	I don t think there are many Mice left on Farmer Green s place It s my opinion that they ve moved away most of them 
1841_159771_000009_000003	train-clean-100	Or maybe old Rough leg the Hawk has caught more than his share 
none	none	Anyhow it s so long since I ate a Meadow Mouse that I ve almost forgotten what they re like Solomon Owl made no reply 
1841_159771_000010_000001	train-clean-100	He was a person of few words 
1841_159771_000010_000002	train-clean-100	If anybody asked his opinion he was ready to give it 
1841_159771_000010_000003	train-clean-100	But he seldom gave any unsought advice 
1841_159771_000011_000000	train-clean-100	 I ve about made up my mind said Simon Screecher that I d move to some other neighborhood 
1841_159771_000011_000001	train-clean-100	If I knew where there was good mousing I d move to morrow 
1841_159771_000012_000000	train-clean-100	While he was speaking Solomon Owl started ever so slightly 
none	none	And he cocked his head on one side as if he were listening for something 
1841_159771_000013_000000	train-clean-100	At that moment his cousin began to whistle again 
1841_159771_000014_000000	train-clean-100	 Be quiet Solomon Owl thundered 
1841_159771_000014_000001	train-clean-100	 If I m not mistaken I heard a squeak 
1841_159771_000014_000002	train-clean-100	But no Meadow Mouse will ever venture out of doors if you re going to whistle 
1841_159771_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 I forgot said Simon Screecher once more 
none	none	I m so used to whistling that I don t know when I m doing it Illustration Solomon Owl and Simon Screecher wait for Master Meadow Mouse
1841_159771_000017_000000	train-clean-100	 That s the reason why you can t catch more Mice Solomon Owl snapped for he was angry 
none	none	There are dozens of Meadow Mice under the snow 
1841_159771_000017_000002	train-clean-100	But of course you can t surprise them if you tell them you re coming 
none	none	You might as well send them a telegram saying that you ll be on hand to meet them at eight P M 
1841_159771_000018_000000	train-clean-100	Simon Screecher was silenced for the time being 
1841_159771_000019_000000	train-clean-100	And it wasn t long before Solomon Owl gave another start 
1841_159771_000020_000000	train-clean-100	 There s that squeak again he whispered 
1841_159771_000020_000001	train-clean-100	 I believe it is getting nearer too 
1841_159771_000021_000000	train-clean-100	Now Master Meadow Mouse had a tunnel that led right beneath the tree where the two cousins were sitting 
1841_159771_000021_000001	train-clean-100	And he had strolled that way after scurrying under the snow when he heard Solomon Owl laughing in the woods earlier in the evening 
1841_159771_000022_000000	train-clean-100	It was he that Solomon heard 
1841_159771_000022_000001	train-clean-100	It was he that stuck his head out of a hole in the snow and peeped up at the star sprinkled sky 
none	none	Solomon Owl saw him 
1841_159771_000023_000001	train-clean-100	And he dived out of the old oak straight at Master Meadow Mouse 
none	none	Master Meadow Mouse pulled his head in just in time
1841_159771_000025_000000	train-clean-100	 I didn t suppose that chap would be here as soon as this he gasped He must have hurried over here from the woods 
1841_159771_000025_000001	train-clean-100	He must be very hungry 
none	none	As Solomon Owl returned to the old oak his cousin Simon Screecher laughed somewhat unpleasantly
1841_159771_000027_000000	train-clean-100	 Missed him didn t you he inquired 
none	none	Yes
1841_159771_000029_000000	train-clean-100	 Why didn t you grab him out of the snow Simon asked 
1841_159771_000029_000001	train-clean-100	 What are your claws for 
1841_159771_000029_000002	train-clean-100	What s your beak for 
1841_159771_000030_000000	train-clean-100	 I couldn t dig him out Solomon Owl replied 
1841_159771_000030_000001	train-clean-100	 The snow is three feet deep 
1841_159771_000030_000002	train-clean-100	And it has seven different crusts one under another 
1841_159771_000031_000000	train-clean-100	 This is a hard winter said Simon Screecher 
1841_159771_000031_000001	train-clean-100	 I wish I d gone South last fall 
none	none	I wonder how the mousing is down there Illustration Illustration twenty Eating a Tree 
1841_159771_000036_000000	train-clean-100	AS SIMON SCREECHER remarked to his cousin Solomon Owl it was a hard winter 
none	none	The snow was deep 
1841_159771_000036_000002	train-clean-100	The days were cold 
1841_159771_000036_000003	train-clean-100	And the nights were colder 
1841_159771_000036_000004	train-clean-100	And worst of all food became scarce 
1841_159771_000036_000005	train-clean-100	It seemed as if there wasn t anything to eat anywhere except at the farm buildings which Farmer Green had stuffed full of hay and grain during the summer and autumn 
1841_159771_000036_000006	train-clean-100	Many of the forest folk stole down from Blue Mountain after nightfall and visited the farmyard in the hope of getting a bite of something or other 
none	none	Even Master Meadow Mouse began to find it harder and harder to get enough seeds under the snow to satisfy his hunger 
1841_159771_000037_000001	train-clean-100	He had stored away a stock of food 
1841_159771_000037_000002	train-clean-100	But it hadn t been big enough 
1841_159771_000037_000003	train-clean-100	And that was a great mistake 
1841_159771_000037_000004	train-clean-100	Master Meadow Mouse promised himself that he would not repeat it another time 
1841_159771_000037_000005	train-clean-100	Unfortunately all the promises in the world wouldn t give him a square meal when he needed one 
none	none	At last he went to one of his cousins who had already spent one winter in the meadow
1841_159771_000039_000000	train-clean-100	 This is my first winter Master Meadow Mouse explained 
none	none	I m running short of food And I wish you d tell me what to do in such a case
1841_159771_000040_000000	train-clean-100	 That s easy his cousin answered 
1841_159771_000040_000001	train-clean-100	 Get more And then he hurried away for he had important business to attend to 
none	none	Poor Master Meadow Mouse ran after him 
1841_159771_000041_000001	train-clean-100	It was hard to follow his cousin through the winding galleries beneath the snow 
1841_159771_000041_000002	train-clean-100	Several times Master Meadow Mouse took the wrong turn and had to retrace his steps But at last he found his busy cousin again 
1841_159771_000042_000000	train-clean-100	 You advised me to get more food said Master Meadow Mouse 
1841_159771_000042_000001	train-clean-100	 But you didn t tell me where to get it 
1841_159771_000043_000000	train-clean-100	 In the orchard his cousin cried 
1841_159771_000043_000001	train-clean-100	And then he hurried away again 
1841_159771_000044_000000	train-clean-100	 I wish he d wait a minute Master Meadow Mouse grumbled as he tore after his cousin once more 
1841_159771_000044_000001	train-clean-100	 I don t feel like running 
none	none	I haven t had a hearty meal for days 
1841_159771_000045_000000	train-clean-100	The cousin seemed surprised when Master Meadow Mouse overtook him 
none	none	What that busy gentleman exclaimed Have you been to the orchard and back so soon No said Master Meadow Mouse
1841_159771_000047_000001	train-clean-100	 I ve been chasing you 
1841_159771_000047_000002	train-clean-100	I want you to tell me what I ll find to eat when I go to the orchard 
1841_159771_000048_000000	train-clean-100	 That s easy his cousin replied 
1841_159771_000048_000001	train-clean-100	 Trees Having said those three words he dashed off again even faster than before 
1841_159771_000049_000000	train-clean-100	 Trees Master Meadow Mouse echoed 
1841_159771_000049_000001	train-clean-100	 I can t eat trees 
none	none	I ve never eaten a tree in all my life 
1841_159771_000049_000003	train-clean-100	There must be something that my cousin forgot to explain 
1841_159771_000049_000004	train-clean-100	So I suppose I ll have to run after him again and ask him what he meant 
1841_159771_000050_000000	train-clean-100	The fourth time that Master Meadow Mouse found his cousin he took no chances 
1841_159771_000050_000001	train-clean-100	He caught his cousin by his tail and held on firmly 
1841_159771_000051_000000	train-clean-100	 You re not going to get away from me till I ve found out what I want to know he declared 
1841_159771_000051_000001	train-clean-100	 How can I eat a tree Master Meadow Mouse demanded 
1841_159771_000052_000000	train-clean-100	 You can t his cousin replied struggling desperately to free himself for he was too busy to stop long 
1841_159771_000053_000000	train-clean-100	 Then explain what you mean Master Meadow Mouse cried 
1841_159771_000054_000000	train-clean-100	 Eat the bark his cousin answered 
1841_159771_000055_000000	train-clean-100	Then and not till then did Master Meadow Mouse let him go 
1841_159771_000056_000000	train-clean-100	Master Meadow Mouse chased his cousin no more but hurried away to Farmer Green s orchard where he gnawed a ring all the way around one of the young fruit trees at the top of the snow 
1841_159771_000056_000001	train-clean-100	It was the first big meal he had enjoyed for weeks 
1841_159771_000056_000002	train-clean-100	And he went home feeling that the winter was not so hard as he had thought after all 
1841_159771_000057_000000	train-clean-100	But Farmer Green didn t agree with him 
1841_159771_000057_000001	train-clean-100	When he happened to go into the orchard one day later and saw tree after tree ruined he was very very much displeased 
1841_159771_000058_000000	train-clean-100	 I ought to have put wire netting around those young trees he told the hired man 
1841_159771_000058_000001	train-clean-100	 This is what comes of a hard winter 
none	none	Illustration Illustration twenty one A Cold Dip 
1841_159771_000063_000000	train-clean-100	IN one way Peter Mink was like Master Meadow Mouse 
1841_159771_000063_000001	train-clean-100	He enjoyed swimming And he spent a great deal of his time along the streams that threaded their way through Pleasant Valley 
1841_159771_000063_000002	train-clean-100	Sometimes Peter dawdled on the banks of Swift River 
1841_159771_000063_000003	train-clean-100	Sometimes he lingered for days in the neighborhood of Black Creek 
1841_159771_000063_000004	train-clean-100	Nor did he disdain so small a stream as the brook that crossed the meadow 
1841_159771_000063_000005	train-clean-100	It was deep enough for a swim 
1841_159771_000063_000006	train-clean-100	And he knew that muskrats lived under its banks 
none	none	While as for meadow mice well Peter Mink had surprised many a one swimming in the brook 
1841_159771_000063_000008	train-clean-100	If it hadn t been for the meadow mice perhaps he wouldn t have visited the brook so often 
none	none	Even in winter Master Meadow Mouse just had to have his cold dip now and then 
1841_159771_000064_000001	train-clean-100	So he ran one of his many snow tunnels to the brook making a little opening that led under the ice where the water had fallen away and left a cavern 
1841_159771_000064_000002	train-clean-100	Just because there was skating for Johnnie Green on top of the brook it mustn t be supposed that Master Meadow Mouse wasn t going to have a swim when he wanted one 
1841_159771_000065_000000	train-clean-100	When Peter Mink wandered along a stream in winter he preferred to travel under the ice rather than walk upon the upper side of it 
1841_159771_000065_000001	train-clean-100	It made little difference to him whether there was a dry strip along the edge of the stream where he could steal silently along without wetting his feet 
1841_159771_000065_000002	train-clean-100	When he found no place to walk he swam 
none	none	Now Master Meadow Mouse was well aware of this trick of Peter Mink s this trick of lurking beneath the ice of river creek and brook But Master Meadow Mouse would have his cold dip now and then despite Peter Mink and his prowling ways 
1841_159771_000067_000000	train-clean-100	To be sure Master Meadow Mouse tried to be careful 
1841_159771_000067_000001	train-clean-100	Before he crept from the end of his tunnel he stuck his head out and looked up and down and all around 
1841_159771_000067_000002	train-clean-100	He peeped under the bank of the brook 
1841_159771_000067_000003	train-clean-100	He even stared into the water 
1841_159771_000067_000004	train-clean-100	And then if he saw nobody that was fiercer than Paddy Muskrat only then would he venture to skip to the water s edge and plunge in 
1841_159771_000068_000000	train-clean-100	To tell the truth Master Meadow Mouse always felt safer when one of the Muskrat family happened to be taking a swim at the same time 
1841_159771_000068_000001	train-clean-100	For the Muskrats all had a warning signal that told everybody when there was danger 
1841_159771_000068_000002	train-clean-100	When one of them caught sight of Peter Mink he never failed if he was in the water to give a loud slap upon the surface with his tail 
1841_159771_000069_000000	train-clean-100	Master Meadow Mouse always had one ear that was listening for that slap And when it sounded he never waited an instant but darted into his tunnel without even stopping to shake the water off his coat 
1841_159771_000069_000001	train-clean-100	He said that he could dry his coat after he reached home while if he stopped to dry it at the edge of the brook perhaps he d never get home at all 
1841_159771_000070_000000	train-clean-100	You might think that now and then he would have said to himself Oh I won t bother to look for Peter Mink to day 
1841_159771_000070_000001	train-clean-100	He must be miles away 
1841_159771_000070_000002	train-clean-100	I ll step right out of my tunnel and have my swim without taking a look see first But Master Meadow Mouse was never so lazy as that 
1841_159771_000070_000003	train-clean-100	And the day came at last when it was well worth his while to take the little extra trouble of peeping out before he had his swim 
1841_159771_000071_000000	train-clean-100	For Master Meadow Mouse caught a glimpse of a snakelike head that darted out from under the bank of the brook and darted back again out of sight 
none	none	He knew that that queer head belonged to Peter Mink and to nobody else Illustration Illustration twenty two Fishing for Mice MASTER MEADOW MOUSE peeped out of the end of his tunnel and gave a faint squeak As he watched he saw Peter Mink s head on its long neck flash out from beneath the overhanging bank of the brook What are you doing up there Master Meadow Mouse called Fishing said Peter Mink promptly Aren t you a long way from the water Master Meadow Mouse inquired With a pole one doesn t need to stand right at the water s edge said Peter Mink But you haven t a pole Master Meadow Mouse pointed out At least I can t see that you have one Peter was greatly surprised or seemed to be I declare he said I forgot to bring my pole with me And if you hadn t reminded me of it I shouldn t have known what was the trouble I was wondering why I didn t get any bites As he spoke he slid down the lower part of the bank and stretched himself like a cat But all the time he was looking at Master Meadow Mouse out of the corner of his eye What are you doing here Peter Mink asked pleasantly I came to take a swim Master Meadow Mouse explained Have you had it Not yet Master Meadow Mouse told him And I believe I ll wait till to morrow The water s fine to day said Peter Mink I ve been in and out of it forty times But Master Meadow Mouse wasn t to be persuaded so easily I might spoil your fishing if I went in now he remarked I don t care if you do said Peter Mink The pleasure of seeing you enjoy a swim would more than repay me for the loss of the biggest fish in this brook Now such speeches sounded very strange coming from the mouth of a surly rascal like Peter Mink who was never known to do anybody a good turn Master Meadow Mouse pondered over this last statement There seemed to be a catch in it somewhere And he decided finally that he had discovered it I didn t know there were any fish in this brook worth catching he piped They say there were trout here once But now there s nothing bigger than a minnow Peter Mink nodded That s the truth he said If this brook has a fish that s as meaty as you are I ve never seen him Ah cried Master Meadow Mouse You d far rather catch me than catch a fish in this pool Peter Mink grinned at him brazenly I won t deny it he replied But you tried to deceive me Master Meadow Mouse told him You said when I asked you what you were doing here you said that you were fishing So I was Peter Mink exclaimed with a horrid chuckle I was fishing for mice And if you d been a little less careful I d have caught one too Good day said Master Meadow Mouse Good day and good by Don t say good by Peter Mink corrected Say Till we meet again But Master Meadow Mouse had already pulled his head out of sight and vanished inside his tunnel Illustration Illustration twenty three Moving Day MASTER MEADOW MOUSE had a great uncle who was known as Uncle Billy He was the oldest of all the members of the Meadow Mouse family that lived under the snow near the brook Hobbling along through one of the tunnels beneath the seven crusts of snow he happened to meet Master Meadow Mouse as he was returning from his talk with Peter Mink I just saw Peter Mink at the brook Master Meadow Mouse called Ha Uncle Billy snorted The question is did he see you He did Master Meadow Mouse answered with no little pride for he felt quite important He not only saw me He talked with me Ha Uncle Billy snorted again Then this is moving day Why it s not the first of May is it Master Meadow Mouse cried Hardly said Uncle Billy with something like a sniff It s not Ground Hog Day yet and that s only the second of February Then why should anybody move right in the middle of winter Master Meadow Mouse wanted to know Because Uncle Billy declared hotly because somebody has gone and let Peter Mink know where we re spending the winter And it s not safe for us to stay here any longer Master Meadow Mouse couldn t help feeling guilty Still he hoped he hadn t made as great a mistake as Uncle Billy would have him believe I ve heard he ventured that Peter Mink can squeeze through any hole that s big enough for his head But surely he couldn t get even his flat head into one of our passages He can burrow in the snow Uncle Billy snapped He can and he will He ll come sniffing and listening all around here And when he finds a likely spot to dig down he ll go through drifts and crusts until he reaches the stubble Uncle Billy shook his head and drew a long breath Young man he said you ve got us into a peck of trouble This whole village has to move Don t let it happen again By that time others of the villagers had gathered round and heard the news Of course the news spread fast And in a surprisingly short while the Meadow Mouse family was on its way to the mill pond Everybody set to work everybody except Uncle Billy Meadow Mouse He was busy telling all the rest what to do though he didn t help half as much as he thought he did But every one was polite to him for he was the oldest Meadow Mouse on the farm It wasn t long before they had everything snug again And as for Master Meadow Mouse he was actually glad that he had made the whole village move For Paddy Muskrat lived in the mill pond He spent all his time there when he wasn t taking excursions up the brook And Master Meadow Mouse found him the best of company Especially did Master Meadow Mouse like to hear Paddy Muskrat slap his tail upon the water when he gave the danger signal Illustration Illustration twenty four Master or Mister LIVING as he did near the mill pond Master Meadow Mouse saw a great deal of Paddy Muskrat They had a number of tastes in common They both liked lily bulbs They both enjoyed swimming They both disliked Peter Mink They were bound to become great cronies if for no other reason than the last By spring Paddy Muskrat knew Master Meadow Mouse well enough to ask him a very intimate question Why does everybody call you Master he inquired one day Master Meadow Mouse looked at him in a puzzled fashion for a moment or two I don t know he answered I don t know why unless it s because they always have called me that Don t you think it s a good name he asked Paddy Muskrat a bit anxiously Oh yes Paddy assured him There s no doubt that it s a good enough name But it s one that s given to a youngster to a mere child I m not a youngster Master Meadow Mouse cried Nobody can call me young I m almost a year old I thought so said Paddy Muskrat as if he knew he couldn t have been mistaken You re grown up And yet they still call you Master Meadow Mouse If I were you I d get folks to change that It was plain that Master Meadow Mouse agreed with him in every way He had already made up his mind that he wouldn t answer to the name of Master Meadow Mouse any longer And he told Paddy Muskrat as much If they want me to answer after this they ll have to call me something else he declared Now what would you suggest Paddy Muskrat said he needed time to think the matter over And he thought that he d like to consult his wife who always had an opinion Wait here till I come back he told Master Meadow Mouse And diving into the water he swam home He was back in a few minutes with a broad smile upon his face I ve thought of the very thing he exclaimed Or at least my wife has She says Call him Mister of course That s fine cried Master Meadow Mouse I m sure I couldn t have thought of that if I d tried all summer And now he added I must go and tell everybody about this sudden change So he hurried home And calling everybody around him he explained that he was a year old and that he had successfully dodged Miss Kitty Cat Tommy Fox Solomon Owl Ferdinand Frog Peter Mink Old mister Crow and goodness only knew how many other dangerous folk I m grown up now he told his hearers From this time on I expect everybody to call me Mister Meadow Mouse And everybody said that a new name was no more than he deserved They all approved his choice No There was just one among all the company that was opposed to the change He snorted and started to say something disagreeable And for once everybody told Uncle Billy for it was he to be quiet And that was the end of Master Meadow Mouse Illustration THE END Transcriber s Notes Comma added on title page after CUFFY BEAR BOOKS Page forty one Farmer s changed to Farmer Farmer Green s woodpile End of the
