shall give me greater ease Than your cold Christ and tangled Trinities The Convert She was the daughter of Sonoo a Hill man and Jadeh his wife One year their maize failed and two bears spent the night in their only poppy field just above the Sutlej Valley on the Kotgarth side so next season they turned Christian and brought their baby to the Mission to be baptized The Kotgarth Chaplain christened her Elizabeth and Lispeth is the Hill or pahari pronunciation Later cholera came into the Kotgarth Valley and carried off Sonoo and Jadeh and Lispeth became half servant half companion to the wife of the then Chaplain of Kotgarth This was after the reign of the Moravian missionaries but before Kotgarth had quite forgotten her title of Mistress of the Northern Hills Whether Christianity improved Lispeth or whether the gods of her own people would have done as much for her under any circumstances I do not know but she grew very lovely When a Hill girl grows lovely she is worth traveling fifty miles over bad ground to look upon Lispeth had a Greek face one of those faces people paint so often and see so seldom She was of a pale ivory color and for her race extremely tall Also she possessed eyes that were wonderful and had she not been dressed in the abominable print cloths affected by Missions you would meeting her on the hill side unexpectedly have thought her the original Diana of the Romans going out to slay Lispeth took to Christianity readily and did not abandon it when she reached womanhood as do some Hill girls Her own people hated her because she had they said become a memsahib and washed herself daily and the Chaplain s wife did not know what to do with her Somehow one cannot ask a stately goddess five foot ten in her shoes to clean plates and dishes So she played with the Chaplain s children and took classes in the Sunday School and read all the books in the house and grew more and more beautiful like the Princesses in fairy tales The Chaplain s wife said that the girl ought to take service in Simla as a nurse or something genteel But Lispeth did not want to take service She was very happy where she was When travellers there were not many in those years came to Kotgarth Lispeth used to lock herself into her own room for fear they might take her away to Simla or somewhere out into the unknown world One day a few months after she was seventeen years old Lispeth went out for a walk She did not walk in the manner of English ladies a mile and a half out and a ride back again She covered between twenty and thirty miles in her little constitutionals all about and about between Kotgarth and Narkunda This time she came back at full dusk stepping down the breakneck descent into Kotgarth with something heavy in her arms The Chaplain s wife was dozing in the drawing room when Lispeth came in breathing hard and very exhausted with her burden Lispeth put it down on the sofa and said simply This is my husband I found him on the Bagi Road He has hurt himself We will nurse him and when he is well your husband shall marry him to me This was the first mention Lispeth had ever made of her matrimonial views and the Chaplain s wife shrieked with horror However the man on the sofa needed attention first He was a young Englishman and his head had been cut to the bone by something jagged Lispeth said she had found him down the khud so she had brought him in He was breathing queerly and was unconscious He was put to bed and tended by the Chaplain who knew something of medicine and Lispeth waited outside the door in case she could be useful She explained to the Chaplain that this was the man she meant to marry and the Chaplain and his wife lectured her severely on the impropriety of her conduct Lispeth listened quietly and repeated her first proposition It takes a great deal of Christianity to wipe out uncivilized Eastern instincts such as falling in love at first sight Lispeth having found the man she worshipped did not see why she should keep silent as to her choice She had no intention of being sent away either She was going to nurse that Englishman until he was well enough to marry her This was her little programme After a fortnight of slight fever and inflammation the Englishman recovered coherence and thanked the Chaplain and his wife and Lispeth especially Lispeth for their kindness He was a traveller in the East he said they never talked about globe trotters in those days when the P O fleet was young and small and had come from Dehra Dun to hunt for plants and butterflies among the Simla hills No one at Simla therefore knew anything about him He fancied he must have fallen over the cliff while stalking a fern on a rotten tree trunk and that his coolies must have stolen his baggage and fled He thought he would go back to Simla when he was a little stronger He desired no more mountaineering He made small haste to go away and recovered his strength slowly Lispeth objected to being advised either by the Chaplain or his wife so the latter spoke to the Englishman and told him how matters stood in Lispeth s heart He laughed a good deal and said it was very pretty and romantic a perfect idyl of the Himalayas but as he was engaged to a girl at Home he fancied that nothing would happen Certainly he would behave with discretion He did that Still he found it very pleasant to talk to Lispeth and walk with Lispeth and say nice things to her and call her pet names while he was getting strong enough to go away It meant nothing at all to him and everything in the world to Lispeth She was very happy while the fortnight lasted because she had found a man to love Being a savage by birth she took no trouble to hide her feelings and the Englishman was amused When he went away Lispeth walked with him up the Hill as far as Narkunda very troubled and very miserable The Chaplain s wife being a good Christian and disliking anything in the shape of fuss or scandal Lispeth was beyond her management entirely had told the Englishman to tell Lispeth that he was coming back to marry her She is but a child you know and I fear at heart a heathen said the Chaplain s wife So all the twelve miles up the hill the Englishman with his arm around Lispeth s waist was assuring the girl that he would come back and marry her and Lispeth made him promise over and over again She wept on the Narkunda Ridge till he had passed out of sight along the Muttiani path Then she dried her tears and went in to Kotgarth again and said to the Chaplain s wife He will come back and marry me He has gone to his own people to tell them so And the Chaplain s wife soothed Lispeth and said He will come back At the end of two months Lispeth grew impatient and was told that the Englishman had gone over the seas to England She knew where England was because she had read little geography primers but of course she had no conception of the nature of the sea being a Hill girl There was an old puzzle map of the World in the House Lispeth had played with it when she was a child She unearthed it again and put it together of evenings and cried to herself and tried to imagine where her Englishman was As she had no ideas of distance or steamboats her notions were somewhat erroneous It would not have made the least difference had she been perfectly correct for the Englishman had no intention of coming back to marry a Hill girl He forgot all about her by the time he was butterfly hunting in Assam He wrote a book on the East afterwards Lispeth s name did not appear At the end of three months Lispeth made daily pilgrimage to Narkunda to see if her Englishman was coming along the road It gave her comfort and the Chaplain s wife finding her happier thought that she was getting over her barbarous and most indelicate folly A little later the walks ceased to help Lispeth and her temper grew very bad The Chaplain s wife thought this a profitable time to let her know the real state of affairs that the Englishman had only promised his love to keep her quiet that he had never meant anything and that it was wrong and improper of Lispeth to think of marriage with an Englishman who was of a superior clay besides being promised in marriage to a girl of his own people Lispeth said that all this was clearly impossible because he had said he loved her and the Chaplain s wife had with her own lips asserted that the Englishman was coming back How can what he and you said be untrue asked Lispeth We said it as an excuse to keep you quiet child said the Chaplain s wife Then you have lied to me said Lispeth you and he The Chaplain s wife bowed her head and said nothing Lispeth was silent too for a little time then she went out down the valley and returned in the dress of a Hill girl infamously dirty but without the nose and ear rings She had her hair braided into the long pig tail helped out with black thread that Hill women wear I am going back to my own people said she You have killed Lispeth There is only left old Jadeh s daughter the daughter of a pahari and the servant of Tarka Devi You are all liars you English By the time that the Chaplain s wife had recovered from the shock of the announcement that Lispeth had verted to her mother s gods the girl had gone and she never came back She took to her own unclean people savagely as if to make up the arrears of the life she had stepped out of and in a little time she married a wood cutter who beat her after the manner of paharis and her beauty faded soon There is no law whereby you can account for the vagaries of the heathen said the Chaplain s wife and I believe that Lispeth was always at heart an infidel Seeing she had been taken into the Church of England at the mature age of five weeks this statement does not do credit to the Chaplain s wife Lispeth was a very old woman when she died She always had a perfect command of English and when she was sufficiently drunk could sometimes be induced to tell the story of her first love affair It was hard then to realize that the bleared wrinkled creature so like a wisp of charred rag could ever have been Lispeth of the Kotgarth Mission THREE AND AN EXTRA When halter and heel ropes are slipped do not give chase with sticks but with gram Punjabi Proverb After marriage arrives a reaction sometimes a big sometimes a little one but it comes sooner or later and must be tided over by both parties if they desire the rest of their lives to go with the current In the case of the Cusack Bremmils this reaction did not set in till the third year after the wedding Bremmil was hard to hold at the best of times but he was a beautiful husband until the baby died and missus Bremmil wore black and grew thin and mourned as if the bottom of the universe had fallen out Perhaps Bremmil ought to have comforted her He tried to do so I think but the more he comforted the more missus Bremmil grieved and consequently the more uncomfortable Bremmil grew The fact was that they both needed a tonic And they got it missus Bremmil can afford to laugh now but it was no laughing matter to her at the time You see missus Hauksbee appeared on the horizon and where she existed was fair chance of trouble At Simla her bye name was the Stormy Petrel She had won that title five times to my own certain knowledge She was a little brown thin almost skinny woman with big rolling violet blue eyes and the sweetest manners in the world You had only to mention her name at afternoon teas for every woman in the room to rise up and call her well NOT blessed She was clever witty brilliant and sparkling beyond most of her kind but possessed of many devils of malice and mischievousness She could be nice though even to her own sex But that is another story Bremmil went off at score after the baby s death and the general discomfort that followed and missus Hauksbee annexed him She took no pleasure in hiding her captives She annexed him publicly and saw that the public saw it He rode with her and walked with her and talked with her and picnicked with her and tiffined at Peliti s with her till people put up their eyebrows and said Shocking missus Bremmil stayed at home turning over the dead baby s frocks and crying into the empty cradle She did not care to do anything else But some eight dear affectionate lady friends explained the situation at length to her in case she should miss the cream of it missus Bremmil listened quietly and thanked them for their good offices She was not as clever as missus Hauksbee but she was no fool She kept her own counsel and did not speak to Bremmil of what she had heard This is worth remembering Speaking to or crying over a husband never did any good yet When Bremmil was at home which was not often he was more affectionate than usual and that showed his hand The affection was forced partly to soothe his own conscience and partly to soothe missus Bremmil It failed in both regards Then the A D C in Waiting was commanded by Their Excellencies Lord and Lady Lytton to invite mister and missus Cusack Bremmil to Peterhoff on July twenty sixth at nine point thirty P M Dancing in the bottom left hand corner I can t go said missus Bremmil it is too soon after poor little Florrie but it need not stop you Tom She meant what she said then and Bremmil said that he would go just to put in an appearance Here he spoke the thing which was not and missus Bremmil knew it She guessed a woman s guess is much more accurate than a man s certainty that he had meant to go from the first and with missus Hauksbee She sat down to think and the outcome of her thoughts was that the memory of a dead child was worth considerably less than the affections of a living husband She made her plan and staked her all upon it In that hour she discovered that she knew Tom Bremmil thoroughly and this knowledge she acted on Tom said she I shall be dining out at the Longmores on the evening of the twenty sixth You d better dine at the club This saved Bremmil from making an excuse to get away and dine with missus Hauksbee so he was grateful and felt small and mean at the same time which was wholesome Bremmil left the house at five for a ride About half past five in the evening a large leather covered basket came in from Phelps for missus Bremmil She was a woman who knew how to dress and she had not spent a week on designing that dress and having it gored and hemmed and herring boned and tucked and rucked or whatever the terms are for nothing It was a gorgeous dress slight mourning I can t describe it but it was what The Queen calls a creation a thing that hit you straight between the eyes and made you gasp She had not much heart for what she was going to do but as she glanced at the long mirror she had the satisfaction of knowing that she had never looked so well in her life She was a large blonde and when she chose carried herself superbly After the dinner at the Longmores she went on to the dance a little late and encountered Bremmil with missus Hauksbee on his arm That made her flush and as the men crowded round her for dances she looked magnificent She filled up all her dances except three and those she left blank missus Hauksbee caught her eye once and she knew it was war real war between them She started handicapped in the struggle for she had ordered Bremmil about just the least little bit in the world too much and he was beginning to resent it Moreover he had never seen his wife look so lovely He stared at her from doorways and glared at her from passages as she went about with her partners and the more he stared the more taken was he He could scarcely believe that this was the woman with the red eyes and the black stuff gown who used to weep over the eggs at breakfast missus Hauksbee did her best to hold him in play but after two dances he crossed over to his wife and asked for a dance I m afraid you ve come too late MISTER Bremmil she said with her eyes twinkling Then he begged her to give him a dance and as a great favor she allowed him the fifth waltz Luckily five stood vacant on his programme They danced it together and there was a little flutter round the room Bremmil had a sort of notion that his wife could dance but he never knew she danced so divinely At the end of that waltz he asked for another as a favor not as a right and missus Bremmil said Show me your programme dear He showed it as a naughty little schoolboy hands up contraband sweets to a master There was a fair sprinkling of H on it besides H at supper missus Bremmil said nothing but she smiled contemptuously ran her pencil through seven and nine two H s and returned the card with her own name written above a pet name that only she and her husband used Then she shook her finger at him and said laughing Oh you silly SILLY boy missus Hauksbee heard that and she owned as much felt that she had the worst of it Bremmil accepted seven and nine gratefully They danced seven and sat out nine in one of the little tents What Bremmil said and what missus Bremmil said is no concern of any one s When the band struck up The Roast Beef of Old England the two went out into the verandah and Bremmil began looking for his wife s dandy this was before rickshaw days while she went into the cloak room missus Hauksbee came up and said You take me in to supper I think mister Bremmil Bremmil turned red and looked foolish Ah h m I m going home with my wife missus Hauksbee I think there has been a little mistake Being a man he spoke as though missus Hauksbee were entirely responsible missus Bremmil came out of the cloak room in a swansdown cloak with a white cloud round her head She looked radiant and she had a right to The couple went off in the darkness together Bremmil riding very close to the dandy Then says missus Hauksbee to me she looked a trifle faded and jaded in the lamplight Take my word for it the silliest woman can manage a clever man but it needs a very clever woman to manage a fool Then we went in to supper THROWN AWAY And some are sulky while some will plunge So ho Steady Stand still you Some you must gentle and some you must lunge There There Who wants to kill you Some there are losses in every trade Will break their hearts ere bitted and made Will fight like fiends as the rope cuts hard And die dumb mad in the breaking yard Toolungala Stockyard Chorus To rear a boy under what parents call the sheltered life system is if the boy must go into the world and fend for himself not wise Unless he be one in a thousand he has certainly to pass through many unnecessary troubles and may possibly come to extreme grief simply from ignorance of the proper proportions of things Let a puppy eat the soap in the bath room or chew a newly blacked boot He chews and chuckles until by and by he finds out that blacking and Old Brown Windsor make him very sick so he argues that soap and boots are not wholesome Any old dog about the house will soon show him the unwisdom of biting big dogs ears Being young he remembers and goes abroad at six months a well mannered little beast with a chastened appetite If he had been kept away from boots and soap and big dogs till he came to the trinity full grown and with developed teeth just consider how fearfully sick and thrashed he would be Apply that motion to the sheltered life and see how it works It does not sound pretty but it is the better of two evils There was a Boy once who had been brought up under the sheltered life theory and the theory killed him dead He stayed with his people all his days from the hour he was born till the hour he went into Sandhurst nearly at the top of the list He was beautifully taught in all that wins marks by a private tutor and carried the extra weight of never having given his parents an hour s anxiety in his life What he learnt at Sandhurst beyond the regular routine is of no great consequence He looked about him and he found soap and blacking so to speak very good He ate a little and came out of Sandhurst not so high as he went in Them there was an interval and a scene with his people who expected much from him Next a year of living unspotted from the world in a third rate depot battalion where all the juniors were children and all the seniors old women and lastly he came out to India where he was cut off from the support of his parents and had no one to fall back on in time of trouble except himself Now India is a place beyond all others where one must not take things too seriously the midday sun always excepted Too much work and too much energy kill a man just as effectively as too much assorted vice or too much drink Flirtation does not matter because every one is being transferred and either you or she leave the Station and never return Good work does not matter because a man is judged by his worst output and another man takes all the credit of his best as a rule Bad work does not matter because other men do worse and incompetents hang on longer in India than anywhere else Amusements do not matter because you must repeat them as soon as you have accomplished them once and most amusements only mean trying to win another person s money Sickness does not matter because it s all in the day s work and if you die another man takes over your place and your office in the eight hours between death and burial Nothing matters except Home furlough and acting allowances and these only because they are scarce This is a slack kutcha country where all men work with imperfect instruments and the wisest thing is to take no one and nothing in earnest but to escape as soon as ever you can to some place where amusement is amusement and a reputation worth the having But this Boy the tale is as old as the Hills came out and took all things seriously He was pretty and was petted He took the pettings seriously and fretted over women not worth saddling a pony to call upon He found his new free life in India very good It DOES look attractive in the beginning from a Subaltern s point of view all ponies partners dancing and so on He tasted it as the puppy tastes the soap Only he came late to the eating with a growing set of teeth He had no sense of balance just like the puppy and could not understand why he was not treated with the consideration he received under his father s roof This hurt his feelings He quarrelled with other boys and being sensitive to the marrow remembered these quarrels and they excited him He found whist and gymkhanas and things of that kind meant to amuse one after office good but he took them seriously too just as he took the head that followed after drink He lost his money over whist and gymkhanas because they were new to him He took his losses seriously and wasted as much energy and interest over a two goldmohur race for maiden ekka ponies with their manes hogged as if it had been the Derby One half of this came from inexperience much as the puppy squabbles with the corner of the hearth rug and the other half from the dizziness bred by stumbling out of his quiet life into the glare and excitement of a livelier one No one told him about the soap and the blacking because an average man takes it for granted that an average man is ordinarily careful in regard to them It was pitiful to watch The Boy knocking himself to pieces as an over handled colt falls down and cuts himself when he gets away from the groom This unbridled license in amusements not worth the trouble of breaking line for much less rioting over endured for six months all through one cold weather and then we thought that the heat and the knowledge of having lost his money and health and lamed his horses would sober The Boy down and he would stand steady In ninety nine cases out of a hundred this would have happened You can see the principle working in any Indian Station But this particular case fell through because The Boy was sensitive and took things seriously as I may have said some seven times before Of course we couldn t tell how his excesses struck him personally They were nothing very heart breaking or above the average He might be crippled for life financially and want a little nursing Still the memory of his performances would wither away in one hot weather and the shroff would help him to tide over the money troubles But he must have taken another view altogether and have believed himself ruined beyond redemption His Colonel talked to him severely when the cold weather ended That made him more wretched than ever and it was only an ordinary Colonel s wigging What follows is a curious instance of the fashion in which we are all linked together and made responsible for one another THE thing that kicked the beam in The Boy s mind was a remark that a woman made when he was talking to her There is no use in repeating it for it was only a cruel little sentence rapped out before thinking that made him flush to the roots of his hair He kept himself to himself for three days and then put in for two days leave to go shooting near a Canal Engineer s Rest House about thirty miles out He got his leave and that night at Mess was noisier and more offensive than ever He said that he was going to shoot big game and left at half past ten o clock in an ekka Partridge which was the only thing a man could get near the Rest House is not big game so every one laughed Next morning one of the Majors came in from short leave and heard that The Boy had gone out to shoot big game The Major had taken an interest in The Boy and had more than once tried to check him in the cold weather The Major put up his eyebrows when he heard of the expedition and went to The Boy s room where he rummaged Presently he came out and found me leaving cards on the Mess There was no one else in the ante room He said The Boy has gone out shooting DOES a man shoot tetur with a revolver and a writing case I said Nonsense Major for I saw what was in his mind He said Nonsense or nonsense I m going to the Canal now at once I don t feel easy Then he thought for a minute and said Can you lie You know best I answered It s my profession Very well said the Major you must come out with me now at once in an ekka to the Canal to shoot black buck Go and put on shikar kit quick and drive here with a gun The Major was a masterful man and I knew that he would not give orders for nothing So I obeyed and on return found the Major packed up in an ekka gun cases and food slung below all ready for a shooting trip He dismissed the driver and drove himself We jogged along quietly while in the station but as soon as we got to the dusty road across the plains he made that pony fly A country bred can do nearly anything at a pinch We covered the thirty miles in under three hours but the poor brute was nearly dead Once I said What s the blazing hurry Major He said quietly The Boy has been alone by himself for one two five fourteen hours now I tell you I don t feel easy This uneasiness spread itself to me and I helped to beat the pony When we came to the Canal Engineer s Rest House the Major called for The Boy s servant but there was no answer Then we went up to the house calling for The Boy by name but there was no answer Oh he s out shooting said I Just then I saw through one of the windows a little hurricane lamp burning This was at four in the afternoon We both stopped dead in the verandah holding our breath to catch every sound and we heard inside the room the brr brr brr of a multitude of flies The Major said nothing but he took off his helmet and we entered very softly The Boy was dead on the charpoy in the centre of the bare lime washed room He had shot his head nearly to pieces with his revolver The gun cases were still strapped so was the bedding and on the table lay The Boy s writing case with photographs He had gone away to die like a poisoned rat The Major said to himself softly Poor Boy Poor POOR devil Then he turned away from the bed and said I want your help in this business Knowing The Boy was dead by his own hand I saw exactly what that help would be so I passed over to the table took a chair lit a cheroot and began to go through the writing case the Major looking over my shoulder and repeating to himself We came too late Like a rat in a hole Poor POOR devil The Boy must have spent half the night in writing to his people and to his Colonel and to a girl at Home and as soon as he had finished must have shot himself for he had been dead a long time when we came in I read all that he had written and passed over each sheet to the Major as I finished it We saw from his accounts how very seriously he had taken everything He wrote about disgrace which he was unable to bear indelible shame criminal folly wasted life and so on besides a lot of private things to his Father and Mother too much too sacred to put into print The letter to the girl at Home was the most pitiful of all and I choked as I read it The Major made no attempt to keep dry eyed I respected him for that He read and rocked himself to and fro and simply cried like a woman without caring to hide it The letters were so dreary and hopeless and touching We forgot all about The Boy s follies and only thought of the poor Thing on the charpoy and the scrawled sheets in our hands It was utterly impossible to let the letters go Home They would have broken his Father s heart and killed his Mother after killing her belief in her son At last the Major dried his eyes openly and said Nice sort of thing to spring on an English family What shall we do I said knowing what the Major had brought me but for The Boy died of cholera We were with him at the time We can t commit ourselves to half measures Come along Then began one of the most grimy comic scenes I have ever taken part in the concoction of a big written lie bolstered with evidence to soothe The Boy s people at Home I began the rough draft of a letter the Major throwing in hints here and there while he gathered up all the stuff that The Boy had written and burnt it in the fireplace It was a hot still evening when we began and the lamp burned very badly In due course I got the draft to my satisfaction setting forth how The Boy was the pattern of all virtues beloved by his regiment with every promise of a great career before him and so on how we had helped him through the sickness it was no time for little lies you will understand and how he had died without pain I choked while I was putting down these things and thinking of the poor people who would read them Then I laughed at the grotesqueness of the affair and the laughter mixed itself up with the choke and the Major said that we both wanted drinks I am afraid to say how much whiskey we drank before the letter was finished It had not the least effect on us Then we took off The Boy s watch locket and rings Lastly the Major said We must send a lock of hair too A woman values that But there were reasons why we could not find a lock fit to send The Boy was black haired and so was the Major luckily I cut off a piece of the Major s hair above the temple with a knife and put it into the packet we were making The laughing fit and the chokes got hold of me again and I had to stop The Major was nearly as bad and we both knew that the worst part of the work was to come We sealed up the packet photographs locket seals ring letter and lock of hair with The Boy s sealing wax and The Boy s seal Then the Major said For God s sake let s get outside away from the room and think We went outside and walked on the banks of the Canal for an hour eating and drinking what we had with us until the moon rose I know now exactly how a murderer feels Finally we forced ourselves back to the room with the lamp and the Other Thing in it and began to take up the next piece of work I am not going to write about this It was too horrible We burned the bedstead and dropped the ashes into the Canal we took up the matting of the room and treated that in the same way I went off to a village and borrowed two big hoes I did not want the villagers to help while the Major arranged the other matters It took us four hours hard work to make the grave As we worked we argued out whether it was right to say as much as we remembered of the Burial of the Dead We compromised things by saying the Lord s Prayer with a private unofficial prayer for the peace of the soul of The Boy Then we filled in the grave and went into the verandah not the house to lie down to sleep We were dead tired When we woke the Major said wearily We can t go back till to morrow We must give him a decent time to die in He died early THIS morning remember That seems more natural So the Major must have been lying awake all the time thinking I said Then why didn t we bring the body back to the cantonments The Major thought for a minute Because the people bolted when they heard of the cholera And the ekka has gone That was strictly true We had forgotten all about the ekka pony and he had gone home So we were left there alone all that stifling day in the Canal Rest House testing and re testing our story of The Boy s death to see if it was weak at any point A native turned up in the afternoon but we said that a Sahib was dead of cholera and he ran away As the dusk gathered the Major told me all his fears about The Boy and awful stories of suicide or nearly carried out suicide tales that made one s hair crisp He said that he himself had once gone into the same Valley of the Shadow as the Boy when he was young and new to the country so he understood how things fought together in The Boy s poor jumbled head He also said that youngsters in their repentant moments consider their sins much more serious and ineffaceable than they really are We talked together all through the evening and rehearsed the story of the death of The Boy As soon as the moon was up and The Boy theoretically just buried we struck across country for the Station We walked from eight till six o clock in the morning but though we were dead tired we did not forget to go to The Boy s room and put away his revolver with the proper amount of cartridges in the pouch Also to set his writing case on the table We found the Colonel and reported the death feeling more like murderers than ever Then we went to bed and slept the clock round for there was no more in us The tale had credence as long as was necessary for every one forgot about The Boy before a fortnight was over Many people however found time to say that the Major had behaved scandalously in not bringing in the body for a regimental funeral The saddest thing of all was a letter from The Boy s mother to the Major and me with big inky blisters all over the sheet She wrote the sweetest possible things about our great kindness and the obligation she would be under to us as long as she lived All things considered she WAS under an obligation but not exactly as she meant MISS YOUGHAL S SAIS When Man and Woman are agreed what can the Kazi do Mahomedan Proverb Some people say that there is no romance in India Those people are wrong Our lives hold quite as much romance as is good for us Sometimes more Strickland was in the Police and people did not understand him so they said he was a doubtful sort of man and passed by on the other side Strickland had himself to thank for this He held the extraordinary theory that a Policeman in India should try to know as much about the natives as the natives themselves Now in the whole of Upper India there is only ONE man who can pass for Hindu or Mohammedan chamar or faquir as he pleases He is feared and respected by the natives from the Ghor Kathri to the Jamma Musjid and he is supposed to have the gift of invisibility and executive control over many Devils But what good has this done him with the Government None in the world He has never got Simla for his charge and his name is almost unknown to Englishmen Strickland was foolish enough to take that man for his model and following out his absurd theory dabbled in unsavory places no respectable man would think of exploring all among the native riff raff He educated himself in this peculiar way for seven years and people could not appreciate it He was perpetually going Fantee among the natives which of course no man with any sense believes in He was initiated into the Sat Bhai at Allahabad once when he was on leave he knew the Lizard Song of the Sansis and the Halli Hukk dance which is a religious can can of a startling kind When a man knows who dances the Halli Hukk and how and when and where he knows something to be proud of He has gone deeper than the skin But Strickland was not proud though he had helped once at Jagadhri at the Painting of the Death Bull which no Englishman must even look upon had mastered the thieves patter of the changars had taken a Eusufzai horse thief alone near Attock and had stood under the mimbar board of a Border mosque and conducted service in the manner of a Sunni Mollah His crowning achievement was spending eleven days as a faquir in the gardens of Baba Atal at Amritsar and there picking up the threads of the great Nasiban Murder Case But people said justly enough Why on earth can t Strickland sit in his office and write up his diary and recruit and keep quiet instead of showing up the incapacity of his seniors So the Nasiban Murder Case did him no good departmentally but after his first feeling of wrath he returned to his outlandish custom of prying into native life By the way when a man once acquires a taste for this particular amusement it abides with him all his days It is the most fascinating thing in the world Love not excepted Where other men took ten days to the Hills Strickland took leave for what he called shikar put on the disguise that appealed to him at the time stepped down into the brown crowd and was swallowed up for a while He was a quiet dark young fellow spare black eyes and when he was not thinking of something else a very interesting companion Strickland on Native Progress as he had seen it was worth hearing Natives hated Strickland but they were afraid of him He knew too much When the Youghals came into the station Strickland very gravely as he did everything fell in love with Miss Youghal and she after a while fell in love with him because she could not understand him Then Strickland told the parents but missus Youghal said she was not going to throw her daughter into the worst paid Department in the Empire and old Youghal said in so many words that he mistrusted Strickland s ways and works and would thank him not to speak or write to his daughter any more Very well said Strickland for he did not wish to make his lady love s life a burden After one long talk with Miss Youghal he dropped the business entirely The Youghals went up to Simla in April In July Strickland secured three months leave on urgent private affairs He locked up his house though not a native in the Providence would wittingly have touched Estreekin Sahib s gear for the world and went down to see a friend of his an old dyer at Tarn Taran Here all trace of him was lost until a sais met me on the Simla Mall with this extraordinary note Dear old man Please give bearer a box of cheroots Supers No I for preference They are freshest at the Club I ll repay when I reappear but at present I m out of Society Yours E STRICKLAND I ordered two boxes and handed them over to the sais with my love That sais was Strickland and he was in old Youghal s employ attached to Miss Youghal s Arab The poor fellow was suffering for an English smoke and knew that whatever happened I should hold my tongue till the business was over Later on missus Youghal who was wrapped up in her servants began talking at houses where she called of her paragon among saises the man who was never too busy to get up in the morning and pick flowers for the breakfast table and who blacked actually BLACKED the hoofs of his horse like a London coachman The turnout of Miss Youghal s Arab was a wonder and a delight Strickland Dulloo I mean found his reward in the pretty things that Miss Youghal said to him when she went out riding Her parents were pleased to find she had forgotten all her foolishness for young Strickland and said she was a good girl Strickland vows that the two months of his service were the most rigid mental discipline he has ever gone through Quite apart from the little fact that the wife of one of his fellow saises fell in love with him and then tried to poison him with arsenic because he would have nothing to do with her he had to school himself into keeping quiet when Miss Youghal went out riding with some man who tried to flirt with her and he was forced to trot behind carrying the blanket and hearing every word Also he had to keep his temper when he was slanged in Benmore porch by a policeman especially once when he was abused by a Naik he had himself recruited from Isser Jang village or worse still when a young subaltern called him a pig for not making way quickly enough But the life had its compensations He obtained great insight into the ways and thefts of saises enough he says to have summarily convicted half the chamar population of the Punjab if he had been on business He became one of the leading players at knuckle bones which all jhampanis and many saises play while they are waiting outside the Government House or the Gaiety Theatre of nights he learned to smoke tobacco that was three fourths cowdung and he heard the wisdom of the grizzled Jemadar of the Government House saises whose words are valuable He saw many things which amused him and he states on honor that no man can appreciate Simla properly till he has seen it from the sais s point of view He also says that if he chose to write all he saw his head would be broken in several places Strickland s account of the agony he endured on wet nights hearing the music and seeing the lights in Benmore with his toes tingling for a waltz and his head in a horse blanket is rather amusing One of these days Strickland is going to write a little book on his experiences That book will be worth buying and even more worth suppressing Thus he served faithfully as Jacob served for Rachel and his leave was nearly at an end when the explosion came He had really done his best to keep his temper in the hearing of the flirtations I have mentioned but he broke down at last An old and very distinguished General took Miss Youghal for a ride and began that specially offensive you re only a little girl sort of flirtation most difficult for a woman to turn aside deftly and most maddening to listen to Miss Youghal was shaking with fear at the things he said in the hearing of her sais Dulloo Strickland stood it as long as he could Then he caught hold of the General s bridle and in most fluent English invited him to step off and be heaved over the cliff Next minute Miss Youghal began crying and Strickland saw that he had hopelessly given himself away and everything was over The General nearly had a fit while Miss Youghal was sobbing out the story of the disguise and the engagement that wasn t recognized by the parents Strickland was furiously angry with himself and more angry with the General for forcing his hand so he said nothing but held the horse s head and prepared to thrash the General as some sort of satisfaction but when the General had thoroughly grasped the story and knew who Strickland was he began to puff and blow in the saddle and nearly rolled off with laughing He said Strickland deserved a V C if it were only for putting on a sais s blanket Then he called himself names and vowed that he deserved a thrashing but he was too old to take it from Strickland Then he complimented Miss Youghal on her lover The scandal of the business never struck him for he was a nice old man with a weakness for flirtations Then he laughed again and said that old Youghal was a fool Strickland let go of the cob s head and suggested that the General had better help them if that was his opinion Strickland knew Youghal s weakness for men with titles and letters after their names and high official position It s rather like a forty minute farce said the General but begad I WILL help if it s only to escape that tremendous thrashing I deserved Go along to your home my sais Policeman and change into decent kit and I ll attack mister Youghal Miss Youghal may I ask you to canter home and wait About seven minutes later there was a wild hurroosh at the Club A sais with a blanket and head rope was asking all the men he knew For Heaven s sake lend me decent clothes As the men did not recognize him there were some peculiar scenes before Strickland could get a hot bath with soda in it in one room a shirt here a collar there a pair of trousers elsewhere and so on He galloped off with half the Club wardrobe on his back and an utter stranger s pony under him to the house of old Youghal The General arrayed in purple and fine linen was before him What the General had said Strickland never knew but Youghal received Strickland with moderate civility and missus Youghal touched by the devotion of the transformed Dulloo was almost kind The General beamed and chuckled and Miss Youghal came in and almost before old Youghal knew where he was the parental consent had been wrenched out and Strickland had departed with Miss Youghal to the Telegraph Office to wire for his kit The final embarrassment was when an utter stranger attacked him on the Mall and asked for the stolen pony So in the end Strickland and Miss Youghal were married on the strict understanding that Strickland should drop his old ways and stick to Departmental routine which pays best and leads to Simla Strickland was far too fond of his wife just then to break his word but it was a sore trial to him for the streets and the bazars and the sounds in them were full of meaning to Strickland and these called to him to come back and take up his wanderings and his discoveries Some day I will tell you how he broke his promise to help a friend That was long since and he has by this time been nearly spoilt for what he would call shikar He is forgetting the slang and the beggar s cant and the marks and the signs and the drift of the undercurrents which if a man would master he must always continue to learn But he fills in his Departmental returns beautifully YOKED WITH AN UNBELIEVER I am dying for you and you are dying for another Punjabi Proverb When the Gravesend tender left the P O steamer for Bombay and went back to catch the train to Town there were many people in it crying But the one who wept most and most openly was Miss Agnes Laiter She had reason to cry because the only man she ever loved or ever could love so she said was going out to India and India as every one knows is divided equally between jungle tigers cobras cholera and sepoys Phil Garron leaning over the side of the steamer in the rain felt very unhappy too but he did not cry He was sent out to tea What tea meant he had not the vaguest idea but fancied that he would have to ride on a prancing horse over hills covered with tea vines and draw a sumptuous salary for doing so and he was very grateful to his uncle for getting him the berth He was really going to reform all his slack shiftless ways save a large proportion of his magnificent salary yearly and in a very short time return to marry Agnes Laiter Phil Garron had been lying loose on his friends hands for three years and as he had nothing to do he naturally fell in love He was very nice but he was not strong in his views and opinions and principles and though he never came to actual grief his friends were thankful when he said good bye and went out to this mysterious tea business near Darjiling They said God bless you dear boy Let us never see your face again or at least that was what Phil was given to understand When he sailed he was very full of a great plan to prove himself several hundred times better than any one had given him credit for to work like a horse and triumphantly marry Agnes Laiter He had many good points besides his good looks his only fault being that he was weak the least little bit in the world weak He had as much notion of economy as the Morning Sun and yet you could not lay your hand on any one item and say Herein Phil Garron is extravagant or reckless Nor could you point out any particular vice in his character but he was unsatisfactory and as workable as putty Agnes Laiter went about her duties at home her family objected to the engagement with red eyes while Phil was sailing to Darjiling a port on the Bengal Ocean as his mother used to tell her friends He was popular enough on board ship made many acquaintances and a moderately large liquor bill and sent off huge letters to Agnes Laiter at each port Then he fell to work on this plantation somewhere between Darjiling and Kangra and though the salary and the horse and the work were not quite all he had fancied he succeeded fairly well and gave himself much unnecessary credit for his perseverance In the course of time as he settled more into collar and his work grew fixed before him the face of Agnes Laiter went out of his mind and only came when he was at leisure which was not often He would forget all about her for a fortnight and remember her with a start like a school boy who has forgotten to learn his lesson She did not forget Phil because she was of the kind that never forgets Only another man a really desirable young man presented himself before missus Laiter and the chance of a marriage with Phil was as far off as ever and his letters were so unsatisfactory and there was a certain amount of domestic pressure brought to bear on the girl and the young man really was an eligible person as incomes go and the end of all things was that Agnes married him and wrote a tempestuous whirlwind of a letter to Phil in the wilds of Darjiling and said she should never know a happy moment all the rest of her life Which was a true prophecy Phil got that letter and held himself ill treated This was two years after he had come out but by dint of thinking fixedly of Agnes Laiter and looking at her photograph and patting himself on the back for being one of the most constant lovers in history and warming to the work as he went on he really fancied that he had been very hardly used He sat down and wrote one final letter a really pathetic world without end amen epistle explaining how he would be true to Eternity and that all women were very much alike and he would hide his broken heart et cetera et cetera but if at any future time et cetera et cetera he could afford to wait et cetera et cetera unchanged affections et cetera et cetera return to her old love et cetera et cetera for eight closely written pages From an artistic point of view it was very neat work but an ordinary Philistine who knew the state of Phil s real feelings not the ones he rose to as he went on writing would have called it the thoroughly mean and selfish work of a thoroughly mean and selfish weak man But this verdict would have been incorrect Phil paid for the postage and felt every word he had written for at least two days and a half It was the last flicker before the light went out That letter made Agnes Laiter very unhappy and she cried and put it away in her desk and became missus Somebody Else for the good of her family Which is the first duty of every Christian maid Phil went his ways and thought no more of his letter except as an artist thinks of a neatly touched in sketch His ways were not bad but they were not altogether good until they brought him across Dunmaya the daughter of a Rajput ex Subadar Major of our Native Army The girl had a strain of Hill blood in her and like the Hill women was not a purdah nashin Where Phil met her or how he heard of her does not matter She was a good girl and handsome and in her way very clever and shrewd though of course a little hard It is to be remembered that Phil was living very comfortably denying himself no small luxury never putting by an anna very satisfied with himself and his good intentions was dropping all his English correspondents one by one and beginning more and more to look upon this land as his home Some men fall this way and they are of no use afterwards The climate where he was stationed was good and it really did not seem to him that there was anything to go Home for He did what many planters have done before him that is to say he made up his mind to marry a Hill girl and settle down He was seven and twenty then with a long life before him but no spirit to go through with it So he married Dunmaya by the forms of the English Church and some fellow planters said he was a fool and some said he was a wise man Dunmaya was a thoroughly honest girl and in spite of her reverence for an Englishman had a reasonable estimate of her husband s weaknesses She managed him tenderly and became in less than a year a very passable imitation of an English lady in dress and carriage It is curious to think that a Hill man after a lifetime s education is a Hill man still but a Hill woman can in six months master most of the ways of her English sisters There was a coolie woman once But that is another story Dunmaya dressed by preference in black and yellow and looked well Meantime the letter lay in Agnes s desk and now and again she would think of poor resolute hard working Phil among the cobras and tigers of Darjiling toiling in the vain hope that she might come back to him Her husband was worth ten Phils except that he had rheumatism of the heart Three years after he was married and after he had tried Nice and Algeria for his complaint he went to Bombay where he died and set Agnes free Being a devout woman she looked on his death and the place of it as a direct interposition of Providence and when she had recovered from the shock she took out and reread Phil s letter with the et cetera et cetera and the big dashes and the little dashes and kissed it several times No one knew her in Bombay she had her husband s income which was a large one and Phil was close at hand It was wrong and improper of course but she decided as heroines do in novels to find her old lover to offer him her hand and her gold and with him spend the rest of her life in some spot far from unsympathetic souls She sat for two months alone in Watson s Hotel elaborating this decision and the picture was a pretty one Then she set out in search of Phil Garron Assistant on a tea plantation with a more than usually unpronounceable name She found him She spent a month over it for his plantation was not in the Darjiling district at all but nearer Kangra Phil was very little altered and Dunmaya was very nice to her Now the particular sin and shame of the whole business is that Phil who really is not worth thinking of twice was and is loved by Dunmaya and more than loved by Agnes the whole of whose life he seems to have spoilt Worst of all Dunmaya is making a decent man of him and he will be ultimately saved from perdition through her training Which is manifestly unfair FALSE DAWN To night God knows what thing shall tide The Earth is racked and faint Expectant sleepless open eyed And we who from the Earth were made Thrill with our Mother s pain In Durance No man will ever know the exact truth of this story though women may sometimes whisper it to one another after a dance when they are putting up their hair for the night and comparing lists of victims A man of course cannot assist at these functions So the tale must be told from the outside in the dark all wrong Never praise a sister to a sister in the hope of your compliments reaching the proper ears and so preparing the way for you later on Sisters are women first and sisters afterwards and you will find that you do yourself harm Saumarez knew this when he made up his mind to propose to the elder Miss Copleigh Saumarez was a strange man with few merits so far as men could see though he was popular with women and carried enough conceit to stock a Viceroy s Council and leave a little over for the Commander in Chief s Staff He was a Civilian Very many women took an interest in Saumarez perhaps because his manner to them was offensive If you hit a pony over the nose at the outset of your acquaintance he may not love you but he will take a deep interest in your movements ever afterwards The elder Miss Copleigh was nice plump winning and pretty The younger was not so pretty and from men disregarding the hint set forth above her style was repellant and unattractive Both girls had practically the same figure and there was a strong likeness between them in look and voice though no one could doubt for an instant which was the nicer of the two Saumarez made up his mind as soon as they came into the station from Behar to marry the elder one At least we all made sure that he would which comes to the same thing She was two and twenty and he was thirty three with pay and allowances of nearly fourteen hundred rupees a month So the match as we arranged it was in every way a good one Saumarez was his name and summary was his nature as a man once said Having drafted his Resolution he formed a Select Committee of One to sit upon it and resolved to take his time In our unpleasant slang the Copleigh girls hunted in couples That is to say you could do nothing with one without the other They were very loving sisters but their mutual affection was sometimes inconvenient Saumarez held the balance hair true between them and none but himself could have said to which side his heart inclined though every one guessed He rode with them a good deal and danced with them but he never succeeded in detaching them from each other for any length of time Women said that the two girls kept together through deep mistrust each fearing that the other would steal a march on her But that has nothing to do with a man Saumarez was silent for good or bad and as business likely attentive as he could be having due regard to his work and his polo Beyond doubt both girls were fond of him As the hot weather drew nearer and Saumarez made no sign women said that you could see their trouble in the eyes of the girls that they were looking strained anxious and irritable Men are quite blind in these matters unless they have more of the woman than the man in their composition in which case it does not matter what they say or think I maintain it was the hot April days that took the color out of the Copleigh girls cheeks They should have been sent to the Hills early No one man or woman feels an angel when the hot weather is approaching The younger sister grew more cynical not to say acid in her ways and the winningness of the elder wore thin There was more effort in it Now the Station wherein all these things happened was though not a little one off the line of rail and suffered through want of attention There were no gardens or bands or amusements worth speaking of and it was nearly a day s journey to come into Lahore for a dance People were grateful for small things to interest them About the beginning of May and just before the final exodus of Hill goers when the weather was very hot and there were not more than twenty people in the Station Saumarez gave a moonlight riding picnic at an old tomb six miles away near the bed of the river It was a Noah s Ark picnic and there was to be the usual arrangement of quarter mile intervals between each couple on account of the dust Six couples came altogether including chaperons Moonlight picnics are useful just at the very end of the season before all the girls go away to the Hills They lead to understandings and should be encouraged by chaperones especially those whose girls look sweetish in riding habits I knew a case once But that is another story That picnic was called the Great Pop Picnic because every one knew Saumarez would propose then to the eldest Miss Copleigh and beside his affair there was another which might possibly come to happiness The social atmosphere was heavily charged and wanted clearing We met at the parade ground at ten the night was fearfully hot The horses sweated even at walking pace but anything was better than sitting still in our own dark houses When we moved off under the full moon we were four couples one triplet and mister Saumarez rode with the Copleigh girls and I loitered at the tail of the procession wondering with whom Saumarez would ride home Every one was happy and contented but we all felt that things were going to happen We rode slowly and it was nearly midnight before we reached the old tomb facing the ruined tank in the decayed gardens where we were going to eat and drink I was late in coming up and before I went into the garden I saw that the horizon to the north carried a faint dun colored feather But no one would have thanked me for spoiling so well managed an entertainment as this picnic and a dust storm more or less does no great harm We gathered by the tank Some one had brought out a banjo which is a most sentimental instrument and three or four of us sang You must not laugh at this Our amusements in out of the way Stations are very few indeed Then we talked in groups or together lying under the trees with the sun baked roses dropping their petals on our feet until supper was ready It was a beautiful supper as cold and as iced as you could wish and we stayed long over it I had felt that the air was growing hotter and hotter but nobody seemed to notice it until the moon went out and a burning hot wind began lashing the orange trees with a sound like the noise of the sea Before we knew where we were the dust storm was on us and everything was roaring whirling darkness The supper table was blown bodily into the tank We were afraid of staying anywhere near the old tomb for fear it might be blown down So we felt our way to the orange trees where the horses were picketed and waited for the storm to blow over Then the little light that was left vanished and you could not see your hand before your face The air was heavy with dust and sand from the bed of the river that filled boots and pockets and drifted down necks and coated eyebrows and moustaches It was one of the worst dust storms of the year We were all huddled together close to the trembling horses with the thunder clattering overhead and the lightning spurting like water from a sluice all ways at once There was no danger of course unless the horses broke loose I was standing with my head downward and my hands over my mouth hearing the trees thrashing each other I could not see who was next me till the flashes came Then I found that I was packed near Saumarez and the eldest Miss Copleigh with my own horse just in front of me I recognized the eldest Miss Copleigh because she had a pagri round her helmet and the younger had not All the electricity in the air had gone into my body and I was quivering and tingling from head to foot exactly as a corn shoots and tingles before rain It was a grand storm The wind seemed to be picking up the earth and pitching it to leeward in great heaps and the heat beat up from the ground like the heat of the Day of Judgment The storm lulled slightly after the first half hour and I heard a despairing little voice close to my ear saying to itself quietly and softly as if some lost soul were flying about with the wind O my God Then the younger Miss Copleigh stumbled into my arms saying Where is my horse Get my horse I want to go home I WANT to go home Take me home I thought that the lightning and the black darkness had frightened her so I said there was no danger but she must wait till the storm blew over She answered It is not THAT It is not THAT I want to go home O take me away from here I said that she could not go till the light came but I felt her brush past me and go away It was too dark to see where Then the whole sky was split open with one tremendous flash as if the end of the world were coming and all the women shrieked Almost directly after this I felt a man s hand on my shoulder and heard Saumarez bellowing in my ear Through the rattling of the trees and howling of the wind I did not catch his words at once but at last I heard him say I ve proposed to the wrong one What shall I do Saumarez had no occasion to make this confidence to me I was never a friend of his nor am I now but I fancy neither of us were ourselves just then He was shaking as he stood with excitement and I was feeling queer all over with the electricity I could not think of anything to say except More fool you for proposing in a dust storm But I did not see how that would improve the mistake Then he shouted Where s Edith Edith Copleigh Edith was the youngest sister I answered out of my astonishment What do you want with HER Would you believe it for the next two minutes he and I were shouting at each other like maniacs he vowing that it was the youngest sister he had meant to propose to all along and I telling him till my throat was hoarse that he must have made a mistake I can t account for this except again by the fact that we were neither of us ourselves Everything seemed to me like a bad dream from the stamping of the horses in the darkness to Saumarez telling me the story of his loving Edith Copleigh since the first He was still clawing my shoulder and begging me to tell him where Edith Copleigh was when another lull came and brought light with it and we saw the dust cloud forming on the plain in front of us So we knew the worst was over The moon was low down and there was just the glimmer of the false dawn that comes about an hour before the real one But the light was very faint and the dun cloud roared like a bull I wondered where Edith Copleigh had gone and as I was wondering I saw three things together First Maud Copleigh s face come smiling out of the darkness and move towards Saumarez who was standing by me I heard the girl whisper George and slide her arm through the arm that was not clawing my shoulder and I saw that look on her face which only comes once or twice in a lifetime when a woman is perfectly happy and the air is full of trumpets and gorgeous colored fire and the Earth turns into cloud because she loves and is loved At the same time I saw Saumarez s face as he heard Maud Copleigh s voice and fifty yards away from the clump of orange trees I saw a brown holland habit getting upon a horse It must have been my state of over excitement that made me so quick to meddle with what did not concern me Saumarez was moving off to the habit but I pushed him back and said Stop here and explain I ll fetch her back and I ran out to get at my own horse I had a perfectly unnecessary notion that everything must be done decently and in order and that Saumarez s first care was to wipe the happy look out of Maud Copleigh s face All the time I was linking up the curb chain I wondered how he would do it I cantered after Edith Copleigh thinking to bring her back slowly on some pretence or another But she galloped away as soon as she saw me and I was forced to ride after her in earnest She called back over her shoulder Go away I m going home Oh go away two or three times but my business was to catch her first and argue later The ride just fitted in with the rest of the evil dream The ground was very bad and now and again we rushed through the whirling choking dust devils in the skirts of the flying storm There was a burning hot wind blowing that brought up a stench of stale brick kilns with it and through the half light and through the dust devils across that desolate plain flickered the brown holland habit on the gray horse She headed for the Station at first Then she wheeled round and set off for the river through beds of burnt down jungle grass bad even to ride a pig over In cold blood I should never have dreamed of going over such a country at night but it seemed quite right and natural with the lightning crackling overhead and a reek like the smell of the Pit in my nostrils I rode and shouted and she bent forward and lashed her horse and the aftermath of the dust storm came up and caught us both and drove us downwind like pieces of paper I don t know how far we rode but the drumming of the horse hoofs and the roar of the wind and the race of the faint blood red moon through the yellow mist seemed to have gone on for years and years and I was literally drenched with sweat from my helmet to my gaiters when the gray stumbled recovered himself and pulled up dead lame My brute was used up altogether Edith Copleigh was in a sad state plastered with dust her helmet off and crying bitterly Why can t you let me alone she said I only wanted to get away and go home Oh PLEASE let me go You have got to come back with me Miss Copleigh Saumarez has something to say to you It was a foolish way of putting it but I hardly knew Miss Copleigh and though I was playing Providence at the cost of my horse I could not tell her in as many words what Saumarez had told me I thought he could do that better himself All her pretence about being tired and wanting to go home broke down and she rocked herself to and fro in the saddle as she sobbed and the hot wind blew her black hair to leeward I am not going to repeat what she said because she was utterly unstrung This if you please was the cynical Miss Copleigh Here was I almost an utter stranger to her trying to tell her that Saumarez loved her and she was to come back to hear him say so I believe I made myself understood for she gathered the gray together and made him hobble somehow and we set off for the tomb while the storm went thundering down to Umballa and a few big drops of warm rain fell I found out that she had been standing close to Saumarez when he proposed to her sister and had wanted to go home and cry in peace as an English girl should She dabbled her eyes with her pocket handkerchief as we went along and babbled to me out of sheer lightness of heart and hysteria That was perfectly unnatural and yet it seemed all right at the time and in the place All the world was only the two Copleigh girls Saumarez and I ringed in with the lightning and the dark and the guidance of this misguided world seemed to lie in my hands When we returned to the tomb in the deep dead stillness that followed the storm the dawn was just breaking and nobody had gone away They were waiting for our return Saumarez most of all His face was white and drawn As Miss Copleigh and I limped up he came forward to meet us and when he helped her down from her saddle he kissed her before all the picnic It was like a scene in a theatre and the likeness was heightened by all the dust white ghostly looking men and women under the orange trees clapping their hands as if they were watching a play at Saumarez s choice I never knew anything so un English in my life Lastly Saumarez said we must all go home or the Station would come out to look for us and WOULD I be good enough to ride home with Maud Copleigh Nothing would give me greater pleasure I said So we formed up six couples in all and went back two by two Saumarez walking at the side of Edith Copleigh who was riding his horse The air was cleared and little by little as the sun rose I felt we were all dropping back again into ordinary men and women and that the Great Pop Picnic was a thing altogether apart and out of the world never to happen again It had gone with the dust storm and the tingle in the hot air I felt tired and limp and a good deal ashamed of myself as I went in for a bath and some sleep There is a woman s version of this story but it will never be written unless Maud Copleigh cares to try THE RESCUE OF PLUFFLES Thus for a season they fought it fair She and his cousin May Tactful talented debonnaire Decorous foes were they But never can battle of man compare With merciless feminine fray Two and One missus Hauksbee was sometimes nice to her own sex Here is a story to prove this and you can believe just as much as ever you please Pluffles was a subaltern in the Unmentionables He was callow even for a subaltern He was callow all over like a canary that had not finished fledging itself The worst of it was he had three times as much money as was good for him Pluffles Papa being a rich man and Pluffles being the only son Pluffles Mamma adored him She was only a little less callow than Pluffles and she believed everything he said Pluffles weakness was not believing what people said He preferred what he called trusting to his own judgment He had as much judgment as he had seat or hands and this preference tumbled him into trouble once or twice But the biggest trouble Pluffles ever manufactured came about at Simla some years ago when he was four and twenty He began by trusting to his own judgment as usual and the result was that after a time he was bound hand and foot to missus Reiver s rickshaw wheels There was nothing good about missus Reiver unless it was her dress She was bad from her hair which started life on a Brittany s girl s head to her boot heels which were two and three eighth inches high She was not honestly mischievous like missus Hauksbee she was wicked in a business like way There was never any scandal she had not generous impulses enough for that She was the exception which proved the rule that Anglo Indian ladies are in every way as nice as their sisters at Home She spent her life in proving that rule missus Hauksbee and she hated each other fervently They heard far too much to clash but the things they said of each other were startling not to say original missus Hauksbee was honest honest as her own front teeth and but for her love of mischief would have been a woman s woman There was no honesty about missus Reiver nothing but selfishness And at the beginning of the season poor little Pluffles fell a prey to her She laid herself out to that end and who was Pluffles to resist He went on trusting to his judgment and he got judged I have seen Hayes argue with a tough horse I have seen a tonga driver coerce a stubborn pony I have seen a riotous setter broken to gun by a hard keeper but the breaking in of Pluffles of the Unmentionables was beyond all these He learned to fetch and carry like a dog and to wait like one too for a word from missus Reiver He learned to keep appointments which missus Reiver had no intention of keeping He learned to take thankfully dances which missus Reiver had no intention of giving him He learned to shiver for an hour and a quarter on the windward side of Elysium while missus Reiver was making up her mind to come for a ride He learned to hunt for a rickshaw in a light dress suit under a pelting rain and to walk by the side of that rickshaw when he had found it He learned what it was to be spoken to like a coolie and ordered about like a cook He learned all this and many other things besides And he paid for his schooling Perhaps in some hazy way he fancied that it was fine and impressive that it gave him a status among men and was altogether the thing to do It was nobody s business to warn Pluffles that he was unwise The pace that season was too good to inquire and meddling with another man s folly is always thankless work Pluffles Colonel should have ordered him back to his regiment when he heard how things were going But Pluffles had got himself engaged to a girl in England the last time he went home and if there was one thing more than another which the Colonel detested it was a married subaltern He chuckled when he heard of the education of Pluffles and said it was good training for the boy But it was not good training in the least It led him into spending money beyond his means which were good above that the education spoilt an average boy and made it a tenth rate man of an objectionable kind He wandered into a bad set and his little bill at Hamilton s was a thing to wonder at Then missus Hauksbee rose to the occasion She played her game alone knowing what people would say of her and she played it for the sake of a girl she had never seen Pluffles fiancee was to come out under the chaperonage of an aunt in October to be married to Pluffles At the beginning of August missus Hauksbee discovered that it was time to interfere A man who rides much knows exactly what a horse is going to do next before he does it In the same way a woman of missus Hauksbee s experience knows accurately how a boy will behave under certain circumstances notably when he is infatuated with one of missus Reiver s stamp She said that sooner or later little Pluffles would break off that engagement for nothing at all simply to gratify missus Reiver who in return would keep him at her feet and in her service just so long as she found it worth her while She said she knew the signs of these things If she did not no one else could Then she went forth to capture Pluffles under the guns of the enemy just as missus Cusack Bremmil carried away Bremmil under missus Hauksbee s eyes This particular engagement lasted seven weeks we called it the Seven Weeks War and was fought out inch by inch on both sides A detailed account would fill a book and would be incomplete then Any one who knows about these things can fit in the details for himself It was a superb fight there will never be another like it as long as Jakko stands and Pluffles was the prize of victory People said shameful things about missus Hauksbee They did not know what she was playing for missus Reiver fought partly because Pluffles was useful to her but mainly because she hated missus Hauksbee and the matter was a trial of strength between them No one knows what Pluffles thought He had not many ideas at the best of times and the few he possessed made him conceited missus Hauksbee said The boy must be caught and the only way of catching him is by treating him well So she treated him as a man of the world and of experience so long as the issue was doubtful Little by little Pluffles fell away from his old allegiance and came over to the enemy by whom he was made much of He was never sent on out post duty after rickshaws any more nor was he given dances which never came off nor were the drains on his purse continued missus Hauksbee held him on the snaffle and after his treatment at missus Reiver s hands he appreciated the change missus Reiver had broken him of talking about himself and made him talk about her own merits missus Hauksbee acted otherwise and won his confidence till he mentioned his engagement to the girl at Home speaking of it in a high and mighty way as a piece of boyish folly This was when he was taking tea with her one afternoon and discoursing in what he considered a gay and fascinating style missus Hauksbee had seen an earlier generation of his stamp bud and blossom and decay into fat Captains and tubby Majors At a moderate estimate there were about three and twenty sides to that lady s character Some men say more She began to talk to Pluffles after the manner of a mother and as if there had been three hundred years instead of fifteen between them She spoke with a sort of throaty quaver in her voice which had a soothing effect though what she said was anything but soothing She pointed out the exceeding folly not to say meanness of Pluffles conduct and the smallness of his views Then he stammered something about trusting to his own judgment as a man of the world and this paved the way for what she wanted to say next It would have withered up Pluffles had it come from any other woman but in the soft cooing style in which missus Hauksbee put it it only made him feel limp and repentant as if he had been in some superior kind of church Little by little very softly and pleasantly she began taking the conceit out of Pluffles as you take the ribs out of an umbrella before re covering it She told him what she thought of him and his judgment and his knowledge of the world and how his performances had made him ridiculous to other people and how it was his intention make love to herself if she gave him the chance Then she said that marriage would be the making of him and drew a pretty little picture all rose and opal of the missus Pluffles of the future going through life relying on the judgment and knowledge of the world of a husband who had nothing to reproach himself with How she reconciled these two statements she alone knew But they did not strike Pluffles as conflicting Hers was a perfect little homily much better than any clergyman could have given and it ended with touching allusions to Pluffles Mamma and Papa and the wisdom of taking his bride Home Then she sent Pluffles out for a walk to think over what she had said Pluffles left blowing his nose very hard and holding himself very straight missus Hauksbee laughed What Pluffles had intended to do in the matter of the engagement only missus Reiver knew and she kept her own counsel to her death She would have liked it spoiled as a compliment I fancy Pluffles enjoyed many talks with missus Hauksbee during the next few days They were all to the same end and they helped Pluffles in the path of Virtue missus Hauksbee wanted to keep him under her wing to the last Therefore she discountenanced his going down to Bombay to get married Goodness only knows what might happen by the way she said Pluffles is cursed with the curse of Reuben and India is no fit place for him In the end the fiancee arrived with her aunt and Pluffles having reduced his affairs to some sort of order here again missus Hauksbee helped him was married missus Hauksbee gave a sigh of relief when both the I wills had been said and went her way Pluffies took her advice about going Home He left the Service and is now raising speckled cattle inside green painted fences somewhere at Home I believe he does this very judiciously He would have come to extreme grief out here For these reasons if any one says anything more than usually nasty about missus Hauksbee tell him the story of the Rescue of Pluffles CUPID S ARROWS Pit where the buffalo cooled his hide By the hot sun emptied and

girl the daughter of a poor but honest District and Sessions Judge She was a good girl but could not help knowing her power and using it Her Mamma was very anxious about her daughter s future as all good Mammas should be When a man is a Commissioner and a bachelor and has the right of wearing open work jam tart jewels in gold and enamel on his clothes and of going through a door before every one except a Member of Council a Lieutenant Governor or a Viceroy he is worth marrying At least that is what ladies say There was a Commissioner in Simla in those days who was and wore and did all I have said He was a plain man an ugly man the ugliest man in Asia with two exceptions His was a face to dream about and try to carve on a pipe head afterwards His name was Saggott Barr Saggott Anthony Barr Saggott and six letters to follow Departmentally he was one of the best men the Government of India owned Socially he was like a blandishing gorilla When he turned his attentions to Miss Beighton I believe that missus Beighton wept with delight at the reward Providence had sent her in her old age mister Beighton held his tongue He was an easy going man Now a Commissioner is very rich His pay is beyond the dreams of avarice is so enormous that he can afford to save and scrape in a way that would almost discredit a Member of Council Most Commissioners are mean but Barr Saggott was an exception He entertained royally he horsed himself well he gave dances he was a power in the land and he behaved as such Consider that everything I am writing of took place in an almost pre historic era in the history of British India Some folk may remember the years before lawn tennis was born when we all played croquet There were seasons before that if you will believe me when even croquet had not been invented and archery which was revived in England in eighteen forty four was as great a pest as lawn tennis is now People talked learnedly about holding and loosing steles reflexed bows fifty six pound bows backed or self yew bows as we talk about rallies volleys smashes returns and sixteen ounce rackets Miss Beighton shot divinely over ladies distance sixty yards that is and was acknowledged the best lady archer in Simla Men called her Diana of Tara Devi Barr Saggott paid her great attention and as I have said the heart of her mother was uplifted in consequence Kitty Beighton took matters more calmly It was pleasant to be singled out by a Commissioner with letters after his name and to fill the hearts of other girls with bad feelings But there was no denying the fact that Barr Saggott was phenomenally ugly and all his attempts to adorn himself only made him more grotesque He was not christened The Langur which means gray ape for nothing It was pleasant Kitty thought to have him at her feet but it was better to escape from him and ride with the graceless Cubbon the man in a Dragoon Regiment at Umballa the boy with a handsome face and no prospects Kitty liked Cubbon more than a little He never pretended for a moment the he was anything less than head over heels in love with her for he was an honest boy So Kitty fled now and again from the stately wooings of Barr Saggott to the company of young Cubbon and was scolded by her Mamma in consequence But Mother she said mister Saggot is such such a is so FEARFULLY ugly you know My dear said missus Beighton piously we cannot be other than an all ruling Providence has made us Besides you will take precedence of your own Mother you know Think of that and be reasonable Then Kitty put up her little chin and said irreverent things about precedence and Commissioners and matrimony mister Beighton rubbed the top of his head for he was an easy going man Late in the season when he judged that the time was ripe Barr Saggott developed a plan which did great credit to his administrative powers He arranged an archery tournament for ladies with a most sumptuous diamond studded bracelet as prize He drew up his terms skilfully and every one saw that the bracelet was a gift to Miss Beighton the acceptance carrying with it the hand and the heart of Commissioner Barr Saggott The terms were a saint Leonard s Round thirty six shots at sixty yards under the rules of the Simla Toxophilite Society All Simla was invited There were beautifully arranged tea tables under the deodars at Annandale where the Grand Stand is now and alone in its glory winking in the sun sat the diamond bracelet in a blue velvet case Miss Beighton was anxious almost too anxious to compete On the appointed afternoon all Simla rode down to Annandale to witness the Judgment of Paris turned upside down Kitty rode with young Cubbon and it was easy to see that the boy was troubled in his mind He must be held innocent of everything that followed Kitty was pale and nervous and looked long at the bracelet Barr Saggott was gorgeously dressed even more nervous than Kitty and more hideous than ever missus Beighton smiled condescendingly as befitted the mother of a potential Commissioneress and the shooting began all the world standing in a semicircle as the ladies came out one after the other Nothing is so tedious as an archery competition They shot and they shot and they kept on shooting till the sun left the valley and little breezes got up in the deodars and people waited for Miss Beighton to shoot and win Cubbon was at one horn of the semicircle round the shooters and Barr Saggott at the other Miss Beighton was last on the list The scoring had been weak and the bracelet PLUS Commissioner Barr Saggott was hers to a certainty The Commissioner strung her bow with his own sacred hands She stepped forward looked at the bracelet and her first arrow went true to a hair full into the heart of the gold counting nine points Young Cubbon on the left turned white and his Devil prompted Barr Saggott to smile Now horses used to shy when Barr Saggott smiled Kitty saw that smile She looked to her left front gave an almost imperceptible nod to Cubbon and went on shooting I wish I could describe the scene that followed It was out of the ordinary and most improper Miss Kitty fitted her arrows with immense deliberation so that every one might see what she was doing She was a perfect shot and her forty six pound bow suited her to a nicety She pinned the wooden legs of the target with great care four successive times She pinned the wooden top of the target once and all the ladies looked at each other Then she began some fancy shooting at the white which if you hit it counts exactly one point She put five arrows into the white It was wonderful archery but seeing that her business was to make golds and win the bracelet Barr Saggott turned a delicate green like young water grass Next she shot over the target twice then wide to the left twice always with the same deliberation while a chilly hush fell over the company and missus Beighton took out her handkerchief Then Kitty shot at the ground in front of the target and split several arrows Then she made a red or seven points just to show what she could do if she liked and finished up her amazing performance with some more fancy shooting at the target supports Here is her score as it was picked off Gold Red Blue Black White Total Hits Total Score Miss Beighton one one zero zero five seven twenty one Barr Saggott looked as if the last few arrowheads had been driven into his legs instead of the target s and the deep stillness was broken by a little snubby mottled half grown girl saying in a shrill voice of triumph Then I VE won missus Beighton did her best to bear up but she wept in the presence of the people No training could help her through such a disappointment Kitty unstrung her bow with a vicious jerk and went back to her place while Barr Saggott was trying to pretend that he enjoyed snapping the bracelet on the snubby girl s raw red wrist It was an awkward scene most awkward Every one tried to depart in a body and leave Kitty to the mercy of her Mamma But Cubbon took her away instead and the rest isn t worth printing HIS CHANCE IN LIFE Then a pile of heads be laid Thirty thousand heaped on high All to please the Kafir maid

none	none	 in seven cases out of nine there is a woman at the back of the virtue The two exceptions must have suffered from sunstroke WATCHES OF THE NIGHT What is in the Brahmin s books that is in the Brahmin s heart Neither you nor I knew there was so much evil in the world Hindu Proverb This began in a practical joke but it has gone far enough now and is getting serious Platte the Subaltern being poor had a Waterbury watch and a plain leather guard The Colonel had a Waterbury watch also and for guard the lip strap of a curb chain Lip straps make the best watch guards They are strong and short Between a lip strap and an ordinary leather guard there is no great difference between one Waterbury watch and another there is none at all Every one in the station knew the Colonel s lip strap He was not a horsey man but he liked people to believe he had been on once and he wove fantastic stories of the hunting bridle to which this particular lip strap had belonged Otherwise he was painfully religious Platte and the Colonel were dressing at the Club both late for their engagements and both in a hurry That was Kismet The two watches were on a shelf below the looking glass guards hanging down That was carelessness Platte changed first snatched a watch looked in the glass settled his tie and ran Forty seconds later the Colonel did exactly the same thing each man taking the other s watch You may have noticed that many religious people are deeply suspicious They seem for purely religious purposes of course to know more about iniquity than the Unregenerate Perhaps they were specially bad before they became converted At any rate in the imputation of things evil and in putting the worst construction on things innocent a certain type of good people may be trusted to surpass all others The Colonel and his Wife were of that type But the Colonel s Wife was the worst She manufactured the Station scandal and TALKED TO HER AYAH Nothing more need be said The Colonel s Wife broke up the Laplace s home The Colonel s Wife stopped the Ferris Haughtrey engagement The Colonel s Wife induced young Buxton to keep his wife down in the Plains through the first year of the marriage Whereby little missus Buxton died and the baby with her These things will be remembered against the Colonel s Wife so long as there is a regiment in the country But to come back to the Colonel and Platte They went their several ways from the dressing room The Colonel dined with two Chaplains while Platte went to a bachelor party and whist to follow Mark how things happen If Platte s sais had put the new saddle pad on the mare the butts of the territs would not have worked through the worn leather and the old pad into the mare s withers when she was coming home at two o clock in the morning She would not have reared bolted fallen into a ditch upset the cart and sent Platte flying over an aloe hedge on to missus Larkyn s well kept lawn and this tale would never have been written But the mare did all these things and while Platte was rolling over and over on the turf like a shot rabbit the watch and guard flew from his waistcoat as an Infantry Major s sword hops out of the scabbard when they are firing a feu de joie and rolled and rolled in the moonlight till it stopped under a window Platte stuffed his handkerchief under the pad put the cart straight and went home Mark again how Kismet works This would not happen once in a hundred years Towards the end of his dinner with the two Chaplains the Colonel let out his waistcoat and leaned over the table to look at some Mission Reports The bar of the watch guard worked through the buttonhole and the watch Platte s watch slid quietly on to the carpet Where the bearer found it next morning and kept it Then the Colonel went home to the wife of his bosom but the driver of the carriage was drunk and lost his way So the Colonel returned at an unseemly hour and his excuses were not accepted If the Colonel s Wife had been an ordinary vessel of wrath appointed for destruction she would have known that when a man stays away on purpose his excuse is always sound and original The very baldness of the Colonel s explanation proved its truth See once more the workings of Kismet The Colonel s watch which came with Platte hurriedly on to missus Larkyn s lawn chose to stop just under missus Larkyn s window where she saw it early in the morning recognized it and picked it up She had heard the crash of Platte s cart at two o clock that morning and his voice calling the mare names She knew Platte and liked him That day she showed him the watch and heard his story He put his head on one side winked and said How disgusting Shocking old man with his religious training too I should send the watch to the Colonel s Wife and ask for explanations missus Larkyn thought for a minute of the Laplaces whom she had known when Laplace and his wife believed in each other and answered I will send it I think it will do her good But remember we must NEVER tell her the truth Platte guessed that his own watch was in the Colonel s possession and thought that the return of the lip strapped Waterbury with a soothing note from missus Larkyn would merely create a small trouble for a few minutes missus Larkyn knew better She knew that any poison dropped would find good holding ground in the heart of the Colonel s Wife The packet and a note containing a few remarks on the Colonel s calling hours were sent over to the Colonel s Wife who wept in her own room and took counsel with herself If there was one woman under Heaven whom the Colonel s Wife hated with holy fervor it was missus Larkyn missus Larkyn was a frivolous lady and called the Colonel s Wife old cat The Colonel s Wife said that somebody in Revelations was remarkably like missus Larkyn She mentioned other Scripture people as well From the Old Testament But the Colonel s Wife was the only person who cared or dared to say anything against missus Larkyn Every one else accepted her as an amusing honest little body Wherefore to believe that her husband had been shedding watches under that Thing s window at ungodly hours coupled with the fact of his late arrival on the previous night was At this point she rose up and sought her husband He denied everything except the ownership of the watch She besought him for his Soul s sake to speak the truth He denied afresh with two bad words Then a stony silence held the Colonel s Wife while a man could draw his breath five times The speech that followed is no affair of mine or yours It was made up of wifely and womanly jealousy knowledge of old age and sunken cheeks deep mistrust born of the text that says even little babies hearts are as bad as they make them rancorous hatred of missus Larkyn and the tenets of the creed of the Colonel s Wife s upbringing Over and above all was the damning lip strapped Waterbury ticking away in the palm of her shaking withered hand At that hour I think the Colonel s Wife realized a little of the restless suspicions she had injected into old Laplace s mind a little of poor Miss Haughtrey s misery and some of the canker that ate into Buxton s heart as he watched his wife dying before his eyes The Colonel stammered and tried to explain Then he remembered that his watch had disappeared and the mystery grew greater The Colonel s Wife talked and prayed by turns till she was tired and went away to devise means for chastening the stubborn heart of her husband Which translated means in our slang tail twisting You see being deeply impressed with the doctrine of Original Sin she could not believe in the face of appearances She knew too much and jumped to the wildest conclusions But it was good for her It spoilt her life as she had spoilt the life of the Laplaces She had lost her faith in the Colonel and here the creed suspicion came in he might she argued have erred many times before a merciful Providence at the hands of so unworthy an instrument as missus Larkyn had established his guilt He was a bad wicked gray haired profligate This may sound too sudden a revulsion for a long wedded wife but it is a venerable fact that if a man or woman makes a practice of and takes a delight in believing and spreading evil of people indifferent to him or her he or she will end in believing evil of folk very near and dear You may think also that the mere incident of the watch was too small and trivial to raise this misunderstanding It is another aged fact that in life as well as racing all the worst accidents happen at little ditches and cut down fences In the same way you sometimes see a woman who would have made a Joan of Arc in another century and climate threshing herself to pieces over all the mean worry of housekeeping But that is another story Her belief only made the Colonel s Wife more wretched because it insisted so strongly on the villainy of men Remembering what she had done it was pleasant to watch her unhappiness and the penny farthing attempts she made to hide it from the Station But the Station knew and laughed heartlessly for they had heard the story of the watch with much dramatic gesture from missus Larkyn s lips Once or twice Platte said to missus Larkyn seeing that the Colonel had not cleared himself This thing has gone far enough I move we tell the Colonel s Wife how it happened missus Larkyn shut her lips and shook her head and vowed that the Colonel s Wife must bear her punishment as best she could Now missus Larkyn was a frivolous woman in whom none would have suspected deep hate So Platte took no action and came to believe gradually from the Colonel s silence that the Colonel must have run off the line somewhere that night and therefore preferred to stand sentence on the lesser count of rambling into other people s compounds out of calling hours Platte forgot about the watch business after a while and moved down country with his regiment missus Larkyn went home when her husband s tour of Indian service expired She never forgot But Platte was quite right when he said that the joke had gone too far The mistrust and the tragedy of it which we outsiders cannot see and do not believe in are killing the Colonel s Wife and are making the Colonel wretched If either of them read this story they can depend upon its being a fairly true account of the case and can kiss and make friends Shakespeare alludes to the pleasure of watching an Engineer being shelled by his own Battery Now this shows that poets should not write about what they do not understand Any one could have told him that Sappers and Gunners are perfectly different branches of the Service But if you correct the sentence and substitute Gunner for Sapper the moral comes just the same THE OTHER MAN When the earth was sick and the skies were gray And the woods were rotted with rain The Dead Man rode through the autumn day To visit his love again Old Ballad Far back in the seventies before they had built any Public Offices at Simla and the broad road round Jakko lived in a pigeon hole in the P W D hovels her parents made Miss Gaurey marry Colonel Schriederling He could not have been MUCH more than thirty five years her senior and as he lived on two hundred rupees a month and had money of his own he was well off He belonged to good people and suffered in the cold weather from lung complaints In the hot weather he dangled on the brink of heat apoplexy but it never quite killed him Understand I do not blame Schriederling He was a good husband according to his lights and his temper only failed him when he was being nursed Which was some seventeen days in each month He was almost generous to his wife about money matters and that for him was a concession Still missus Schreiderling was not happy They married her when she was this side of twenty and had given all her poor little heart to another man I have forgotten his name but we will call him the Other Man He had no money and no prospects He was not even good looking and I think he was in the Commissariat or Transport But in spite of all these things she loved him very madly and there was some sort of an engagement between the two when Schreiderling appeared and told missus Gaurey that he wished to marry her daughter Then the other engagement was broken off washed away by missus Gaurey s tears for that lady governed her house by weeping over disobedience to her authority and the lack of reverence she received in her old age The daughter did not take after her mother She never cried Not even at the wedding The Other Man bore his loss quietly and was transferred to as bad a station as he could find Perhaps the climate consoled him He suffered from intermittent fever and that may have distracted him from his other trouble He was weak about the heart also Both ways One of the valves was affected and the fever made it worse This showed itself later on Then many months passed and missus Schreiderling took to being ill She did not pine away like people in story books but she seemed to pick up every form of illness that went about a station from simple fever upwards She was never more than ordinarily pretty at the best of times and the illness made her ugly Schreiderling said so He prided himself on speaking his mind When she ceased being pretty he left her to her own devices and went back to the lairs of his bachelordom She used to trot up and down Simla Mall in a forlorn sort of way with a gray Terai hat well on the back of her head and a shocking bad saddle under her Schreiderling s generosity stopped at the horse He said that any saddle would do for a woman as nervous as missus Schreiderling She never was asked to dance because she did not dance well and she was so dull and uninteresting that her box very seldom had any cards in it Schreiderling said that if he had known that she was going to be such a scare crow after her marriage he would never have married her He always prided himself on speaking his mind did Schreiderling He left her at Simla one August and went down to his regiment Then she revived a little but she never recovered her looks I found out at the Club that the Other Man is coming up sick very sick on an off chance of recovery The fever and the heart valves had nearly killed him She knew that too and she knew what I had no interest in knowing when he was coming up I suppose he wrote to tell her They had not seen each other since a month before the wedding And here comes the unpleasant part of the story A late call kept me down at the Dovedell Hotel till dusk one evening missus Schreidlerling had been flitting up and down the Mall all the afternoon in the rain Coming up along the Cart road a tonga passed me and my pony tired with standing so long set off at a canter Just by the road down to the Tonga Office missus Schreiderling dripping from head to foot was waiting for the tonga I turned up hill as the tonga was no affair of mine and just then she began to shriek I went back at once and saw under the Tonga Office lamps missus Schreiderling kneeling in the wet road by the back seat of the newly arrived tonga screaming hideously Then she fell face down in the dirt as I came up Sitting in the back seat very square and firm with one hand on the awning stanchion and the wet pouring off his hat and moustache was the Other Man dead The sixty mile up hill jolt had been too much for his valve I suppose The tonga driver said The Sahib died two stages out of Solon Therefore I tied him with a rope lest he should fall out by the way and so came to Simla Will the Sahib give me bukshish IT pointing to the Other Man should have given one rupee The Other Man sat with a grin on his face as if he enjoyed the joke of his arrival and missus Schreiderling in the mud began to groan There was no one except us four in the office and it was raining heavily The first thing was to take missus Schreiderling home and the second was to prevent her name from being mixed up with the affair The tonga driver received five rupees to find a bazar rickshaw for missus Schreiderling He was to tell the tonga Babu afterwards of the Other Man and the Babu was to make such arrangements as seemed best missus Schreiderling was carried into the shed out of the rain and for three quarters of an hour we two waited for the rickshaw The Other Man was left exactly as he had arrived missus Schreiderling would do everything but cry which might have helped her She tried to scream as soon as her senses came back and then she began praying for the Other Man s soul Had she not been as honest as the day she would have prayed for her own soul too I waited to hear her do this but she did not Then I tried to get some of the mud off her habit Lastly the rickshaw came and I got her away partly by force It was a terrible business from beginning to end but most of all when the rickshaw had to squeeze between the wall and the tonga and she saw by the lamp light that thin yellow hand grasping the awning stanchion She was taken home just as every one was going to a dance at Viceregal Lodge Peterhoff it was then and the doctor found that she had fallen from her horse that I had picked her up at the back of Jakko and really deserved great credit for the prompt manner in which I had secured medical aid She did not die men of Schreiderling s stamp marry women who don t die easily They live and grow ugly She never told of her one meeting since her marriage with the Other Man and when the chill and cough following the exposure of that evening allowed her abroad she never by word or sign alluded to having met me by the Tonga Office Perhaps she never knew She used to trot up and down the Mall on that shocking bad saddle looking as if she expected to meet some one round the corner every minute Two years afterward she went Home and died at Bournemouth I think Schreiderling when he grew maudlin at Mess used to talk about my poor dear wife He always set great store on speaking his mind did Schreiderling CONSEQUENCES Rosicrucian subtleties In the Orient had rise Ye may find their teachers still Under Jacatala s Hill Seek ye Bombast Paracelsus Read what Flood the Seeker tells us Of the Dominant that runs Through the cycles of the Suns Read my story last and see Luna at her apogee There are yearly appointments and two yearly appointments and five yearly appointments at Simla and there are or used to be permanent appointments whereon you stayed up for the term of your natural life and secured red cheeks and a nice income Of course you could descend in the cold weather for Simla is rather dull then Tarrion came from goodness knows where all away and away in some forsaken part of Central India where they call Pachmari a Sanitarium and drive behind trotting bullocks I believe He belonged to a regiment but what he really wanted to do was to escape from his regiment and live in Simla forever and ever He had no preference for anything in particular beyond a good horse and a nice partner He thought he could do everything well which is a beautiful belief when you hold it with all your heart He was clever in many ways and good to look at and always made people round him comfortable even in Central India So he went up to Simla and because he was clever and amusing he gravitated naturally to missus Hauksbee who could forgive everything but stupidity Once he did her great service by changing the date on an invitation card for a big dance which missus Hauksbee wished to attend but couldn t because she had quarrelled with the A D C who took care being a mean man to invite her to a small dance on the sixth instead of the big Ball of the twenty sixth It was a very clever piece of forgery and when missus Hauksbee showed the A D C her invitation card and chaffed him mildly for not better managing his vendettas he really thought he had made a mistake and which was wise realized that it was no use to fight with missus Hauksbee She was grateful to Tarrion and asked what she could do for him He said simply I m a Freelance up here on leave and on the lookout for what I can loot I haven t a square inch of interest in all Simla My name isn t known to any man with an appointment in his gift and I want an appointment a good sound pukka one I believe you can do anything you turn yourself to do Will you help me missus Hauksbee thought for a minute and passed the last of her riding whip through her lips as was her custom when thinking Then her eyes sparkled and she said I will and she shook hands on it Tarrion having perfect confidence in this great woman took no further thought of the business at all Except to wonder what sort of an appointment he would win missus Hauksbee began calculating the prices of all the Heads of Departments and Members of Council she knew and the more she thought the more she laughed because her heart was in the game and it amused her Then she took a Civil List and ran over a few of the appointments There are some beautiful appointments in the Civil List Eventually she decided that though Tarrion was too good for the Political Department she had better begin by trying to get him in there What were her own plans to this end does not matter in the least for Luck or Fate played into her hands and she had nothing to do but to watch the course of events and take the credit of them All Viceroys when they first come out pass through the Diplomatic Secrecy craze It wears off in time but they all catch it in the beginning because they are new to the country The particular Viceroy who was suffering from the complaint just then this was a long time ago before Lord Dufferin ever came from Canada or Lord Ripon from the bosom of the English Church had it very badly and the result was that men who were new to keeping official secrets went about looking unhappy and the Viceroy plumed himself on the way in which he had instilled notions of reticence into his Staff Now the Supreme Government have a careless custom of committing what they do to printed papers These papers deal with all sorts of things from the payment of Rs two hundred to a secret service native up to rebukes administered to Vakils and Motamids of Native States and rather brusque letters to Native Princes telling them to put their houses in order to refrain from kidnapping women or filling offenders with pounded red pepper and eccentricities of that kind Of course these things could never be made public because Native Princes never err officially and their States are officially as well administered as Our territories Also the private allowances to various queer people are not exactly matters to put into newspapers though they give quaint reading sometimes When the Supreme Government is at Simla these papers are prepared there and go round to the people who ought to see them in office boxes or by post The principle of secrecy was to that Viceroy quite as important as the practice and he held that a benevolent despotism like Ours should never allow even little things such as appointments of subordinate clerks to leak out till the proper time He was always remarkable for his principles There was a very important batch of papers in preparation at that time It had to travel from one end of Simla to the other by hand It was not put into an official envelope but a large square pale pink one the matter being in MS on soft crinkley paper It was addressed to The Head Clerk et cetera et cetera Now between The Head Clerk et cetera et cetera and missus Hauksbee and a flourish is no very great difference if the address be written in a very bad hand as this was The chaprassi who took the envelope was not more of an idiot than most chaprassis He merely forgot where this most unofficial cover was to be delivered and so asked the first Englishman he met who happened to be a man riding down to Annandale in a great hurry The Englishman hardly looked said Hauksbee Sahib ki Mem and went on So did the chaprasss because that letter was the last in stock and he wanted to get his work over There was no book to sign he thrust the letter into missus Hauksbee s bearer s hands and went off to smoke with a friend missus Hauksbee was expecting some cut out pattern things in flimsy paper from a friend As soon as she got the big square packet therefore she said Oh the DEAR creature and tore it open with a paper knife and all the MS enclosures tumbled out on the floor missus Hauksbee began reading I have said the batch was rather important That is quite enough for you to know It referred to some correspondence two measures a peremptory order to a native chief and two dozen other things missus Hauksbee gasped as she read for the first glimpse of the naked machinery of the Great Indian Government stripped of its casings and lacquer and paint and guard rails impresses even the most stupid man And missus Hauksbee was a clever woman She was a little afraid at first and felt as if she had laid hold of a lightning flash by the tail and did not quite know what to do with it There were remarks and initials at the side of the papers and some of the remarks were rather more severe than the papers The initials belonged to men who are all dead or gone now but they were great in their day missus Hauksbee read on and thought calmly as she read Then the value of her trove struck her and she cast about for the best method of using it Then Tarrion dropped in and they read through all the papers together and Tarrion not knowing how she had come by them vowed that missus Hauksbee was the greatest woman on earth Which I believe was true or nearly so The honest course is always the best said Tarrion after an hour and a half of study and conversation All things considered the Intelligence Branch is about my form Either that or the Foreign Office I go to lay siege to the High Gods in their Temples He did not seek a little man or a little big man or a weak Head of a strong Department but he called on the biggest and strongest man that the Government owned and explained that he wanted an appointment at Simla on a good salary The compound insolence of this amused the Strong Man and as he had nothing to do for the moment he listened to the proposals of the audacious Tarrion You have I presume some special qualifications besides the gift of self assertion for the claims you put forwards said the Strong Man That Sir said Tarrion is for you to judge Then he began for he had a good memory quoting a few of the more important notes in the papers slowly and one by one as a man drops chlorodyne into a glass When he had reached the peremptory order and it WAS a peremptory order the Strong Man was troubled Tarrion wound up And I fancy that special knowledge of this kind is at least as valuable for let us say a berth in the Foreign Office as the fact of being the nephew of a distinguished officer s wife That hit the Strong Man hard for the last appointment to the Foreign Office had been by black favor and he knew it I ll see what I can do for you said the Strong Man Many thanks said Tarrion Then he left and the Strong Man departed to see how the appointment was to be blocked Followed a pause of eleven days with thunders and lightnings and much telegraphing The appointment was not a very important one carrying only between Rs five hundred and Rs seven hundred a month but as the Viceroy said it was the principle of diplomatic secrecy that had to be maintained and it was more than likely that a boy so well supplied with special information would be worth translating So they translated him They must have suspected him though he protested that his information was due to singular talents of his own Now much of this story including the after history of the missing envelope you must fill in for yourself because there are reasons why it cannot be written If you do not know about things Up Above you won t understand how to fill it in and you will say it is impossible What the Viceroy said when Tarrion was introduced to him was So this is the boy who rusked the Government of India is it Recollect Sir that is not done TWICE So he must have known something What Tarrion said when he saw his appointment gazetted was If missus Hauksbee were twenty years younger and I her husband I should be Viceroy of India in twenty years What missus Hauksbee said when Tarrion thanked her almost with tears in his eyes was first I told you so and next to herself What fools men are THE CONVERSION OF AURELIAN McGOGGIN Ride with an idle whip ride with an unused heel But once in a way there will come a day When the colt must be taught to feel The lash that falls and the curb that galls and the sting of the rowelled steel Life s Handicap This is not a tale exactly It is a Tract and I am immensely proud of it Making a Tract is a Feat Every man is entitled to his own religious opinions but no man least of all a junior has a right to thrust these down other men s throats The Government sends out weird Civilians now and again but McGoggin was the queerest exported for a long time He was clever brilliantly clever but his cleverness worked the wrong way Instead of keeping to the study of the vernaculars he had read some books written by a man called Comte I think and a man called Spencer and a Professor Clifford You will find these books in the Library They deal with people s insides from the point of view of men who have no stomachs There was no order against his reading them but his Mamma should have smacked him They fermented in his head and he came out to India with a rarefied religion over and above his work It was not much of a creed It only proved that men had no souls and there was no God and no hereafter and that you must worry along somehow for the good of Humanity One of its minor tenets seemed to be that the one thing more sinful than giving an order was obeying it At least that was what McGoggin said but I suspect he had misread his primers I do not say a word against this creed It was made up in Town where there is nothing but machinery and asphalt and building all shut in by the fog Naturally a man grows to think that there is no one higher than himself and that the Metropolitan Board of Works made everything But in this country where you really see humanity raw brown naked humanity with nothing between it and the blazing sky and only the used up over handled earth underfoot the notion somehow dies away and most folk come back to simpler theories Life in India is not long enough to waste in proving that there is no one in particular at the head of affairs For this reason The Deputy is above the Assistant the Commissioner above the Deputy the Lieutenant Governor above the Commissioner and the Viceroy above all four under the orders of the Secretary of State who is responsible to the Empress If the Empress be not responsible to her Maker if there is no Maker for her to be responsible to the entire system of Our administration must be wrong Which is manifestly impossible At Home men are to be excused They are stalled up a good deal and get intellectually beany When you take a gross beany horse to exercise he slavers and slobbers over the bit till you can t see the horns But the bit is there just the same Men do not get beany in India The climate and the work are against playing bricks with words If McGoggin had kept his creed with the capital letters and the endings in isms to himself no one would have cared but his grandfathers on both sides had been Wesleyan preachers and the preaching strain came out in his mind He wanted every one at the Club to see that they had no souls too and to help him to eliminate his Creator As a good many men told him HE undoubtedly had no soul because he was so young but it did not follow that his seniors were equally undeveloped and whether there was another world or not a man still wanted to read his papers in this But that is not the point that is not the point Aurelian used to say Then men threw sofa cushions at him and told him to go to any particular place he might believe in They christened him the Blastoderm he said he came from a family of that name somewhere in the pre historic ages and by insult and laughter strove to choke him dumb for he was an unmitigated nuisance at the Club besides being an offence to the older men His Deputy Commissioner who was working on the Frontier when Aurelian was rolling on a bed quilt told him that for a clever boy Aurelian was a very big idiot And you know if he had gone on with his work he would have been caught up to the Secretariat in a few years He was just the type that goes there all head no physique and a hundred theories Not a soul was interested in McGoggin s soul He might have had two or none or somebody s else s His business was to obey orders and keep abreast of his files instead of devastating the Club with isms He worked brilliantly but he could not accept any order without trying to better it That was the fault of his creed It made men too responsible and left too much to their honor You can sometimes ride an old horse in a halter but never a colt McGoggin took more trouble over his cases than any of the men of his year He may have fancied that thirty page judgments on fifty rupee cases both sides perjured to the gullet advanced the cause of Humanity At any rate he worked too much and worried and fretted over the rebukes he received and lectured away on his ridiculous creed out of office till the Doctor had to warn him that he was overdoing it No man can toil eighteen annas in the rupee in June without suffering But McGoggin was still intellectually beany and proud of himself and his powers and he would take no hint He worked nine hours a day steadily Very well said the doctor you ll break down because you are over engined for your beam McGoggin was a little chap One day the collapse came as dramatically as if it had been meant to embellish a Tract It was just before the Rains We were sitting in the verandah in the dead hot close air gasping and praying that the black blue clouds would let down and bring the cool Very very far away there was a faint whisper which was the roar of the Rains breaking over the river One of the men heard it got out of his chair listened and said naturally enough Thank God Then the Blastoderm turned in his place and said Why I assure you it s only the result of perfectly natural causes atmospheric phenomena of the simplest kind Why you should therefore return thanks to a Being who never did exist who is only a figment Blastoderm grunted the man in the next chair dry up and throw me over the Pioneer We know all about your figments The Blastoderm reached out to the table took up one paper and jumped as if something had stung him Then he handed the paper over As I was saying he went on slowly and with an effort due to perfectly natural causes perfectly natural causes I mean Hi Blastoderm you ve given me the Calcutta Mercantile Advertiser The dust got up in little whorls while the treetops rocked and the kites whistled But no one was looking at the coming of the Rains We were all staring at the Blastoderm who had risen from his chair and was fighting with his speech Then he said still more slowly Perfectly conceivable dictionary red oak amenable cause retaining shuttlecock alone Blastoderm s drunk said one man But the Blastoderm was not drunk He looked at us in a dazed sort of way and began motioning with his hands in the half light as the clouds closed overhead Then with a scream What is it Can t reserve attainable market obscure But his speech seemed to freeze in him and just as the lightning shot two tongues that cut the whole sky into three pieces and the rain fell in quivering sheets the Blastoderm was struck dumb He stood pawing and champing like a hard held horse and his eyes were full of terror The Doctor came over in three minutes and heard the story It s aphasia he said Take him to his room I KNEW the smash would come We carried the Blastoderm across in the pouring rain to his quarters and the Doctor gave him bromide of potassium to make him sleep Then the Doctor came back to us and told us that aphasia was like all the arrears of Punjab Head falling in a lump and that only once before in the case of a sepoy had he met with so complete a case I myself have seen mild aphasia in an overworked man but this sudden dumbness was uncanny though as the Blastoderm himself might have said due to perfectly natural causes He ll have to take leave after this said the Doctor He won t be fit for work for another three months No it isn t insanity or anything like it It s only complete loss of control over the speech and memory I fancy it will keep the Blastoderm quiet though Two days later the Blastoderm found his tongue again The first question he asked was What was it The Doctor enlightened him But I can t understand it said the Blastoderm I m quite sane but I can t be sure of my mind it seems my OWN memory can I Go up into the Hills for three months and don t think about it said the Doctor But I can t understand it repeated the Blastoderm It was my OWN mind and memory I can t help it said the Doctor there are a good many things you can t understand and by the time you have put in my length of service you ll know exactly how much a man dare call his own in this world The stroke cowed the Blastoderm He could not understand it He went into the Hills in fear and trembling wondering whether he would be permitted to reach the end of any sentence he began This gave him a wholesome feeling of mistrust The legitimate explanation that he had been overworking himself failed to satisfy him Something had wiped his lips of speech as a mother wipes the milky lips of her child and he was afraid horribly afraid So the Club had rest when he returned and if ever you come across Aurelian McGoggin laying down the law on things Human he doesn t seem to know as much as he used to about things Divine put your forefinger on your lip for a moment and see what happens Don t blame me if he throws a glass at your head A GERM DESTROYER Pleasant it is for the Little Tin Gods When great Jove nods But Little Tin Gods make their little mistakes In missing the hour when great Jove wakes As a general rule it is inexpedient to meddle with questions of State in a land where men are highly paid to work them out for you This tale is a justifiable exception Once in every five years as you know we indent for a new Viceroy and each Viceroy imports with the rest of his baggage a Private Secretary who may or may not be the real Viceroy just as Fate ordains Fate looks after the Indian Empire because it is so big and so helpless There was a Viceroy once who brought out with him a turbulent Private Secretary a hard man with a soft manner and a morbid passion for work This Secretary was called Wonder John Fennil Wonder The Viceroy possessed no name nothing but a string of counties and two thirds of the alphabet after them He said in confidence that he was the electro plated figurehead of a golden administration and he watched in a dreamy amused way Wonder s attempts to draw matters which were entirely outside his province into his own hands When we are all cherubims together said His Excellency once my dear good friend Wonder will head the conspiracy for plucking out Gabriel s tail feathers or stealing Peter s keys THEN I shall report him But though the Viceroy did nothing to check Wonder s officiousness other people said unpleasant things Maybe the Members of Council began it but finally all Simla agreed that there was too much Wonder and too little Viceroy in that regime Wonder was always quoting His Excellency It was His Excellency this His Excellency that In the opinion of His Excellency and so on The Viceroy smiled but he did not heed He said that so long as his old men squabbled with his dear good Wonder they might be induced to leave the Immemorial East in peace No wise man has a policy said the Viceroy A Policy is the blackmail levied on the Fool by the Unforeseen I am not the former and I do not believe in the latter I do not quite see what this means unless it refers to an Insurance Policy Perhaps it was the Viceroy s way of saying Lie low That season came up to Simla one of these crazy people with only a single idea These are the men who make things move but they are not nice to talk to This man s name was Mellish and he had lived for fifteen years on land of his own in Lower Bengal studying cholera He held that cholera was a germ that propagated itself as it flew through a muggy atmosphere and stuck in the branches of trees like a wool flake The germ could be rendered sterile he said by Mellish s Own Invincible Fumigatory a heavy violet black powder the result of fifteen years scientific investigation Sir Inventors seem very much alike as a caste They talk loudly especially about conspiracies of monopolists they beat upon the table with their fists and they secrete fragments of their inventions about their persons Mellish said that there was a Medical Ring at Simla headed by the Surgeon General who was in league apparently with all the Hospital Assistants in the Empire I forget exactly how he proved it but it had something to do with skulking up to the Hills and what Mellish wanted was the independent evidence of the Viceroy Steward of our Most Gracious Majesty the Queen Sir So Mellish went up to Simla with eighty four pounds of Fumigatory in his trunk to speak to the Viceroy and to show him the merits of the invention But it is easier to see a Viceroy than to talk to him unless you chance to be as important as Mellishe of Madras He was a six thousand rupee man so great that his daughters never married They contracted alliances He himself was not paid He received emoluments and his journeys about the country were tours of observation His business was to stir up the people in Madras with a long pole as you stir up stench in a pond and the people had to come up out of their comfortable old ways and gasp This is Enlightenment and progress Isn t it fine Then they gave Mellishe statues and jasmine garlands in the hope of getting rid of him Mellishe came up to Simla to confer with the Viceroy That was one of his perquisites The Viceroy knew nothing of Mellishe except that he was one of those middle class deities who seem necessary to the spiritual comfort of this Paradise of the Middle classes and that in all probability he had suggested designed founded and endowed all the public institutions in Madras Which proves that His Excellency though dreamy had experience of the ways of six thousand rupee men Mellishe s name was E Mellishe and Mellish s was E S Mellish and they were both staying at the same hotel and the Fate that looks after the Indian Empire ordained that Wonder should blunder and drop the final e that the Chaprassi should help him and that the note which ran Dear mister Mellish Can you set aside your other engagements and lunch with us at two to morrow His Excellency has an hour at your disposal then should be given to Mellish with the Fumigatory He nearly wept with pride and delight and at the appointed hour cantered off to Peterhoff a big paper bag full of the Fumigatory in his coat tail pockets He had his chance and he meant to make the most of it Mellishe of Madras had been so portentously solemn about his conference that Wonder had arranged for a private tiffin no A D C s no Wonder no one but the Viceroy who said plaintively that he feared being left alone with unmuzzled autocrats like the great Mellishe of Madras But his guest did not bore the Viceroy On the contrary he amused him Mellish was nervously anxious to go straight to his Fumigatory and talked at random until tiffin was over and His Excellency asked him to smoke The Viceroy was pleased with Mellish because he did not talk shop As soon as the cheroots were lit Mellish spoke like a man beginning with his cholera theory reviewing his fifteen years scientific labors the machinations of the Simla Ring and the excellence of his Fumigatory while the Viceroy watched him between half shut eyes and thought Evidently this is the wrong tiger but it is an original animal Mellish s hair was standing on end with excitement and he stammered He began groping in his coat tails and before the Viceroy knew what was about to happen he had tipped a bagful of his powder into the big silver ash tray J j judge for yourself Sir said Mellish Y Excellency shall judge for yourself Absolutely infallible on my honor He plunged the lighted end of his cigar into the powder which began to smoke like a volcano and send up fat greasy wreaths of copper colored smoke In five seconds the room was filled with a most pungent and sickening stench a reek that took fierce hold of the trap of your windpipe and shut it The powder then hissed and fizzed and sent out blue and green sparks and the smoke rose till you could neither see nor breathe nor gasp Mellish however was used to it Nitrate of strontia he shouted baryta bone meal etcetera Thousand cubic feet smoke per cubic inch Not a germ could live not a germ Y Excellency But His Excellency had fled and was coughing at the foot of the stairs while all Peterhoff hummed like a hive Red Lancers came in and the Head Chaprassi who speaks English came in and mace bearers came in and ladies ran downstairs screaming fire for the smoke was drifting through the house and oozing out of the windows and bellying along the verandahs and wreathing and writhing across the gardens No one could enter the room where Mellish was lecturing on his Fumigatory till that unspeakable powder had burned itself out Then an Aide de Camp who desired the V C rushed through the rolling clouds and hauled Mellish into the hall The Viceroy was prostrate with laughter and could only waggle his hands feebly at Mellish who was shaking a fresh bagful of powder at him Glorious Glorious sobbed his Excellency Not a germ as you justly observe could exist I can swear it A magnificent success Then he laughed till the tears came and Wonder who had caught the real Mellishe snorting on the Mall entered and was deeply shocked at the scene But the Viceroy was delighted because he saw that Wonder would presently depart Mellish with the Fumigatory was also pleased for he felt that he had smashed the Simla Medical Ring Few men could tell a story like His Excellency when he took the trouble and the account of my dear good Wonder s friend with the powder went the round of Simla and flippant folk made Wonder unhappy by their remarks But His Excellency told the tale once too often for Wonder As he meant to do It was at a Seepee Picnic Wonder was sitting just behind the Viceroy And I really thought for a moment wound up His Excellency that my dear good Wonder had hired an assassin to clear his way to the throne Every one laughed but there was a delicate subtinkle in the Viceroy s tone which Wonder understood He found that his health was giving way and the Viceroy allowed him to go and presented him with a flaming character for use at Home among big people My fault entirely said His Excellency in after seasons with a twinkling in his eye My inconsistency must always have been distasteful to such a masterly man KIDNAPPED There is a tide in the affairs of men Which taken any way you please is bad And strands them in forsaken guts and creeks No decent soul would think of visiting You cannot stop the tide but now and then You may arrest some rash adventurer Who h m will hardly thank you for your pains Vibart s Moralities We are a high caste and enlightened race and infant marriage is very shocking and the consequences are sometimes peculiar but nevertheless the Hindu notion which is the Continental notion which is the aboriginal notion of arranging marriages irrespective of the personal inclinations of the married is sound Think for a minute and you will see that it must be so unless of course you believe in affinities In which case you had better not read this tale How can a man who has never married who cannot be trusted to pick up at sight a moderately sound horse whose head is hot and upset with visions of domestic felicity go about the choosing of a wife He cannot see straight or think straight if he tries and the same disadvantages exist in the case of a girl s fancies But when mature married and discreet people arrange a match between a boy and a girl they do it sensibly with a view to the future and the young couple live happily ever afterwards As everybody knows Properly speaking Government should establish a Matrimonial Department efficiently officered with a Jury of Matrons a Judge of the Chief Court a Senior Chaplain and an Awful Warning in the shape of a love match that has gone wrong chained to the trees in the courtyard All marriages should be made through the Department which might be subordinate to the Educational Department under the same penalty as that attaching to the transfer of land without a stamped document But Government won t take suggestions It pretends that it is too busy However I will put my notion on record and explain the example that illustrates the theory Once upon a time there was a good young man a first class officer in his own Department a man with a career before him and possibly a K C G E at the end of it All his superiors spoke well of him because he knew how to hold his tongue and his pen at the proper times There are to day only eleven men in India who possess this secret and they have all with one exception attained great honor and enormous incomes This good young man was quiet and self contained too old for his years by far Which always carries its own punishment Had a Subaltern or a Tea Planter s Assistant or anybody who enjoys life and has no care for to morrow done what he tried to do not a soul would have cared But when Peythroppe the estimable virtuous economical quiet hard working young Peythroppe fell there was a flutter through five Departments The manner of his fall was in this way He met a Miss Castries d Castries it was originally but the family dropped the d for administrative reasons and he fell in love with her even more energetically that he worked Understand clearly that there was not a breath of a word to be said against Miss Castries not a shadow of a breath She was good and very lovely possessed what innocent people at home call a Spanish complexion with thick blue black hair growing low down on her forehead into a widow s peak and big violet eyes under eyebrows as black and as straight as the borders of a Gazette Extraordinary when a big man dies But but but Well she was a VERY sweet girl and very pious but for many reasons she was impossible Quite so All good Mammas know what impossible means It was obviously absurd that Peythroppe should marry her The little opal tinted onyx at the base of her finger nails said this as plainly as print Further marriage with Miss Castries meant marriage with several other Castries Honorary Lieutenant Castries her Papa missus Eulalie Castries her Mamma and all the ramifications of the Castries family on incomes ranging from Rs one hundred seventy five to Rs four hundred seventy a month and THEIR wives and connections again It would have been cheaper for Peythroppe to have assaulted a Commissioner with a dog whip or to have burned the records of a Deputy Commissioner s Office than to have contracted an alliance with the Castries It would have weighted his after career less even under a Government which never forgets and NEVER forgives Everybody saw this but Peythroppe He was going to marry Miss Castries he was being of age and drawing a good income and woe betide the house that would not afterwards receive missus Virginie Saulez Peythroppe with the deference due to her husband s rank That was Peythroppe s ultimatum and any remonstrance drove him frantic These sudden madnesses most afflict the sanest men There was a case once but I will tell you of that later on You cannot account for the mania except under a theory directly contradicting the one about the Place wherein marriages are made Peythroppe was burningly anxious to put a millstone round his neck at the outset of his career and argument had not the least effect on him He was going to marry Miss Castries and the business was his own business He would thank you to keep your advice to yourself With a man in this condition mere words only fix him in his purpose Of course he cannot see that marriage out here does not concern the individual but the Government he serves Do you remember missus Hauksbee the most wonderful woman in India She saved Pluffles from missus Reiver won Tarrion his appointment in the Foreign Office and was defeated in open field by missus Cusack Bremmil She heard of the lamentable condition of Peythroppe and her brain struck out the plan that saved him She had the wisdom of the Serpent the logical coherence of the Man the fearlessness of the Child and the triple intuition of the Woman Never no never as long as a tonga buckets down the Solon dip or the couples go a riding at the back of Summer Hill will there be such a genius as missus Hauksbee She attended the consultation of Three Men on Peythroppe s case and she stood up with the lash of her riding whip between her lips and spake Three weeks later Peythroppe dined with the Three Men and the Gazette of India came in Peythroppe found to his surprise that he had been gazetted a month s leave Don t ask me how this was managed I believe firmly that if missus Hauksbee gave the order the whole Great Indian Administration would stand on its head The Three Men had also a month s leave each Peythroppe put the Gazette down and said bad words Then there came from the compound the soft pad pad of camels thieves camels the bikaneer breed that don t bubble and howl when they sit down and get up After that I don t know what happened This much is certain Peythroppe disappeared vanished like smoke and the long foot rest chair in the house of the Three Men was broken to splinters Also a bedstead departed from one of the bedrooms missus Hauksbee said that mister Peythroppe was shooting in Rajputana with the Three Men so we were compelled to believe her At the end of the month Peythroppe was gazetted twenty days extension of leave but there was wrath and lamentation in the house of Castries The marriage day had been fixed but the bridegroom never came and the D Silvas Pereiras and Ducketts lifted their voices and mocked Honorary Lieutenant Castries as one who had been basely imposed upon missus Hauksbee went to the wedding and was much astonished when Peythroppe did not appear After seven weeks Peythroppe and the Three Men returned from Rajputana Peythroppe was in hard tough condition rather white and more self contained than ever One of the Three Men had a cut on his nose cause by the kick of a gun Twelve bores kick rather curiously Then came Honorary Lieutenant Castries seeking for the blood of his perfidious son in law to be He said things vulgar and impossible things which showed the raw rough ranker below the Honorary and I fancy Peythroppe s eyes were opened Anyhow he held his peace till the end when he spoke briefly Honorary Lieutenant Castries asked for a peg before he went away to die or bring a suit for breach of promise Miss Castries was a very good girl She said that she would have no breach of promise suits She said that if she was not a lady she was refined enough to know that ladies kept their broken hearts to themselves and as she ruled her parents nothing happened Later on she married a most respectable and gentlemanly person He travelled for an enterprising firm in Calcutta and was all that a good husband should be So Peythroppe came to his right mind again and did much good work and was honored by all who knew him One of these days he will marry but he will marry a sweet pink and white maiden on the Government House List with a little money and some influential connections as every wise man should And he will never all his life tell her what happened during the seven weeks of his shooting tour in Rajputana But just think how much trouble and expense for camel hire is not cheap and those Bikaneer brutes had to be fed like humans might have been saved by a properly conducted Matrimonial Department under the control of the Director General of Education but corresponding direct with the Viceroy THE ARREST OF LIEUTENANT GOLIGHTLY I ve forgotten the countersign sez e Oh You aye ave you sez I But I m the Colonel sez e Oh You are are you sez I Colonel nor no Colonel you waits ere till I m relieved an the Sarjint reports on your ugly old mug Coop sez I An s help me soul twas the Colonel after all But I was a recruity then 
5278-40897-0000	train-other-500	The Unedited Autobiography of Private Ortheris IF there was one thing on which Golightly prided himself more than another it was looking like an Officer and a gentleman He said it was for the honor of the Service that he attired himself so elaborately
none	none	 but those who knew him best said that it was just personal vanity 
5278-40897-0001	train-other-500	There was no harm about Golightly not an ounce He recognized a horse when he saw one and could do more than fill a cantle He played a very fair game at billiards and was a sound man at the whist table
5278-40897-0002	train-other-500	Everyone liked him and nobody ever dreamed of seeing him handcuffed on a station platform as a deserter But this sad thing happened He was going down from Dalhousie at the end of his leave riding down
none	none	 He had cut his leave as fine as he dared and wanted to come down in a hurry 
5278-40897-0003	train-other-500	It was fairly warm at Dalhousie and knowing what to expect below he descended in a new khaki suit tight fitting of a delicate olive green a peacock blue tie white collar and a snowy white solah helmet
5278-40897-0004	train-other-500	He prided himself on looking neat even when he was riding post He did look neat and he was so deeply concerned about his appearance before he started that he quite forgot to take anything but some small change with him
5278-40897-0005	train-other-500	He left all his notes at the hotel His servants had gone down the road before him to be ready in waiting at Pathankote with a change of gear That was what he called travelling in light marching order
5278-40897-0006	train-other-500	He was proud of his faculty of organization what we call bundobust Twenty two miles out of Dalhousie it began to rain not a mere hill shower but a good tepid monsoonish downpour
5278-40897-0007	train-other-500	Golightly bustled on wishing that he had brought an umbrella The dust on the roads turned into mud and the pony mired a good deal So did Golightly s khaki gaiters But he kept on steadily and tried to think how pleasant the coolth was
5278-40897-0008	train-other-500	His next pony was rather a brute at starting and Golightly s hands being slippery with the rain contrived to get rid of Golightly at a corner He chased the animal caught it and went ahead briskly
5278-40897-0009	train-other-500	The spill had not improved his clothes or his temper and he had lost one spur He kept the other one employed By the time that stage was ended the pony had had as much exercise as he wanted
5278-40897-0010	train-other-500	and in spite of the rain Golightly was sweating freely At the end of another miserable half hour Golightly found the world disappear before his eyes in clammy pulp
5278-40897-0011	train-other-500	The rain had turned the pith of his huge and snowy solah topee into an evil smelling dough and it had closed on his head like a half opened mushroom Also the green lining was beginning to run
5278-40897-0012	train-other-500	Golightly did not say anything worth recording here He tore off and squeezed up as much of the brim as was in his eyes and ploughed on The back of the helmet was flapping on his neck and the sides stuck to his ears
5278-40897-0013	train-other-500	but the leather band and green lining kept things roughly together so that the hat did not actually melt away where it flapped Presently the pulp and the green stuff made a sort of slimy mildew which ran over Golightly in several directions
none	none	 down his back and bosom for choice 
5278-40897-0014	train-other-500	The khaki color ran too it was really shockingly bad dye and sections of Golightly were brown and patches were violet and contours were ochre and streaks were ruddy red and blotches were nearly white
5278-40897-0015	train-other-500	according to the nature and peculiarities of the dye
none	none	 When he took out his handkerchief to wipe his face and the green of the hat lining and the purple stuff that had soaked through on to his neck from the tie 
5278-40897-0016	train-other-500	became thoroughly mixed the effect was
none	none	 amazing 
5278-40897-0017	train-other-500	Near Dhar the rain stopped and the evening sun came out and dried him up slightly It fixed the colors too Three miles from Pathankote the last pony fell dead lame and Golightly was forced to walk
5278-40897-0018	train-other-500	He pushed on into Pathankote to find his servants He did not know then that his khitmatgar had stopped by the roadside to get drunk and would come on the next day saying that he had sprained his ankle
5278-40897-0019	train-other-500	When he got into Pathankote he couldn t find his servants his boots were stiff and ropy with mud and there were large quantities of dirt about his body The blue tie had run as much as the khaki So he took it off with the collar and threw it away
5278-40897-0020	train-other-500	Then he said something about servants generally and tried to get a peg He paid eight annas for the drink and this revealed to him that he had only six annas more in his pocket or in the world as he stood at that hour
5278-40897-0021	train-other-500	He went to the Station Master to negotiate for a first class ticket to Khasa where he was stationed The booking clerk said something to the Station Master the Station Master said something to the Telegraph Clerk
none	none	 and the three looked at him with curiosity 
5278-40897-0022	train-other-500	They asked him to wait for half an hour while they telegraphed to Umritsar for authority So he waited and four constables came and grouped themselves picturesquely round him Just as he was preparing to ask them to go away the Station Master said that
5278-40897-0023	train-other-500	he would give the Sahib a ticket to Umritsar
none	none	 if the Sahib would kindly come inside the booking office 
5278-40897-0024	train-other-500	Golightly stepped inside and the next thing he knew was that a constable was attached to each of his legs and arms while the Station Master was trying to cram a mailbag over his head
5278-40897-0025	train-other-500	There was a very fair scuffle all round the booking office and Golightly received a nasty cut over his eye through falling against a table But the constables were too much for him and they and the Station Master handcuffed him securely
5278-40897-0026	train-other-500	As soon as the mail bag was slipped he began expressing his opinions and the head constable said Without doubt this is the soldier Englishman we required Listen to the abuse
none	none	 Then Golightly asked the Station Master what the this and the that the proceedings meant 
5278-40897-0027	train-other-500	The Station Master told him he was
none	none	 Private John Binkle of the Regiment five fort nine in fair hair gray eyes and a dissipated appearance 
5278-40897-0028	train-other-500	no marks on the body who had deserted a fortnight ago
none	none	 Golightly began explaining at great length and the more he explained the less the Station Master believed him 
5278-40897-0029	train-other-500	He said that no Lieutenant could look such a ruffian as did Golightly and that his instructions were to send his capture under proper escort to Umritsar Golightly was feeling very damp and uncomfortable and the language he used was not fit for publication
5278-40897-0030	train-other-500	even in an expurgated form The four constables saw him safe to Umritsar in an intermediate compartment and he spent the four hour journey in abusing them as fluently as his knowledge of the vernaculars allowed
5278-40897-0031	train-other-500	At Umritsar he was bundled out on the platform into the arms of a Corporal
none	none	 and two men of the Regiment 
5278-40897-0032	train-other-500	Golightly drew himself up and tried to carry off matters jauntily He did not feel too jaunty in handcuffs with four constables behind him and the blood from the cut on his forehead stiffening on his left cheek The Corporal was not jocular either
5278-40897-0033	train-other-500	Golightly got as far as This is a very absurd mistake my men when the Corporal told him to stow his lip and come along Golightly did not want to come along He desired to stop and explain
5278-40897-0034	train-other-500	He explained very well indeed until the Corporal cut in with YOU
none	none	 a orficer It s the like o YOU as brings disgrace on the likes of US 
5278-40897-0035	train-other-500	Bloom in fine orficer you are I know your regiment
none	none	 The Rogue s March is the quickstep where you come from 
5278-40897-0036	train-other-500	You re a black shame to the Service Golightly kept his temper and began explaining all over again from the beginning Then he was marched out of the rain into the refreshment room and told not to make a qualified fool of himself
5278-40897-0037	train-other-500	The men were going to run him up to Fort Govindghar And running up is a performance almost as undignified as the Frog March Golightly was nearly hysterical with rage and the chill and the mistake and the handcuffs and the headache that the cut on his forehead had given him
5278-40897-0038	train-other-500	He really laid himself out to express what was in his mind When he had quite finished and his throat was feeling dry one of the men said I ve eard a few beggars in the click blind stiff and crack on a bit
5278-40897-0039	train-other-500	but I ve never eard any one to touch this ere orficer They were not angry with him They rather admired him They had some beer at the refreshment room and offered Golightly some too because he had swore won erful
5278-40897-0040	train-other-500	They asked him to tell them all about the adventures of Private John Binkle while he was loose on the countryside and that made Golightly wilder than ever
none	none	 If he had kept his wits about him he would have kept quiet until an officer came but he attempted to run 
5278-40897-0041	train-other-500	Now the butt of a Martini in the small of your back hurts a great deal and rotten rain soaked khaki tears easily when two men are jerking at your collar Golightly rose from the floor feeling very sick and giddy
5278-40897-0042	train-other-500	with his shirt ripped open all down his breast and nearly all down his back He yielded to his luck and at that point the down train from Lahore came in carrying one of Golightly s Majors This is the Major s evidence in full
5278-40897-0043	train-other-500	There was the sound of a scuffle in the second class refreshment room so I went in and saw the most villainous loafer that I ever set eyes on His boots and breeches were plastered with mud and beer stains He wore a muddy white dunghill sort of thing on his head
5278-40897-0044	train-other-500	and it hung down in slips on his shoulders which were a good deal scratched He was half in and half out of a shirt as nearly in two pieces as it could be and he was begging the guard to look at the name on the tail of it As he had rucked the shirt all over his head I couldn t at first see who he was but
none	none	 I fancied that he was a man in the first stage of D T 
5278-40897-0045	train-other-500	from the way he swore while he wrestled with his rags
none	none	 When he turned round and I had made allowance for a lump as big as a pork pie over one eye 
5278-40897-0046	train-other-500	and some green war paint on the face and some violet stripes round the neck I saw that it was Golightly He was very glad to see me said the Major
5278-40897-0047	train-other-500	and he hoped I would not tell the Mess about it I didn t but you can if you like now that Golightly has gone Home Golightly spent the greater part of that summer in trying to get the Corporal and the two soldiers tried by Court Martial
none	none	 for arresting an officer and a gentleman They were of course very sorry for their error But the tale leaked into the regimental canteen and thence ran about the Province THE HOUSE OF SUDDHOO A stone s throw out on either hand From that well ordered road we tread And all the world is wild and strange Churel and ghoul and Djinn and sprite Shall bear us company to night For we have reached the Oldest Land Wherein the Powers of Darkness range From the Dusk to the Dawn The house of Suddhoo near the Taksali Gate is two storied with four carved windows of old brown wood and a flat roof You may recognize it by five red hand prints arranged like the Five of Diamonds on the whitewash between the upper windows Bhagwan Dass the bunnia and a man who says he gets his living by seal cutting live in the lower story with a troop of wives servants friends and retainers The two upper rooms used to be occupied by Janoo and Azizun and a little black and tan terrier that was stolen from an Englishman s house and given to Janoo by a soldier To day only Janoo lives in the upper rooms Suddhoo sleeps on the roof generally except when he sleeps in the street He used to go to Peshawar in the cold weather to visit his son who sells curiosities near the Edwardes Gate and then he slept under a real mud roof Suddhoo is a great friend of mine because his cousin had a son who secured thanks to my recommendation the post of head messenger to a big firm in the Station Suddhoo says that God will make me a Lieutenant Governor one of these days I daresay his prophecy will come true He is very very old with white hair and no teeth worth showing and he has outlived his wits outlived nearly everything except his fondness for his son at Peshawar Janoo and Azizun are Kashmiris Ladies of the City and theirs was an ancient and more or less honorable profession but Azizun has since married a medical student from the North West and has settled down to a most respectable life somewhere near Bareilly Bhagwan Dass is an extortionate and an adulterator He is very rich The man who is supposed to get his living by seal cutting pretends to be very poor This lets you know as much as is necessary of the four principal tenants in the house of Suddhoo Then there is Me of course but I am only the chorus that comes in at the end to explain things So I do not count Suddhoo was not clever The man who pretended to cut seals was the cleverest of them all Bhagwan Dass only knew how to lie except Janoo She was also beautiful but that was her own affair Suddhoo s son at Peshawar was attacked by pleurisy and old Suddhoo was troubled The seal cutter man heard of Suddhoo s anxiety and made capital out of it He was abreast of the times He got a friend in Peshawar to telegraph daily accounts of the son s health And here the story begins Suddhoo s cousin s son told me one evening that Suddhoo wanted to see me that he was too old and feeble to come personally and that I should be conferring an everlasting honor on the House of Suddhoo if I went to him I went but I think seeing how well off Suddhoo was then that he might have sent something better than an ekka which jolted fearfully to haul out a future Lieutenant Governor to the City on a muggy April evening The ekka did not run quickly It was full dark when we pulled up opposite the door of Ranjit Singh s Tomb near the main gate of the Fort Here was Suddhoo and he said that by reason of my condescension it was absolutely certain that I should become a Lieutenant Governor while my hair was yet black Then we talked about the weather and the state of my health and the wheat crops for fifteen minutes in the Huzuri Bagh under the stars Suddhoo came to the point at last He said that Janoo had told him that there was an order of the Sirkar against magic because it was feared that magic might one day kill the Empress of India I didn t know anything about the state of the law but I fancied that something interesting was going to happen I said that so far from magic being discouraged by the Government it was highly commended The greatest officials of the State practiced it themselves If the Financial Statement isn t magic I don t know what is Then to encourage him further I said that if there was any jadoo afoot I had not the least objection to giving it my countenance and sanction and to seeing that it was clean jadoo white magic as distinguished from the unclean jadoo which kills folk It took a long time before Suddhoo admitted that this was just what he had asked me to come for Then he told me in jerks and quavers that the man who said he cut seals was a sorcerer of the cleanest kind that every day he gave Suddhoo news of the sick son in Peshawar more quickly than the lightning could fly and that this news was always corroborated by the letters Further that he had told Suddhoo how a great danger was threatening his son which could be removed by clean jadoo and of course heavy payment I began to see how the land lay and told Suddhoo that I also understood a little jadoo in the Western line and would go to his house to see that everything was done decently and in order We set off together and on the way Suddhoo told me he had paid the seal cutter between one hundred and two hundred rupees already and the jadoo of that night would cost two hundred more Which was cheap he said considering the greatness of his son s danger but I do not think he meant it The lights were all cloaked in the front of the house when we arrived I could hear awful noises from behind the seal cutter s shop front as if some one were groaning his soul out Suddhoo shook all over and while we groped our way upstairs told me that the jadoo had begun Janoo and Azizun met us at the stair head and told us that the jadoo work was coming off in their rooms because there was more space there Janoo is a lady of a freethinking turn of mind She whispered that the jadoo was an invention to get money out of Suddhoo and that the seal cutter would go to a hot place when he died Suddhoo was nearly crying with fear and old age He kept walking up and down the room in the half light repeating his son s name over and over again and asking Azizun if the seal cutter ought not to make a reduction in the case of his own landlord Janoo pulled me over to the shadow in the recess of the carved bow windows The boards were up and the rooms were only lit by one tiny lamp There was no chance of my being seen if I stayed still Presently the groans below ceased and we heard steps on the staircase That was the seal cutter He stopped outside the door as the terrier barked and Azizun fumbled at the chain and he told Suddhoo to blow out the lamp This left the place in jet darkness except for the red glow from the two huqas that belonged to Janoo and Azizun The seal cutter came in and I heard Suddhoo throw himself down on the floor and groan Azizun caught her breath and Janoo backed to one of the beds with a shudder There was a clink of something metallic and then shot up a pale blue green flame near the ground The light was just enough to show Azizun pressed against one corner of the room with the terrier between her knees Janoo with her hands clasped leaning forward as she sat on the bed Suddhoo face down quivering and the seal cutter I hope I may never see another man like that seal cutter He was stripped to the waist with a wreath of white jasmine as thick as my wrist round his forehead a salmon colored loin cloth round his middle and a steel bangle on each ankle This was not awe inspiring It was the face of the man that turned me cold It was blue gray in the first place In the second the eyes were rolled back till you could only see the whites of them and in the third the face was the face of a demon a ghoul anything you please except of the sleek oily old ruffian who sat in the day time over his turning lathe downstairs He was lying on his stomach with his arms turned and crossed behind him as if he had been thrown down pinioned His head and neck were the only parts of him off the floor They were nearly at right angles to the body like the head of a cobra at spring It was ghastly In the centre of the room on the bare earth floor stood a big deep brass basin with a pale blue green light floating in the centre like a night light Round that basin the man on the floor wriggled himself three times How he did it I do not know I could see the muscles ripple along his spine and fall smooth again but I could not see any other motion The head seemed the only thing alive about him except that slow curl and uncurl of the laboring back muscles Janoo from the bed was breathing seventy to the minute Azizun held her hands before her eyes and old Suddhoo fingering at the dirt that had got into his white beard was crying to himself The horror of it was that the creeping crawly thing made no sound only crawled And remember this lasted for ten minutes while the terrier whined and Azizun shuddered and Janoo gasped and Suddhoo cried I felt the hair lift at the back of my head and my heart thump like a thermantidote paddle Luckily the seal cutter betrayed himself by his most impressive trick and made me calm again After he had finished that unspeakable triple crawl he stretched his head away from the floor as high as he could and sent out a jet of fire from his nostrils Now I knew how fire spouting is done I can do it myself so I felt at ease The business was a fraud If he had only kept to that crawl without trying to raise the effect goodness knows what I might not have thought Both the girls shrieked at the jet of fire and the head dropped chin down on the floor with a thud the whole body lying then like a corpse with its arms trussed There was a pause of five full minutes after this and the blue green flame died down Janoo stooped to settle one of her anklets while Azizun turned her face to the wall and took the terrier in her arms Suddhoo put out an arm mechanically to Janoo s huqa and she slid it across the floor with her foot Directly above the body and on the wall were a couple of flaming portraits in stamped paper frames of the Queen and the Prince of Wales They looked down on the performance and to my thinking seemed to heighten the grotesqueness of it all Just when the silence was getting unendurable the body turned over and rolled away from the basin to the side of the room where it lay stomach up There was a faint plop from the basin exactly like the noise a fish makes when it takes a fly and the green light in the centre revived I looked at the basin and saw bobbing in the water the dried shrivelled black head of a native baby open eyes open mouth and shaved scalp It was worse being so very sudden than the crawling exhibition We had no time to say anything before it began to speak Read Poe s account of the voice that came from the mesmerized dying man and you will realize less than one half of the horror of that head s voice There was an interval of a second or two between each word and a sort of ring ring ring in the note of the voice like the timbre of a bell It pealed slowly as if talking to itself for several minutes before I got rid of my cold sweat Then the blessed solution struck me I looked at the body lying near the doorway and saw just where the hollow of the throat joins on the shoulders a muscle that had nothing to do with any man s regular breathing twitching away steadily The whole thing was a careful reproduction of the Egyptian teraphin that one read about sometimes and the voice was as clever and as appalling a piece of ventriloquism as one could wish to hear All this time the head was lip lip lapping against the side of the basin and speaking It told Suddhoo on his face again whining of his son s illness and of the state of the illness up to the evening of that very night I always shall respect the seal cutter for keeping so faithfully to the time of the Peshawar telegrams It went on to say that skilled doctors were night and day watching over the man s life and that he would eventually recover if the fee to the potent sorcerer whose servant was the head in the basin were doubled Here the mistake from the artistic point of view came in To ask for twice your stipulated fee in a voice that Lazarus might have used when he rose from the dead is absurd Janoo who is really a woman of masculine intellect saw this as quickly as I did I heard her say Asli nahin Fareib scornfully under her breath and just as she said so the light in the basin died out the head stopped talking and we heard the room door creak on its hinges Then Janoo struck a match lit the lamp and we saw that head basin and seal cutter were gone Suddhoo was wringing his hands and explaining to any one who cared to listen that if his chances of eternal salvation depended on it he could not raise another two hundred rupees Azizun was nearly in hysterics in the corner while Janoo sat down composedly on one of the beds to discuss the probabilities of the whole thing being a bunao or make up I explained as much as I knew of the seal cutter s way of jadoo but her argument was much more simple The magic that is always demanding gifts is no true magic said she My mother told me that the only potent love spells are those which are told you for love This seal cutter man is a liar and a devil I dare not tell do anything or get anything done because I am in debt to Bhagwan Dass the bunnia for two gold rings and a heavy anklet I must get my food from his shop The seal cutter is the friend of Bhagwan Dass and he would poison my food A fool s jadoo has been going on for ten days and has cost Suddhoo many rupees each night The seal cutter used black hens and lemons and mantras before He never showed us anything like this till to night Azizun is a fool and will be a pur dahnashin soon Suddhoo has lost his strength and his wits See now I had hoped to get from Suddhoo many rupees while he lived and many more after his death and behold he is spending everything on that offspring of a devil and a she ass the seal cutter Here I said But what induced Suddhoo to drag me into the business Of course I can speak to the seal cutter and he shall refund The whole thing is child s talk shame and senseless Suddhoo IS an old child said Janoo He has lived on the roofs these seventy years and is as senseless as a milch goat He brought you here to assure himself that he was not breaking any law of the Sirkar whose salt he ate many years ago He worships the dust off the feet of the seal cutter and that cow devourer has forbidden him to go and see his son What does Suddhoo know of your laws or the lightning post I have to watch his money going day by day to that lying beast below Janoo stamped her foot on the floor and nearly cried with vexation while Suddhoo was whimpering under a blanket in the corner and Azizun was trying to guide the pipe stem to his foolish old mouth Now the case stands thus Unthinkingly I have laid myself open to the charge of aiding and abetting the seal cutter in obtaining money under false pretences which is forbidden by Section four hundred twenty of the Indian Penal Code I am helpless in the matter for these reasons I cannot inform the Police What witnesses would support my statements Janoo refuses flatly Azizun is a veiled woman somewhere near Bareilly lost in this big India of ours I cannot again take the law into my own hands and speak to the seal cutter for certain am I that not only would Suddhoo disbelieve me but this step would end in the poisoning of Janoo who is bound hand and foot by her debt to the bunnia Suddhoo is an old dotard and whenever we meet mumbles my idiotic joke that the Sirkar rather patronizes the Black Art than otherwise His son is well now but Suddhoo is completely under the influence of the seal cutter by whose advice he regulates the affairs of his life Janoo watches daily the money that she hoped to wheedle out of Suddhoo taken by the seal cutter and becomes daily more furious and sullen She will never tell because she dare not but unless something happens to prevent her I am afraid that the seal cutter will die of cholera the white arsenic kind about the middle of May And thus I shall have to be privy to a murder in the House of Suddhoo HIS WEDDED WIFE Cry Murder in the market place and each Will turn upon his neighbor anxious eyes That ask Art thou the man We hunted Cain Some centuries ago across the world That bred the fear our own misdeeds maintain To day Vibart s Moralities Shakespeare says something about worms or it may be giants or beetles turning if you tread on them too severely The safest plan is never to tread on a worm not even on the last new subaltern from Home with his buttons hardly out of their tissue paper and the red of sappy English beef in his cheeks This is the story of the worm that turned For the sake of brevity we will call Henry Augustus Ramsay Faizanne The Worm although he really was an exceedingly pretty boy without a hair on his face and with a waist like a girl s when he came out to the Second Shikarris and was made unhappy in several ways The Shikarris are a high caste regiment and you must be able to do things well play a banjo or ride more than a little or sing or act to get on with them The Worm did nothing except fall off his pony and knock chips out of gate posts with his trap Even that became monotonous after a time He objected to whist cut the cloth at billiards sang out of tune kept very much to himself and wrote to his Mamma and sisters at Home Four of these five things were vices which the Shikarris objected to and set themselves to eradicate Every one knows how subalterns are by brother subalterns softened and not permitted to be ferocious It is good and wholesome and does no one any harm unless tempers are lost and then there is trouble There was a man once but that is another story The Shikarris shikarred The Worm very much and he bore everything without winking He was so good and so anxious to learn and flushed so pink that his education was cut short and he was left to his own devices by every one except the Senior Subaltern who continued to make life a burden to The Worm The Senior Subaltern meant no harm but his chaff was coarse and he didn t quite understand where to stop He had been waiting too long for his company and that always sours a man Also he was in love which made him worse One day after he had borrowed The Worm s trap for a lady who never existed had used it himself all the afternoon had sent a note to The Worm purporting to come from the lady and was telling the Mess all about it The Worm rose in his place and said in his quiet ladylike voice That was a very pretty sell but I ll lay you a month s pay to a month s pay when you get your step that I work a sell on you that you ll remember for the rest of your days and the Regiment after you when you re dead or broke The Worm wasn t angry in the least and the rest of the Mess shouted Then the Senior Subaltern looked at The Worm from the boots upwards and down again and said Done Baby The Worm took the rest of the Mess to witness that the bet had been taken and retired into a book with a sweet smile Two months passed and the Senior Subaltern still educated The Worm who began to move about a little more as the hot weather came on I have said that the Senior Subaltern was in love The curious thing is that a girl was in love with the Senior Subaltern Though the Colonel said awful things and the Majors snorted and married Captains looked unutterable wisdom and the juniors scoffed those two were engaged The Senior Subaltern was so pleased with getting his Company and his acceptance at the same time that he forgot to bother The Worm The girl was a pretty girl and had money of her own She does not come into this story at all One night at the beginning of the hot weather all the Mess except The Worm who had gone to his own room to write Home letters were sitting on the platform outside the Mess House The Band had finished playing but no one wanted to go in And the Captains wives were there also The folly of a man in love is unlimited The Senior Subaltern had been holding forth on the merits of the girl he was engaged to and the ladies were purring approval while the men yawned when there was a rustle of skirts in the dark and a tired faint voice lifted itself Where s my husband I do not wish in the least to reflect on the morality of the Shikarris but it is on record that four men jumped up as if they had been shot Three of them were married men Perhaps they were afraid that their wives had come from Home unbeknownst The fourth said that he had acted on the impulse of the moment He explained this afterwards Then the voice cried Oh Lionel Lionel was the Senior Subaltern s name A woman came into the little circle of light by the candles on the peg tables stretching out her hands to the dark where the Senior Subaltern was and sobbing We rose to our feet feeling that things were going to happen and ready to believe the worst In this bad small world of ours one knows so little of the life of the next man which after all is entirely his own concern that one is not surprised when a crash comes Anything might turn up any day for any one Perhaps the Senior Subaltern had been trapped in his youth Men are crippled that way occasionally We didn t know we wanted to hear and the Captains wives were as anxious as we If he HAD been trapped he was to be excused for the woman from nowhere in the dusty shoes and gray travelling dress was very lovely with black hair and great eyes full of tears She was tall with a fine figure and her voice had a running sob in it pitiful to hear As soon as the Senior Subaltern stood up she threw her arms round his neck and called him my darling and said she could not bear waiting alone in England and his letters were so short and cold and she was his to the end of the world and would he forgive her This did not sound quite like a lady s way of speaking It was too demonstrative Things seemed black indeed and the Captains wives peered under their eyebrows at the Senior Subaltern and the Colonel s face set like the Day of Judgment framed in gray bristles and no one spoke for a while Next the Colonel said very shortly Well Sir and the woman sobbed afresh The Senior Subaltern was half choked with the arms round his neck but he gasped out It s a d d lie I never had a wife in my life Don t swear said the Colonel Come into the Mess We must sift this clear somehow and he sighed to himself for he believed in his Shikarris did the Colonel We trooped into the ante room under the full lights and there we saw how beautiful the woman was She stood up in the middle of us all sometimes choking with crying then hard and proud and then holding out her arms to the Senior Subaltern It was like the fourth act of a tragedy She told us how the Senior Subaltern had married her when he was Home on leave eighteen months before and she seemed to know all that we knew and more too of his people and his past life He was white and ashy gray trying now and again to break into the torrent of her words and we noting how lovely she was and what a criminal he looked esteemed him a beast of the worst kind We felt sorry for him though I shall never forget the indictment of the Senior Subaltern by his wife Nor will he It was so sudden rushing out of the dark unannounced into our dull lives The Captains wives stood back but their eyes were alight and you could see that they had already convicted and sentenced the Senior Subaltern The Colonel seemed five years older One Major was shading his eyes with his hand and watching the woman from underneath it Another was chewing his moustache and smiling quietly as if he were witnessing a play Full in the open space in the centre by the whist tables the Senior Subaltern s terrier was hunting for fleas I remember all this as clearly as though a photograph were in my hand I remember the look of horror on the Senior Subaltern s face It was rather like seeing a man hanged but much more interesting Finally the woman wound up by saying that the Senior Subaltern carried a double F M in tattoo on his left shoulder We all knew that and to our innocent minds it seemed to clinch the matter But one of the Bachelor Majors said very politely I presume that your marriage certificate would be more to the purpose That roused the woman She stood up and sneered at the Senior Subaltern for a cur and abused the Major and the Colonel and all the rest Then she wept and then she pulled a paper from her breast saying imperially Take that And let my husband my lawfully wedded husband read it aloud if he dare There was a hush and the men looked into each other s eyes as the Senior Subaltern came forward in a dazed and dizzy way and took the paper We were wondering as we stared whether there was anything against any one of us that might turn up later on The Senior Subaltern s throat was dry but as he ran his eye over the paper he broke out into a hoarse cackle of relief and said to the woman You young blackguard But the woman had fled through a door and on the paper was written This is to certify that I The Worm have paid in full my debts to the Senior Subaltern and further that the Senior Subaltern is my debtor by agreement on the twenty threed of February as by the Mess attested to the extent of one month s Captain s pay in the lawful currency of the India Empire Then a deputation set off for The Worm s quarters and found him betwixt and between unlacing his stays with the hat wig serge dress et cetera on the bed He came over as he was and the Shikarris shouted till the Gunners Mess sent over to know if they might have a share of the fun I think we were all except the Colonel and the Senior Subaltern a little disappointed that the scandal had come to nothing But that is human nature There could be no two words about The Worm s acting It leaned as near to a nasty tragedy as anything this side of a joke can When most of the Subalterns sat upon him with sofa cushions to find out why he had not said that acting was his strong point he answered very quietly I don t think you ever asked me I used to act at Home with my sisters But no acting with girls could account for The Worm s display that night Personally I think it was in bad taste Besides being dangerous There is no sort of use in playing with fire even for fun The Shikarris made him President of the Regimental Dramatic Club and when the Senior Subaltern paid up his debt which he did at once The Worm sank the money in scenery and dresses He was a good Worm and the Shikarris are proud of him The only drawback is that he has been christened missus Senior Subaltern and as there are now two missus Senior Subalterns in the Station this is sometimes confusing to strangers Later on I will tell you of a case something like this but with all the jest left out and nothing in it but real trouble THE BROKEN LINK HANDICAPPED While the snaffle holds or the long neck stings While the big beam tilts or the last bell rings While horses are horses to train and to race Then women and wine take a second place For me for me While a short ten three Has a field to squander or fence to face Song of the G R There are more ways of running a horse to suit your book than pulling his head off in the straight Some men forget this Understand clearly that all racing is rotten as everything connected with losing money must be Out here in addition to its inherent rottenness it has the merit of being two thirds sham looking pretty on paper only Every one knows every one else far too well for business purposes How on earth can you rack and harry and post a man for his losings when you are fond of his wife and live in the same Station with him He says on the Monday following I can t settle just yet You say All right old man and think your self lucky if you pull off nine hundred out of a two thousand rupee debt Any way you look at it Indian racing is immoral and expensively immoral Which is much worse If a man wants your money he ought to ask for it or send round a subscription list instead of juggling about the country with an Australian larrikin a brumby with as much breed as the boy a brace of chumars in gold laced caps three or four ekka ponies with hogged manes and a switch tailed demirep of a mare called Arab because she has a kink in her flag Racing leads to the shroff quicker than anything else But if you have no conscience and no sentiments and good hands and some knowledge of pace and ten years experience of horses and several thousand rupees a month I believe that you can occasionally contrive to pay your shoeing bills Did you ever know Shackles b w g fifteen point thirteen eight coarse loose mule like ears barrel as long as a gate post tough as a telegraph wire and the queerest brute that ever looked through a bridle He was of no brand being one of an ear nicked mob taken into the Bucephalus at fourl tens a head to make up freight and sold raw and out of condition at Calcutta for Rs two hundred seventy five People who lost money on him called him a brumby but if ever any horse had Harpoon s shoulders and The Gin s temper Shackles was that horse Two miles was his own particular distance He trained himself ran himself and rode himself and if his jockey insulted him by giving him hints he shut up at once and bucked the boy off He objected to dictation Two or three of his owners did not understand this and lost money in consequence At last he was bought by a man who discovered that if a race was to be won Shackles and Shackles only would win it in his own way so long as his jockey sat still This man had a riding boy called Brunt a lad from Perth West Australia and he taught Brunt with a trainer s whip the hardest thing a jock can learn to sit still to sit still and to keep on sitting still When Brunt fairly grasped this truth Shackles devastated the country No weight could stop him at his own distance and The fame of Shackles spread from Ajmir in the South to Chedputter in the North There was no horse like Shackles so long as he was allowed to do his work in his own way But he was beaten in the end and the story of his fall is enough to make angels weep At the lower end of the Chedputter racecourse just before the turn into the straight the track passes close to a couple of old brick mounds enclosing a funnel shaped hollow The big end of the funnel is not six feet from the railings on the off side The astounding peculiarity of the course is that if you stand at one particular place about half a mile away inside the course and speak at an ordinary pitch your voice just hits the funnel of the brick mounds and makes a curious whining echo there A man discovered this one morning by accident while out training with a friend He marked the place to stand and speak from with a couple of bricks and he kept his knowledge to himself EVERY peculiarity of a course is worth remembering in a country where rats play the mischief with the elephant litter and Stewards build jumps to suit their own stables This man ran a very fairish country bred a long racking high mare with the temper of a fiend and the paces of an airy wandering seraph a drifty glidy stretch The mare was as a delicate tribute to missus Reiver called The Lady Regula Baddun or for short Regula Baddun Shackles jockey Brunt was a quiet well behaved boy but his nerves had been shaken He began his career by riding jump races in Melbourne where a few Stewards want lynching and was one of the jockeys who came through the awful butchery perhaps you will recollect it of the Maribyrnong Plate The walls were colonial ramparts logs of jarrak spiked into masonry with wings as strong as Church buttresses Once in his stride a horse had to jump or fall He couldn t run out In the Maribyrnong Plate twelve horses were jammed at the second wall Red Hat leading fell this side and threw out The Glen and the ruck came up behind and the space between wing and wing was one struggling screaming kicking shambles Four jockeys were taken out dead three were very badly hurt and Brunt was among the three He told the story of the Maribyrnong Plate sometimes and when he described how Whalley on Red Hat said as the mare fell under him God ha mercy I m done for and how next instant Sithee There and White Otter had crushed the life out of poor Whalley and the dust hid a small hell of men and horses no one marvelled that Brunt had dropped jump races and Australia together Regula Baddun s owner knew that story by heart Brunt never varied it in the telling He had no education Shackles came to the Chedputter Autumn races one year and his owner walked about insulting the sportsmen of Chedputter generally till they went to the Honorary Secretary in a body and said Appoint Handicappers and arrange a race which shall break Shackles and humble the pride of his owner The Districts rose against Shackles and sent up of their best Ousel who was supposed to be able to do his mile in one fifty three Petard the stud bred trained by a cavalry regiment who knew how to train Gringalet the ewe lamb of the seventy fifth Bobolink the pride of Peshawar and many others They called that race The Broken Link Handicap because it was to smash Shackles and the Handicappers piled on the weights and the Fund gave eight hundred rupees and the distance was round the course for all horses Shackles owner said You can arrange the race with regard to Shackles only So long as you don t bury him under weight cloths I don t mind Regula Baddun s owner said I throw in my mare to fret Ousel Six furlongs is Regula s distance and she will then lie down and die So also will Ousel for his jockey doesn t understand a waiting race Now this was a lie for Regula had been in work for two months at Dehra and her chances were good always supposing that Shackles broke a blood vessel OR BRUNT MOVED ON HIM The plunging in the lotteries was fine They filled eight thousand rupee lotteries on the Broken Link Handicap and the account in the Pioneer said that favoritism was divided In plain English the various contingents were wild on their respective horses for the Handicappers had done their work well The Honorary Secretary shouted himself hoarse through the din and the smoke of the cheroots was like the smoke and the rattling of the dice boxes like the rattle of small arm fire Ten horses started very level and Regula Baddun s owner cantered out on his back to a place inside the circle of the course where two bricks had been thrown He faced towards the brick mounds at the lower end of the course and waited The story of the running is in the Pioneer At the end of the first mile Shackles crept out of the ruck well on the outside ready to get round the turn lay hold of the bit and spin up the straight before the others knew he had got away Brunt was sitting still perfectly happy listening to the drum drum drum of the hoofs behind and knowing that in about twenty strides Shackles would draw one deep breath and go up the last half mile like the Flying Dutchman As Shackles went short to take the turn and came abreast of the brick mound Brunt heard above the noise of the wind in his ears a whining wailing voice on the offside saying God ha mercy I m done for In one stride Brunt saw the whole seething smash of the Maribyrnong Plate before him started in his saddle and gave a yell of terror The start brought the heels into Shackles side and the scream hurt Shackles feelings He couldn t stop dead but he put out his feet and slid along for fifty yards and then very gravely and judicially bucked off Brunt a shaking terror stricken lump while Regula Baddun made a neck and neck race with Bobolink up the straight and won by a short head Petard a bad third Shackles owner in the Stand tried to think that his field glasses had gone wrong Regula Baddun s owner waiting by the two bricks gave one deep sigh of relief and cantered back to the stand He had won in lotteries and bets about fifteen thousand It was a broken link Handicap with a vengeance It broke nearly all the men concerned and nearly broke the heart of Shackles owner He went down to interview Brunt The boy lay livid and gasping with fright where he had tumbled off The sin of losing the race never seemed to strike him All he knew was that Whalley had called him that the call was a warning and were he cut in two for it he would never get up again His nerve had gone altogether and he only asked his master to give him a good thrashing and let him go He was fit for nothing he said He got his dismissal and crept up to the paddock white as chalk with blue lips his knees giving way under him People said nasty things in the paddock but Brunt never heeded He changed into tweeds took his stick and went down the road still shaking with fright and muttering over and over again God ha mercy I m done for To the best of my knowledge and belief he spoke the truth So now you know how the Broken Link Handicap was run and won Of course you don t believe it You would credit anything about Russia s designs on India or the recommendations of the Currency Commission but a little bit of sober fact is more than you can stand BEYOND THE PALE Love heeds not caste nor sleep a broken bed I went in search of love and lost myself Hindu Proverb A man should whatever happens keep to his own caste race and breed Let the White go to the White and the Black to the Black Then whatever trouble falls is in the ordinary course of things neither sudden alien nor unexpected This is the story of a man who wilfully stepped beyond the safe limits of decent every day society and paid for it heavily He knew too much in the first instance and he saw too much in the second He took too deep an interest in native life but he will never do so again Deep away in the heart of the City behind Jitha Megji s bustee lies Amir Nath s Gully which ends in a dead wall pierced by one grated window At the head of the Gully is a big cow byre and the walls on either side of the Gully are without windows Neither Suchet Singh nor Gaur Chand approved of their women folk looking into the world If Durga Charan had been of their opinion he would have been a happier man to day and little Biessa would have been able to knead her own bread Her room looked out through the grated window into the narrow dark Gully where the sun never came and where the buffaloes wallowed in the blue slime She was a widow about fifteen years old and she prayed the Gods day and night to send her a lover for she did not approve of living alone One day the man Trejago his name was came into Amir Nath s Gully on an aimless wandering and after he had passed the buffaloes stumbled over a big heap of cattle food Then he saw that the Gully ended in a trap and heard a little laugh from behind the grated window It was a pretty little laugh and Trejago knowing that for all practical purposes the old Arabian Nights are good guides went forward to the window and whispered that verse of The Love Song of Har Dyal which begins Can a man stand upright in the face of the naked Sun or a Lover in the Presence of his Beloved If my feet fail me O Heart of my Heart am I to blame being blinded by the glimpse of your beauty There came the faint tchinks of a woman s bracelets from behind the grating and a little voice went on with the song at the fifth verse Alas alas Can the Moon tell the Lotus of her love when the Gate of Heaven is shut and the clouds gather for the rains They have taken my Beloved and driven her with the pack horses to the North There are iron chains on the feet that were set on my heart Call to the bowman to make ready The voice stopped suddenly and Trejago walked out of Amir Nath s Gully wondering who in the world could have capped The Love Song of Har Dyal so neatly Next morning as he was driving to the office an old woman threw a packet into his dog cart In the packet was the half of a broken glass bangle one flower of the blood red dhak a pinch of bhusa or cattle food and eleven cardamoms That packet was a letter not a clumsy compromising letter but an innocent unintelligible lover s epistle Trejago knew far too much about these things as I have said No Englishman should be able to translate object letters But Trejago spread all the trifles on the lid of his office box and began to puzzle them out A broken glass bangle stands for a Hindu widow all India over because when her husband dies a woman s bracelets are broken on her wrists Trejago saw the meaning of the little bit of the glass The flower of the dhak means diversely desire come write or danger according to the other things with it One cardamom means jealousy but when any article is duplicated in an object letter it loses its symbolic meaning and stands merely for one of a number indicating time or if incense curds or saffron be sent also place The message ran then A widow dhak flower and bhusa at eleven o clock The pinch of bhusa enlightened Trejago He saw this kind of letter leaves much to instinctive knowledge that the bhusa referred to the big heap of cattle food over which he had fallen in Amir Nath s Gully and that the message must come from the person behind the grating she being a widow So the message ran then A widow in the Gully in which is the heap of bhusa desires you to come at eleven o clock Trejago threw all the rubbish into the fireplace and laughed He knew that men in the East do not make love under windows at eleven in the forenoon nor do women fix appointments a week in advance So he went that very night at eleven into Amir Nath s Gully clad in a boorka which cloaks a man as well as a woman Directly the gongs in the City made the hour the little voice behind the grating took up The Love Song of Har Dyal at the verse where the Panthan girl calls upon Har Dyal to return The song is really pretty in the Vernacular In English you miss the wail of it It runs something like this Alone upon the housetops to the North I turn and watch the lightning in the sky The glamour of thy footsteps in the North Come back to me Beloved or I die Below my feet the still bazar is laid Far far below the weary camels lie The camels and the captives of thy raid Come back to me Beloved or I die My father s wife is old and harsh with years And drudge of all my father s house am I My bread is sorrow and my drink is tears Come back to me Beloved or I die As the song stopped Trejago stepped up under the grating and whispered I am here Bisesa was good to look upon That night was the beginning of many strange things and of a double life so wild that Trejago to day sometimes wonders if it were not all a dream Bisesa or her old handmaiden who had thrown the object letter had detached the heavy grating from the brick work of the wall so that the window slid inside leaving only a square of raw masonry into which an active man might climb In the day time Trejago drove through his routine of office work or put on his calling clothes and called on the ladies of the Station wondering how long they would know him if they knew of poor little Bisesa At night when all the City was still came the walk under the evil smelling boorka the patrol through Jitha Megji s bustee the quick turn into Amir Nath s Gully between the sleeping cattle and the dead walls and then last of all Bisesa and the deep even breathing of the old woman who slept outside the door of the bare little room that Durga Charan allotted to his sister s daughter Who or what Durga Charan was Trejago never inquired and why in the world he was not discovered and knifed never occurred to him till his madness was over and Bisesa But this comes later Bisesa was an endless delight to Trejago She was as ignorant as a bird and her distorted versions of the rumors from the outside world that had reached her in her room amused Trejago almost as much as her lisping attempts to pronounce his name Christopher The first syllable was always more than she could manage and she made funny little gestures with her rose leaf hands as one throwing the name away and then kneeling before Trejago asked him exactly as an Englishwoman would do if he were sure he loved her Trejago swore that he loved her more than any one else in the world Which was true After a month of this folly the exigencies of his other life compelled Trejago to be especially attentive to a lady of his acquaintance You may take it for a fact that anything of this kind is not only noticed and discussed by a man s own race but by some hundred and fifty natives as well Trejago had to walk with this lady and talk to her at the Band stand and once or twice to drive with her never for an instant dreaming that this would affect his dearer out of the way life But the news flew in the usual mysterious fashion from mouth to mouth till Bisesa s duenna heard of it and told Bisesa The child was so troubled that she did the household work evilly and was beaten by Durga Charan s wife in consequence A week later Bisesa taxed Trejago with the flirtation She understood no gradations and spoke openly Trejago laughed and Bisesa stamped her little feet little feet light as marigold flowers that could lie in the palm of a man s one hand Much that is written about Oriental passion and impulsiveness is exaggerated and compiled at second hand but a little of it is true and when an Englishman finds that little it is quite as startling as any passion in his own proper life Bisesa raged and stormed and finally threatened to kill herself if Trejago did not at once drop the alien Memsahib who had come between them Trejago tried to explain and to show her that she did not understand these things from a Western standpoint Bisesa drew herself up and said simply I do not I know only this it is not good that I should have made you dearer than my own heart to me Sahib You are an Englishman I am only a black girl she was fairer than bar gold in the Mint and the widow of a black man Then she sobbed and said But on my soul and my Mother s soul I love you There shall no harm come to you whatever happens to me Trejago argued with the child and tried to soothe her but she seemed quite unreasonably disturbed Nothing would satisfy her save that all relations between them should end He was to go away at once And he went As he dropped out at the window she kissed his forehead twice and he walked away wondering A week and then three weeks passed without a sign from Bisesa Trejago thinking that the rupture had lasted quite long enough went down to Amir Nath s Gully for the fifth time in the three weeks hoping that his rap at the sill of the shifting grating would be answered He was not disappointed There was a young moon and one stream of light fell down into Amir Nath s Gully and struck the grating which was drawn away as he knocked From the black dark Bisesa held out her arms into the moonlight Both hands had been cut off at the wrists and the stumps were nearly healed Then as Bisesa bowed her head between her arms and sobbed some one in the room grunted like a wild beast and something sharp knife sword or spear thrust at Trejago in his boorka The stroke missed his body but cut into one of the muscles of the groin and he limped slightly from the wound for the rest of his days The grating went into its place There was no sign whatever from inside the house nothing but the moonlight strip on the high wall and the blackness of Amir Nath s Gully behind The next thing Trejago remembers after raging and shouting like a madman between those pitiless walls is that he found himself near the river as the dawn was breaking threw away his boorka and went home bareheaded What the tragedy was whether Bisesa had in a fit of causeless despair told everything or the intrigue had been discovered and she tortured to tell whether Durga Charan knew his name and what became of Bisesa Trejago does not know to this day Something horrible had happened and the thought of what it must have been comes upon Trejago in the night now and again and keeps him company till the morning One special feature of the case is that he does not know where lies the front of Durga Charan s house It may open on to a courtyard common to two or more houses or it may lie behind any one of the gates of Jitha Megji s bustee Trejago cannot tell He cannot get Bisesa poor little Bisesa back again He has lost her in the City where each man s house is as guarded and as unknowable as the grave and the grating that opens into Amir Nath s Gully has been walled up But Trejago pays his calls regularly and is reckoned a very decent sort of man There is nothing peculiar about him except a slight stiffness caused by a riding strain in the right leg IN ERROR They burnt a corpse upon the sand The light shone out afar It guided home the plunging boats That beat from Zanzibar Spirit of Fire where er Thy altars rise Thou art Light of Guidance to our eyes Salsette Boat Song There is hope for a man who gets publicly and riotously drunk more often that he ought to do but there is no hope for the man who drinks secretly and alone in his own house the man who is never seen to drink This is a rule so there must be an exception to prove it Moriarty s case was that exception He was a Civil Engineer and the Government very kindly put him quite by himself in an out district with nobody but natives to talk to and a great deal of work to do He did his work well in the four years he was utterly alone but he picked up the vice of secret and solitary drinking and came up out of the wilderness more old and worn and haggard than the dead alive life had any right to make him You know the saying that a man who has been alone in the jungle for more than a year is never quite sane all his life after People credited Moriarty s queerness of manner and moody ways to the solitude and said it showed how Government spoilt the futures of its best men Moriarty had built himself the plinth of a very god reputation in the bridge dam girder line But he knew every night of the week that he was taking steps to undermine that reputation with L L L and Christopher and little nips of liqueurs and filth of that kind He had a sound constitution and a great brain or else he would have broken down and died like a sick camel in the district as better men have done before him Government ordered him to Simla after he had come out of the desert and he went up meaning to try for a post then vacant That season missus Reiver perhaps you will remember her was in the height of her power and many men lay under her yoke Everything bad that could be said has already been said about missus Reiver in another tale Moriarty was heavily built and handsome very quiet and nervously anxious to please his neighbors when he wasn t sunk in a brown study He started a good deal at sudden noises or if spoken to without warning and when you watched him drinking his glass of water at dinner you could see the hand shake a little But all this was put down to nervousness and the quiet steady sip sip sip fill and sip sip sip again that went on in his own room when he was by himself was never known Which was miraculous seeing how everything in a man s private life is public property out here Moriarty was drawn not into missus Reiver s set because they were not his sort but into the power of missus Reiver and he fell down in front of her and made a goddess of her This was due to his coming fresh out of the jungle to a big town He could not scale things properly or see who was what Because missus Reiver was cold and hard he said she was stately and dignified Because she had no brains and could not talk cleverly he said she was reserved and shy missus Reiver shy Because she was unworthy of honor or reverence from any one he reverenced her from a distance and dowered her with all the virtues in the Bible and most of those in Shakespeare This big dark abstracted man who was so nervous when a pony cantered behind him used to moon in the train of missus Reiver blushing with pleasure when she threw a word or two his way His admiration was strictly platonic even other women saw and admitted this He did not move out in Simla so he heard nothing against his idol which was satisfactory missus Reiver took no special notice of him beyond seeing that he was added to her list of admirers and going for a walk with him now and then just to show that he was her property claimable as such Moriarty must have done most of the talking for missus Reiver couldn t talk much to a man of his stamp and the little she said could not have been profitable What Moriarty believed in as he had good reason to was missus Reiver s influence over him and in that belief set himself seriously to try to do away with the vice that only he himself knew of His experiences while he was fighting with it must have been peculiar but he never described them Sometimes he would hold off from everything except water for a week Then on a rainy night when no one had asked him out to dinner and there was a big fire in his room and everything comfortable he would sit down and make a big night of it by adding little nip to little nip planning big schemes of reformation meanwhile until he threw himself on his bed hopelessly drunk He suffered next morning One night the big crash came He was troubled in his own mind over his attempts to make himself worthy of the friendship of missus Reiver The past ten days had been very bad ones and the end of it all was that he received the arrears of two and three quarter years of sipping in one attack of delirium tremens of the subdued kind beginning with suicidal depression going on to fits and starts and hysteria and ending with downright raving As he sat in a chair in front of the fire or walked up and down the room picking a handkerchief to pieces you heard what poor Moriarty really thought of missus Reiver for he raved about her and his own fall for the most part though he ravelled some P W D accounts into the same skein of thought He talked and talked and talked in a low dry whisper to himself and there was no stopping him He seemed to know that there was something wrong and twice tried to pull himself together and confer rationally with the Doctor but his mind ran out of control at once and he fell back to a whisper and the story of his troubles It is terrible to hear a big man babbling like a child of all that a man usually locks up and puts away in the deep of his heart Moriarty read out his very soul for the benefit of any one who was in the room between ten thirty that night and two forty five next morning From what he said one gathered how immense an influence missus Reiver held over him and how thoroughly he felt for his own lapse His whisperings cannot of course be put down here but they were very instructive as showing the errors of his estimates When the trouble was over and his few acquaintances were pitying him for the bad attack of jungle fever that had so pulled him down Moriarty swore a big oath to himself and went abroad again with missus Reiver till the end of the season adoring her in a quiet and deferential way as an angel from heaven Later on he took to riding not hacking but honest riding which was good proof that he was improving and you could slam doors behind him without his jumping to his feet with a gasp That again was hopeful How he kept his oath and what it cost him in the beginning nobody knows He certainly managed to compass the hardest thing that a man who has drank heavily can do He took his peg and wine at dinner but he never drank alone and never let what he drank have the least hold on him Once he told a bosom friend the story of his great trouble and how the influence of a pure honest woman and an angel as well had saved him When the man startled at anything good being laid to missus Reiver s door laughed it cost him Moriarty s friendship Moriarty who is married now to a woman ten thousand times better than missus Reiver a woman who believes that there is no man on earth as good and clever as her husband will go down to his grave vowing and protesting that missus Reiver saved him from ruin in both worlds That she knew anything of Moriarty s weakness nobody believed for a moment That she would have cut him dead thrown him over and acquainted all her friends with her discovery if she had known of it nobody who knew her doubted for an instant Moriarty thought her something she never was and in that belief saved himself Which was just as good as though she had been everything that he had imagined But the question is what claim will missus Reiver have to the credit of Moriarty s salvation when her day of reckoning comes A BANK FRAUD He drank strong waters and his speech was coarse He purchased raiment and forebore to pay He struck a trusting junior with a horse And won Gymkhanas in a doubtful way Then twixt a vice and folly turned aside To do good deeds and straight to cloak them lied The Mess Room If Reggie Burke were in India now he would resent this tale being told but as he is in Hong Kong and won t see it the telling is safe He was the man who worked the big fraud on the Sind and Sialkote Bank He was manager of an up country Branch and a sound practical man with a large experience of native loan and insurance work He could combine the frivolities of ordinary life with his work and yet do well Reggie Burke rode anything that would let him get up danced as neatly as he rode and was wanted for every sort of amusement in the Station As he said himself and as many men found out rather to their surprise there were two Burkes both very much at your service Reggie Burke between four and ten ready for anything from a hot weather gymkhana to a riding picnic and between ten and four mister Reginald Burke Manager of the Sind and Sialkote Branch Bank You might play polo with him one afternoon and hear him express his opinions when a man crossed and you might call on him next morning to raise a two thousand rupee loan on a five hundred pound insurance policy eighty pounds paid in premiums He would recognize you but you would have some trouble in recognizing him The Directors of the Bank it had its headquarters in Calcutta and its General Manager s word carried weight with the Government picked their men well They had tested Reggie up to a fairly severe breaking strain They trusted him just as much as Directors ever trust Managers You must see for yourself whether their trust was misplaced Reggie s Branch was in a big Station and worked with the usual staff one Manager one Accountant both English a Cashier and a horde of native clerks besides the Police patrol at nights outside The bulk of its work for it was in a thriving district was hoondi and accommodation of all kinds A fool has no grip of this sort of business and a clever man who does not go about among his clients and know more than a little of their affairs is worse than a fool Reggie was young looking clean shaved with a twinkle in his eye and a head that nothing short of a gallon of the Gunners Madeira could make any impression on One day at a big dinner he announced casually that the Directors had shifted on to him a Natural Curiosity from England in the Accountant line He was perfectly correct mister Silas Riley Accountant was a MOST curious animal a long gawky rawboned Yorkshireman full of the savage self conceit that blossom s only in the best county in England Arrogance was a mild word for the mental attitude of mister S Riley He had worked himself up after seven years to a Cashier s position in a Huddersfield Bank and all his experience lay among the factories of the North Perhaps he would have done better on the Bombay side where they are happy with one half per cent profits and money is cheap He was useless for Upper India and a wheat Province where a man wants a large head and a touch of imagination if he is to turn out a satisfactory balance sheet He was wonderfully narrow minded in business and being new to the country had no notion that Indian banking is totally distinct from Home work Like most clever self made men he had much simplicity in his nature and somehow or other had construed the ordinarily polite terms of his letter of engagement into a belief that the Directors had chosen him on account of his special and brilliant talents and that they set great store by him This notion grew and crystallized thus adding to his natural North country conceit Further he was delicate suffered from some trouble in his chest and was short in his temper You will admit that Reggie had reason to call his new Accountant a Natural Curiosity The two men failed to hit it off at all Riley considered Reggie a wild feather headed idiot given to Heaven only knew what dissipation in low places called Messes and totally unfit for the serious and solemn vocation of banking He could never get over Reggie s look of youth and you be damned air and he couldn t understand Reggie s friends clean built careless men in the Army who rode over to big Sunday breakfasts at the Bank and told sultry stories till Riley got up and left the room Riley was always showing Reggie how the business ought to be conducted and Reggie had more than once to remind him that seven years limited experience between Huddersfield and Beverly did not qualify a man to steer a big up country business Then Riley sulked and referred to himself as a pillar of the Bank and a cherished friend of the Directors and Reggie tore his hair If a man s English subordinates fail him in this country he comes to a hard time indeed for native help has strict limitations In the winter Riley went sick for weeks at a time with his lung complaint and this threw more work on Reggie But he preferred it to the everlasting friction when Riley was well One of the Travelling Inspectors of the Bank discovered these collapses and reported them to the Directors Now Riley had been foisted on the Bank by an M P who wanted the support of Riley s father who again was anxious to get his son out to a warmer climate because of those lungs The M P had an interest in the Bank but one of the Directors wanted to advance a nominee of his own and after Riley s father had died he made the rest of the Board see that an Accountant who was sick for half the year had better give place to a healthy man If Riley had known the real story of his appointment he might have behaved better but knowing nothing his stretches of sickness alternated with restless persistent meddling irritation of Reggie and all the hundred ways in which conceit in a subordinate situation can find play Reggie used to call him striking and hair curling names behind his back as a relief to his own feelings but he never abused him to his face because he said Riley is such a frail beast that half of his loathsome conceit is due to pains in the chest Late one April Riley went very sick indeed The doctor punched him and thumped him and told him he would be better before long Then the doctor went to Reggie and said Do you know how sick your Accountant is No said Reggie The worse the better confound him He s a clacking nuisance when he s well I ll let you take away the Bank Safe if you can drug him silent for this hot weather But the doctor did not laugh Man I m not joking he said I ll give him another three months in his bed and a week or so more to die in On my honor and reputation that s all the grace he has in this world Consumption has hold of him to the marrow Reggie s face changed at once into the face of mister Reginald Burke and he answered What can I do Nothing said the doctor For all practical purposes the man is dead already Keep him quiet and cheerful and tell him he s going to recover That s all I ll look after him to the end of course The doctor went away and Reggie sat down to open the evening mail His first letter was one from the Directors intimating for his information that mister Riley was to resign under a month s notice by the terms of his agreement telling Reggie that their letter to Riley would follow and advising Reggie of the coming of a new Accountant a man whom Reggie knew and liked Reggie lit a cheroot and before he had finished smoking he had sketched the outline of a fraud He put away burked the Directors letter and went in to talk to Riley who was as ungracious as usual and fretting himself over the way the bank would run during his illness He never thought of the extra work on Reggie s shoulders but solely of the damage to his own prospects of advancement Then Reggie assured him that everything would be well and that he Reggie would confer with Riley daily on the management of the Bank Riley was a little soothed but he hinted in as many words that he did not think much of Reggie s business capacity Reggie was humble And he had letters in his desk from the Directors that a Gilbarte or a Hardie might have been proud of The days passed in the big darkened house and the Directors letter of dismissal to Riley came and was put away by Reggie who every evening brought the books to Riley s room and showed him what had been going forward while Riley snarled Reggie did his best to make statements pleasing to Riley but the Accountant was sure that the Bank was going to rack and ruin without him In June as the lying in bed told on his spirit he asked whether his absence had been noted by the Directors and Reggie said that they had written most sympathetic letters hoping that he would be able to resume his valuable services before long He showed Riley the letters and Riley said that the Directors ought to have written to him direct A few days later Reggie opened Riley s mail in the half light of the room and gave him the sheet not the envelope of a letter to Riley from the Directors Riley said he would thank Reggie not to interfere with his private papers specially as Reggie knew he was too weak to open his own letters Reggie apologized Then Riley s mood changed and he lectured Reggie on his evil ways his horses and his bad friends Of course lying here on my back mister Burke I can t keep you straight but when I m well I DO hope you ll pay some heed to my words Reggie who had dropped polo and dinners and tennis and all to attend to Riley said that he was penitent and settled Riley s head on the pillow and heard him fret and contradict in hard dry hacking whispers without a sign of impatience This at the end of a heavy day s office work doing double duty in the latter half of June When the new Accountant came Reggie told him the facts of the case and announced to Riley that he had a guest staying with him Riley said that he might have had more consideration than to entertain his doubtful friends at such a time Reggie made Carron the new Accountant sleep at the Club in consequence Carron s arrival took some of the heavy work off his shoulders and he had time to attend to Riley s exactions to explain soothe invent and settle and resettle the poor wretch in bed and to forge complimentary letters from Calcutta At the end of the first month Riley wished to send some money home to his mother Reggie sent the draft At the end of the second month Riley s salary came in just the same Reggie paid it out of his own pocket and with it wrote Riley a beautiful letter from the Directors Riley was very ill indeed but the flame of his life burnt unsteadily Now and then he would be cheerful and confident about the future sketching plans for going Home and seeing his mother Reggie listened patiently when the office work was over and encouraged him At other times Riley insisted on Reggie s reading the Bible and grim Methody tracts to him Out of these tracts he pointed morals directed at his Manager But he always found time to worry Reggie about the working of the Bank and to show him where the weak points lay This in door sick room life and constant strains wore Reggie down a good deal and shook his nerves and lowered his billiard play by forty points But the business of the Bank and the business of the sick room had to go on though the glass was one hundred sixteen degrees in the shade At the end of the third month Riley was sinking fast and had begun to realize that he was very sick But the conceit that made him worry Reggie kept him from believing the worst He wants some sort of mental stimulant if he is to drag on said the doctor Keep him interested in life if you care about his living So Riley contrary to all the laws of business and the finance received a twenty five per cent rise of salary from the Directors The mental stimulant succeeded beautifully Riley was happy and cheerful and as is often the case in consumption healthiest in mind when the body was weakest He lingered for a full month snarling and fretting about the Bank talking of the future hearing the Bible read lecturing Reggie on sin and wondering when he would be able to move abroad But at the end of September one mercilessly hot evening he rose up in his bed with a little gasp and said quickly to Reggie mister Burke I am going to die I know it in myself My chest is all hollow inside and there s nothing to breathe with To the best of my knowledge I have done nowt he was returning to the talk of his boyhood to lie heavy on my conscience God be thanked I have been preserved from the grosser forms of sin and I counsel YOU mister Burke Here his voice died down and Reggie stooped over him Send my salary for September to my mother done great things with the Bank if I had been spared mistaken policy no fault of mine Then he turned his face to the wall and died Reggie drew the sheet over Its face and went out into the verandah with his last mental stimulant a letter of condolence and sympathy from the Directors unused in his pocket If I d been only ten minutes earlier thought Reggie I might have heartened him up to pull through another day TOD S AMENDMENT The World hath set its heavy yoke Upon the old white bearded folk Who strive to please the King God s mercy is upon the young God s wisdom in the baby tongue That fears not anything The Parable of Chajju Bhagat Now Tods Mamma was a singularly charming woman and every one in Simla knew Tods Most men had saved him from death on occasions He was beyond his ayah s control altogether and perilled his life daily to find out what would happen if you pulled a Mountain Battery mule s tail He was an utterly fearless young Pagan about six years old and the only baby who ever broke the holy calm of the supreme Legislative Council It happened this way Tods pet kid got loose and fled up the hill off the Boileaugunge Road Tods after it until it burst into the Viceregal Lodge lawn then attached to Peterhoff The Council were sitting at the time and the windows were open because it was warm The Red Lancer in the porch told Tods to go away but Tods knew the Red Lancer and most of the Members of Council personally Moreover he had firm hold of the kid s collar and was being dragged all across the flower beds Give my salaam to the long Councillor Sahib and ask him to help me take Moti back gasped Tods The Council heard the noise through the open windows and after an interval was seen the shocking spectacle of a Legal Member and a Lieutenant Governor helping under the direct patronage of a Commander in Chief and a Viceroy one small and very dirty boy in a sailor s suit and a tangle of brown hair to coerce a lively and rebellious kid They headed it off down the path to the Mall and Tods went home in triumph and told his Mamma that ALL the Councillor Sahibs had been helping him to catch Moti Whereat his Mamma smacked Tods for interfering with the administration of the Empire but Tods met the Legal Member the next day and told him in confidence that if the Legal Member ever wanted to catch a goat he Tods would give him all the help in his power Thank you Tods said the Legal Member Tods was the idol of some eighty jhampanis and half as many saises He saluted them all as O Brother It never entered his head that any living human being could disobey his orders and he was the buffer between the servants and his Mamma s wrath The working of that household turned on Tods who was adored by every one from the dhoby to the dog boy Even Futteh Khan the villainous loafer khit from Mussoorie shirked risking Tods displeasure for fear his company mates should look down on him So Tods had honor in the land from Boileaugunge to Chota Simla and ruled justly according to his lights Of course he spoke Urdu but he had also mastered many queer side speeches like the chotee bolee of the women and held grave converse with shopkeepers and Hill coolies alike He was precocious for his age and his mixing with natives had taught him some of the more bitter truths of life the meanness and the sordidness of it He used over his bread and milk to deliver solemn and serious aphorisms translated from the vernacular into the English that made his Mamma jump and vow that Tods MUST go home next hot weather Just when Tods was in the bloom of his power the Supreme Legislature were hacking out a Bill for the Sub Montane Tracts a revision of the then Act smaller than the Punjab Land Bill but affecting a few hundred thousand people none the less The Legal Member had built and bolstered and embroidered and amended that Bill till it looked beautiful on paper Then the Council began to settle what they called the minor details As if any Englishman legislating for natives knows enough to know which are the minor and which are the major points from the native point of view of any measure That Bill was a triumph of safe guarding the interests of the tenant One clause provided that land should not be leased on longer terms than five years at a stretch because if the landlord had a tenant bound down for say twenty years he would squeeze the very life out of him The notion was to keep up a stream of independent cultivators in the Sub Montane Tracts and ethnologically and politically the notion was correct The only drawback was that it was altogether wrong A native s life in India implies the life of his son Wherefore you cannot legislate for one generation at a time You must consider the next from the native point of view Curiously enough the native now and then and in Northern India more particularly hates being over protected against himself There was a Naga village once where they lived on dead AND buried Commissariat mules But that is another story For many reasons to be explained later the people concerned objected to the Bill The Native Member in Council knew as much about Punjabis as he knew about Charing Cross He had said in Calcutta that the Bill was entirely in accord with the desires of that large and important class the cultivators and so on and so on The Legal Member s knowledge of natives was limited to English speaking Durbaris and his own red chaprassis the Sub Montane Tracts concerned no one in particular the Deputy Commissioners were a good deal too driven to make representations and the measure was one which dealt with small landholders only Nevertheless the Legal Member prayed that it might be correct for he was a nervously conscientious man He did not know that no man can tell what natives think unless he mixes with them with the varnish off And not always then But he did the best he knew And the measure came up to the Supreme Council for the final touches while Tods patrolled the Burra Simla Bazar in his morning rides and played with the monkey belonging to Ditta Mull the bunnia and listened as a child listens to all the stray talk about this new freak of the Lat Sahib s One day there was a dinner party at the house of Tods Mamma and the Legal Member came Tods was in bed but he kept awake till he heard the bursts of laughter from the men over the coffee Then he paddled out in his little red flannel dressing gown and his night suit and took refuge by the side of his father knowing that he would not be sent back See the miseries of having a family said Tods father giving Tods three prunes some water in a glass that had been used for claret and telling him to sit still Tods sucked the prunes slowly knowing that he would have to go when they were finished and sipped the pink water like a man of the world as he listened to the conversation Presently the Legal Member talking shop to the Head of a Department mentioned his Bill by its full name The Sub Montane Tracts Ryotwari Revised Enactment Tods caught the one native word and lifting up his small voice said Oh I know ALL about that Has it been murramutted yet Councillor Sahib How much said the Legal Member Murramutted mended Put theek you know made nice to please Ditta Mull The Legal Member left his place and moved up next to Tods What do you know about Ryotwari little man he said I m not a little man I m Tods and I know ALL about it Ditta Mull and Choga Lall and Amir Nath and oh lakhs of my friends tell me about it in the bazars when I talk to them Oh they do do they What do they say Tods Tods tucked his feet under his red flannel dressing gown and said I must fink The Legal Member waited patiently Then Tods with infinite compassion You don t speak my talk do you Councillor Sahib No I am sorry to say I do not said the Legal Member Very well said Tods I must fink in English He spent a minute putting his ideas in order and began very slowly translating in his mind from the vernacular to English as many Anglo Indian children do You must remember that the Legal Member helped him on by questions when he halted for Tods was not equal to the sustained flight of oratory that follows Ditta Mull says This thing is the talk of a child and was made up by fools But I don t think you are a fool Councillor Sahib said Todds hastily You caught my goat This is what Ditta Mull says I am not a fool and why should the Sirkar say I am a child I can see if the land is good and if the landlord is good If I am a fool the sin is upon my own head For five years I take my ground for which I have saved money and a wife I take too and a little son is born Ditta Mull has one daughter now but he SAYS he will have a son soon And he says At the end of five years by this new bundobust I must go If I do not go I must get fresh seals and takkus stamps on the papers perhaps in the middle of the harvest and to go to the law courts once is wisdom but to go twice is Jehannum That is QUITE true explained Tods gravely All my friends say so And Ditta Mull says Always fresh takkus and paying money to vakils and chaprassis and law courts every five years or else the landlord makes me go Why do I want to go Am I fool If I am a fool and do not know after forty years good land when I see it let me die But if the new bundobust says for FIFTEEN years then it is good and wise My little son is a man and I am burnt and he takes the ground or another ground paying only once for the takkus stamps on the papers and his little son is born and at the end of fifteen years is a man too But what profit is there in five years and fresh papers Nothing but dikh trouble dikh We are not young men who take these lands but old ones not jais but tradesmen with a little money and for fifteen years we shall have peace Nor are we children that the Sirkar should treat us so Here Tods stopped short for the whole table were listening The Legal Member said to Tods Is that all All I can remember said Tods But you should see Ditta Mull s big monkey It s just like a Councillor Sahib Tods Go to bed said his father Tods gathered up his dressing gown tail and departed The Legal Member brought his hand down on the table with a crash By Jove said the Legal Member I believe the boy is right The short tenure IS the weak point He left early thinking over what Tods had said Now it was obviously impossible for the Legal Member to play with a bunnia s monkey by way of getting understanding but he did better He made inquiries always bearing in mind the fact that the real native not the hybrid University trained mule is as timid as a colt and little by little he coaxed some of the men whom the measure concerned most intimately to give in their views which squared very closely with Tods evidence So the Bill was amended in that clause and the Legal Member was filled with an uneasy suspicion that Native Members represent very little except the Orders they carry on their bosoms But he put the thought from him as illiberal He was a most Liberal Man After a time the news spread through the bazars that Tods had got the Bill recast in the tenure clause and if Tods Mamma had not interfered Tods would have made himself sick on the baskets of fruit and pistachio nuts and Cabuli grapes and almonds that crowded the verandah Till he went Home Tods ranked some few degrees before the Viceroy in popular estimation But for the little life of him Tods could not understand why In the Legal Member s private paper box still lies the rough draft of the Sub Montane Tracts Ryotwari Revised Enactment and opposite the twenty second clause pencilled in blue chalk and signed by the Legal Member are the words Tods Amendment IN THE PRIDE OF HIS YOUTH Stopped in the straight when the race was his own Look at him cutting it cur to the bone Ask ere the youngster be rated and chidden What did he carry and how was he ridden Maybe they used him too much at the start Maybe Fate s weight cloths are breaking his heart Life s Handicap When I was telling you of the joke that The Worm played off on the Senior Subaltern I promised a somewhat similar tale but with all the jest left out This is that tale Dicky Hatt was kidnapped in his early early youth neither by landlady s daughter housemaid barmaid nor cook but by a girl so nearly of his own caste that only a woman could have said she was just the least little bit in the world below it This happened a month before he came out to India and five days after his one and twentieth birthday The girl was nineteen six years older than Dicky in the things of this world that is to say and for the time twice as foolish as he Excepting always falling off a horse there is nothing more fatally easy than marriage before the Registrar The ceremony costs less than fifty shillings and is remarkably like walking into a pawn shop After the declarations of residence have been put in four minutes will cover the rest of the proceedings fees attestation and all Then the Registrar slides the blotting pad over the names and says grimly with his pen between his teeth Now you re man and wife and the couple walk out into the street feeling as if something were horribly illegal somewhere But that ceremony holds and can drag a man to his undoing just as thoroughly as the long as ye both shall live curse from the altar rails with the bridesmaids giggling behind and The Voice that breathed o er Eden lifting the roof off In this manner was Dicky Hatt kidnapped and he considered it vastly fine for he had received an appointment in India which carried a magnificent salary from the Home point of view The marriage was to be kept secret for a year Then missus Dicky Hatt was to come out and the rest of life was to be a glorious golden mist That was how they sketched it under the Addison Road Station lamps and after one short month came Gravesend and Dicky steaming out to his new life and the girl crying in a thirty shillings a week bed and living room in a back street off Montpelier Square near the Knightsbridge Barracks But the country that Dicky came to was a hard land where men of twenty one were reckoned very small boys indeed and life was expensive The salary that loomed so large six thousand miles away did not go far Particularly when Dicky divided it by two and remitted more than the fair half at one six to Montpelier Square One hundred and thirty five rupees out of three hundred and thirty is not much to live on but it was absurd to suppose that missus Hatt could exist forever on the twenty pounds held back by Dicky from his outfit allowance Dicky saw this and remitted at once always remembering that Rs seven hundred were to be paid twelve months later for a first class passage out for a lady When you add to these trifling details the natural instincts of a boy beginning a new life in a new country and longing to go about and enjoy himself and the necessity for grappling with strange work which properly speaking should take up a boy s undivided attention you will see that Dicky started handicapped He saw it himself for a breath or two but he did not guess the full beauty of his future As the hot weather began the shackles settled on him and ate into his flesh First would come letters big crossed seven sheet letters from his wife telling him how she longed to see him and what a Heaven upon earth would be their property when they met Then some boy of the chummery wherein Dicky lodged would pound on the door of his bare little room and tell him to come out and look at a pony the very thing to suit him Dicky could not afford ponies He had to explain this Dicky could not afford living in the chummery modest as it was He had to explain this before he moved to a single room next the office where he worked all day He kept house on a green oil cloth table cover one chair one charpoy one photograph one tooth glass very strong and thick a seven rupee eight anna filter and messing by contract at thirty seven rupees a month Which last item was extortion He had no punkah for a punkah costs fifteen rupees a month but he slept on the roof of the office with all his wife s letters under his pillow Now and again he was asked out to dinner where he got both a punkah and an iced drink But this was seldom for people objected to recognizing a boy who had evidently the instincts of a Scotch tallow chandler and who lived in such a nasty fashion Dicky could not subscribe to any amusement so he found no amusement except the pleasure of turning over his Bank book and reading what it said about loans on approved security That cost nothing He remitted through a Bombay Bank by the way and the Station knew nothing of his private affairs Every month he sent Home all he could possibly spare for his wife and for another reason which was expected to explain itself shortly and would require more money About this time Dicky was overtaken with the nervous haunting fear that besets married men when they are out of sorts He had no pension to look to What if he should die suddenly and leave his wife unprovided for The thought used to lay hold of him in the still hot nights on the roof till the shaking of his heart made him think that he was going to die then and there of heart disease Now this is a frame of mind which no boy has a right to know It is a strong man s trouble but coming when it did it nearly drove poor punkah less perspiring Dicky Hatt mad He could tell no one about it A certain amount of screw is as necessary for a man as for a billiard ball It makes them both do wonderful things Dicky needed money badly and he worked for it like a horse But naturally the men who owned him knew that a boy can live very comfortably on a certain income pay in India is a matter of age not merit you see and if their particular boy wished to work like two boys Business forbid that they should stop him But Business forbid that they should give him an increase of pay at his present ridiculously immature age So Dicky won certain rises of salary ample for a boy not enough for a wife and child certainly too little for the seven hundred rupee passage that he and missus Hatt had discussed so lightly once upon a time And with this he was forced to be content Somehow all his money seemed to fade away in Home drafts and the crushing Exchange and the tone of the Home letters changed and grew querulous Why wouldn t Dicky have his wife and the baby out Surely he had a salary a fine salary and it was too bad of him to enjoy himself in India But would he could he make the next draft a little more elastic Here followed a list of baby s kit as long as a Parsee s bill Then Dicky whose heart yearned to his wife and the little son he had never seen which again is a feeling no boy is entitled to enlarged the draft and wrote queer half boy half man letters saying that life was not so enjoyable after all and would the little wife wait yet a little longer But the little wife however much she approved of money objected to waiting and there was a strange hard sort of ring in her letters that Dicky didn t understand How could he poor boy Later on still just as Dicky had been told apropos of another youngster who had made a fool of himself as the saying is that matrimony would not only ruin his further chances of advancement but would lose him his present appointment came the news that the baby his own little little son had died and behind this forty lines of an angry woman s scrawl saying that death might have been averted if certain things all costing money had been done or if the mother and the baby had been with Dicky The letter struck at Dicky s naked heart but not being officially entitled to a baby he could show no sign of trouble How Dicky won through the next four months and what hope he kept alight to force him into his work no one dare say He pounded on the seven hundred rupee passage as far away as ever and his style of living unchanged except when he launched into a new filter There was the strain of his office work and the strain of his remittances and the knowledge of his boy s death which touched the boy more perhaps than it would have touched a man and beyond all the enduring strain of his daily life Gray headed seniors who approved of his thrift and his fashion of denying himself everything pleasant reminded him of the old saw that says If a youth would be distinguished in his art art art He must keep the girls away from his heart heart heart And Dicky who fancied he had been through every trouble that a man is permitted to know had to laugh and agree with the last line of his balanced Bank book jingling in his head day and night But he had one more sorrow to digest before the end There arrived a letter from the little wife the natural sequence of the others if Dicky had only known it and the burden of that letter was gone with a handsomer man than you It was a rather curious production without stops something like this She was not going to wait forever and the baby was dead and Dicky was only a boy and he would never set eyes on her again and why hadn t he waved his handkerchief to her when he left Gravesend and God was her judge she was a wicked woman but Dicky was worse enjoying himself in India and this other man loved the ground she trod on and would Dicky ever forgive her for she would never forgive Dicky and there was no address to write to Instead of thanking his lucky stars that he was free Dicky discovered exactly how an injured husband feels again not at all the knowledge to which a boy is entitled for his mind went back to his wife as he remembered her in the thirty shilling suite in Montpelier Square when the dawn of his last morning in England was breaking and she was crying in the bed Whereat he rolled about on his bed and bit his fingers He never stopped to think whether if he had met missus Hatt after those two years he would have discovered that he and she had grown quite different and new persons This theoretically he ought to have done He spent the night after the English Mail came in rather severe pain Next morning Dicky Hatt felt disinclined to work He argued that he had missed the pleasure of youth He was tired and he had tasted all the sorrow in life before three and twenty His Honor was gone that was the man and now he too would go to the Devil that was the boy in him So he put his head down on the green oil cloth table cover and wept before resigning his post and all it offered But the reward of his services came He was given three days to reconsider himself and the Head of the establishment after some telegraphings said that it was a most unusual step but in view of the ability that mister Hatt had displayed at such and such a time at such and such junctures he was in a position to offer him an infinitely superior post first on probation and later in the natural course of things on confirmation And how much does the post carry said Dicky Six hundred and fifty rupees said the Head slowly expecting to see the young man sink with gratitude and joy And it came then The seven hundred rupee passage and enough to have saved the wife and the little son and to have allowed of assured and open marriage came then Dicky burst into a roar of laughter laughter he could not check nasty jangling merriment that seemed as if it would go on forever When he had recovered himself he said quite seriously I m tired of work I m an old man now It s about time I retired And I will The boy s mad said the Head I think he was right but Dicky Hatt never reappeared to settle the question PIG Go stalk the red deer o er the heather Ride follow the fox if you can But for pleasure and profit together Allow me the hunting of Man The chase of the Human the search for the Soul To its ruin the hunting of Man The Old Shikarri I believe the difference began in the matter of a horse with a twist in his temper whom Pinecoffin sold to Nafferton and by whom Nafferton was nearly slain There may have been other causes of offence the horse was the official stalking horse Nafferton was very angry but Pinecoffin laughed and said that he had never guaranteed the beast s manners Nafferton laughed too though he vowed that he would write off his fall against Pinecoffin if he waited five years Now a Dalesman from beyond Skipton will forgive an injury when the Strid lets a man live but a South Devon man is as soft as a Dartmoor bog You can see from their names that Nafferton had the race advantage of Pinecoffin He was a peculiar man and his notions of humor were cruel He taught me a new and fascinating form of shikar He hounded Pinecoffin from Mithankot to Jagadri and from Gurgaon to Abbottabad up and across the Punjab a large province and in places remarkably dry He said that he had no intention of allowing Assistant Commissioners to sell him pups in the shape of ramping screaming countrybreds without making their lives a burden to them Most Assistant Commissioners develop a bent for some special work after their first hot weather in the country The boys with digestions hope to write their names large on the Frontier and struggle for dreary places like Bannu and Kohat The bilious ones climb into the Secretariat Which is very bad for the liver Others are bitten with a mania for District work Ghuznivide coins or Persian poetry while some who come of farmers stock find that the smell of the Earth after the Rains gets into their blood and calls them to develop the resources of the Province These men are enthusiasts Pinecoffin belonged to their class He knew a great many facts bearing on the cost of bullocks and temporary wells and opium scrapers and what happens if you burn too much rubbish on a field in the hope of enriching used up soil All the Pinecoffins come of a landholding breed and so the land only took back her own again Unfortunately most unfortunately for Pinecoffin he was a Civilian as well as a farmer Nafferton watched him and thought about the horse Nafferton said See me chase that boy till he drops I said You can t get your knife into an Assistant Commissioner Nafferton told me that I did not understand the administration of the Province Our Government is rather peculiar It gushes on the agricultural and general information side and will supply a moderately respectable man with all sorts of economic statistics if he speaks to it prettily For instance you are interested in gold washing in the sands of the Sutlej You pull the string and find that it wakes up half a dozen Departments and finally communicates say with a friend of yours in the Telegraph who once wrote some notes on the customs of the gold washers when he was on construction work in their part of the Empire He may or may not be pleased at being ordered to write out everything he knows for your benefit This depends on his temperament The bigger man you are the more information and the greater trouble can you raise Nafferton was not a big man but he had the reputation of being very earnest An earnest man can do much with a Government There was an earnest man who once nearly wrecked but all India knows THAT story I am not sure what real earnestness is A very fair imitation can be manufactured by neglecting to dress decently by mooning about in a dreamy misty sort of way by taking office work home after staying in office till seven and by receiving crowds of native gentlemen on Sundays That is one sort of earnestness Nafferton cast about for a peg whereon to hang his earnestness and for a string that would communicate with Pinecoffin He found both They were Pig Nafferton became an earnest inquirer after Pig He informed the Government that he had a scheme whereby a very large percentage of the British Army in India could be fed at a very large saving on Pig Then he hinted that Pinecoffin might supply him with the varied information necessary to the proper inception of the scheme So the Government wrote on the back of the letter Instruct mister Pinecoffin to furnish mister Nafferton with any information in his power Government is very prone to writing things on the backs of letters which later lead to trouble and confusion Nafferton had not the faintest interest in Pig but he knew that Pinecoffin would flounce into the trap Pinecoffin was delighted at being consulted about Pig The Indian Pig is not exactly an important factor in agricultural life but Nafferton explained to Pinecoffin that there was room for improvement and corresponded direct with that young man You may think that there is not much to be evolved from Pig It all depends how you set to work Pinecoffin being a Civilian and wishing to do things thoroughly began with an essay on the Primitive Pig the Mythology of the Pig and the Dravidian Pig Nafferton filed that information twenty seven foolscap sheets and wanted to know about the distribution of the Pig in the Punjab and how it stood the Plains in the hot weather From this point onwards remember that I am giving you only the barest outlines of the affair the guy ropes as it were of the web that Nafferton spun round Pinecoffin Pinecoffin made a colored Pig population map and collected observations on the comparative longevity of the Pig a in the sub montane tracts of the Himalayas and b in the Rechna Doab Nafferton filed that and asked what sort of people looked after Pig This started an ethnological excursus on swineherds and drew from Pinecoffin long tables showing the proportion per thousand of the caste in the Derajat Nafferton filed that bundle and explained that the figures which he wanted referred to the Cis Sutlej states where he understood that Pigs were very fine and large and where he proposed to start a Piggery By this time Government had quite forgotten their instructions to mister Pinecoffin They were like the gentlemen in Keats poem who turned well oiled wheels to skin other people But Pinecoffin was just entering into the spirit of the Pig hunt as Nafferton well knew he would do He had a fair amount of work of his own to clear away but he sat up of nights reducing Pig to five places of decimals for the honor of his Service He was not going to appear ignorant of so easy a subject as Pig Then Government sent him on special duty to Kohat to inquire into the big seven foot iron shod spades of that District People had been killing each other with those peaceful tools and Government wished to know whether a modified form of agricultural implement could not tentatively and as a temporary measure be introduced among the agricultural population without needlessly or unduly exasperating the existing religious sentiments of the peasantry Between those spades and Nafferton s Pig Pinecoffin was rather heavily burdened Nafferton now began to take up a The food supply of the indigenous Pig with a view to the improvement of its capacities as a flesh former b The acclimatization of the exotic Pig maintaining its distinctive peculiarities Pinecoffin replied exhaustively that the exotic Pig would become merged in the indigenous type and quoted horse breeding statistics to prove this The side issue was debated at great length on Pinecoffin s side till Nafferton owned that he had been in the wrong and moved the previous question When Pinecoffin had quite written himself out about flesh formers and fibrins and glucose and the nitrogenous constituents of maize and lucerne Nafferton raised the question of expense By this time Pinecoffin who had been transferred from Kohat had developed a Pig theory of his own which he stated in thirty three folio pages all carefully filed by Nafferton Who asked for more These things took ten months and Pinecoffin s interest in the potential Piggery seemed to die down after he had stated his own views But Nafferton bombarded him with letters on the Imperial aspect of the scheme as tending to officialize the sale of pork and thereby calculated to give offence to the Mahomedan population of Upper India He guessed that Pinecoffin would want some broad free hand work after his niggling stippling decimal details Pinecoffin handled the latest development of the case in masterly style and proved that no popular ebullition of excitement was to be apprehended Nafferton said that there was nothing like Civilian insight in matters of this kind and lured him up a bye path the possible profits to accrue to the Government from the sale of hog bristles There is an extensive literature of hog bristles and the shoe brush and colorman s trades recognize more varieties of bristles than you would think possible After Pinecoffin had wondered a little at Nafferton s rage for information he sent back a monograph fifty one pages on Products of the Pig This led him under Nafferton s tender handling straight to the Cawnpore factories the trade in hog skin for saddles and thence to the tanners Pinecoffin wrote that pomegranate seed was the best cure for hog skin and suggested for the past fourteen months had wearied him that Nafferton should raise his pigs before he tanned them Nafferton went back to the second section of his fifth question How could the exotic Pig be brought to give as much pork as it did in the West and yet assume the essentially hirsute characteristics of its oriental congener Pinecoffin felt dazed for he had forgotten what he had written sixteen month s before and fancied that he was about to reopen the entire question He was too far involved in the hideous tangle to retreat and in a weak moment he wrote Consult my first letter Which related to the Dravidian Pig As a matter of fact Pinecoffin had still to reach the acclimatization stage having gone off on a side issue on the merging of types THEN Nafferton really unmasked his batteries He complained to the Government in stately language of the paucity of help accorded to me in my earnest attempts to start a potentially remunerative industry and the flippancy with which my requests for information are treated by a gentleman whose pseudo scholarly attainments should at lest have taught him the primary differences between the Dravidian and the Berkshire variety of the genus Sus If I am to understand that the letter to which he refers me contains his serious views on the acclimatization of a valuable though possibly uncleanly animal I am reluctantly compelled to believe et cetera et cetera There was a new man at the head of the Department of Castigation The wretched Pinecoffin was told that the Service was made for the Country and not the Country for the Service and that he had better begin to supply information about Pigs Pinecoffin answered insanely that he had written everything that could be written about Pig and that some furlough was due to him Nafferton got a copy of that letter and sent it with the essay on the Dravidian Pig to a down country paper which printed both in full The essay was rather highflown but if the Editor had seen the stacks of paper in Pinecoffin s handwriting on Nafferton s table he would not have been so sarcastic about the nebulous discursiveness and blatant self sufficiency of the modern Competition wallah and his utter inability to grasp the practical issues of a practical question Many friends cut out these remarks and sent them to Pinecoffin I have already stated that Pinecoffin came of a soft stock This last stroke frightened and shook him He could not understand it but he felt he had been somehow shamelessly betrayed by Nafferton He realized that he had wrapped himself up in the Pigskin without need and that he could not well set himself right with his Government All his acquaintances asked after his nebulous discursiveness or his blatant self sufficiency and this made him miserable He took a train and went to Nafferton whom he had not seen since the Pig business began He also took the cutting from the paper and blustered feebly and called Nafferton names and then died down to a watery weak protest of the I say it s too bad you know order Nafferton was very sympathetic I m afraid I ve given you a good deal of trouble haven t I said he Trouble whimpered Pinecoffin I don t mind the trouble so much though that was bad enough but what I resent is this showing up in print It will stick to me like a burr all through my service And I DID do my best for your interminable swine It s too bad of you on my soul it is I don t know said Nafferton have you ever been stuck with a horse It isn t the money I mind though that is bad enough but what I resent is the chaff that follows especially from the boy who stuck me But I think we ll cry quite now Pinecoffin found nothing to say save bad words and Nafferton smiled ever so sweetly and asked him to dinner THE ROUT OF THE WHITE HUSSARS It was not in the open fight We threw away the sword But in the lonely watching In the darkness by the ford The waters lapped the night wind blew Full armed the Fear was born and grew And we were flying ere we knew From panic in the night Beoni Bar Some people hold that an English Cavalry regiment cannot run This is a mistake I have seen four hundred and thirty seven sabres flying over the face of the country in abject terror have seen the best Regiment that ever drew bridle wiped off the Army List for the space of two hours If you repeat this tale to the White Hussars they will in all probability treat you severely They are not proud of the incident You may know the White Hussars by their side which is greater than that of all the Cavalry Regiments on the roster If this is not a sufficient mark you may know them by their old brandy It has been sixty years in the Mess and is worth going far to taste Ask for the McGaire old brandy and see that you get it If the Mess Sergeant thinks that you are uneducated and that the genuine article will be lost on you he will treat you accordingly He is a good man But when you are at Mess you must never talk to your hosts about forced marches or long distance rides The Mess are very sensitive and if they think that you are laughing at them will tell you so As the White Hussars say it was all the Colonel s fault He was a new man and he ought never to have taken the Command He said that the Regiment was not smart enough This to the White Hussars who knew they could walk round any Horse and through any Guns and over any Foot on the face of the earth That insult was the first cause of offence Then the Colonel cast the Drum Horse the Drum Horse of the White Hussars Perhaps you do not see what an unspeakable crime he had committed I will try to make it clear The soul of the Regiment lives in the Drum Horse who carries the silver kettle drums He is nearly always a big piebald Waler That is a point of honor and a Regiment will spend anything you please on a piebald He is beyond the ordinary laws of casting His work is very light and he only manoeuvres at a foot pace Wherefore so long as he can step out and look handsome his well being is assured He knows more about the Regiment than the Adjutant and could not make a mistake if he tried The Drum Horse of the White Hussars was only eighteen years old and perfectly equal to his duties He had at least six years more work in him and carried himself with all the pomp and dignity of a Drum Major of the Guards The Regiment had paid Rs twelve hundred for him But the Colonel said that he must go and he was cast in due form and replaced by a washy bay beast as ugly as a mule with a ewe neck rat tail and cow hocks The Drummer detested that animal and the best of the Band horses put back their ears and showed the whites of their eyes at the very sight of him They knew him for an upstart and no gentleman I fancy that the Colonel s ideas of smartness extended to the Band and that he wanted to make it take part in the regular parade movements A Cavalry Band is a sacred thing It only turns out for Commanding Officers parades and the Band Master is one degree more important than the Colonel He is a High Priest and the Keel Row is his holy song The Keel Row is the Cavalry Trot and the man who has never heard that tune rising high and shrill above the rattle of the Regiment going past the saluting base has something yet to hear and understand When the Colonel cast the Drum horse of the White Hussars there was nearly a mutiny The officers were angry the Regiment were furious and the Bandsman swore like troopers The Drum Horse was going to be put up to auction public auction to be bought perhaps by a Parsee and put into a cart It was worse than exposing the inner life of the Regiment to the whole world or selling the Mess Plate to a Jew a black Jew The Colonel was a mean man and a bully He knew what the Regiment thought about his action and when the troopers offered to buy the Drum Horse he said that their offer was mutinous and forbidden by the Regulations But one of the Subalterns Hogan Yale an Irishman bought the Drum Horse for Rs one hundred sixty at the sale and the Colonel was wroth Yale professed repentance he was unnaturally submissive and said that as he had only made the purchase to save the horse from possible ill treatment and starvation he would now shoot him and end the business This appeared to soothe the Colonel for he wanted the Drum Horse disposed of He felt that he had made a mistake and could not of course acknowledge it Meantime the presence of the Drum Horse was an annoyance to him Yale took to himself a glass of the old brandy three cheroots and his friend Martyn and they all left the Mess together Yale and Martyn conferred for two hours in Yale s quarters but only the bull terrier who keeps watch over Yale s boot trees knows what they said A horse hooded and sheeted to his ears left Yale s stables and was taken very unwillingly into the Civil Lines Yale s groom went with him Two men broke into the Regimental Theatre and took several paint pots and some large scenery brushes Then night fell over the Cantonments and there was a noise as of a horse kicking his loose box to pieces in Yale s stables Yale had a big old white Waler trap horse The next day was a Thursday and the men hearing that Yale was going to shoot the Drum Horse in the evening determined to give the beast a regular regimental funeral a finer one than they would have given the Colonel had he died just then They got a bullock cart and some sacking and mounds and mounds of roses and the body under sacking was carried out to the place where the anthrax cases were cremated two thirds of the Regiment followed There was no Band but they all sang The Place where the old Horse died as something respectful and appropriate to the occasion When the corpse was dumped into the grave and the men began throwing down armfuls of roses to cover it the Farrier Sergeant ripped out an oath and said aloud Why it ain t the Drum Horse any more than it s me The Troop Sergeant Majors asked him whether he had left his head in the Canteen The Farrier Sergeant said that he knew the Drum Horse s feet as well as he knew his own but he was silenced when he saw the regimental number burnt in on the poor stiff upturned near fore Thus was the Drum Horse of the White Hussars buried the Farrier Sergeant grumbling The sacking that covered the corpse was smeared in places with black paint and the Farrier Sergeant drew attention to this fact But the Troop Sergeant Major of E Troop kicked him severely on the shin and told him that he was undoubtedly drunk On the Monday following the burial the Colonel sought revenge on the White Hussars Unfortunately being at that time temporarily in Command of the Station he ordered a Brigade field day He said that he wished to make the regiment sweat for their damned insolence and he carried out his notion thoroughly That Monday was one of the hardest days in the memory of the White Hussars They were thrown against a skeleton enemy and pushed forward and withdrawn and dismounted and scientifically handled in every possible fashion over dusty country till they sweated profusely Their only amusement came late in the day when they fell upon the battery of Horse Artillery and chased it for two mile s This was a personal question and most of the troopers had money on the event the Gunners saying openly that they had the legs of the White Hussars They were wrong A march past concluded the campaign and when the Regiment got back to their Lines the men were coated with dirt from spur to chin strap The White Hussars have one great and peculiar privilege They won it at Fontenoy I think Many Regiments possess special rights such as wearing collars with undress uniform or a bow of ribbon between the shoulders or red and white roses in their helmets on certain days of the year Some rights are connected with regimental saints and some with regimental successes All are valued highly but none so highly as the right of the White Hussars to have the Band playing when their horses are being watered in the Lines Only one tune is played and that tune never varies I don t know its real name but the White Hussars call it Take me to London again It sound s very pretty The Regiment would sooner be struck off the roster than forego their distinction After the dismiss was sounded the officers rode off home to prepare for stables and the men filed into the lines riding easy That is to say they opened their tight buttons shifted their helmets and began to joke or to swear as the humor took them the more careful slipping off and easing girths and curbs A good trooper values his mount exactly as much as he values himself and believes or should believe that the two together are irresistible where women or men girl s or gun s are concerned Then the Orderly Officer gave the order Water horses and the Regiment loafed off to the squadron troughs which were in rear of the stables and between these and the barracks There were four huge troughs one for each squadron arranged en echelon so that the whole Regiment could water in ten minutes if it liked But it lingered for seventeen as a rule while the Band played The band struck up as the squadrons filed off the troughs and the men slipped their feet out of the stirrups and chaffed each other The sun was just setting in a big hot bed of red cloud and the road to the Civil Lines seemed to run straight into the sun s eye There was a little dot on the road It grew and grew till it showed as a horse with a sort of gridiron thing on his back The red cloud glared through the bars of the gridiron Some of the troopers shaded their eyes with their hands and said What the mischief as that there orse got on im In another minute they heard a neigh that every soul horse and man in the Regiment knew and saw heading straight towards the Band the dead Drum Horse of the White Hussars On his withers banged and bumped the kettle drums draped in crape and on his back very stiff and soldierly sat a bare headed skeleton The band stopped playing and for a moment there was a hush Then some one in E troop men said it was the Troop Sergeant Major swung his horse round and yelled No one can account exactly for what happened afterwards but it seems that at least one man in each troop set an example of panic and the rest followed like sheep The horses that had barely put their muzzles into the trough s reared and capered but as soon as the Band broke which it did when the ghost of the Drum Horse was about a furlong distant all hooves followed suit and the clatter of the stampede quite different from the orderly throb and roar of a movement on parade or the rough horse play of watering in camp made them only more terrified They felt that the men on their backs were afraid of something When horses once know THAT all is over except the butchery Troop after troop turned from the troughs and ran anywhere and everywhere like spit quicksilver It was a most extraordinary spectacle for men and horses were in all stages of easiness and the carbine buckets flopping against their sides urged the horses on Men were shouting and cursing and trying to pull clear of the Band which was being chased by the Drum Horse whose rider had fallen forward and seemed to be spurring for a wager The Colonel had gone over to the Mess for a drink Most of the officers were with him and the Subaltern of the Day was preparing to go down to the lines and receive the watering reports from the Troop Sergeant Majors When Take me to London again stopped after twenty bars every one in the Mess said What on earth has happened A minute later they heard unmilitary noises and saw far across the plain the White Hussars scattered and broken and flying The Colonel was speechless with rage for he thought that the Regiment had risen against him or was unanimously drunk The Band a disorganized mob tore past and at it s heels labored the Drum Horse the dead and buried Drum Horse with the jolting clattering skeleton Hogan Yale whispered softly to Martyn No wire will stand that treatment and the Band which had doubled like a hare came back again But the rest of the Regiment was gone was rioting all over the Province for the dusk had shut in and each man was howling to his neighbor that the Drum Horse was on his flank Troop Horses are far too tenderly treated as a rule They can on emergencies do a great deal even with seventeen stone on their backs As the troopers found out How long this panic lasted I cannot say I believe that when the moon rose the men saw they had nothing to fear and by twos and threes and half troops crept back into Cantonments very much ashamed of themselves Meantime the Drum Horse disgusted at his treatment by old friends pulled up wheeled round and trotted up to the Mess verandah steps for bread No one liked to run but no one cared to go forward till the Colonel made a movement and laid hold of the skeleton s foot The Band had halted some distance away and now came back slowly The Colonel called it individually and collectively every evil name that occurred to him at the time for he had set his hand on the bosom of the Drum Horse and found flesh and blood Then he beat the kettle drums with his clenched fist and discovered that they were but made of silvered paper and bamboo Next still swearing he tried to drag the skeleton out of the saddle but found that it had been wired into the cantle The sight of the Colonel with his arms round the skeleton s pelvis and his knee in the old Drum Horse s stomach was striking Not to say amusing He worried the thing off in a minute or two and threw it down on the ground saying to the Band Here you curs that s what you re afraid of The skeleton did not look pretty in the twilight The Band Sergeant seemed to recognize it for he began to chuckle and choke Shall I take it away sir said the Band Sergeant Yes said the Colonel take it to Hell and ride there yourselves The Band Sergeant saluted hoisted the skeleton across his saddle bow and led off to the stables Then the Colonel began to make inquiries for the rest of the Regiment and the language he used was wonderful He would disband the Regiment he would court martial every soul in it he would not command such a set of rabble and so on and so on As the men dropped in his language grew wilder until at last it exceeded the utmost limits of free speech allowed even to a Colonel of Horse Martyn took Hogan Yale aside and suggested compulsory retirement from the service as a necessity when all was discovered Martyn was the weaker man of the two Hogan Yale put up his eyebrows and remarked firstly that he was the son of a Lord and secondly that he was as innocent as the babe unborn of the theatrical resurrection of the Drum Horse My instructions said Yale with a singularly sweet smile were that the Drum Horse should be sent back as impressively as possible I ask you AM I responsible if a mule headed friend sends him back in such a manner as to disturb the peace of mind of a regiment of Her Majesty s Cavalry Martyn said you are a great man and will in time become a General but I d give my chance of a troop to be safe out of this affair Providence saved Martyn and Hogan Yale The Second in Command led the Colonel away to the little curtained alcove wherein the subalterns of the white Hussars were accustomed to play poker of nights and there after many oaths on the Colonel s part they talked together in low tones I fancy that the Second in Command must have represented the scare as the work of some trooper whom it would be hopeless to detect and I know that he dwelt upon the sin and the shame of making a public laughingstock of the scare They will call us said the Second in Command who had really a fine imagination they will call us the Fly by Nights they will call us the Ghost Hunters they will nickname us from one end of the Army list to the other All the explanations in the world won t make outsiders understand that the officers were away when the panic began For the honor of the Regiment and for your own sake keep this thing quiet The Colonel was so exhausted with anger that soothing him down was not so difficult as might be imagined He was made to see gently and by degrees that it was obviously impossible to court martial the whole Regiment and equally impossible to proceed against any subaltern who in his belief had any concern in the hoax But the beast s alive He s never been shot at all shouted the Colonel It s flat flagrant disobedience I ve known a man broke for less d d sight less They re mocking me I tell you Mutman They re mocking me Once more the Second in Command set himself to sooth the Colonel and wrestled with him for half an hour At the end of that time the Regimental Sergeant Major reported himself The situation was rather novel tell to him but he was not a man to be put out by circumstances He saluted and said Regiment all come back Sir Then to propitiate the Colonel An none of the horses any the worse Sir The Colonel only snorted and answered You d better tuck the men into their cots then and see that they don t wake up and cry in the night The Sergeant withdrew His little stroke of humor pleased the Colonel and further he felt slightly ashamed of the language he had been using The Second in Command worried him again and the two sat talking far into the night Next day but one there was a Commanding Officer s parade and the Colonel harangued the White Hussars vigorously The pith of his speech was that since the Drum Horse in his old age had proved himself capable of cutting up the Whole Regiment he should return to his post of pride at the head of the band BUT the Regiment were a set of ruffians with bad consciences The White Hussars shouted and threw everything movable about them into the air and when the parade was over they cheered the Colonel till they couldn t speak No cheers were put up for Lieutenant Hogan Yale who smiled very sweetly in the background Said the Second in Command to the Colonel unofficially These little things ensure popularity and do not the least affect discipline But I went back on my word said the Colonel Never mind said the Second in Command The White Hussars will follow you anywhere from to day Regiment s are just like women They will do anything for trinketry A week later Hogan Yale received an extraordinary letter from some one who signed himself Secretary Charity and Zeal three thousand seven hundred nine E C and asked for the return of our skeleton which we have reason to believe is in your possession Who the deuce is this lunatic who trades in bones said Hogan Yale Beg your pardon Sir said the Band Sergeant but the skeleton is with me an I ll return it if you ll pay the carriage into the Civil Lines There s a coffin with it Sir Hogan Yale smiled and handed two rupees to the Band Sergeant saying Write the date on the skull will you If you doubt this story and know where to go you can see the date on the skeleton But don t mention the matter to the White Hussars I happen to know something about it because I prepared the Drum Horse for his resurrection He did not take kindly to the skeleton at all THE BRONCKHORST DIVORCE CASE In the daytime when she moved about me In the night when she was sleeping at my side I was wearied I was wearied of her presence Day by day and night by night I grew to hate her Would to God that she or I had died Confessions There was a man called Bronckhorst a three cornered middle aged man in the Army gray as a badger and some people said with a touch of country blood in him That however cannot be proved missus Bronckhorst was not exactly young though fifteen years younger than her husband She was a large pale quiet woman with heavy eyelids over weak eyes and hair that turned red or yellow as the lights fell on it Bronckhorst was not nice in any way He had no respect for the pretty public and private lies that make life a little less nasty than it is His manner towards his wife was coarse There are many things including actual assault with the clenched fist that a wife will endure but seldom a wife can bear as missus Bronckhorst bore with a long course of brutal hard chaff making light of her weaknesses her headaches her small fits of gayety her dresses her queer little attempts to make herself attractive to her husband when she knows that she is not what she has been and worst of all the love that she spends on her children That particular sort of heavy handed jest was specially dear to Bronckhorst I suppose that he had first slipped into it meaning no harm in the honeymoon when folk find their ordinary stock of endearments run short and so go to the other extreme to express their feelings A similar impulse make s a man say Hutt you old beast when a favorite horse nuzzles his coat front Unluckily when the reaction of marriage sets in the form of speech remains and the tenderness having died out hurts the wife more than she cares to say But missus Bronckhorst was devoted to her teddy as she called him Perhaps that was why he objected to her Perhaps this is only a theory to account for his infamous behavior later on he gave way to the queer savage feeling that sometimes takes by the throat a husband twenty years married when he sees across the table the same face of his wedded wife and knows that as he has sat facing it so must he continue to sit until day of its death or his own Most men and all women know the spasm It only lasts for three breaths as a rule must be a throw back to times when men and women were rather worse than they are now and is too unpleasant to be discussed Dinner at the Bronckhorst s was an infliction few men cared to undergo Bronckhorst took a pleasure in saying things that made his wife wince When their little boy came in at dessert Bronckhorst used to give him half a glass of wine and naturally enough the poor little mite got first riotous next miserable and was removed screaming Bronckhorst asked if that was the way Teddy usually behaved and whether missus Bronckhorst could not spare some of her time to teach the little beggar decency missus Bronckhorst who loved the boy more than her own life tried not to cry her spirit seemed to have been broken by her marriage Lastly Bronckhorst used to say There That ll do that ll do For God s sake try to behave like a rational woman Go into the drawing room missus Bronckhorst would go trying to carry it all off with a smile and the guest of the evening would feel angry and uncomfortable After three years of this cheerful life for missus Bronckhorst had no woman friends to talk to the Station was startled by the news that Bronckhorst had instituted proceedings ON THE CRIMINAL COUNT against a man called Biel who certainly had been rather attentive to missus Bronckhorst whenever she had appeared in public The utter want of reserve with which Bronckhorst treated his own dishonor helped us to know that the evidence against Biel would be entirely circumstantial and native There were no letters but Bronckhorst said openly that he would rack Heaven and Earth until he saw Biel superintending the manufacture of carpets in the Central Jail missus Bronckhorst kept entirely to her house and let charitable folks say what they pleased Opinions were divided Some two thirds of the Station jumped at once to the conclusion that Biel was guilty but a dozen men who knew and liked him held by him Biel was furious and surprised He denied the whole thing and vowed that he would thrash Bronckhorst within an inch of his life No jury we knew could convict a man on the criminal count on native evidence in a land where you can buy a murder charge including the corpse all complete for fifty four rupees but Biel did not care to scrape through by the benefit of a doubt He wanted the whole thing cleared but as he said one night He can prove anything with servants evidence and I ve only my bare word This was about a month before the case came on and beyond agreeing with Biel we could do little All that we could be sure of was that the native evidence would be bad enough to blast Biel s character for the rest of his service for when a native begins perjury he perjures himself thoroughly He does not boggle over details Some genius at the end of the table whereat the affair was being talked over said Look here I don t believe lawyers are any good Get a man to wire to Strickland and beg him to come down and pull us through Strickland was about a hundred and eighty miles up the line He had not long been married to Miss Youghal but he scented in the telegram a chance of return to the old detective work that his soul lusted after and next night he came in and heard our story He finished his pipe and said oracularly we must get at the evidence Oorya bearer Mussalman khit and methraniayah I suppose are the pillars of the charge I am on in this piece but I m afraid I m getting rusty in my talk He rose and went into Biel s bedroom where his trunk had been put and shut the door An hour later we heard him say I hadn t the heart to part with my old makeups when I married Will this do There was a lothely faquir salaaming in the doorway Now lend me fifty rupees said Strickland and give me your Words of Honor that you won t tell my Wife He got all that he asked for and left the house while the table drank his health What he did only he himself knows A faquir hung about Bronckhorst s compound for twelve days Then a mehter appeared and when Biel heard of HIM he said that Strickland was an angel full fledged Whether the mehter made love to Janki missus Bronckhorst s ayah is a question which concerns Strickland exclusively He came back at the end of three weeks and said quietly You spoke the truth Biel The whole business is put up from beginning to end Jove It almost astonishes ME That Bronckhorst beast isn t fit to live There was uproar and shouting and Biel said How are you going to prove it You can t say that you ve been trespassing on Bronckhorst s compound in disguise No said Strickland Tell your lawyer fool whoever he is to get up something strong about inherent improbabilities and discrepancies of evidence He won t have to speak but it will make him happy I M going to run this business Biel held his tongue and the other men waited to see what would happen They trusted Strickland as men trust quiet men When the case came off the Court was crowded Strickland hung about in the verandah of the Court till he met the Mohammedan khitmatgar Then he murmured a faquir s blessing in his ear and asked him how his second wife did The man spun round and as he looked into the eyes of Estreeken Sahib his jaw dropped You must remember that before Strickland was married he was as I have told you already a power among natives Strickland whispered a rather coarse vernacular proverb to the effect that he was abreast of all that was going on and went into the Court armed with a gut trainer s whip The Mohammedan was the first witness and Strickland beamed upon him from the back of the Court The man moistened his lips with his tongue and in his abject fear of Estreeken Sahib the faquir went back on every detail of his evidence said he was a poor man and God was his witness that he had forgotten every thing that Bronckhorst Sahib had told him to say Between his terror of Strickland the Judge and Bronckhorst he collapsed weeping Then began the panic among the witnesses Janki the ayah leering chastely behind her veil turned gray and the bearer left the Court He said that his Mamma was dying and that it was not wholesome for any man to lie unthriftily in the presence of Estreeken Sahib Biel said politely to Bronckhorst Your witnesses don t seem to work Haven t you any forged letters to produce But Bronckhorst was swaying to and fro in his chair and there was a dead pause after Biel had been called to order Bronckhorst s Counsel saw the look on his client s face and without more ado pitched his papers on the little green baize table and mumbled something about having been misinformed The whole Court applauded wildly like soldiers at a theatre and the Judge began to say what he thought Biel came out of the place and Strickland dropped a gut trainer s whip in the verandah Ten minutes later Biel was cutting Bronckhorst into ribbons behind the old Court cells quietly and without scandal What was left of Bronckhorst was sent home in a carriage and his wife wept over it and nursed it into a man again Later on after Biel had managed to hush up the counter charge against Bronckhorst of fabricating false evidence missus Bronckhorst with her faint watery smile said that there had been a mistake but it wasn t her Teddy s fault altogether She would wait till her Teddy came back to her Perhaps he had grown tired of her or she had tried his patience and perhaps we wouldn t cut her any more and perhaps the mothers would let their children play with little Teddy again He was so lonely Then the Station invited missus Bronckhorst everywhere until Bronckhorst was fit to appear in public when he went Home and took his wife with him According to the latest advices her Teddy did come back to her and they are moderately happy Though of course he can never forgive her the thrashing that she was the indirect means of getting for him What Biel wants to know is Why didn t I press home the charge against the Bronckhorst brute and have him run in What missus Strickland wants to know is How DID my husband bring such a lovely lovely Waler from your Station I know ALL his money affairs and I m CERTAIN he didn t BUY it What I want to know is How do women like missus Bronckhorst come to marry men like Bronckhorst And my conundrum is the most unanswerable of the three VENUS ANNODOMINI And the years went on as the years must do But our great Diana was always new Fresh and blooming and blonde and fair With azure eyes and with aureate hair And all the folk as they came or went Offered her praise to her heart s content Diana of Ephesus She had nothing to do with Number Eighteen in the Braccio Nuovo of the Vatican between Visconti s Ceres and the God of the Nile She was purely an Indian deity an Anglo Indian deity that is to say and we called her THE Venus Annodomini to distinguish her from other Annodominis of the same everlasting order There was a legend among the Hills that she had once been young but no living man was prepared to come forward and say boldly that the legend was true Men rode up to Simla and stayed and went away and made their name and did their life s work and returned again to find the Venus Annodomini exactly as they had left her She was as immutable as the Hills But not quite so green All that a girl of eighteen could do in the way of riding walking dancing picnicking and over exertion generally the Venus Annodomini did and showed no sign of fatigue or trace of weariness Besides perpetual youth she had discovered men said the secret of perpetual health and her fame spread about the land From a mere woman she grew to be an Institution insomuch that no young man could be said to be properly formed who had not at some time or another worshipped at the shrine of the Venus Annodomini There was no one like her though there were many imitations Six years in her eyes were no more than six months to ordinary women and ten made less visible impression on her than does a week s fever on an ordinary woman Every one adored her and in return she was pleasant and courteous to nearly every one Youth had been a habit of hers for so long that she could not part with it never realized in fact the necessity of parting with it and took for her more chosen associates young people Among the worshippers of the Venus Annodomini was young Gayerson Very Young Gayerson he was called to distinguish him from his father Young Gayerson a Bengal Civilian who affected the customs as he had the heart of youth Very Young Gayerson was not content to worship placidly and for form s sake as the other young men did or to accept a ride or a dance or a talk from the Venus Annodomini in a properly humble and thankful spirit He was exacting and therefore the Venus Annodomini repressed him He worried himself nearly sick in a futile sort of way over her and his devotion and earnestness made him appear either shy or boisterous or rude as his mood might vary by the side of the older men who with him bowed before the Venus Annodomini She was sorry for him He reminded her of a lad who three and twenty years ago had professed a boundless devotion for her and for whom in return she had felt something more than a week s weakness But that lad had fallen away and married another woman less than a year after he had worshipped her and the Venus Annodomini had almost not quite forgotten his name Very Young Gayerson had the same big blue eyes and the same way of pouting his underlip when he was excited or troubled But the Venus Annodomini checked him sternly none the less Too much zeal was a thing that she did not approve of preferring instead a tempered and sober tenderness Very Young Gayerson was miserable and took no trouble to conceal his wretchedness He was in the Army a Line regiment I think but am not certain and since his face was a looking glass and his forehead an open book by reason of his innocence his brothers in arms made his life a burden to him and embittered his naturally sweet disposition No one except Very Young Gayerson and he never told his views knew how old Very Young Gayerson believed the Venus Annodomini to be Perhaps he thought her five and twenty or perhaps she told him that she was this age Very Young Gayerson would have forded the Gugger in flood to carry her lightest word and had implicit faith in her Every one liked him and every one was sorry when they saw him so bound a slave of the Venus Annodomini Every one too admitted that it was not her fault for the Venus Annodomini differed from missus Hauksbee and missus Reiver in this particular she never moved a finger to attract any one but like Ninon de l Enclos all men were attracted to her One could admire and respect missus Hauksbee despise and avoid missus Reiver but one was forced to adore the Venus Annodomini Very Young Gayerson s papa held a Division or a Collectorate or something administrative in a particularly unpleasant part of Bengal full of Babus who edited newspapers proving that Young Gayerson was a Nero and a Scylla and a Charybdis and in addition to the Babus there was a good deal of dysentery and cholera abroad for nine months of the year Young Gayerson he was about five and forty rather liked Babus they amused him but he objects to dysentery and when he could get away went to Darjilling for the most part This particular season he fancied that he would come up to Simla and see his boy The boy was not altogether pleased He told the Venus Annodomini that his father was coming up and she flushed a little and said that she should be delighted to make his acquaintance Then she looked long and thoughtfully at Very Young Gayerson because she was very very sorry for him and he was a very very big idiot My daughter is coming out in a fortnight mister Gayerson she said Your WHAT said he Daughter said the Venus Annodomini She s been out for a year at Home already and I want her to see a little of India She is nineteen and a very sensible nice girl I believe Very Young Gayerson who was a short twenty two years old nearly fell out of his chair with astonishment for he had persisted in believing against all belief in the youth of the Venus Annodomini She with her back to the curtained window watched the effect of her sentences and smiled Very Young Gayerson s papa came up twelve days later and had not been in Simla four and twenty hours before two men old acquaintances of his had told him how Very Young Gayerson had been conducting himself Young Gayerson laughed a good deal and inquired who the Venus Annodomini might be Which proves that he had been living in Bengal where nobody knows anything except the rate of Exchange Then he said boys will be boys and spoke to his son about the matter Very Young Gayerson said that he felt wretched and unhappy and Young Gayerson said that he repented of having helped to bring a fool into the world He suggested that his son had better cut his leave short and go down to his duties This led to an unfilial answer and relations were strained until Young Gayerson demmanded that they should call on the Venus Annodomini Very Young Gayerson went with his papa feeling somehow uncomfortable and small The Venus Annodomini received them graciously and Young Gayerson said By Jove It s Kitty Very Young Gayerson would have listened for an explanation if his time had not been taken up with trying to talk to a large handsome quiet well dressed girl introduced to him by the Venus Annodomini as her daughter She was far older in manners style and repose than Very Young Gayerson and as he realized this thing he felt sick Presently he heard the Venus Annodomini saying Do you know that your son is one of my most devoted admirers I don t wonder said Young Gayerson Here he raised his voice He follows his father s footsteps Didn t I worship the ground you trod on ever so long ago Kitty and you haven t changed since then How strange it all seems Very Young Gayerson said nothing His conversation with the daughter of the Venus Annodomini was through the rest of the call fragmentary and disjointed At five to morrow then said the Venus Annodomini And mind you are punctual At five punctual said Young Gayerson You can lend your old father a horse I dare say youngster can t you I m going for a ride tomorrow afternoon Certainly said Very Young Gayerson I am going down to morrow morning My ponies are at your service Sir The Venus Annodomini looked at him across the half light of the room and her big gray eyes filled with moisture She rose and shook hands with him Good bye Tom whispered the Venus Annodomini THE BISARA OF POOREE Little Blind Fish thou art marvellous wise Little Blind Fish who put out thy eyes Open thine ears while I whisper my wish Bring me a lover thou little Blind Fish The Charm of the Bisara Some natives say that it came from the other side of Kulu where the eleven inch Temple Sapphire is Others that it was made at the Devil Shrine of Ao Chung in Thibet was stolen by a Kafir from him by a Gurkha from him again by a Lahouli from him by a khitmatgar and by this latter sold to an Englishman so all its virtue was lost because to work properly the Bisara of Pooree must be stolen with bloodshed if possible but at any rate stolen These stories of the coming into India are all false It was made at Pooree ages since the manner of its making would fill a small book was stolen by one of the Temple dancing girls there for her own purposes and then passed on from hand to hand steadily northward till it reached Hanla always bearing the same name the Bisara of Pooree In shape it is a tiny square box of silver studded outside with eight small balas rubies Inside the box which opens with a spring is a little eyeless fish carved from some sort of dark shiny nut and wrapped in a shred of faded gold cloth That is the Bisara of Pooree and it were better for a man to take a king cobra in his hand than to touch the Bisara of Pooree All kinds of magic are out of date and done away with except in India where nothing changes in spite of the shiny toy scum stuff that people call civilization Any man who knows about the Bisara of Pooree will tell you what its powers are always supposing that it has been honestly stolen It is the only regularly working trustworthy love charm in the country with one exception The other charm is in the hands of a trooper of the Nizam s Horse at a place called Tuprani due north of Hyderabad This can be depended upon for a fact Some one else may explain it If the Bisara be not stolen but given or bought or found it turns against its owner in three years and leads to ruin or death This is another fact which you may explain when you have time Meanwhile you can laugh at it At present the Bisara is safe on an ekka pony s neck inside the blue bead necklace that keeps off the Evil eye If the ekka driver ever finds it and wears it or gives it to his wife I am sorry for him A very dirty hill cooly woman with goitre owned it at Theog in eighteen eighty four It came into Simla from the north before Churton s khitmatgar bought it and sold it for three times its silver value to Churton who collected curiosities The servant knew no more what he had bought than the master but a man looking over Churton s collection of curiosities Churton was an Assistant Commissioner by the way saw and held his tongue He was an Englishman but knew how to believe Which shows that he was different from most Englishmen He knew that it was dangerous to have any share in the little box when working or dormant for unsought Love is a terrible gift Pack Grubby Pack as we used to call him was in every way a nasty little man who must have crawled into the Army by mistake He was three inches taller than his sword but not half so strong And the sword was a fifty shilling tailor made one Nobody liked him and I suppose it was his wizenedness and worthlessness that made him fall so hopelessly in love with Miss Hollis who was good and sweet and five foot seven in her tennis shoes He was not content with falling in love quietly but brought all the strength of his miserable little nature into the business If he had not been so objectionable one might have pitied him He vapored and fretted and fumed and trotted up and down and tried to make himself pleasing in Miss Hollis s big quiet gray eyes and failed It was one of the cases that you sometimes meet even in this country where we marry by Code of a really blind attachment all on one side without the faintest possibility of return Miss Hollis looked on Pack as some sort of vermin running about the road He had no prospects beyond Captain s pay and no wits to help that out by one anna In a large sized man love like his would have been touching In a good man it would have been grand He being what he was it was only a nuisance You will believe this much What you will not believe is what follows Churton and The Man who Knew that the Bisara was were lunching at the Simla Club together Churton was complaining of life in general His best mare had rolled out of stable down the hill and had broken her back his decisions were being reversed by the upper Courts more than an Assistant Commissioner of eight years standing has a right to expect he knew liver and fever and for weeks past had felt out of sorts Altogether he was disgusted and disheartened Simla Club dining room is built as all the world knows in two sections with an arch arrangement dividing them Come in turn to your own left take the table under the window and you cannot see any one who has come in turning to the right and taken a table on the right side of the arch Curiously enough every word that you say can be heard not only by the other diner but by the servants beyond the screen through which they bring dinner This is worth knowing an echoing room is a trap to be forewarned against Half in fun and half hoping to be believed The Man who Knew told Churton the story of the Bisara of Pooree at rather greater length than I have told it to you in this place winding up with the suggestion that Churton might as well throw the little box down the hill and see whether all his troubles would go with it In ordinary ears English ears the tale was only an interesting bit of folk lore Churton laughed said that he felt better for his tiffin and went out Pack had been tiffining by himself to the right of the arch and had heard everything He was nearly mad with his absurd infatuation for Miss Hollis that all Simla had been laughing about It is a curious thing that when a man hates or loves beyond reason he is ready to go beyond reason to gratify his feelings Which he would not do for money or power merely Depend upon it Solomon would never have built altars to Ashtaroth and all those ladies with queer names if there had not been trouble of some kind in his zenana and nowhere else But this is beside the story The facts of the case are these Pack called on Churton next day when Churton was out left his card and STOLE the Bisara of Pooree from its place under the clock on the mantelpiece Stole it like the thief he was by nature Three days later all Simla was electrified by the news that Miss Hollis had accepted Pack the shrivelled rat Pack Do you desire clearer evidence than this The Bisara of Pooree had been stolen and it worked as it had always done when won by foul means There are three or four times in a man s life when he is justified in meddling with other people s affairs to play Providence The Man who Knew felt that he WAS justified but believing and acting on a belief are quite different things The insolent satisfaction of Pack as he ambled by the side of Miss Hollis and Churton s striking release from liver as soon as the Bisara of Pooree had gone decided the Man He explained to Churton and Churton laughed because he was not brought up to believe that men on the Government House List steal at least little things But the miraculous acceptance by Miss Hollis of that tailor Pack decided him to take steps on suspicion He vowed that he only wanted to find out where his ruby studded silver box had vanished to You cannot accuse a man on the Government House List of stealing And if you rifle his room you are a thief yourself Churton prompted by The Man who Knew decided on burglary If he found nothing in Pack s room but it is not nice to think of what would have happened in that case Pack went to a dance at Benmore Benmore WAS Benmore in those days and not an office and danced fifteen waltzes out of twenty two with Miss Hollis Churton and The Man took all the keys that they could lay hands on and went to Pack s room in the hotel certain that his servants would be away Pack was a cheap soul He had not purchased a decent cash box to keep his papers in but one of those native imitations that you buy for ten rupees It opened to any sort of key and there at the bottom under Pack s Insurance Policy lay the Bisara of Pooree Churton called Pack names put the Bisara of Pooree in his pocket and went to the dance with The Man At least he came in time for supper and saw the beginning of the end in Miss Hollis s eyes She was hysterical after supper and was taken away by her Mamma At the dance with the abominable Bisara in his pocket Churton twisted his foot on one of the steps leading down to the old Rink and had to be sent home in a rickshaw grumbling He did not believe in the Bisara of Pooree any the more for this manifestation but he sought out Pack and called him some ugly names and thief was the mildest of them Pack took the names with the nervous smile of a little man who wants both soul and body to resent an insult and went his way There was no public scandal A week later Pack got his definite dismissal from Miss Hollis There had been a mistake in the placing of her affections she said So he went away to Madras where he can do no great harm even if he lives to be a Colonel Churton insisted upon The Man who Knew taking the Bisara of Pooree as a gift The Man took it went down to the Cart Road at once found an ekka pony with a blue head necklace fastened the Bisara of Pooree inside the necklace with a piece of shoe string and thanked Heaven that he was rid of a danger Remember in case you ever find it that you must not destroy the Bisara of Pooree I have not time to explain why just now but the power lies in the little wooden fish Mister Gubernatis or Max Muller could tell you more about it than I You will say that all this story is made up Very well If ever you come across a little silver ruby studded box seven eighths of an inch long by three quarters wide with a dark brown wooden fish wrapped in gold cloth inside it keep it Keep it for three years and then you will discover for yourself whether my story is true or false Better still steal it as Pack did and you will be sorry that you had not killed yourself in the beginning THE GATE OF A HUNDRED SORROWS If I can attain Heaven for a pice why should you be envious Opium Smoker s Proverb This is no work of mine My friend Gabral Misquitta the half caste spoke it all between moonset and morning six weeks before he died and I took it down from his mouth as he answered my questions so It lies between the Copper smith s Gully and the pipe stem sellers quarter within a hundred yards too as the crow flies of the Mosque of Wazir Khan I don t mind telling any one this much but I defy him to find the Gate however well he may think he knows the City You might even go through the very gully it stands in a hundred times and be none the wiser We used to call the gully the Gully of the Black Smoke but its native name is altogether different of course A loaded donkey couldn t pass between the walls and at one point just before you reach the Gate a bulged house front makes people go along all sideways It isn t really a gate though It s a house Old Fung Tching had it first five years ago He was a boot maker in Calcutta They say that he murdered his wife there when he was drunk That was why he dropped bazar rum and took to the Black Smoke instead Later on he came up north and opened the Gate as a house where you could get your smoke in peace and quiet Mind you it was a pukka respectable opium house and not one of those stifling sweltering chandoo khanas that you can find all over the City No the old man knew his business thoroughly and he was most clean for a Chinaman He was a one eyed little chap not much more than five feet high and both his middle fingers were gone All the same he was the handiest man at rolling black pills I have ever seen Never seemed to be touched by the Smoke either and what he took day and night night and day was a caution I ve been at it five years and I can do my fair share of the Smoke with any one but I was a child to Fung Tching that way All the same the old man was keen on his money very keen and that s what I can t understand I heard he saved a good deal before he died but his nephew has got all that now and the old man s gone back to China to be buried He kept the big upper room where his best customers gathered as neat as a new pin In one corner used to stand Fung Tching s Joss almost as ugly as Fung Tching and there were always sticks burning under his nose but you never smelt em when the pipes were going thick Opposite the Joss was Fung Tching s coffin He had spent a good deal of his savings on that and whenever a new man came to the Gate he was always introduced to it It was lacquered black with red and gold writings on it and I ve heard that Fung Tching brought it out all the way from China I don t know whether that s true or not but I know that if I came first in the evening I used to spread my mat just at the foot of it It was a quiet corner you see and a sort of breeze from the gully came in at the window now and then Besides the mats there was no other furniture in the room only the coffin and the old Joss all green and blue and purple with age and polish Fung Tching never told us why he called the place The Gate of a Hundred Sorrows He was the only Chinaman I know who used bad sounding fancy names Most of them are flowery As you ll see in Calcutta We used to find that out for ourselves Nothing grows on you so much if you re white as the Black Smoke A yellow man is made different Opium doesn t tell on him scarcely at all but white and black suffer a good deal Of course there are some people that the Smoke doesn t touch any more than tobacco would at first They just doze a bit as one would fall asleep naturally and next morning they are almost fit for work Now I was one of that sort when I began but I ve been at it for five years pretty steadily and its different now There was an old aunt of mine down Agra way and she left me a little at her death About sixty rupees a month secured Sixty isn t much I can recollect a time seems hundreds and hundreds of years ago that I was getting my three hundred a month and pickings when I was working on a big timber contract in Calcutta I didn t stick to that work for long The Black Smoke does not allow of much other business and even though I am very little affected by it as men go I couldn t do a day s work now to save my life After all sixty rupees is what I want When old Fung Tching was alive he used to draw the money for me give me about half of it to live on I eat very little and the rest he kept himself I was free of the Gate at any time of the day and night and could smoke and sleep there when I liked so I didn t care I know the old man made a good thing out of it but that s no matter Nothing matters much to me and besides the money always came fresh and fresh each month There was ten of us met at the Gate when the place was first opened Me and two Baboos from a Government Office somewhere in Anarkulli but they got the sack and couldn t pay no man who has to work in the daylight can do the Black Smoke for any length of time straight on a Chinaman that was Fung Tching s nephew a bazar woman that had got a lot of money somehow an English loafer Mac Somebody I think but I have forgotten that smoked heaps but never seemed to pay anything they said he had saved Fung Tching s life at some trial in Calcutta when he was a barrister another Eurasian like myself from Madras a half caste woman and a couple of men who said they had come from the North I think they must have been Persians or Afghans or something There are not more than five of us living now but we come regular I don t know what happened to the Baboos but the bazar woman she died after six months of the Gate and I think Fung Tching took her bangles and nose ring for himself But I m not certain The Englishman he drank as well as smoked and he dropped off One of the Persians got killed in a row at night by the big well near the mosque a long time ago and the Police shut up the well because they said it was full of foul air They found him dead at the bottom of it So you see there is only me the Chinaman the half caste woman that we call the Memsahib she used to live with Fung Tching the other Eurasian and one of the Persians The Memsahib looks very old now I think she was a young woman when the Gate was opened but we are all old for the matter of that Hundreds and hundreds of years old It is very hard to keep count of time in the Gate and besides time doesn t matter to me I draw my sixty rupees fresh and fresh every month A very very long while ago when I used to be getting three hundred and fifty rupees a month and pickings on a big timber contract at Calcutta I had a wife of sorts But she s dead now People said that I killed her by taking to the Black Smoke Perhaps I did but it s so long since it doesn t matter Sometimes when I first came to the Gate I used to feel sorry for it but that s all over and done with long ago and I draw my sixty rupees fresh and fresh every month and am quite happy Not DRUNK happy you know but always quiet and soothed and contented How did I take to it It began at Calcutta I used to try it in my own house just to see what it was like I never went very far but I think my wife must have died then Anyhow I found myself here and got to know Fung Tching I don t remember rightly how that came about but he told me of the Gate and I used to go there and somehow I have never got away from it since Mind you though the Gate was a respectable place in Fung Tching s time where you could be comfortable and not at all like the chandoo khanas where the niggers go No it was clean and quiet and not crowded Of course there were others beside us ten and the man but we always had a mat apiece with a wadded woollen head piece all covered with black and red dragons and things just like a coffin in the corner At the end of one s third pipe the dragons used to move about and fight I ve watched em many and many a night through I used to regulate my Smoke that way and now it takes a dozen pipes to make em stir Besides they are all torn and dirty like the mats and old Fung Tching is dead He died a couple of years ago and gave me the pipe I always use now a silver one with queer beasts crawling up and down the receiver bottle below the cup Before that I think I used a big bamboo stem with a copper cup a very small one and a green jade mouthpiece It was a little thicker than a walking stick stem and smoked sweet very sweet The bamboo seemed to suck up the smoke Silver doesn t and I ve got to clean it out now and then that s a great deal of trouble but I smoke it for the old man s sake He must have made a good thing out of me but he always gave me clean mats and pillows and the best stuff you could get anywhere When he died his nephew Tsin ling took up the Gate and he called it the Temple of the Three Possessions but we old ones speak of it as the Hundred Sorrows all the same The nephew does things very shabbily and I think the Memsahib must help him She lives with him same as she used to do with the old man The two let in all sorts of low people niggers and all and the Black Smoke isn t as good as it used to be I ve found burnt bran in my pipe over and over again The old man would have died if that had happened in his time Besides the room is never cleaned and all the mats are torn and cut at the edges The coffin has gone gone to China again with the old man and two ounces of smoke inside it in case he should want em on the way The Joss doesn t get so many sticks burnt under his nose as he used to that s a sign of ill luck as sure as Death He s all brown too and no one ever attends to him That s the Memsahib s work I know because when Tsin ling tried to burn gilt paper before him she said it was a waste of money and if he kept a stick burning very slowly the Joss wouldn t know the difference So now we ve got the sticks mixed with a lot of glue and they take half an hour longer to burn and smell stinky Let alone the smell of the room by itself No business can get on if they try that sort of thing The Joss doesn t like it I can see that Late at night sometimes he turns all sorts of queer colors blue and green and red just as he used to do when old Fung Tching was alive and he rolls his eyes and stamps his feet like a devil I don t know why I don t leave the place and smoke quietly in a little room of my own in the bazar Most like Tsin ling would kill me if I went away he draws my sixty rupees now and besides it s so much trouble and I ve grown to be very fond of the Gate It s not much to look at Not what it was in the old man s time but I couldn t leave it I ve seen so many come in and out And I ve seen so many die here on the mats that I should be afraid of dying in the open now I ve seen some things that people would call strange enough but nothing is strange when you re on the Black Smoke except the Black Smoke And if it was it wouldn t matter Fung Tching used to be very particular about his people and never got in any one who d give trouble by dying messy and such But the nephew isn t half so careful He tells everywhere that he keeps a first chop house Never tries to get men in quietly and make them comfortable like Fung Tching did That s why the Gate is getting a little bit more known than it used to be Among the niggers of course The nephew daren t get a white or for matter of that a mixed skin into the place He has to keep us three of course me and the Memsahib and the other Eurasian We re fixtures But he wouldn t give us credit for a pipeful not for anything One of these days I hope I shall die in the Gate The Persian and the Madras man are terrible shaky now They ve got a boy to light their pipes for them I always do that myself Most like I shall see them carried out before me I don t think I shall ever outlive the Memsahib or Tsin ling Women last longer than men at the Black Smoke and Tsin ling has a deal of the old man s blood in him though he DOES smoke cheap stuff The bazar woman knew when she was going two days before her time and SHE died on a clean mat with a nicely wadded pillow and the old man hung up her pipe just above the Joss He was always fond of her I fancy But he took her bangles just the same I should like to die like the bazar woman on a clean cool mat with a pipe of good stuff between my lips When I feel I m going I shall ask Tsin ling for them and he can draw my sixty rupees a month fresh and fresh as long as he pleases and watch the black and red dragons have their last big fight together and then Well it doesn t matter Nothing matters much to me only I wished Tsin ling wouldn t put bran into the Black Smoke THE STORY OF MUHAMMAD DIN Who is the happy man He that sees in his own house at home little children crowned with dust leaping and falling and crying Munichandra translated by Professor Peterson The polo ball was an old one scarred chipped and dinted It stood on the mantelpiece among the pipe stems which Imam Din khitmatgar was cleaning for me Does the Heaven born want this ball said Imam Din deferentially The Heaven born set no particular store by it but of what use was a polo ball to a khitmatgar By Your Honor s favor I have a little son He has seen this ball and desires it to play with I do not want it for myself No one would for an instant accuse portly old Imam Din of wanting to play with polo balls He carried out the battered thing into the verandah and there followed a hurricane of joyful squeaks a patter of small feet and the thud thud thud of the ball rolling along the ground Evidently the little son had been waiting outside the door to secure his treasure But how had he managed to see that polo ball Next day coming back from office half an hour earlier than usual I was aware of a small figure in the dining room a tiny plump figure in a ridiculously inadequate shirt which came perhaps half way down the tubby stomach It wandered round the room thumb in mouth crooning to itself as it took stock of the pictures Undoubtedly this was the little son He had no business in my room of course but was so deeply absorbed in his discoveries that he never noticed me in the doorway I stepped into the room and startled him nearly into a fit He sat down on the ground with a gasp His eyes opened and his mouth followed suit I knew what was coming and fled followed by a long dry howl which reached the servants quarters far more quickly than any command of mine had ever done In ten seconds Imam Din was in the dining room Then despairing sobs arose and I returned to find Imam Din admonishing the small sinner who was using most of his shirt as a handkerchief This boy said Imam Din judicially is a budmash a big budmash He will without doubt go to the jail khana for his behavior Renewed yells from the penitent and an elaborate apology to myself from Imam Din Tell the baby said I that the Sahib is not angry and take him away Imam Din conveyed my forgiveness to the offender who had now gathered all his shirt round his neck string wise and the yell subsided into a sob The two set off for the door His name said Imam Din as though the name were part of the crime is Muhammad Din and he is a budmash Freed from present danger Muhammad Din turned round in his father s arms and said gravely It is true that my name is Muhammad Din Tahib but I am not a budmash I am a MAN From that day dated my acquaintance with Muhammad Din Never again did he come into my dining room but on the neutral ground of the compound we greeted each other with much state though our conversation was confined to Talaam Tahib from his side and Salaam Muhammad Din from mine Daily on my return from office the little white shirt and the fat little body used to rise from the shade of the creeper covered trellis where they had been hid and daily I checked my horse here that my salutation might not be slurred over or given unseemly Muhammad Din never had any companions He used to trot about the compound in and out of the castor oil bushes on mysterious errands of his own One day I stumbled upon some of his handiwork far down the ground He had half buried the polo ball in dust and stuck six shrivelled old marigold flowers in a circle round it Outside that circle again was a rude square traced out in bits of red brick alternating with fragments of broken china the whole bounded by a little bank of dust The bhistie from the well curb put in a plea for the small architect saying that it was only the play of a baby and did not much disfigure my garden Heaven knows that I had no intention of touching the child s work then or later but that evening a stroll through the garden brought me unawares full on it so that I trampled before I knew marigold heads dust bank and fragments of broken soap dish into confusion past all hope of mending Next morning I came upon Muhammad Din crying softly to himself over the ruin I had wrought Some one had cruelly told him that the Sahib was very angry with him for spoiling the garden and had scattered his rubbish using bad language the while Muhammad Din labored for an hour at effacing every trace of the dust bank and pottery fragments and it was with a tearful apologetic face that he said Talaam Tahib when I came home from the office A hasty inquiry resulted in Imam Din informing Muhammad Din that by my singular favor he was permitted to disport himself as he pleased Whereat the child took heart and fell to tracing the ground plan of an edifice which was to eclipse the marigold polo ball creation For some months the chubby little eccentricity revolved in his humble orbit among the castor oil bushes and in the dust always fashioning magnificent palaces from stale flowers thrown away by the bearer smooth water worn pebbles bits of broken glass and feathers pulled I fancy from my fowls always alone and always crooning to himself A gayly spotted sea shell was dropped one day close to the last of his little buildings and I looked that Muhammad Din should build something more than ordinarily splendid on the strength of it Nor was I disappointed He meditated for the better part of an hour and his crooning rose to a jubilant song Then he began tracing in dust It would certainly be a wondrous palace this one for it was two yards long and a yard broad in ground plan But the palace was never completed Next day there was no Muhammad Din at the head of the carriage drive and no Talaam Tahib to welcome my return I had grown accustomed to the greeting and its omission troubled me Next day Imam Din told me that the child was suffering slightly from fever and needed quinine He got the medicine and an English Doctor They have no stamina these brats said the Doctor as he left Imam Din s quarters A week later though I would have given much to have avoided it I met on the road to the Mussulman burying ground Imam Din accompanied by one other friend carrying in his arms wrapped in a white cloth all that was left of little Muhammad Din ON THE STRENGTH OF A LIKENESS If your mirror be broken look into still water but have a care that you do not fall in Hindu Proverb Next to a requited attachment one of the most convenient things that a young man can carry about with him at the beginning of his career is an unrequited attachment It makes him feel important and business like and blase and cynical and whenever he has a touch of liver or suffers from want of exercise he can mourn over his lost love and be very happy in a tender twilight fashion Hannasyde s affair of the heart had been a Godsend to him It was four years old and the girl had long since given up thinking of it She had married and had many cares of her own In the beginning she had told Hannasyde that while she could never be anything more than a sister to him she would always take the deepest interest in his welfare This startlingly new and original remark gave Hannasyde something to think over for two years and his own vanity filled in the other twenty four months Hannasyde was quite different from Phil Garron but none the less had several points in common with that far too lucky man He kept his unrequited attachment by him as men keep a well smoked pipe for comfort s sake and because it had grown dear in the using It brought him happily through the Simla season Hannasyde was not lovely There was a crudity in his manners and a roughness in the way in which he helped a lady on to her horse that did not attract the other sex to him Even if he had cast about for their favor which he did not He kept his wounded heart all to himself for a while Then trouble came to him All who go to Simla know the slope from the Telegraph to the Public Works Office Hannasyde was loafing up the hill one September morning between calling hours when a rickshaw came down in a hurry and in the rickshaw sat the living breathing image of the girl who had made him so happily unhappy Hannasyde leaned against the railing and gasped He wanted to run downhill after the rickshaw but that was impossible so he went forward with most of his blood in his temples It was impossible for many reasons that the woman in the rickshaw could be the girl he had known She was he discovered later the wife of a man from Dindigul or Coimbatore or some out of the way place and she had come up to Simla early in the season for the good of her health She was going back to Dindigul or wherever it was at the end of the season and in all likelihood would never return to Simla again her proper Hill station being Ootacamund That night Hannasyde raw and savage from the raking up of all old feelings took counsel with himself for one measured hour What he decided upon was this and you must decide for yourself how much genuine affection for the old love and how much a very natural inclination to go abroad and enjoy himself affected the decision missus Landys Haggert would never in all human likelihood cross his path again So whatever he did didn t much matter She was marvellously like the girl who took a deep interest and the rest of the formula All things considered it would be pleasant to make the acquaintance of missus Landys Haggert and for a little time only a very little time to make believe that he was with Alice Chisane again Every one is more or less mad on one point Hannasyde s particular monomania was his old love Alice Chisane He made it his business to get introduced to missus Haggert and the introduction prospered He also made it his business to see as much as he could of that lady When a man is in earnest as to interviews the facilities which Simla offers are startling There are garden parties and tennis parties and picnics and luncheons at Annandale and rifle matches and dinners and balls besides rides and walks which are matters of private arrangement Hannasyde had started with the intention of seeing a likeness and he ended by doing much more He wanted to be deceived he meant to be deceived and he deceived himself very thoroughly Not only were the face and figure the face and figure of Alice Chisane but the voice and lower tones were exactly the same and so were the turns of speech and the little mannerisms that every woman has of gait and gesticulation were absolutely and identically the same The turn of the head was the same the tired look in the eyes at the end of a long walk was the same the sloop and wrench over the saddle to hold in a pulling horse was the same and once most marvellous of all missus Landys Haggert singing to herself in the next room while Hannasyde was waiting to take her for a ride hummed note for note with a throaty quiver of the voice in the second line Poor Wandering One exactly as Alice Chisane had hummed it for Hannasyde in the dusk of an English drawing room In the actual woman herself in the soul of her there was not the least likeness she and Alice Chisane being cast in different moulds But all that Hannasyde wanted to know and see and think about was this maddening and perplexing likeness of face and voice and manner He was bent on making a fool of himself that way and he was in no sort disappointed Open and obvious devotion from any sort of man is always pleasant to any sort of woman but missus Landys Haggert being a woman of the world could make nothing of Hannasyde s admiration He would take any amount of trouble he was a selfish man habitually to meet and forestall if possible her wishes Anything she told him to do was law and he was there could be no doubting it fond of her company so long as she talked to him and kept on talking about trivialities But when she launched into expression of her personal views and her wrongs those small social differences that make the spice of Simla life Hannasyde was neither pleased nor interested He didn t want to know anything about missus Landys Haggert or her experiences in the past she had travelled nearly all over the world and could talk cleverly he wanted the likeness of Alice Chisane before his eyes and her voice in his ears Anything outside that reminding him of another personality jarred and he showed that it did Under the new Post Office one evening missus Landys Haggert turned on him and spoke her mind shortly and without warning mister Hannasyde said she will you be good enough to explain why you have appointed yourself my special cavalier servente I don t understand it But I am perfectly certain somehow or other that you don t care the least little bit in the world for ME This seems to support by the way the theory that no man can act or tell lies to a woman without being found out Hannasyde was taken off his guard His defence never was a strong one because he was always thinking of himself and he blurted out before he knew what he was saying this inexpedient answer No more I do The queerness of the situation and the reply made missus Landys Haggert laugh Then it all came out and at the end of Hannasyde s lucid explanation missus Haggert said with the least little touch of scorn in her voice So I m to act as the lay figure for you to hang the rags of your tattered affections on am I Hannasyde didn t see what answer was required and he devoted himself generally and vaguely to the praise of Alice Chisane which was unsatisfactory Now it is to be thoroughly made clear that missus Haggert had not the shadow of a ghost of an interest in Hannasyde Only only no woman likes being made love through instead of to specially on behalf of a musty divinity of four years standing Hannasyde did not see that he had made any very particular exhibition of himself He was glad to find a sympathetic soul in the arid wastes of Simla When the season ended Hannasyde went down to his own place and missus Haggert to hers It was like making love to a ghost said Hannasyde to himself and it doesn t matter and now I ll get to my work But he found himself thinking steadily of the Haggert Chisane ghost and he could not be certain whether it was Haggert or Chisane that made up the greater part of the pretty phantom He got understanding a month later A peculiar point of this peculiar country is the way in which a heartless Government transfers men from one end of the Empire to the other You can never be sure of getting rid of a friend or an enemy till he or she dies There was a case once but that s another story Haggert s Department ordered him up from Dindigul to the Frontier at two days notice and he went through losing money at every step from Dindigul to his station He dropped missus Haggert at Lucknow to stay with some friends there to take part in a big ball at the Chutter Munzil and to come on when he had made the new home a little comfortable Lucknow was Hannasyde s station and missus Haggert stayed a week there Hannasyde went to meet her And the train came in he discovered which he had been thinking of for the past month The unwisdom of his conduct also struck him The Lucknow week with two dances and an unlimited quantity of rides together clinched matters and Hannasyde found himself pacing this circle of thought He adored Alice Chisane at least he HAD adored her AND he admired missus Landys Haggert because she was like Alice Chisane BUT missus Landys Haggert was not in the least like Alice Chisane being a thousand times more adorable NOW Alice Chisane was the bride of another and so was missus Landys Haggert and a good and honest wife too THEREFORE he Hannasyde was here he called himself several hard names and wished that he had been wise in the beginning Whether missus Landys Haggert saw what was going on in his mind she alone knows He seemed to take an unqualified interest in everything connected with herself as distinguished from the Alice Chisane likeness and he said one or two things which if Alice Chisane had been still betrothed to him could scarcely have been excused even on the grounds of the likeness But missus Haggert turned the remarks aside and spent a long time in making Hannasyde see what a comfort and a pleasure she had been to him because of her strange resemblance to his old love Hannasyde groaned in his saddle and said Yes indeed and busied himself with preparations for her departure to the Frontier feeling very small and miserable The last day of her stay at Lucknow came and Hannasyde saw her off at the Railway Station She was very grateful for his kindness and the trouble he had taken and smiled pleasantly and sympathetically as one who knew the Alice Chisane reason of that kindness And Hannasyde abused the coolies with the luggage and hustled the people on the platform and prayed that the roof might fall in and slay him As the train went out slowly missus Landys Haggert leaned out of the window to say goodbye On second thoughts au revoir mister Hannasyde I go Home in the Spring and perhaps I may meet you in Town Hannasyde shook hands and said very earnestly and adoringly I hope to Heaven I shall never see your face again And missus Haggert understood WRESSLEY OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE I closed and drew for my love s sake That now is false to me And I slew the Riever of Tarrant Moss And set Dumeny free And ever they give me praise and gold And ever I moan my loss For I struck the blow for my false love s sake And not for the men at the Moss Tarrant Moss One of the many curses of our life out here is the want of atmosphere in the painter s sense There are no half tints worth noticing Men stand out all crude and raw with nothing to tone them down and nothing to scale them against They do their work and grow to think that there is nothing but their work and nothing like their work and that they are the real pivots on which the administration turns Here is an instance of this feeling A half caste clerk was ruling forms in a Pay Office He said to me Do you know what would happen if I added or took away one single line on this sheet Then with the air of a conspirator It would disorganize the whole of the Treasury payments throughout the whole of the Presidency Circle Think of that If men had not this delusion as to the ultra importance of their own particular employments I suppose that they would sit down and kill themselves But their weakness is wearisome particularly when the listener knows that he himself commits exactly the same sin Even the Secretariat believes that it does good when it asks an over driven Executive Officer to take census of wheat weevils through a district of five thousand square miles There was a man once in the Foreign Office a man who had grown middle aged in the department and was commonly said by irreverent juniors to be able to repeat Aitchison s Treaties and Sunnuds backwards in his sleep What he did with his stored knowledge only the Secretary knew and he naturally would not publish the news abroad This man s name was Wressley and it was the Shibboleth in those days to say Wressley knows more about the Central Indian States than any living man If you did not say this you were considered one of mean understanding Now a days the man who says that he knows the ravel of the inter tribal complications across the Border is of more use but in Wressley s time much attention was paid to the Central Indian States They were called foci and factors and all manner of imposing names And here the curse of Anglo Indian life fell heavily When Wressley lifted up his voice and spoke about such and such a succession to such and such a throne the Foreign Office were silent and Heads of Departments repeated the last two or three words of Wressley s sentences and tacked yes yes on them and knew that they were assisting the Empire to grapple with serious political contingencies In most big undertakings one or two men do the work while the rest sit near and talk till the ripe decorations begin to fall Wressley was the working member of the Foreign Office firm and to keep him up to his duties when he showed signs of flagging he was made much of by his superiors and told what a fine fellow he was He did not require coaxing because he was of tough build but what he received confirmed him in the belief that there was no one quite so absolutely and imperatively necessary to the stability of India as Wressley of the Foreign Office There might be other good men but the known honored and trusted man among men was Wressley of the Foreign Office We had a Viceroy in those days who knew exactly when to gentle a fractious big man and to hearten up a collar galled little one and so keep all his team level He conveyed to Wressley the impression which I have just set down and even tough men are apt to be disorganized by a Viceroy s praise There was a case once but that is another story All India knew Wressley s name and office it was in Thacker and Spink s Directory but who he was personally or what he did or what his special merits were not fifty men knew or cared His work filled all his time and he found no leisure to cultivate acquaintances beyond those of dead Rajput chiefs with Ahir blots in their scutcheons Wressley would have made a very good Clerk in the Herald s College had he not been a Bengal Civilian Upon a day between office and office great trouble came to Wressley overwhelmed him knocked him down and left him gasping as though he had been a little school boy Without reason against prudence and at a moment s notice he fell in love with a frivolous golden haired girl who used to tear about Simla Mall on a high rough waler with a blue velvet jockey cap crammed over her eyes Her name was Venner Tillie Venner and she was delightful She took Wressley s heart at a hand gallop and Wressley found that it was not good for man to live alone even with half the Foreign Office Records in his presses Then Simla laughed for Wressley in love was slightly ridiculous He did his best to interest the girl in himself that is to say his work and she after the manner of women did her best to appear interested in what behind his back she called mister Wressley s Wajahs for she lisped very prettily She did not understand one little thing about them but she acted as if she did Men have married on that sort of error before now Providence however had care of Wressley He was immensely struck with Miss Venner s intelligence He would have been more impressed had he heard her private and confidential accounts of his calls He held peculiar notions as to the wooing of girls He said that the best work of a man s career should be laid reverently at their feet Ruskin writes something like this somewhere I think but in ordinary life a few kisses are better and save time About a month after he had lost his heart to Miss Venner and had been doing his work vilely in consequence the first idea of his Native Rule in Central India struck Wressley and filled him with joy It was as he sketched it a great thing the work of his life a really comprehensive survey of a most fascinating subject to be written with all the special and laboriously acquired knowledge of Wressley of the Foreign Office a gift fit for an Empress He told Miss Venner that he was going to take leave and hoped on his return to bring her a present worthy of her acceptance Would she wait Certainly she would Wressley drew seventeen hundred rupees a month She would wait a year for that Her mamma would help her to wait So Wressley took one year s leave and all the available documents about a truck load that he could lay hands on and went down to Central India with his notion hot in his head He began his book in the land he was writing of Too much official correspondence had made him a frigid workman and he must have guessed that he needed the white light of local color on his palette This is a dangerous paint for amateurs to play with Heavens how that man worked He caught his Rajahs analyzed his Rajahs and traced them up into the mists of Time and beyond with their queens and their concubines He dated and cross dated pedigreed and triple pedigreed compared noted connoted wove strung sorted selected inferred calendared and counter calendared for ten hours a day And because this sudden and new light of Love was upon him he turned those dry bones of history and dirty records of misdeeds into things to weep or to laugh over as he pleased His heart and soul were at the end of his pen and they got into the link He was dowered with sympathy insight humor and style for two hundred and thirty days and nights and his book was a Book He had his vast special knowledge with him so to speak but the spirit the woven in human Touch the poetry and the power of the output were beyond all special knowledge But I doubt whether he knew the gift that was in him then and thus he may have lost some happiness He was toiling for Tillie Venner not for himself Men often do their best work blind for some one else s sake Also though this has nothing to do with the story in India where every one knows every one else you can watch men being driven by the women who govern them out of the rank and file and sent to take up points alone A good man once started goes forward but an average man so soon as the woman loses interest in his success as a tribute to her power comes back to the battalion and is no more heard of Wressley bore the first copy of his book to Simla and blushing and stammering presented it to Miss Venner She read a little of it I give her review verbatim Oh your book It s all about those how wid Wajahs I didn t understand it Wressley of the Foreign Office was broken smashed I am not exaggerating by this one frivolous little girl All that he could say feebly was But but it s my magnum opus The work of my life Miss Venner did not know what magnum opus meant but she knew that Captain Kerrington had won three races at the last Gymkhana Wressley didn t press her to wait for him any longer He had sense enough for that Then came the reaction after the year s strain and Wressley went back to the Foreign Office and his Wajahs a compiling gazetteering report writing hack who would have been dear at three hundred rupees a month He abided by Miss Venner s review Which proves that the inspiration in the book was purely temporary and unconnected with himself Nevertheless he had no right to sink in a hill tarn five packing cases brought up at enormous expense from Bombay of the best book of Indian history ever written When he sold off before retiring some years later I was turning over his shelves and came across the only existing copy of Native Rule in Central India the copy that Miss Venner could not understand I read it sitting on his mule trucks as long as the light lasted and offered him his own price for it He looked over my shoulder for a few pages and said to himself drearily Now how in the world did I come to write such damned good stuff as that Then to me Take it and keep it Write one of your penny farthing yarns about its birth Perhaps perhaps the whole business may have been ordained to that end Which knowing what Wressley of the Foreign Office was once struck me as about the bitterest thing that I had ever heard a man say of his own work BY WORD OF MOUTH Not though you die to night O Sweet and wail A spectre at my door Shall mortal Fear make Love immortal fail I shall but love you more Who from Death s house returning give me still One moment s comfort in my matchless ill Shadow Houses This tale may be explained by those who know how souls are made and where the bounds of the Possible are put down I have lived long enough in this country to know that it is best to know nothing and can only write the story as it happened Dumoise was our Civil Surgeon at Meridki and we called him Dormouse because he was a round little sleepy little man He was a good Doctor and never quarrelled with any one not even with our Deputy Commissioner who had the manners of a bargee and the tact of a horse He married a girl as round and as sleepy looking as himself She was a Miss Hillardyce daughter of Squash Hillardyce of the Berars who married his Chief s daughter by mistake But that is another story A honeymoon in India is seldom more than a week long but there is nothing to hinder a couple from extending it over two or three years This is a delightful country for married folk who are wrapped up in one another They can live absolutely alone and without interruption just as the Dormice did These two little people retired from the world after their marriage and were very happy They were forced of course to give occasional dinners but they made no friends hereby and the Station went its own way and forgot them only saying occasionally that Dormouse was the best of good fellows though dull A Civil Surgeon who never quarrels is a rarity appreciated as such Few people can afford to play Robinson Crusoe anywhere least of all in India where we are few in the land and very much dependent on each other s kind offices Dumoise was wrong in shutting himself from the world for a year and he discovered his mistake when an epidemic of typhoid broke out in the Station in the heart of the cold weather and his wife went down He was a shy little man and five days were wasted before he realized that missus Dumoise was burning with something worse than simple fever and three days more passed before he ventured to call on missus Shute the Engineer s wife and timidly speak about his trouble Nearly every household in India knows that Doctors are very helpless in typhoid The battle must be fought out between Death and the Nurses minute by minute and degree by degree missus Shute almost boxed Dumoise s ears for what she called his criminal delay and went off at once to look after the poor girl We had seven cases of typhoid in the Station that winter and as the average of death is about one in every five cases we felt certain that we should have to lose somebody But all did their best The women sat up nursing the women and the men turned to and tended the bachelors who were down and we wrestled with those typhoid cases for fifty six days and brought them through the Valley of the Shadow in triumph But just when we thought all was over and were going to give a dance to celebrate the victory little missus Dumoise got a relapse and died in a week and the Station went to the funeral Dumoise broke down utterly at the brink of the grave and had to be taken away After the death Dumoise crept into his own house and refused to be comforted He did his duties perfectly but we all felt that he should go on leave and the other men of his own Service told him so Dumoise was very thankful for the suggestion he was thankful for anything in those days and went to Chini on a walking tour Chini is some twenty marches from Simla in the heart of the Hills and the scenery is good if you are in trouble You pass through big still deodar forests and under big still cliffs and over big still grass downs swelling like a woman s breasts and the wind across the grass and the rain among the deodars says Hush hush hush So little Dumoise was packed off to Chini to wear down his grief with a full plate camera and a rifle He took also a useless bearer because the man had been his wife s favorite servant He was idle and a thief but Dumoise trusted everything to him On his way back from Chini Dumoise turned aside to Bagi through the Forest Reserve which is on the spur of Mount Huttoo Some men who have travelled more than a little say that the march from Kotegarh to Bagi is one of the finest in creation It runs through dark wet forest and ends suddenly in bleak nipped hill side and black rocks Bagi dak bungalow is open to all the winds and is bitterly cold Few people go to Bagi Perhaps that was the reason why Dumoise went there He halted at seven in the evening and his bearer went down the hill side to the village to engage coolies for the next day s march The sun had set and the night winds were beginning to croon among the rocks Dumoise leaned on the railing of the verandah waiting for his bearer to return The man came back almost immediately after he had disappeared and at such a rate that Dumoise fancied he must have crossed a bear He was running as hard as he could up the face of the hill But there was no bear to account for his terror He raced to the verandah and fell down the blood spurting from his nose and his face iron gray Then he gurgled I have seen the Memsahib I have seen the Memsahib Where said Dumoise Down there walking on the road to the village She was in a blue dress and she lifted the veil of her bonnet and said Ram Dass give my salaams to the Sahib and tell him that I shall meet him next month at Nuddea Then I ran away because I was afraid What Dumoise said or did I do not know Ram Dass declares that he said nothing but walked up and down the verandah all the cold night waiting for the Memsahib to come up the hill and stretching out his arms into the dark like a madman But no Memsahib came and next day he went on to Simla cross questioning the bearer every hour Ram Dass could only say that he had met missus Dumoise and that she had lifted up her veil and given him the message which he had faithfully repeated to Dumoise To this statement Ram Dass adhered He did not know where Nuddea was had no friends at Nuddea and would most certainly never go to Nuddea even though his pay were doubled Nuddea is in Bengal and has nothing whatever to do with a doctor serving in the Punjab It must be more than twelve hundred miles from Meridki Dumoise went through Simla without halting and returned to Meridki there to take over charge from the man who had been officiating for him during his tour There were some Dispensary accounts to be explained and some recent orders of the Surgeon General to be noted and altogether the taking over was a full day s work In the evening Dumoise told his locum tenens who was an old friend of his bachelor days what had happened at Bagi and the man said that Ram Dass might as well have chosen Tuticorin while he was about it At that moment a telegraph peon came in with a telegram from Simla ordering Dumoise not to take over charge at Meridki but to go at once to Nuddea on special duty There was a nasty outbreak of cholera at Nuddea and the Bengal Government being shorthanded as usual had borrowed a Surgeon from the Punjab Dumoise threw the telegram across the table and said Well The other Doctor said nothing It was all that he could say Then he remembered that Dumoise had passed through Simla on his way from Bagi and thus might possibly have heard the first news of the impending transfer He tried to put the question and the implied suspicion into words but Dumoise stopped him with If I had desired THAT I should never have come back from Chini I was shooting there I wish to live for I have things to do but I shall not be sorry The other man bowed his head and helped in the twilight to pack up Dumoise s just opened trunks Ram Dass entered with the lamps Where is the Sahib going he asked To Nuddea said Dumoise softly Ram Dass clawed Dumoise s knees and boots and begged him not to go Ram Dass wept and howled till he was turned out of the room Then he wrapped up all his belongings and came back to ask for a character He was not going to Nuddea to see his Sahib die and perhaps to die himself So Dumoise gave the man his wages and went down to Nuddea alone the other Doctor bidding him good bye as one under sentence of death Eleven days later he had joined his Memsahib and the Bengal Government had to borrow a fresh Doctor to cope with that epidemic at Nuddea The first importation lay dead in Chooadanga Dak Bungalow TO BE HELD FOR REFERENCE By the hoof of the Wild Goat up tossed From the Cliff where She lay in the Sun Fell the Stone To the Tarn where the daylight is lost So She fell from the light of the Sun And alone Now the fall was ordained from the first With the Goat and the Cliff and the Tarn But the Stone Knows only Her life is accursed As She sinks in the depths of the Tarn And alone Oh Thou who has builded the world Oh Thou who hast lighted the Sun Oh Thou who hast darkened the Tarn Judge Thou The Sin of the Stone that was hurled By the Goat from the light of the Sun As She sinks in the mire of the Tarn Even now even now even now From the Unpublished Papers of McIntosh Jellaludin Say is it dawn is it dusk in thy Bower Thou whom I long for who longest for me Oh be it night be it Here he fell over a little camel colt that was sleeping in the Serai where the horse traders and the best of the blackguards from Central Asia live and because he was very drunk indeed and the night was dark he could not rise again till I helped him That was the beginning of my acquaintance with McIntosh Jellaludin When a loafer and drunk sings The Song of the Bower he must be worth cultivating He got off the camel s back and said rather thickly I I I m a bit screwed but a dip in Loggerhead will put me right again and I say have you spoken to Symonds about the mare s knees Now Loggerhead was six thousand weary miles away from us close to Mesopotamia where you mustn t fish and poaching is impossible and Charley Symonds stable a half mile further across the paddocks It was strange to hear all the old names on a May night among the horses and camels of the Sultan Caravanserai Then the man seemed to remember himself and sober down at the same time He leaned against the camel and pointed to a corner of the Serai where a lamp was burning I live there said he and I should be extremely obliged if you would be good enough to help my mutinous feet thither for I am more than usually drunk most most phenomenally tight But not in respect to my head My brain cries out against how does it go But my head rides on the rolls on the dung hill I should have said and controls the qualm I helped him through the gangs of tethered horses and he collapsed on the edge of the verandah in front of the line of native quarters Thanks a thousand thanks O Moon and little little Stars To think that a man should so shamelessly Infamous liquor too Ovid in exile drank no worse Better It was frozen Alas I had no ice Good night I would introduce you to my wife were I sober or she civilized A native woman came out of the darkness of the room and began calling the man names so I went away He was the most interesting loafer that I had the pleasure of knowing for a long time and later on he became a friend of mine He was a tall well built fair man fearfully shaken with drink and he looked nearer fifty than the thirty five which he said was his real age When a man begins to sink in India and is not sent Home by his friends as soon as may be he falls very low from a respectable point of view By the time that he changes his creed as did McIntosh he is past redemption In most big cities natives will tell you of two or three Sahibs generally low caste who have turned Hindu or Mussulman and who live more or less as such But it is not often that you can get to know them As McIntosh himself used to say If I change my religion for my stomach s sake I do not seek to become a martyr to missionaries nor am I anxious for notoriety At the outset of acquaintance McIntosh warned me Remember this I am not an object for charity I require neither your money your food nor your cast off raiment I am that rare animal a self supporting drunkard If you choose I will smoke with you for the tobacco of the bazars does not I admit suit my palate and I will borrow any books which you may not specially value It is more than likely that I shall sell them for bottles of excessively filthy country liquors In return you shall share such hospitality as my house affords Here is a charpoy on which two can sit and it is possible that there may from time to time be food in that platter Drink unfortunately you will find on the premises at any hour and thus I make you welcome to all my poor establishments I was admitted to the McIntosh household I and my good tobacco But nothing else Unluckily one cannot visit a loafer in the Serai by day Friends buying horses would not understand it Consequently I was obliged to see McIntosh after dark He laughed at this and said simply You are perfectly right When I enjoyed a position in society rather higher than yours I should have done exactly the same thing Good Heavens I was once he spoke as though he had fallen from the Command of a Regiment an Oxford Man This accounted for the reference to Charley Symonds stable You said McIntosh slowly have not had that advantage but to outward appearance you do not seem possessed of a craving for strong drinks On the whole I fancy that you are the luckier of the two Yet I am not certain You are forgive my saying so even while I am smoking your excellent tobacco painfully ignorant of many things We were sitting together on the edge of his bedstead for he owned no chairs watching the horses being watered for the night while the native woman was preparing dinner I did not like being patronized by a loafer but I was his guest for the time being though he owned only one very torn alpaca coat and a pair of trousers made out of gunny bags He took the pipe out of his mouth and went on judicially All things considered I doubt whether you are the luckier I do not refer to your extremely limited classical attainments or your excruciating quantities but to your gross ignorance of matters more immediately under your notice That for instance He pointed to a woman cleaning a samovar near the well in the centre of the Serai She was flicking the water out of the spout in regular cadenced jerks There are ways and ways of cleaning samovars If you knew why she was doing her work in that particular fashion you would know what the Spanish Monk meant when he said I the Trinity illustrate Drinking watered orange pulp In three sips the Aryan frustrate While he drains his at one gulp and many other things which now are hidden from your eyes However missus McIntosh has prepared dinner Let us come and eat after the fashion of the people of the country of whom by the way you know nothing The native woman dipped her hand in the dish with us This was wrong The wife should always wait until the husband has eaten McIntosh Jellaludin apologized saying It is an English prejudice which I have not been able to overcome and she loves me Why I have never been able to understand I fore gathered with her at Jullundur three years ago and she has remained with me ever since I believe her to be moral and know her to be skilled in cookery He patted the woman s head as he spoke and she cooed softly She was not pretty to look at McIntosh never told me what position he had held before his fall He was when sober a scholar and a gentleman When drunk he was rather more of the first than the second He used to get drunk about once a week for two days On those occasions the native woman tended him while he raved in all tongues except his own One day indeed he began reciting Atalanta in Calydon and went through it to the end beating time to the swing of the verse with a bedstead leg But he did most of his ravings in Greek or German The man s mind was a perfect rag bag of useless things Once when he was beginning to get sober he told me that I was the only rational being in the Inferno into which he had descended a Virgil in the Shades he said and that in return for my tobacco he would before he died give me the materials of a new Inferno that should make me greater than Dante Then he fell asleep on a horse blanket and woke up quite calm Man said he when you have reached the uttermost depths of degradation little incidents which would vex a higher life are to you of no consequence Last night my soul was among the gods but I make no doubt that my bestial body was writhing down here in the garbage You were abominably drunk if that s what you mean I said I WAS drunk filthy drunk I who am the son of a man with whom you have no concern I who was once Fellow of a College whose buttery hatch you have not seen I was loathsomely drunk But consider how lightly I am touched It is nothing to me Less than nothing for I do not even feel the headache which should be my portion Now in a higher life how ghastly would have been my punishment how bitter my repentance Believe me my friend with the neglected education the highest is as the lowest always supposing each degree extreme He turned round on the blanket put his head between his fists and continued On the Soul which I have lost and on the Conscience which I have killed I tell you that I CANNOT feel I am as the gods knowing good and evil but untouched by either Is this enviable or is it not When a man has lost the warning of next morning s head he must be in a bad state I answered looking at McIntosh on the blanket with his hair over his eyes and his lips blue white that I did not think the insensibility good enough For pity s sake don t say that I tell you it IS good and most enviable Think of my consolations Have you so many then McIntosh Certainly your attempts at sarcasm which is essentially the weapon of a cultured man are crude First my attainments my classical and literary knowledge blurred perhaps by immoderate drinking which reminds me that before my soul went to the Gods last night I sold the Pickering Horace you so kindly lent me Ditta Mull the Clothesman has it It fetched ten annas and may be redeemed for a rupee but still infinitely superior to yours Secondly the abiding affection of missus McIntosh best of wives Thirdly a monument more enduring than brass which I have built up in the seven years of my degradation He stopped here and crawled across the room for a drink of water He was very shaky and sick He referred several times to his treasure some great possession that he owned but I held this to be the raving of drink He was as poor and as proud as he could be His manner was not pleasant but he knew enough about the natives among whom seven years of his life had been spent to make his acquaintance worth having He used actually to laugh at Strickland as an ignorant man ignorant West and East he said His boast was first that he was an Oxford Man of rare and shining parts which may or may not have been true I did not know enough to check his statements and secondly that he had his hand on the pulse of native life which was a fact As an Oxford man he struck me as a prig he was always throwing his education about As a Mahommedan faquir as McIntosh Jellaludin he was all that I wanted for my own ends He smoked several pounds of my tobacco and taught me several ounces of things worth knowing but he would never accept any gifts not even when the cold weather came and gripped the poor thin chest under the poor thin alpaca coat He grew very angry and said that I had insulted him and that he was not going into hospital He had lived like a beast and he would die rationally like a man As a matter of fact he died of pneumonia and on the night of his death sent over a grubby note asking me to come and help him to die The native woman was weeping by the side of the bed McIntosh wrapped in a cotton cloth was too weak to resent a fur coat being thrown over him He was very active as far as his mind was concerned and his eyes were blazing When he had abused the Doctor who came with me so foully that the indignant old fellow left he cursed me for a few minutes and calmed down Then he told his wife to fetch out The Book from a hole in the wall She brought out a big bundle wrapped in the tail of a petticoat of old sheets of miscellaneous note paper all numbered and covered with fine cramped writing McIntosh ploughed his hand through the rubbish and stirred it up lovingly This he said is my work the Book of McIntosh Jellaludin showing what he saw and how he lived and what befell him and others being also an account of the life and sins and death of Mother Maturin What Mirza Murad Ali Beg s book is to all other books on native life will my work be to Mirza Murad Ali Beg s This as will be conceded by any one who knows Mirza Ali Beg s book was a sweeping statement The papers did not look specially valuable but McIntosh handled them as if they were currency notes Then he said slowly In despite the many weaknesses of your education you have been good to me I will speak of your tobacco when I reach the Gods I owe you much thanks for many kindnesses But I abominate indebtedness For this reason I bequeath to you now the monument more enduring than brass my one book rude and imperfect in parts but oh how rare in others I wonder if you will understand it It is a gift more honorable than Bah where is my brain rambling to You will mutilate it horribly You will knock out the gems you call Latin quotations you Philistine and you will butcher the style to carve into your own jerky jargon but you cannot destroy the whole of it I bequeath it to you Ethel My brain again missus McIntosh bear witness that I give the sahib all these papers They would be of no use to you Heart of my heart and I lay it upon you he turned to me here that you do not let my book die in its present form It is yours unconditionally the story of McIntosh Jellaludin which is NOT the story of McIntosh Jellaludin but of a greater man than he and of a far greater woman Listen now I am neither mad nor drunk That book will make you famous I said thank you as the native woman put the bundle into my arms My only baby said McIntosh with a smile He was sinking fast but he continued to talk as long as breath remained I waited for the end knowing that in six cases out of ten the dying man calls for his mother He turned on his side and said Say how it came into your possession No one will believe you but my name at least will live You will treat it brutally I know you will Some of it must go the public are fools and prudish fools I was their servant once But do your mangling gently very gently It is a great work and I have paid for it in seven years damnation His voice stopped for ten or twelve breaths and then he began mumbling a prayer of some kind in Greek The native woman cried very bitterly Lastly he rose in bed and said as loudly as slowly Not guilty my Lord Then he fell back and the stupor held him till he died The native woman ran into the Serai among the horses and screamed and beat her breasts for she had loved him Perhaps his last sentence in life told what McIntosh had once gone through but saving the big bundle of old sheets in the cloth there was nothing in his room to say who or what he had been The papers were in a hopeless muddle Strickland helped me to sort them and he said that the writer was either an extreme liar or a most wonderful person He thought the former One of these days you may be able to judge for yourself The bundle needed much expurgation and was full of Greek nonsense at the head of the chapters which has all been cut out If the things are ever published some one may perhaps remember this story now printed as a safeguard
