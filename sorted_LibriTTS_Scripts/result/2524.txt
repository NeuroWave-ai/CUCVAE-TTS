MY LADY LUDLOW Transcribed from the eighteen ninety six Smith Elder and company Lizzie Leigh and Other Tales edition by David Price email ccxseventy four coventry ac uk MY LADY LUDLOW by Elizabeth Gaskell CHAPTER I I am an old woman now and things are very different to what they were in my youth Then we who travelled travelled in coaches carrying six inside and making a two days journey out of what people now go over in a couple of hours with a whizz and a flash and a screaming whistle enough to deafen one Then letters came in but three times a week indeed in some places in Scotland where I have stayed when I was a girl the post came in but once a month but letters were letters then and we made great prizes of them and read them and studied them like books Now the post comes rattling in twice a day bringing short jerky notes some without beginning or end but just a little sharp sentence which well bred folks would think too abrupt to be spoken Well well they may all be improvements I dare say they are but you will never meet with a Lady Ludlow in these days I will try and tell you about her It is no story it has as I said neither beginning middle nor end My father was a poor clergyman with a large family My mother was always said to have good blood in her veins and when she wanted to maintain her position with the people she was thrown among principally rich democratic manufacturers all for liberty and the French Revolution she would put on a pair of ruffles trimmed with real old English point very much darned to be sure but which could not be bought new for love or money as the art of making it was lost years before These ruffles showed as she said that her ancestors had been Somebodies when the grandfathers of the rich folk who now looked down upon her had been Nobodies if indeed they had any grandfathers at all I don t know whether any one out of our own family ever noticed these ruffles but we were all taught as children to feel rather proud when my mother put them on and to hold up our heads as became the descendants of the lady who had first possessed the lace Not but what my dear father often told us that pride was a great sin we were never allowed to be proud of anything but my mother s ruffles and she was so innocently happy when she put them on often poor dear creature to a very worn and threadbare gown that I still think even after all my experience of life they were a blessing to the family You will think that I am wandering away from my Lady Ludlow Not at all The Lady who had owned the lace Ursula Hanbury was a common ancestress of both my mother and my Lady Ludlow And so it fell out that when my poor father died and my mother was sorely pressed to know what to do with her nine children and looked far and wide for signs of willingness to help Lady Ludlow sent her a letter proffering aid and assistance I see that letter now a large sheet of thick yellow paper with a straight broad margin left on the left hand side of the delicate Italian writing writing which contained far more in the same space of paper than all the sloping or masculine hand writings of the present day It was sealed with a coat of arms a lozenge for Lady Ludlow was a widow My mother made us notice the motto Foy et Loy and told us where to look for the quarterings of the Hanbury arms before she opened the letter Indeed I think she was rather afraid of what the contents might be for as I have said in her anxious love for her fatherless children she had written to many people upon whom to tell truly she had but little claim and their cold hard answers had many a time made her cry when she thought none of us were looking I do not even know if she had ever seen Lady Ludlow all I knew of her was that she was a very grand lady whose grandmother had been half sister to my mother s great grandmother but of her character and circumstances I had heard nothing and I doubt if my mother was acquainted with them I looked over my mother s shoulder to read the letter it began Dear Cousin Margaret Dawson and I think I felt hopeful from the moment I saw those words She went on to say stay I think I can remember the very words DEAR COUSIN MARGARET DAWSON I have been much grieved to hear of the loss you have sustained in the death of so good a husband and so excellent a clergyman as I have always heard that my late cousin Richard was esteemed to be There said my mother laying her finger on the passage read that aloud to the little ones Let them hear how their father s good report travelled far and wide and how well he is spoken of by one whom he never saw COUSIN Richard how prettily her ladyship writes Go on Margaret She wiped her eyes as she spoke and laid her fingers on her lips to still my little sister Cecily who not understanding anything about the important letter was beginning to talk and make a noise You say you are left with nine children I too should have had nine if mine had all lived I have none left but Rudolph the present Lord Ludlow He is married and lives for the most part in London But I entertain six young gentlewomen at my house at Connington who are to me as daughters save that perhaps I restrict them in certain indulgences in dress and diet that might be befitting in young ladies of a higher rank and of more probable wealth These young persons all of condition though out of means are my constant companions and I strive to do my duty as a Christian lady towards them One of these young gentlewomen died at her own home whither she had gone upon a visit last May Will you do me the favour to allow your eldest daughter to supply her place in my household She is as I make out about sixteen years of age She will find companions here who are but a little older than herself I dress my young friends myself and make each of them a small allowance for pocket money They have but few opportunities for matrimony as Connington is far removed from any town The clergyman is a deaf old widower my agent is married and as for the neighbouring farmers they are of course below the notice of the young gentlewomen under my protection Still if any young woman wishes to marry and has conducted herself to my satisfaction I give her a wedding dinner her clothes and her house linen And such as remain with me to my death will find a small competency provided for them in my will I reserve to myself the option of paying their travelling expenses disliking gadding women on the one hand on the other not wishing by too long absence from the family home to weaken natural ties If my proposal pleases you and your daughter or rather if it pleases you for I trust your daughter has been too well brought up to have a will in opposition to yours let me know dear cousin Margaret Dawson and I will make arrangements for meeting the young gentlewoman at Cavistock which is the nearest point to which the coach will bring her My mother dropped the letter and sat silent I shall not know what to do without you Margaret A moment before like a young untried girl as I was I had been pleased at the notion of seeing a new place and leading a new life But now my mother s look of sorrow and the children s cry of remonstrance Mother I won t go I said Nay but you had better replied she shaking her head Lady Ludlow has much power She can help your brothers It will not do to slight her offer So we accepted it after much consultation We were rewarded or so we thought for afterwards when I came to know Lady Ludlow I saw that she would have done her duty by us as helpless relations however we might have rejected her kindness by a presentation to Christ s Hospital for one of my brothers And this was how I came to know my Lady Ludlow I remember well the afternoon of my arrival at Hanbury Court Her ladyship had sent to meet me at the nearest post town at which the mail coach stopped There was an old groom inquiring for me the ostler said if my name was Dawson from Hanbury Court he believed I felt it rather formidable and first began to understand what was meant by going among strangers when I lost sight of the guard to whom my mother had intrusted me I was perched up in a high gig with a hood to it such as in those days was called a chair and my companion was driving deliberately through the most pastoral country I had ever yet seen By and by we ascended a long hill and the man got out and walked at the horse s head I should have liked to walk too very much indeed but I did not know how far I might do it and in fact I dared not speak to ask to be helped down the deep steps of the gig We were at last at the top on a long breezy sweeping unenclosed piece of ground called as I afterwards learnt a Chase The groom stopped breathed patted his horse and then mounted again to my side Are we near Hanbury Court I asked Near Why Miss we ve a matter of ten mile yet to go Once launched into conversation we went on pretty glibly I fancy he had been afraid of beginning to speak to me just as I was to him but he got over his shyness with me sooner than I did mine with him I let him choose the subjects of conversation although very often I could not understand the points of interest in them for instance he talked for more than a quarter of an hour of a famous race which a certain dog fox had given him above thirty years before and spoke of all the covers and turns just as if I knew them as well as he did and all the time I was wondering what kind of an animal a dog fox might be After we left the Chase the road grew worse No one in these days who has not seen the byroads of fifty years ago can imagine what they were We had to quarter as Randal called it nearly all the way along the deep rutted miry lanes and the tremendous jolts I occasionally met with made my seat in the gig so unsteady that I could not look about me at all I was so much occupied in holding on The road was too muddy for me to walk without dirtying myself more than I liked to do just before my first sight of my Lady Ludlow But by and by when we came to the fields in which the lane ended I begged Randal to help me down as I saw that I could pick my steps among the pasture grass without making myself unfit to be seen and Randal out of pity for his steaming horse wearied with the hard struggle through the mud thanked me kindly and helped me down with a springing jump The pastures fell gradually down to the lower land shut in on either side by rows of high elms as if there had been a wide grand avenue here in former times Down the grassy gorge we went seeing the sunset sky at the end of the shadowed descent Suddenly we came to a long flight of steps If you ll run down there Miss I ll go round and meet you and then you d better mount again for my lady will like to see you drive up to the house Are we near the house said I suddenly checked by the idea Down there Miss replied he pointing with his whip to certain stacks of twisted chimneys rising out of a group of trees in deep shadow against the crimson light and which lay just beyond a great square lawn at the base of the steep slope of a hundred yards on the edge of which we stood I went down the steps quietly enough I met Randal and the gig at the bottom and falling into a side road to the left we drove sedately round through the gateway and into the great court in front of the house The road by which we had come lay right at the back Hanbury Court is a vast red brick house at least it is cased in part with red bricks and the gate house and walls about the place are of brick with stone facings at every corner and door and window such as you see at Hampton Court At the back are the gables and arched doorways and stone mullions which show so Lady Ludlow used to tell us that it was once a priory There was a prior s parlour I know only we called it missus Medlicott s room and there was a tithe barn as big as a church and rows of fish ponds all got ready for the monks fasting days in old time But all this I did not see till afterwards I hardly noticed this first night the great Virginian Creeper said to have been the first planted in England by one of my lady s ancestors that half covered the front of the house As I had been unwilling to leave the guard of the coach so did I now feel unwilling to leave Randal a known friend of three hours But there was no help for it in I must go past the grand looking old gentleman holding the door open for me on into the great hall on the right hand into which the sun s last rays were sending in glorious red light the gentleman was now walking before me up a step on to the dais as I afterwards learned that it was called then again to the left through a series of sitting rooms opening one out of another and all of them looking into a stately garden glowing even in the twilight with the bloom of flowers We went up four steps out of the last of these rooms and then my guide lifted up a heavy silk curtain and I was in the presence of my Lady Ludlow She was very small of stature and very upright She wore a great lace cap nearly half her own height I should think that went round her head caps which tied under the chin and which we called mobs came in later and my lady held them in great contempt saying people might as well come down in their nightcaps In front of my lady s cap was a great bow of white satin ribbon and a broad band of the same ribbon was tied tight round her head and served to keep the cap straight She had a fine Indian muslin shawl folded over her shoulders and across her chest and an apron of the same a black silk mode gown made with short sleeves and ruffles and with the tail thereof pulled through the pocket hole so as to shorten it to a useful length beneath it she wore as I could plainly see a quilted lavender satin petticoat Her hair was snowy white but I hardly saw it it was so covered with her cap her skin even at her age was waxen in texture and tint her eyes were large and dark blue and must have been her great beauty when she was young for there was nothing particular as far as I can remember either in mouth or nose She had a great gold headed stick by her chair but I think it was more as a mark of state and dignity than for use for she had as light and brisk a step when she chose as any girl of fifteen and in her private early walk of meditation in the mornings would go as swiftly from garden alley to garden alley as any one of us She was standing up when I went in I dropped my curtsey at the door which my mother had always taught me as a part of good manners and went up instinctively to my lady She did not put out her hand but raised herself a little on tiptoe and kissed me on both cheeks You are cold my child You shall have a dish of tea with me She rang a little hand bell on the table by her and her waiting maid came in from a small anteroom and as if all had been prepared and was awaiting my arrival brought with her a small china service with tea ready made and a plate of delicately cut bread and butter every morsel of which I could have eaten and been none the better for it so hungry was I after my long ride The waiting maid took off my cloak and I sat down sorely alarmed at the silence the hushed foot falls of the subdued maiden over the thick carpet and the soft voice and clear pronunciation of my Lady Ludlow My teaspoon fell against my cup with a sharp noise that seemed so out of place and season that I blushed deeply My lady caught my eye with hers both keen and sweet were those dark blue eyes of her ladyship s Your hands are very cold my dear take off those gloves I wore thick serviceable doeskin and had been too shy to take them off unbidden and let me try and warm them the evenings are very chilly And she held my great red hands in hers soft warm white ring laden Looking at last a little wistfully into my face she said Poor child And you re the eldest of nine I had a daughter who would have been just your age but I cannot fancy her the eldest of nine Then came a pause of silence and then she rang her bell and desired her waiting maid Adams to show me to my room It was so small that I think it must have been a cell The walls were whitewashed stone the bed was of white dimity There was a small piece of red staircarpet on each side of the bed and two chairs In a closet adjoining were my washstand and toilet table There was a text of Scripture painted on the wall right opposite to my bed and below hung a print common enough in those days of King George and Queen Charlotte with all their numerous children down to the little Princess Amelia in a go cart On each side hung a small portrait also engraved on the left it was Louis the Sixteenth on the other Marie Antoinette On the chimney piece there was a tinder box and a Prayer book I do not remember anything else in the room Indeed in those days people did not dream of writing tables and inkstands and portfolios and easy chairs and what not We were taught to go into our bedrooms for the purposes of dressing and sleeping and praying Presently I was summoned to supper I followed the young lady who had been sent to call me down the wide shallow stairs into the great hall through which I had first passed on my way to my Lady Ludlow s room There were four other young gentlewomen all standing and all silent who curtsied to me when I first came in They were dressed in a kind of uniform muslin caps bound round their heads with blue ribbons plain muslin handkerchiefs lawn aprons and drab coloured stuff gowns They were all gathered together at a little distance from the table on which were placed a couple of cold chickens a salad and a fruit tart On the dais there was a smaller round table on which stood a silver jug filled with milk and a small roll Near that was set a carved chair with a countess s coronet surmounting the back of it I thought that some one might have spoken to me but they were shy and I was shy or else there was some other reason but indeed almost the minute after I had come into the hall by the door at the lower hand her ladyship entered by the door opening upon the dais whereupon we all curtsied very low I because I saw the others do it She stood and looked at us for a moment Young gentlewomen said she make Margaret Dawson welcome among you and they treated me with the kind politeness due to a stranger but still without any talking beyond what was required for the purposes of the meal After it was over and grace was said by one of our party my lady rang her hand bell and the servants came in and cleared away the supper things then they brought in a portable reading desk which was placed on the dais and the whole household trooping in my lady called to one of my companions to come up and read the Psalms and Lessons for the day I remember thinking how afraid I should have been had I been in her place There were no prayers My lady thought it schismatic to have any prayers excepting those in the Prayer book and would as soon have preached a sermon herself in the parish church as have allowed any one not a deacon at the least to read prayers in a private dwelling house I am not sure that even then she would have approved of his reading them in an unconsecrated place She had been maid of honour to Queen Charlotte a Hanbury of that old stock that flourished in the days of the Plantagenets and heiress of all the land that remained to the family of the great estates which had once stretched into four separate counties Hanbury Court was hers by right She had married Lord Ludlow and had lived for many years at his various seats and away from her ancestral home She had lost all her children but one and most of them had died at these houses of Lord Ludlow s and I dare say that gave my lady a distaste to the places and a longing to come back to Hanbury Court where she had been so happy as a girl I imagine her girlhood had been the happiest time of her life for now I think of it most of her opinions when I knew her in later life were singular enough then but had been universally prevalent fifty years before For instance while I lived at Hanbury Court the cry for education was beginning to come up mister Raikes had set up his Sunday Schools and some clergymen were all for teaching writing and arithmetic as well as reading My lady would have none of this it was levelling and revolutionary she said When a young woman came to be hired my lady would have her in and see if she liked her looks and her dress and question her about her family Her ladyship laid great stress upon this latter point saying that a girl who did not warm up when any interest or curiosity was expressed about her mother or the baby if there was one was not likely to make a good servant Then she would make her put out her feet to see if they were well and neatly shod Then she would bid her say the Lord s Prayer and the Creed Then she inquired if she could write If she could and she had liked all that had gone before her face sank it was a great disappointment for it was an all but inviolable rule with her never to engage a servant who could write But I have known her ladyship break through it although in both cases in which she did so she put the girl s principles to a further and unusual test in asking her to repeat the Ten Commandments One pert young woman and yet I was sorry for her too only she afterwards married a rich draper in Shrewsbury who had got through her trials pretty tolerably considering she could write spoilt all by saying glibly at the end of the last Commandment An t please your ladyship I can cast accounts Go away wench said my lady in a hurry you re only fit for trade you will not suit me for a servant The girl went away crestfallen in a minute however my lady sent me after her to see that she had something to eat before leaving the house and indeed she sent for her once again but it was only to give her a Bible and to bid her beware of French principles which had led the French to cut off their king s and queen s heads The poor blubbering girl said Indeed my lady I wouldn t hurt a fly much less a king and I cannot abide the French nor frogs neither for that matter But my lady was inexorable and took a girl who could neither read nor write to make up for her alarm about the progress of education towards addition and subtraction and afterwards when the clergyman who was at Hanbury parish when I came there had died and the bishop had appointed another and a younger man in his stead this was one of the points on which he and my lady did not agree While good old deaf mister Mountford lived it was my lady s custom when indisposed for a sermon to stand up at the door of her large square pew just opposite to the reading desk and to say at that part of the morning service where it is decreed that in quires and places where they sing here followeth the anthem mister Mountford I will not trouble you for a discourse this morning And we all knelt down to the Litany with great satisfaction for mister Mountford though he could not hear had always his eyes open about this part of the service for any of my lady s movements But the new clergyman mister Gray was of a different stamp He was very zealous in all his parish work and my lady who was just as good as she could be to the poor was often crying him up as a godsend to the parish and he never could send amiss to the Court when he wanted broth or wine or jelly or sago for a sick person But he needs must take up the new hobby of education and I could see that this put my lady sadly about one Sunday when she suspected I know not how that there was something to be said in his sermon about a Sunday school which he was planning She stood up as she had not done since mister Mountford s death two years and better before this time and said mister Gray I will not trouble you for a discourse this morning But her voice was not well assured and steady and we knelt down with more of curiosity than satisfaction in our minds mister Gray preached a very rousing sermon on the necessity of establishing a Sabbath school in the village My lady shut her eyes and seemed to go to sleep but I don t believe she lost a word of it though she said nothing about it that I heard until the next Saturday when two of us as was the custom were riding out with her in her carriage and we went to see a poor bedridden woman who lived some miles away at the other end of the estate and of the parish and as we came out of the cottage we met mister Gray walking up to it in a great heat and looking very tired My lady beckoned him to her and told him she should wait and take him home with her adding that she wondered to see him there so far from his home for that it was beyond a Sabbath day s journey and from what she had gathered from his sermon the last Sunday he was all for Judaism against Christianity He looked as if he did not understand what she meant but the truth was that besides the way in which he had spoken up for schools and schooling he had kept calling Sunday the Sabbath and as her ladyship said The Sabbath is the Sabbath and that s one thing it is Saturday and if I keep it I m a Jew which I m not And Sunday is Sunday and that s another thing and if I keep it I m a Christian which I humbly trust I am But when mister Gray got an inkling of her meaning in talking about a Sabbath day s journey he only took notice of a part of it he smiled and bowed and said no one knew better than her ladyship what were the duties that abrogated all inferior laws regarding the Sabbath and that he must go in and read to old Betty Brown so that he would not detain her ladyship But I shall wait for you mister Gray said she Or I will take a drive round by Oakfield and be back in an hour s time For you see she would not have him feel hurried or troubled with a thought that he was keeping her waiting while he ought to be comforting and praying with old Betty A very pretty young man my dears said she as we drove away But I shall have my pew glazed all the same We did not know what she meant at the time but the next Sunday but one we did She had the curtains all round the grand old Hanbury family seat taken down and instead of them there was glass up to the height of six or seven feet We entered by a door with a window in it that drew up or down just like what you see in carriages This window was generally down and then we could hear perfectly but if mister Gray used the word Sabbath or spoke in favour of schooling and education my lady stepped out of her corner and drew up the window with a decided clang and clash I must tell you something more about mister Gray The presentation to the living of Hanbury was vested in two trustees of whom Lady Ludlow was one Lord Ludlow had exercised this right in the appointment of mister Mountford who had won his lordship s favour by his excellent horsemanship Nor was mister Mountford a bad clergyman as clergymen went in those days He did not drink though he liked good eating as much as any one And if any poor person was ill and he heard of it he would send them plates from his own dinner of what he himself liked best sometimes of dishes which were almost as bad as poison to sick people He meant kindly to everybody except dissenters whom Lady Ludlow and he united in trying to drive out of the parish and among dissenters he particularly abhorred Methodists some one said because John Wesley had objected to his hunting But that must have been long ago for when I knew him he was far too stout and too heavy to hunt besides the bishop of the diocese disapproved of hunting and had intimated his disapprobation to the clergy For my own part I think a good run would not have come amiss even in a moral point of view to mister Mountford He ate so much and took so little exercise that we young women often heard of his being in terrible passions with his servants and the sexton and clerk But they none of them minded him much for he soon came to himself and was sure to make them some present or other some said in proportion to his anger so that the sexton who was a bit of a wag as all sextons are I think said that the vicar s saying The Devil take you was worth a shilling any day whereas The Deuce was a shabby sixpenny speech only fit for a curate There was a great deal of good in mister Mountford too He could not bear to see pain or sorrow or misery of any kind and if it came under his notice he was never easy till he had relieved it for the time at any rate But he was afraid of being made uncomfortable so if he possibly could he would avoid seeing any one who was ill or unhappy and he did not thank any one for telling him about them What would your ladyship have me to do he once said to my Lady Ludlow when she wished him to go and see a poor man who had broken his leg I cannot piece the leg as the doctor can I cannot nurse him as well as his wife does I may talk to him but he no more understands me than I do the language of the alchemists My coming puts him out he stiffens himself into an uncomfortable posture out of respect to the cloth and dare not take the comfort of kicking and swearing and scolding his wife while I am there I hear him with my figurative ears my lady heave a sigh of relief when my back is turned and the sermon that he thinks I ought to have kept for the pulpit and have delivered to his neighbours whose case as he fancies it would just have fitted as it seemed to him to be addressed to the sinful is all ended and done for the day I judge others as myself I do to them as I would be done to That s Christianity at any rate I should hate saving your ladyship s presence to have my Lord Ludlow coming and seeing me if I were ill Twould be a great honour no doubt but I should have to put on a clean nightcap for the occasion and sham patience in order to be polite and not weary his lordship with my complaints I should be twice as thankful to him if he would send me game or a good fat haunch to bring me up to that pitch of health and strength one ought to be in to appreciate the honour of a visit from a nobleman So I shall send Jerry Butler a good dinner every day till he is strong again and spare the poor old fellow my presence and advice My lady would be puzzled by this and by many other of mister Mountford s speeches But he had been appointed by my lord and she could not question her dead husband s wisdom and she knew that the dinners were always sent and often a guinea or two to help to pay the doctor s bills and mister Mountford was true blue as we call it to the back bone hated the dissenters and the French and could hardly drink a dish of tea without giving out the toast of Church and King and down with the Rump Moreover he had once had the honour of preaching before the King and Queen and two of the Princesses at Weymouth and the King had applauded his sermon audibly with Very good very good and that was a seal put upon his merit in my lady s eyes Besides in the long winter Sunday evenings he would come up to the Court and read a sermon to us girls and play a game of picquet with my lady afterwards which served to shorten the tedium of the time My lady would on those occasions invite him to sup with her on the dais but as her meal was invariably bread and milk only mister Mountford preferred sitting down amongst us and made a joke about its being wicked and heterodox to eat meagre on Sunday a festival of the Church We smiled at this joke just as much the twentieth time we heard it as we did at the first for we knew it was coming because he always coughed a little nervously before he made a joke for fear my lady should not approve and neither she nor he seemed to remember that he had ever hit upon the idea before mister Mountford died quite suddenly at last We were all very sorry to lose him He left some of his property for he had a private estate to the poor of the parish to furnish them with an annual Christmas dinner of roast beef and plum pudding for which he wrote out a very good receipt in the codicil to his will Moreover he desired his executors to see that the vault in which the vicars of Hanbury were interred was well aired before his coffin was taken in for all his life long he had had a dread of damp and latterly he kept his rooms to such a pitch of warmth that some thought it hastened his end Then the other trustee as I have said presented the living to mister Gray Fellow of Lincoln College Oxford It was quite natural for us all as belonging in some sort to the Hanbury family to disapprove of the other trustee s choice But when some ill natured person circulated the report that mister Gray was a Moravian Methodist I remember my lady said She could not believe anything so bad without a great deal of evidence CHAPTER II Before I tell you about mister Gray I think I ought to make you understand something more of what we did all day long at Hanbury Court There were five of us at the time of which I am speaking all young women of good descent and allied however distantly to people of rank When we were not with my lady missus Medlicott looked after us a gentle little woman who had been companion to my lady for many years and was indeed I have been told some kind of relation to her missus Medlicott s parents had lived in Germany and the consequence was she spoke English with a very foreign accent Another consequence was that she excelled in all manner of needlework such as is not known even by name in these days She could darn either lace table linen India muslin or stockings so that no one could tell where the hole or rent had been Though a good Protestant and never missing Guy Faux day at church she was as skilful at fine work as any nun in a Papist convent She would take a piece of French cambric and by drawing out some threads and working in others it became delicate lace in a very few hours She did the same by Hollands cloth and made coarse strong lace with which all my lady s napkins and table linen were trimmed We worked under her during a great part of the day either in the still room or at our sewing in a chamber that opened out of the great hall My lady despised every kind of work that would now be called Fancy work She considered that the use of coloured threads or worsted was only fit to amuse children but that grown women ought not to be taken with mere blues and reds but to restrict their pleasure in sewing to making small and delicate stitches She would speak of the old tapestry in the hall as the work of her ancestresses who lived before the Reformation and were consequently unacquainted with pure and simple tastes in work as well as in religion Nor would my lady sanction the fashion of the day which at the beginning of this century made all the fine ladies take to making shoes She said that such work was a consequence of the French Revolution which had done much to annihilate all distinctions of rank and class and hence it was that she saw young ladies of birth and breeding handling lasts and awls and dirty cobblers wax like shoe makers daughters Very frequently one of us would be summoned to my lady to read aloud to her as she sat in her small withdrawing room some improving book It was generally mister Addison s Spectator but one year I remember we had to read Sturm s Reflections translated from a German book missus Medlicott recommended mister Sturm told us what to think about for every day in the year and very dull it was but I believe Queen Charlotte had liked the book very much and the thought of her royal approbation kept my lady awake during the reading missus Chapone s Letters and doctor Gregory s Advice to Young Ladies composed the rest of our library for week day reading I for one was glad to leave my fine sewing and even my reading aloud though this last did keep me with my dear lady to go to the still room and potter about among the preserves and the medicated waters There was no doctor for many miles round and with missus Medlicott to direct us and doctor Buchan to go by for recipes we sent out many a bottle of physic which I dare say was as good as what comes out of the druggist s shop At any rate I do not think we did much harm for if any of our physics tasted stronger than usual missus Medlicott would bid us let it down with cochineal and water to make all safe as she said So our bottles of medicine had very little real physic in them at last but we were careful in putting labels on them which looked very mysterious to those who could not read and helped the medicine to do its work I have sent off many a bottle of salt and water coloured red and whenever we had nothing else to do in the still room missus Medlicott would set us to making bread pills by way of practice and as far as I can say they were very efficacious as before we gave out a box missus Medlicott always told the patient what symptoms to expect and I hardly ever inquired without hearing that they had produced their effect There was one old man who took six pills a night of any kind we liked to give him to make him sleep and if by any chance his daughter had forgotten to let us know that he was out of his medicine he was so restless and miserable that as he said he thought he was like to die I think ours was what would be called homoeopathic practice now a days Then we learnt to make all the cakes and dishes of the season in the still room We had plum porridge and mince pies at Christmas fritters and pancakes on Shrove Tuesday furmenty on Mothering Sunday violet cakes in Passion Week tansy pudding on Easter Sunday three cornered cakes on Trinity Sunday and so on through the year all made from good old Church receipts handed down from one of my lady s earliest Protestant ancestresses Every one of us passed a portion of the day with Lady Ludlow and now and then we rode out with her in her coach and four She did not like to go out with a pair of horses considering this rather beneath her rank and indeed four horses were very often needed to pull her heavy coach through the stiff mud But it was rather a cumbersome equipage through the narrow Warwickshire lanes and I used often to think it was well that countesses were not plentiful or else we might have met another lady of quality in another coach and four where there would have been no possibility of turning or passing each other and very little chance of backing Once when the idea of this danger of meeting another countess in a narrow deep rutted lane was very prominent in my mind I ventured to ask missus Medlicott what would have to be done on such an occasion and she told me that de latest creation must back for sure which puzzled me a good deal at the time although I understand it now I began to find out the use of the Peerage a book which had seemed to me rather dull before but as I was always a coward in a coach I made myself well acquainted with the dates of creation of our three Warwickshire earls and was happy to find that Earl Ludlow ranked second the oldest earl being a hunting widower and not likely to drive out in a carriage All this time I have wandered from mister Gray Of course we first saw him in church when he read himself in He was very red faced the kind of redness which goes with light hair and a blushing complexion he looked slight and short and his bright light frizzy hair had hardly a dash of powder in it I remember my lady making this observation and sighing over it for though since the famine in seventeen hundred and ninety nine and eighteen hundred there had been a tax on hair powder yet it was reckoned very revolutionary and Jacobin not to wear a good deal of it My lady hardly liked the opinions of any man who wore his own hair but this she would say was rather a prejudice only in her youth none but the mob had gone wigless and she could not get over the association of wigs with birth and breeding a man s own hair with that class of people who had formed the rioters in seventeen hundred and eighty when Lord George Gordon had been one of the bugbears of my lady s life Her husband and his brothers she told us had been put into breeches and had their heads shaved on their seventh birthday each of them a handsome little wig of the newest fashion forming the old Lady Ludlow s invariable birthday present to her sons as they each arrived at that age and afterwards to the day of their death they never saw their own hair To be without powder as some underbred people were talking of being now was in fact to insult the proprieties of life by being undressed It was English sans culottism But mister Gray did wear a little powder enough to save him in my lady s good opinion but not enough to make her approve of him decidedly The next time I saw him was in the great hall Mary Mason and I were going to drive out with my lady in her coach and when we went down stairs with our best hats and cloaks on we found mister Gray awaiting my lady s coming I believe he had paid his respects to her before but we had never seen him and he had declined her invitation to spend Sunday evening at the Court as mister Mountford used to do pretty regularly and play a game at picquet too which missus Medlicott told us had caused my lady to be not over well pleased with him He blushed redder than ever at the sight of us as we entered the hall and dropped him our curtsies He coughed two or three times as if he would have liked to speak to us if he could but have found something to say and every time he coughed he became hotter looking than ever I am ashamed to say we were nearly laughing at him half because we too were so shy that we understood what his awkwardness meant My lady came in with her quick active step she always walked quickly when she did not bethink herself of her cane as if she was sorry to have us kept waiting and as she entered she gave us all round one of those graceful sweeping curtsies of which I think the art must have died out with her it implied so much courtesy this time it said as well as words could do I am sorry to have kept you all waiting forgive me She went up to the mantelpiece near which mister Gray had been standing until her entrance and curtseying afresh to him and pretty deeply this time because of his cloth and her being hostess and he a new guest She asked him if he would not prefer speaking to her in her own private parlour and looked as though she would have conducted him there But he burst out with his errand of which he was full even to choking and which sent the glistening tears into his large blue eyes which stood farther and farther out with his excitement My lady I want to speak to you and to persuade you to exert your kind interest with mister Lathom Justice Lathom of Hathaway Manor Harry Lathom inquired my lady as mister Gray stopped to take the breath he had lost in his hurry I did not know he was in the commission He is only just appointed he took the oaths not a month ago more s the pity I do not understand why you should regret it The Lathoms have held Hathaway since Edward the First and mister Lathom bears a good character although his temper is hasty My lady he has committed Job Gregson for stealing a fault of which he is as innocent as I and all the evidence goes to prove it now that the case is brought before the Bench only the Squires hang so together that they can t be brought to see justice and are all for sending Job to gaol out of compliment to mister Lathom saying it his first committal and it won t be civil to tell him there is no evidence against his man For God s sake my lady speak to the gentlemen they will attend to you while they only tell me to mind my own business Now my lady was always inclined to stand by her order and the Lathoms of Hathaway Court were cousins to the Hanbury s Besides it was rather a point of honour in those days to encourage a young magistrate by passing a pretty sharp sentence on his first committals and Job Gregson was the father of a girl who had been lately turned away from her place as scullery maid for sauciness to missus Adams her ladyship s own maid and mister Gray had not said a word of the reasons why he believed the man innocent for he was in such a hurry I believe he would have had my lady drive off to the Henley Court house then and there so there seemed a good deal against the man and nothing but mister Gray s bare word for him and my lady drew herself a little up and said mister Gray I do not see what reason either you or I have to interfere mister Harry Lathom is a sensible kind of young man well capable of ascertaining the truth without our help But more evidence has come out since broke in mister Gray My lady went a little stiffer and spoke a little more coldly I suppose this additional evidence is before the justices men of good family and of honour and credit well known in the county They naturally feel that the opinion of one of themselves must have more weight than the words of a man like Job Gregson who bears a very indifferent character has been strongly suspected of poaching coming from no one knows where squatting on Hareman s Common which by the way is extra parochial I believe consequently you as a clergyman are not responsible for what goes on there and although impolitic there might be some truth in what the magistrates said in advising you to mind your own business said her ladyship smiling and they might be tempted to bid me mind mine if I interfered mister Gray might they not He looked extremely uncomfortable half angry Once or twice he began to speak but checked himself as if his words would not have been wise or prudent At last he said It may seem presumptuous in me a stranger of only a few weeks standing to set up my judgment as to men s character against that of residents Lady Ludlow gave a little bow of acquiescence which was I think involuntary on her part and which I don t think he perceived but I am convinced that the man is innocent of this offence and besides the justices themselves allege this ridiculous custom of paying a compliment to a newly appointed magistrate as their only reason That unlucky word ridiculous It undid all the good his modest beginning had done him with my lady I knew as well as words could have told me that she was affronted at the expression being used by a man inferior in rank to those whose actions he applied it to and truly it was a great want of tact considering to whom he was speaking Lady Ludlow spoke very gently and slowly she always did so when she was annoyed it was a certain sign the meaning of which we had all learnt I think mister Gray we will drop the subject It is one on which we are not likely to agree mister Gray s ruddy colour grew purple and then faded away and his face became pale I think both my lady and he had forgotten our presence and we were beginning to feel too awkward to wish to remind them of it And yet we could not help watching and listening with the greatest interest mister Gray drew himself up to his full height with an unconscious feeling of dignity Little as was his stature and awkward and embarrassed as he had been only a few minutes before I remember thinking he looked almost as grand as my lady when he spoke Your ladyship must remember that it may be my duty to speak to my parishioners on many subjects on which they do not agree with me I am not at liberty to be silent because they differ in opinion from me Lady Ludlow s great blue eyes dilated with surprise and I do think anger at being thus spoken to I am not sure whether it was very wise in mister Gray He himself looked afraid of the consequences but as if he was determined to bear them without flinching For a minute there was silence Then my lady replied mister Gray I respect your plain speaking although I may wonder whether a young man of your age and position has any right to assume that he is a better judge than one with the experience which I have naturally gained at my time of life and in the station I hold If I madam as the clergyman of this parish am not to shrink from telling what I believe to be the truth to the poor and lowly no more am I to hold my peace in the presence of the rich and titled mister Gray s face showed that he was in that state of excitement which in a child would have ended in a good fit of crying He looked as if he had nerved himself up to doing and saying things which he disliked above everything and which nothing short of serious duty could have compelled him to do and say And at such times every minute circumstance which could add to pain comes vividly before one I saw that he became aware of our presence and that it added to his discomfiture My lady flushed up Are you aware sir asked she that you have gone far astray from the original subject of conversation But as you talk of your parish allow me to remind you that Hareman s Common is beyond the bounds and that you are really not responsible for the characters and lives of the squatters on that unlucky piece of ground Madam I see I have only done harm in speaking to you about the affair at all I beg your pardon and take my leave He bowed and looked very sad Lady Ludlow caught the expression of his face Good morning she cried in rather a louder and quicker way than that in which she had been speaking Remember Job Gregson is a notorious poacher and evildoer and you really are not responsible for what goes on at Hareman s Common He was near the hall door and said something half to himself which we heard being nearer to him but my lady did not although she saw that he spoke What did he say she asked in a somewhat hurried manner as soon as the door was closed I did not hear We looked at each other and then I spoke He said my lady that God help him he was responsible for all the evil he did not strive to overcome My lady turned sharp round away from us and Mary Mason said afterwards she thought her ladyship was much vexed with both of us for having been present and with me for having repeated what mister Gray had said But it was not our fault that we were in the hall and when my lady asked what mister Gray had said I thought it right to tell her In a few minutes she bade us accompany her in her ride in the coach Lady Ludlow always sat forwards by herself and we girls backwards Somehow this was a rule which we never thought of questioning It was true that riding backwards made some of us feel very uncomfortable and faint and to remedy this my lady always drove with both windows open which occasionally gave her the rheumatism but we always went on in the old way This day she did not pay any great attention to the road by which we were going and Coachman took his own way We were very silent as my lady did not speak and looked very serious Or else in general she made these rides very pleasant to those who were not qualmish with riding backwards by talking to us in a very agreeable manner and telling us of the different things which had happened to her at various places at Paris and Versailles where she had been in her youth at Windsor and Kew and Weymouth where she had been with the Queen when maid of honour and so on But this day she did not talk at all All at once she put her head out of the window John Footman said she where are we Surely this is Hareman s Common Yes an t please my lady said John Footman and waited for further speech or orders My lady thought a while and then said she would have the steps put down and get out As soon as she was gone we looked at each other and then without a word began to gaze after her We saw her pick her dainty way in the little high heeled shoes she always wore because they had been in fashion in her youth among the yellow pools of stagnant water that had gathered in the clayey soil John Footman followed stately after afraid too for all his stateliness of splashing his pure white stockings Suddenly my lady turned round and said something to him and he returned to the carriage with a half pleased half puzzled air My lady went on to a cluster of rude mud houses at the higher end of the Common cottages built as they were occasionally at that day of wattles and clay and thatched with sods As far as we could make out from dumb show Lady Ludlow saw enough of the interiors of these places to make her hesitate before entering or even speaking to any of the children who were playing about in the puddles After a pause she disappeared into one of the cottages It seemed to us a long time before she came out but I dare say it was not more than eight or ten minutes She came back with her head hanging down as if to choose her way but we saw it was more in thought and bewilderment than for any such purpose She had not made up her mind where we should drive to when she got into the carriage again John Footman stood bare headed waiting for orders To Hathaway My dears if you are tired or if you have anything to do for missus Medlicott I can drop you at Barford Corner and it is but a quarter of an hour s brisk walk home But luckily we could safely say that missus Medlicott did not want us and as we had whispered to each other as we sat alone in the coach that surely my lady must have gone to Job Gregson s we were far too anxious to know the end of it all to say that we were tired So we all set off to Hathaway mister Harry Lathom was a bachelor squire thirty or thirty five years of age more at home in the field than in the drawing room and with sporting men than with ladies My lady did not alight of course it was mister Lathom s place to wait upon her and she bade the butler who had a smack of the gamekeeper in him very unlike our own powdered venerable fine gentleman at Hanbury tell his master with her compliments that she wished to speak to him You may think how pleased we were to find that we should hear all that was said though I think afterwards we were half sorry when we saw how our presence confused the squire who would have found it bad enough to answer my lady s questions even without two eager girls for audience Pray mister Lathom began my lady something abruptly for her but she was very full of her subject what is this I hear about Job Gregson mister Lathom looked annoyed and vexed but dared not show it in his words I gave out a warrant against him my lady for theft that is all You are doubtless aware of his character a man who sets nets and springes in long cover and fishes wherever he takes a fancy It is but a short step from poaching to thieving That is quite true replied Lady Ludlow who had a horror of poaching for this very reason but I imagine you do not send a man to gaol on account of his bad character Rogues and vagabonds said mister Lathom A man may be sent to prison for being a vagabond for no specific act but for his general mode of life He had the better of her ladyship for one moment but then she answered But in this case the charge on which you committed him is for theft now his wife tells me he can prove he was some miles distant from Holmwood where the robbery took place all that afternoon she says you had the evidence before you mister Lathom here interrupted my lady by saying in a somewhat sulky manner No such evidence was brought before me when I gave the warrant I am not answerable for the other magistrates decision when they had more evidence before them It was they who committed him to gaol I am not responsible for that My lady did not often show signs of impatience but we knew she was feeling irritated by the little perpetual tapping of her high heeled shoe against the bottom of the carriage About the same time we sitting backwards caught a glimpse of mister Gray through the open door standing in the shadow of the hall Doubtless Lady Ludlow s arrival had interrupted a conversation between mister Lathom and mister Gray The latter must have heard every word of what she was saying but of this she was not aware and caught at mister Lathom s disclaimer of responsibility with pretty much the same argument which she had heard through our repetition that mister Gray had used not two hours before And do you mean to say mister Lathom that you don t consider yourself responsible for all injustice or wrong doing that you might have prevented and have not Nay in this case the first germ of injustice was your own mistake I wish you had been with me a little while ago and seen the misery in that poor fellow s cottage She spoke lower and mister Gray drew near in a sort of involuntary manner as if to hear all she was saying We saw him and doubtless mister Lathom heard his footstep and knew who it was that was listening behind him and approving of every word that was said He grew yet more sullen in manner but still my lady was my lady and he dared not speak out before her as he would have done to mister Gray Lady Ludlow however caught the look of stubborness in his face and it roused her as I had never seen her roused I am sure you will not refuse sir to accept my bail I offer to bail the fellow out and to be responsible for his appearance at the sessions What say you to that mister Lathom The offence of theft is not bailable my lady Not in ordinary cases I dare say But I imagine this is an extraordinary case The man is sent to prison out of compliment to you and against all evidence as far as I can learn He will have to rot in gaol for two months and his wife and children to starve I Lady Ludlow offer to bail him out and pledge myself for his appearance at next quarter sessions It is against the law my lady Bah Bah Bah Who makes laws Such as I in the House of Lords such as you in the House of Commons We who make the laws in saint Stephen s may break the mere forms of them when we have right on our sides on our own land and amongst our own people The lord lieutenant may take away my commission if he heard of it And a very good thing for the county Harry Lathom and for you too if he did if you don t go on more wisely than you have begun A pretty set you and your brother magistrates are to administer justice through the land I always said a good despotism was the best form of government and I am twice as much in favour of it now I see what a quorum is My dears suddenly turning round to us if it would not tire you to walk home I would beg mister Lathom to take a seat in my coach and we would drive to Henley Gaol and have the poor man out at once A walk over the fields at this time of day is hardly fitting for young ladies to take alone said mister Lathom anxious no doubt to escape from his tete a tete drive with my lady and possibly not quite prepared to go to the illegal length of prompt measures which she had in contemplation But mister Gray now stepped forward too anxious for the release of the prisoner to allow any obstacle to intervene which he could do away with To see Lady Ludlow s face when she first perceived whom she had had for auditor and spectator of her interview with mister Lathom was as good as a play She had been doing and saying the very things she had been so much annoyed at mister Gray s saying and proposing only an hour or two ago She had been setting down mister Lathom pretty smartly in the presence of the very man to whom she had spoken of that gentleman as so sensible and of such a standing in the county that it was presumption to question his doings But before mister Gray had finished his offer of escorting us back to Hanbury Court my lady had recovered herself There was neither surprise nor displeasure in her manner as she answered I thank you mister Gray I was not aware that you were here but I think I can understand on what errand you came And seeing you here recalls me to a duty I owe mister Lathom mister Lathom I have spoken to you pretty plainly forgetting until I saw mister Gray that only this very afternoon I differed from him on this very question taking completely at that time the same view of the whole subject which you have done thinking that the county would be well rid of such a man as Job Gregson whether he had committed this theft or not mister Gray and I did not part quite friends she continued bowing towards him but it so happened that I saw Job Gregson s wife and home I felt that mister Gray had been right and I had been wrong so with the famous inconsistency of my sex I came hither to scold you smiling towards mister Lathom who looked half sulky yet and did not relax a bit of his gravity at her smile for holding the same opinions that I had done an hour before mister Gray again bowing towards him these young ladies will be very much obliged to you for your escort and so shall I mister Lathom may I beg of you to accompany me to Henley mister Gray bowed very low and went very red mister Lathom said something which we none of us heard but which was I think some remonstrance against the course he was as it were compelled to take Lady Ludlow however took no notice of his murmur but sat in an attitude of polite expectancy and as we turned off on our walk I saw mister Lathom getting into the coach with the air of a whipped hound I must say considering my lady s feeling I did not envy him his ride though I believe he was quite in the right as to the object of the ride being illegal Our walk home was very dull We had no fears and would far rather have been without the awkward blushing young man into which mister Gray had sunk At every stile he hesitated sometimes he half got over it thinking that he could assist us better in that way then he would turn back unwilling to go before ladies He had no ease of manner as my lady once said of him though on any occasion of duty he had an immense deal of dignity CHAPTER III 
7265-74918-0000	train-other-500	As far as I can remember it was very soon after this that I first began to have the pain in my hip which has ended in making me a cripple for life I hardly recollect more than one walk after our return under mister Gray s escort from mister Lathom s
7265-74918-0001	train-other-500	Indeed at the time I was not without suspicions which I never named that the beginning of all the mischief was a great jump I had taken from the top of one of the stiles on that very occasion Well it is a long while ago and God disposes of us all
7265-74918-0002	train-other-500	and I am not going to tire you out with telling you how I thought and felt and how when I saw what my life was to be I could hardly bring myself to be patient but rather wished to die at once
none	none	 You can every one of you think for yourselves what becoming all at once useless and unable to move and by and by growing hopeless of cure and feeling that one must be a burden to some one all one s life long would be to an active wilful strong girl of seventeen anxious to get on in the world so as if possible to help her brothers and sisters So I shall only say that one among the blessings which arose out of what seemed at the time a great black sorrow was that Lady Ludlow for many years took me as it were into her own especial charge and now as I lie still and alone in my old age it is such a pleasure to think of her 
7265-74918-0003	train-other-500	missus Medlicott was great as a nurse and I am sure I can never be grateful enough to her memory for all her kindness But she was puzzled to know how to manage me in other ways I used to have long hard fits of crying
7265-74918-0004	train-other-500	and thinking that I ought to go home and yet what could they do with me there and a hundred and fifty other anxious thoughts some of which I could tell to missus Medlicott and others I could not Her way of comforting me was hurrying away for some kind of tempting or strengthening food
none	none	 a basin of melted calves foot jelly was I am sure she thought a cure for every woe 
7265-74918-0005	train-other-500	There take it dear take it she would say
none	none	 and don t go on fretting for what can t be helped 
7265-74918-0006	train-other-500	But I think she got puzzled at length at the non efficacy of good things to eat and one day after I had limped down to see the doctor in missus Medlicott s sitting room a room lined with cupboards containing preserves and dainties of all kinds which she perpetually made and never touched herself
7265-74918-0007	train-other-500	when I was returning to my bed room to cry away the afternoon under pretence of arranging my clothes John Footman brought me a message from my lady with whom the doctor had been having a conversation to bid me go to her in that private sitting room at the end of the suite of apartments
7265-74918-0008	train-other-500	about which I spoke in describing the day of my first arrival at Hanbury I had hardly been in it since as when we read to my lady she generally sat in the small withdrawing room out of which this private room of hers opened
none	none	 I suppose great people do not require what we smaller people value so much 
7265-74918-0009	train-other-500	I mean privacy I do not think that there was a room which my lady occupied that had not two doors and some of them had three or four
none	none	 Then my lady had always Adams waiting upon her in her bed chamber 
7265-74918-0010	train-other-500	and it was missus Medlicott s duty to sit within call as it were in a sort of anteroom that led out of my lady s own sitting room on the opposite side to the drawing room door
none	none	 To fancy the house you must take a great square and halve it by a line at one end of this line was the hall door or public entrance at the opposite the private entrance from a terrace which was terminated at one end by a sort of postern door in an old gray stone wall 
7265-74918-0011	train-other-500	beyond which lay the farm buildings and offices so that people could come in this way to my lady on business while if she were going into the garden from her own room she had nothing to do but to pass through missus Medlicott s apartment out into the lesser hall
7265-74918-0012	train-other-500	and then turning to the right as she passed on to the terrace she could go down the flight of broad shallow steps at the corner of the house into the lovely garden with stretching sweeping lawns and gay flower beds and beautiful bossy laurels and other blooming or massy shrubs
7265-74918-0013	train-other-500	with full grown beeches or larches feathering down to the ground a little farther off The whole was set in a frame as it were by the more distant woodlands The house had been modernized in the days of Queen Anne I think
none	none	 but the money had fallen short that was requisite to carry out all the improvements 
7265-74918-0014	train-other-500	so it was only the suite of withdrawing rooms and the terrace rooms as far as the private entrance that had the new long high windows put in and these were old enough by this time to be draped with roses and honeysuckles and pyracanthus winter and summer long
7265-74918-0015	train-other-500	Well to go back to that day when I limped into my lady s sitting room trying hard to look as if I had not been crying and not to walk as if I was in much pain I do not know whether my lady saw how near my tears were to my eyes
none	none	 but she told me she had sent for me because she wanted some help in arranging the drawers of her bureau and asked me just as if it was a favour I was to do her if I could sit down in the easy chair near the window all quietly arranged before I came in with a footstool and a table quite near and assist her You will wonder perhaps why I was not bidden to sit or lie on the sofa 
7265-74918-0016	train-other-500	but although I found one there a morning or two afterwards when I came down
none	none	 the fact was that there was none in the room at this time I have even fancied that the easy chair was brought in on purpose for me for it was not the chair in which I remembered my lady sitting the first time I saw her That chair was very much carved and gilded with a countess coronet at the top 
7265-74918-0017	train-other-500	I tried it one day some time afterwards when my lady was out of the room and I had a fancy for seeing how I could move about and very uncomfortable it was Now my chair as I learnt to call it and to think it was soft and luxurious
7265-74918-0018	train-other-500	and seemed somehow to give one s body rest just in that part where one most needed it I was not at my ease that first day nor indeed for many days afterwards notwithstanding my chair was so comfortable
7265-74918-0019	train-other-500	Yet I forgot my sad pain in silently wondering over the meaning of many of the things we turned out of those curious old drawers I was puzzled to know why some were kept at all a scrap of writing maybe with only half a dozen common place words written on it or a bit of broken riding whip
none	none	 and here and there a stone of which I thought I could have picked up twenty just as good in the first walk I took 
7265-74918-0020	train-other-500	But it seems that was just my ignorance for my lady told me they were pieces of valuable marble used to make the floors of the great Roman emperors palaces long ago
none	none	 and that when she had been a girl and made the grand tour long ago her cousin Sir Horace Mann the Ambassador or Envoy at Florence had told her to be sure to go into the fields inside the walls of ancient Rome when the farmers were preparing the ground for the onion sowing and had to make the soil fine and pick up what bits of marble she could find 
7265-74918-0021	train-other-500	She had done so and meant to have had them made into a table but somehow that plan fell through
none	none	 and there they were with all the dirt out of the onion field upon them but once when I thought of cleaning them with soap and water at any rate she bade me not to do so for it was Roman dirt earth I think she called it but it was dirt all the same 
7265-74918-0022	train-other-500	Then in this bureau were many other things the value of which I could understand locks of hair carefully ticketed which my lady looked at very sadly and lockets and bracelets with miniatures in them very small pictures to what they make now a days and called miniatures
7265-74918-0023	train-other-500	some of them had even to be looked at through a microscope before you could see the individual expression of the faces or how beautifully they were painted I don t think that looking at these made may lady seem so melancholy as the seeing and touching of the hair did
7265-74918-0024	train-other-500	But to be sure the hair was as it were a part of some beloved body which she might never touch and caress again but which lay beneath the turf all faded and disfigured except perhaps the very hair from which the lock she held had been dissevered whereas the pictures were but pictures after all
7265-74918-0025	train-other-500	likenesses but not the very things themselves This is only my own conjecture mind My lady rarely spoke out her feelings For to begin with she was of rank and I have heard her say that people of rank do not talk about their feelings except to their equals
none	none	 and even to them they conceal them except upon rare occasions Secondly and this is my own reflection she was an only child and an heiress and as such was more apt to think than to talk as all well brought up heiresses must be I think 
7265-74918-0026	train-other-500	Thirdly she had long been a widow without any companion of her own age with whom it would have been natural for her to refer to old associations past pleasures or mutual sorrows missus Medlicott came nearest to her as a companion of this sort
7265-74918-0027	train-other-500	and her ladyship talked more to missus Medlicott in a kind of familiar way than she did to all the rest of the household put together But missus Medlicott was silent by nature and did not reply at any great length Adams indeed was the only one who spoke much to Lady Ludlow
7265-74918-0028	train-other-500	After we had worked away about an hour at the bureau her ladyship said we had done enough for one day and as the time was come for her afternoon ride she left me with a volume of engravings from mister Hogarth s pictures on one side of me
7265-74918-0029	train-other-500	I don t like to write down the names of them though my lady thought nothing of it I am sure and upon a stand her great prayer book open at the evening psalms for the day on the other But as soon as she was gone I troubled myself little with either but amused myself with looking round the room at my leisure
none	none	 The side on which the fire place stood was all panelled part of the old ornaments of the house for there was an Indian paper with birds and beasts and insects on it on all the other sides There were coats of arms of the various families with whom the Hanburys had intermarried all over these panels 
7265-74918-0030	train-other-500	and up and down the ceiling as well There was very little looking glass in the room though one of the great drawing rooms was called the Mirror Room because it was lined with glass which my lady s great grandfather had brought from Venice when he was ambassador there
7265-74918-0031	train-other-500	There were china jars of all shapes and sizes round and about the room and some china monsters or idols of which I could never bear the sight they were so ugly though I think my lady valued them more than all
none	none	 There was a thick carpet on the middle of the floor which was made of small pieces of rare wood fitted into a pattern the doors were opposite to each other and were composed of two heavy tall wings and opened in the middle moving on brass grooves inserted into the floor they would not have opened over a carpet There were two windows reaching up nearly to the ceiling but very narrow and with deep window seats in the thickness of the wall 
7265-74918-0032	train-other-500	The room was full of scent partly from the flowers outside and partly from the great jars of pot pourri inside The choice of odours was what my lady piqued herself upon saying nothing showed birth like a keen susceptibility of smell
7265-74918-0033	train-other-500	We never named musk in her presence her antipathy to it was so well understood through the household her opinion on the subject was believed to be that no scent derived from an animal could ever be of a sufficiently pure nature to give pleasure to any person of good family
7265-74918-0034	train-other-500	where of course the delicate perception of the senses had been cultivated for generations
none	none	 She would instance the way in which sportsmen preserve the breed of dogs who have shown keen scent and how such gifts descend for generations amongst animals who cannot be supposed to have anything of ancestral pride or hereditary fancies about them Musk then was never mentioned at Hanbury Court 
7265-74918-0035	train-other-500	No more were bergamot or southern wood although vegetable in their nature She considered these two latter as betraying a vulgar taste in the person who chose to gather or wear them She was sorry to notice sprigs of them in the button hole of any young man in whom she took an interest
none	none	 either because he was engaged to a servant of hers or otherwise 
7265-74918-0036	train-other-500	as he came out of church on a Sunday afternoon
none	none	 She was afraid that he liked coarse pleasures and I am not sure if she did not think that his preference for these coarse sweetnesses did not imply a probability that he would take to drinking 
7265-74918-0037	train-other-500	But she distinguished between vulgar and common Violets pinks and sweetbriar were common enough roses and mignionette for those who had gardens honeysuckle for those who walked along the bowery lanes but wearing them betrayed no vulgarity of taste
none	none	 the queen upon her throne might be glad to smell at a nosegay of the flowers 
7265-74918-0038	train-other-500	A beau pot as we called it of pinks and roses freshly gathered was placed every morning that they were in bloom on my lady s own particular table
none	none	 For lasting vegetable odours she preferred lavender and sweet woodroof to any extract whatever Lavender reminded her of old customs she said and of homely cottage gardens and many a cottager made his offering to her of a bundle of lavender 
7265-74918-0039	train-other-500	Sweet woodroof again grew in wild woodland places where the soil was fine and the air delicate the poor children used to go and gather it for her up in the woods on the higher lands and for this service she always rewarded them with bright new pennies of which my lord her son
none	none	 used to send her down a bagful fresh from the Mint in London every February Attar of roses again she disliked She said it reminded her of the city and of merchants wives over rich over heavy in its perfume And lilies of the valley somehow fell under the same condemnation They were most graceful and elegant to look at my lady was quite candid about this flower leaf colour everything was refined about them but the smell That was too strong 
7265-74918-0040	train-other-500	But the great hereditary faculty on which my lady piqued herself and with reason for I never met with any person who possessed it was the power she had of perceiving the delicious odour arising from a bed of strawberries in the late autumn when the leaves were all fading and dying
7265-74918-0041	train-other-500	Bacon s Essays was one of the few books that lay about in my lady s room and if you took it up and opened it carelessly it was sure to fall apart at his Essay on Gardens Listen her ladyship would say to what that great philosopher and statesman says
none	none	 Next to that he is speaking of violets my dear is the musk rose 
7265-74918-0042	train-other-500	of which you remember the great bush at the corner of the south wall just by the Blue Drawing room windows that is the old musk rose Shakespeare s musk rose which is dying out through the kingdom now But to return to my Lord Bacon
none	none	 Then the strawberry leaves dying with a most excellent cordial smell Now the Hanburys can always smell this excellent cordial odour and very delicious and refreshing it is You see in Lord Bacon s time there had not been so many intermarriages between the court and the city as there have been since the needy days of his Majesty Charles the Second and altogether in the time of Queen Elizabeth the great old families of England were a distinct race just as a cart horse is one creature and very useful in its place and Childers or Eclipse is another creature though both are of the same species So the old families have gifts and powers of a different and higher class to what the other orders have My dear remember that you try if you can smell the scent of dying strawberry leaves in this next autumn You have some of Ursula Hanbury s blood in you and that gives you a chance But when October came I sniffed and sniffed and all to no purpose and my lady who had watched the little experiment rather anxiously had to give me up as a hybrid I was mortified I confess 
7265-74918-0043	train-other-500	and thought that it was in some ostentation of her own powers that she ordered the gardener to plant a border of strawberries on that side of the terrace that lay under her windows I have wandered away from time and place
none	none	 I tell you all the remembrances I have of those years just as they come up and I hope that in my old age I am not getting too like a certain missus Nickleby whose speeches were once read out aloud to me I came by degrees to be all day long in this room which I have been describing 
7265-74918-0044	train-other-500	sometimes sitting in the easy chair doing some little piece of dainty work for my lady
none	none	 or sometimes arranging flowers or sorting letters according to their handwriting so that she could arrange them afterwards and destroy or keep as she planned looking ever onward to her death Then after the sofa was brought in she would watch my face and if she saw my colour change she would bid me lie down and rest And I used to try to walk upon the terrace every day for a short time it hurt me very much it is true but the doctor had ordered it and I knew her ladyship wished me to obey Before I had seen the background of a great lady s life I had thought it all play and fine doings But whatever other grand people are my lady was never idle For one thing she had to superintend the agent for the large Hanbury estate I believe it was mortgaged for a sum of money which had gone to improve the late lord s Scotch lands but she was anxious to pay off this before her death and so to leave her own inheritance free of incumbrance to her son the present Earl whom I secretly think she considered a greater person as being the heir of the Hanburys though through a female line 
7265-74918-0045	train-other-500	than as being my Lord Ludlow with half a dozen other minor titles With this wish of releasing her property from the mortgage skilful care was much needed in the management of it and as far as my lady could go she took every pains
7265-74918-0046	train-other-500	She had a great book in which every page was ruled into three divisions on the first column was written the date and the name of the tenant who addressed any letter on business to her on the second was briefly stated the subject of the letter which generally contained a request of some kind
none	none	 This request would be surrounded and enveloped in so many words and often inserted amidst so many odd reasons and excuses that mister Horner the steward would sometimes say it was like hunting through a bushel of chaff to find a grain of wheat 
7265-74918-0047	train-other-500	Now in the second column of this book the grain of meaning was placed clean and dry before her ladyship every morning She sometimes would ask to see the original letter sometimes she simply answered the request by a Yes or a No
none	none	 and often she would send for lenses and papers and examine them well 
7265-74918-0048	train-other-500	with mister Horner at her elbow to see if such petitions as to be allowed to plough up pasture fields were provided for in the terms of the original agreement On every Thursday she made herself at liberty to see her tenants from four to six in the afternoon
7265-74918-0049	train-other-500	Mornings would have suited my lady better as far as convenience went and I believe the old custom had been to have these levees as her ladyship used to call them held before twelve But as she said to mister Horner when he urged returning to the former hours
none	none	 it spoilt a whole day for a farmer if he had to dress himself in his best and leave his work in the forenoon 
7265-74918-0050	train-other-500	and my lady liked to see her tenants come in their Sunday clothes she would not say a word maybe but she would take her spectacles slowly out and put them on with silent gravity and look at a dirty or raggedly dressed man so solemnly and earnestly
none	none	 that his nerves must have been pretty strong if he did not wince 
7265-74918-0051	train-other-500	and resolve that however poor he might be
none	none	 soap and water and needle and thread should be used before he again appeared in her ladyship s anteroom The out lying tenants had always a supper provided for them in the servants hall on Thursdays to which indeed all comers were welcome to sit down 
7265-74918-0052	train-other-500	For my lady said though there were not many hours left of a working man s day when their business with her was ended
none	none	 yet that they needed food and rest and that she should be ashamed if they sought either at the Fighting Lion called at this day the Hanbury Arms They had as much beer as they could drink while they were eating and when the food was cleared away they had a cup a piece of good ale in which the oldest tenant present standing up gave Madam s health and after that was drunk they were expected to set off homewards 
7265-74918-0053	train-other-500	at any rate no more liquor was given them The tenants one and all called her Madam for they recognized in her the married heiress of the Hanburys not the widow of a Lord Ludlow of whom they and their forefathers knew nothing
none	none	 and against whose memory indeed there rankled a dim unspoken grudge the cause of which was accurately known to the very few who understood the nature of a mortgage and were therefore aware that Madam s money had been taken to enrich my lord s poor land in Scotland 
7265-74918-0054	train-other-500	I am sure for you can understand I was behind the scenes as it were and had many an opportunity of seeing and hearing as I lay or sat motionless in my lady s room with the double doors open between it and the anteroom beyond
none	none	 where Lady Ludlow saw her steward and gave audience to her tenants I am certain I say that mister Horner was silently as much annoyed at the money that was swallowed up by this mortgage as any one 
7265-74918-0055	train-other-500	and some time or other he had probably spoken his mind out to my lady
none	none	 for there was a sort of offended reference on her part and respectful submission to blame on his 
7265-74918-0056	train-other-500	while every now and then there was an implied protest whenever the payments of the interest became due or whenever my lady stinted herself of any personal expense such as mister Horner thought was only decorous and becoming in the heiress of the Hanburys
none	none	 Her carriages were old and cumbrous wanting all the improvements which had been adopted by those of her rank throughout the county mister Horner would fain have had the ordering of a new coach The carriage horses too were getting past their work yet all the promising colts bred on the estate were sold for ready money and so on My lord her son was ambassador at some foreign place and very proud we all were of his glory and dignity but I fancy it cost money 
7265-74918-0057	train-other-500	and my lady would have lived on bread and water sooner than have called upon him to help her in paying off the mortgage although he was the one who was to benefit by it in the end mister Horner was a very faithful steward and very respectful to my lady
none	none	 although sometimes I thought she was sharper to him than to any one else 
7265-74918-0058	train-other-500	perhaps because she knew that although he never said anything he disapproved of the Hanburys being made to pay for the Earl Ludlow s estates and state The late lord had been a sailor and had been as extravagant in his habits as most sailors are I am told for I never saw the sea
7265-74918-0059	train-other-500	and yet he had a long sight to his own interests but whatever he was my lady loved him and his memory with about as fond and proud a love as ever wife gave husband I should think
none	none	 For a part of his life mister Horner who was born on the Hanbury property had been a clerk to an attorney in Birmingham and these few years had given him a kind of worldly wisdom which though always exerted for her benefit was antipathetic to her ladyship who thought that some of her steward s maxims savoured of trade and commerce I fancy that if it had been possible she would have preferred a return to the primitive system of living on the produce of the land and exchanging the surplus for such articles as were needed without the intervention of money But mister Horner was bitten with new fangled notions as she would say 
7265-74918-0060	train-other-500	though his new fangled notions were what folk at the present day would think sadly behindhand and some of mister Gray s ideas fell on mister Horner s mind like sparks on tow though they started from two different points
none	none	 mister Horner wanted to make every man useful and active in this world and to direct as much activity and usefulness as possible to the improvement of the Hanbury estates and the aggrandisement of the Hanbury family 
7265-74918-0061	train-other-500	and therefore he fell into the new cry for education mister Gray did not care much mister Horner thought not enough for this world and where any man or family stood in their earthly position
none	none	 but he would have every one prepared for the world to come 
7265-74918-0062	train-other-500	and capable of understanding and receiving certain doctrines for which latter purpose it stands to reason he must have heard of these doctrines and therefore mister Gray wanted education The answer in the Catechism that mister Horner was most fond of calling upon a child to repeat was that to
7265-74918-0063	train-other-500	What is thy duty towards thy neighbour The answer mister Gray liked best to hear repeated with unction was that to the question What is the inward and spiritual grace
none	none	 The reply to which Lady Ludlow bent her head the lowest as we said our Catechism to her on Sundays was to 
7265-74918-0064	train-other-500	What is thy duty towards God But neither mister Horner nor mister Gray had heard many answers to the Catechism as yet Up to this time there was no Sunday school in Hanbury mister Gray s desires were bounded by that object
none	none	 mister Horner looked farther on he hoped for a day school at some future time to train up intelligent labourers for working on the estate My lady would hear of neither one nor the other indeed not the boldest man whom she ever saw would have dared to name the project of a day school within her hearing So mister Horner contented himself with quietly teaching a sharp clever lad to read and write with a view to making use of him as a kind of foreman in process of time He had his pick of the farm lads for this purpose and as the brightest and sharpest although by far the raggedest and dirtiest singled out Job Gregson s son But all this as my lady never listened to gossip or indeed was spoken to unless she spoke first was quite unknown to her until the unlucky incident took place which I am going to relate CHAPTER IV I think my lady was not aware of mister Horner s views on education as making men into more useful members of society or the practice to which he was putting his precepts in taking Harry Gregson as pupil and protege if indeed she were aware of Harry s distinct existence at all until the following unfortunate occasion The anteroom which was a kind of business place for my lady to receive her steward and tenants in was surrounded by shelves I cannot call them book shelves though there were many books on them but the contents of the volumes were principally manuscript and relating to details connected with the Hanbury property There were also one or two dictionaries gazetteers works of reference on the management of property all of a very old date the dictionary was Bailey s I remember we had a great Johnson in my lady s room but where lexicographers differed she generally preferred Bailey In this antechamber a footman generally sat awaiting orders from my lady for she clung to the grand old customs and despised any bells except her own little hand bell as modern inventions she would have her people always within summons of this silvery bell or her scarce less silvery voice This man had not the sinecure you might imagine He had to reply to the private entrance what we should call the back door in a smaller house As none came to the front door but my lady and those of the county whom she honoured by visiting and her nearest acquaintance of this kind lived eight miles of bad road off the majority of comers knocked at the nail studded terrace door not to have it opened for open it stood by my lady s orders winter and summer so that the snow often drifted into the back hall and lay there in heaps when the weather was severe but to summon some one to receive their message or carry their request to be allowed to speak to my lady I remember it was long before mister Gray could be made to understand that the great door was only open on state occasions and even to the last he would as soon come in by that as the terrace entrance I had been received there on my first setting foot over my lady s threshold every stranger was led in by that way the first time they came but after that with the exceptions I have named they went round by the terrace as it were by instinct It was an assistance to this instinct to be aware that from time immemorial the magnificent and fierce Hanbury wolf hounds which were extinct in every other part of the island had been and still were kept chained in the front quadrangle where they bayed through a great part of the day and night and were always ready with their deep savage growl at the sight of every person and thing excepting the man who fed them my lady s carriage and four and my lady herself It was pretty to see her small figure go up to the great crouching brutes thumping the flags with their heavy wagging tails and slobbering in an ecstacy of delight at her light approach and soft caress She had no fear of them but she was a Hanbury born and the tale went that they and their kind knew all Hanburys instantly and acknowledged their supremacy ever since the ancestors of the breed had been brought from the East by the great Sir Urian Hanbury who lay with his legs crossed on the altar tomb in the church Moreover it was reported that not fifty years before one of these dogs had eaten up a child which had inadvertently strayed within reach of its chain So you may imagine how most people preferred the terrace door mister Gray did not seem to care for the dogs It might be absence of mind for I have heard of his starting away from their sudden spring when he had unwittingly walked within reach of their chains but it could hardly have been absence of mind when one day he went right up to one of them and patted him in the most friendly manner the dog meanwhile looking pleased and affably wagging his tail just as if mister Gray had been a Hanbury We were all very much puzzled by this and to this day I have not been able to account for it But now let us go back to the terrace door and the footman sitting in the antechamber One morning we heard a parleying which rose to such a vehemence and lasted for so long that my lady had to ring her hand bell twice before the footman heard it What is the matter John asked she when he entered A little boy my lady who says he comes from mister Horner and must see your ladyship Impudent little lad This last to himself What does he want That s just what I have asked him my lady but he won t tell me please your ladyship It is probably some message from mister Horner said Lady Ludlow with just a shade of annoyance in her manner for it was against all etiquette to send a message to her and by such a messenger too No please your ladyship I asked him if he had any message and he said no he had none but he must see your ladyship for all that You had better show him in then without more words said her ladyship quietly but still as I have said rather annoyed As if in mockery of the humble visitor the footman threw open both battants of the door and in the opening there stood a lithe wiry lad with a thick head of hair standing out in every direction as if stirred by some electrical current a short brown face red now from affright and excitement wide resolute mouth and bright deep set eyes which glanced keenly and rapidly round the room as if taking in everything and all was new and strange to be thought and puzzled over at some future time He knew enough of manners not to speak first to one above him in rank or else he was afraid What do you want with me asked my lady in so gentle a tone that it seemed to surprise and stun him An t please your ladyship said he as if he had been deaf You come from mister Horner s why do you want to see me again asked she a little more loudly An t please your ladyship mister Horner was sent for all on a sudden to Warwick this morning His face began to work but he felt it and closed his lips into a resolute form Well And he went off all on a sudden like Well And he left a note for your ladyship with me your ladyship Is that all You might have given it to the footman Please your ladyship I ve clean gone and lost it He never took his eyes off her face If he had not kept his look fixed he would have burst out crying That was very careless said my lady gently But I am sure you are very sorry for it You had better try and find it it may have been of consequence Please mum please your ladyship I can say it off by heart You What do you mean I was really afraid now My lady s blue eyes absolutely gave out light she was so much displeased and moreover perplexed The more reason he had for affright the more his courage rose He must have seen so sharp a lad must have perceived her displeasure but he went on quickly and steadily mister Horner my lady has taught me to read write and cast accounts my lady And he was in a hurry and he folded his paper up but he did not seal it and I read it my lady and now my lady it seems like as if I had got it off by heart and he went on with a high pitched voice saying out very loud what I have no doubt were the identical words of the letter date signature and all it was merely something about a deed which required my lady s signature When he had done he stood almost as if he expected commendation for his accurate memory My lady s eyes contracted till the pupils were as needle points it was a way she had when much disturbed She looked at me and said Margaret Dawson what will this world come to And then she was silent The lad beginning to perceive he had given deep offence stood stock still as if his brave will had brought him into this presence and impelled him to confession and the best amends he could make but had now deserted him or was extinct and left his body motionless until some one else with word or deed made him quit the room My lady looked again at him and saw the frowning dumb foundering terror at his misdeed and the manner in which his confession had been received My poor lad said she the angry look leaving her face into whose hands have you fallen The boy s lips began to quiver Don t you know what tree we read of in Genesis No I hope you have not got to read so easily as that A pause Who has taught you to read and write Please my lady I meant no harm my lady He was fairly blubbering overcome by her evident feeling of dismay and regret the soft repression of which was more frightening to him than any strong or violent words would have been Who taught you I ask It were mister Horner s clerk who learned me my lady And did mister Horner know of it Yes my lady And I am sure I thought for to please him Well perhaps you were not to blame for that But I wonder at mister Horner However my boy as you have got possession of edge tools you must have some rules how to use them Did you never hear that you were not to open letters Please my lady it were open mister Horner forgot for to seal it in his hurry to be off But you must not read letters that are not intended for you You must never try to read any letters that are not directed to you even if they be open before you Please may lady I thought it were good for practice all as one as a book My lady looked bewildered as to what way she could farther explain to him the laws of honour as regarded letters You would not listen I am sure said she to anything you were not intended to hear He hesitated for a moment partly because he did not fully comprehend the question My lady repeated it The light of intelligence came into his eager eyes and I could see that he was not certain if he could tell the truth Please my lady I always hearken when I hear folk talking secrets but I mean no harm My poor lady sighed she was not prepared to begin a long way off in morals Honour was to her second nature and she had never tried to find out on what principle its laws were based So telling the lad that she wished to see mister Horner when he returned from Warwick she dismissed him with a despondent look he meanwhile right glad to be out of the awful gentleness of her presence What is to be done said she half to herself and half to me I could not answer for I was puzzled myself It was a right word she continued that I used when I called reading and writing edge tools If our lower orders have these edge tools given to them we shall have the terrible scenes of the French Revolution acted over again in England When I was a girl one never heard of the rights of men one only heard of the duties Now here was mister Gray only last night talking of the right every child had to instruction I could hardly keep my patience with him and at length we fairly came to words and I told him I would have no such thing as a Sunday school or a Sabbath school as he calls it just like a Jew in my village And what did he say my lady I asked for the struggle that seemed now to have come to a crisis had been going on for some time in a quiet way Why he gave way to temper and said he was bound to remember he was under the bishop s authority not under mine and implied that he should persevere in his designs notwithstanding my expressed opinion And your ladyship I half inquired I could only rise and curtsey and civilly dismiss him When two persons have arrived at a certain point of expression on a subject about which they differ as materially as I do from mister Gray the wisest course if they wish to remain friends is to drop the conversation entirely and suddenly It is one of the few cases where abruptness is desirable I was sorry for mister Gray He had been to see me several times and had helped me to bear my illness in a better spirit than I should have done without his good advice and prayers And I had gathered from little things he said how much his heart was set upon this new scheme I liked him so much and I loved and respected my lady so well that I could not bear them to be on the cool terms to which they were constantly getting Yet I could do nothing but keep silence I suppose my lady understood something of what was passing in my mind for after a minute or two she went on If mister Gray knew all I know if he had my experience he would not be so ready to speak of setting up his new plans in opposition to my judgment Indeed she continued lashing herself up with her own recollections times are changed when the parson of a village comes to beard the liege lady in her own house Why in my grandfather s days the parson was family chaplain too and dined at the Hall every Sunday He was helped last and expected to have done first I remember seeing him take up his plate and knife and fork and say with his mouth full all the time he was speaking If you please Sir Urian and my lady I ll follow the beef into the housekeeper s room for you see unless he did so he stood no chance of a second helping A greedy man that parson was to be sure I recollect his once eating up the whole of some little bird at dinner and by way of diverting attention from his greediness he told how he had heard that a rook soaked in vinegar and then dressed in a particular way could not be distinguished from the bird he was then eating I saw by the grim look of my grandfather s face that the parson s doing and saying displeased him and child as I was I had some notion of what was coming when as I was riding out on my little white pony by my grandfather s side the next Friday he stopped one of the gamekeepers and bade him shoot one of the oldest rooks he could find I knew no more about it till Sunday when a dish was set right before the parson and Sir Urian said Now Parson Hemming I have had a rook shot and soaked in vinegar and dressed as you described last Sunday Fall to man and eat it with as good an appetite as you had last Sunday Pick the bones clean or by no more Sunday dinners shall you eat at my table I gave one look at poor mister Hemming s face as he tried to swallow the first morsel and make believe as though he thought it very good but I could not look again for shame although my grandfather laughed and kept asking us all round if we knew what could have become of the parson s appetite And did he finish it I asked O yes my dear What my grandfather said was to be done was done always He was a terrible man in his anger But to think of the difference between Parson Hemming and mister Gray or even of poor dear mister Mountford and mister Gray mister Mountford would never have withstood me as mister Gray did And your ladyship really thinks that it would not be right to have a Sunday school I asked feeling very timid as I put time question Certainly not As I told mister Gray I consider a knowledge of the Creed and of the Lord s Prayer as essential to salvation and that any child may have whose parents bring it regularly to church Then there are the Ten Commandments which teach simple duties in the plainest language Of course if a lad is taught to read and write as that unfortunate boy has been who was here this morning his duties become complicated and his temptations much greater while at the same time he has no hereditary principles and honourable training to serve as safeguards I might take up my old simile of the race horse and cart horse I am distressed continued she with a break in her ideas about that boy The whole thing reminds me so much of a story of what happened to a friend of mine Clement de Crequy Did I ever tell you about him No your ladyship I replied Poor Clement More than twenty years ago Lord Ludlow and I spent a winter in Paris He had many friends there perhaps not very good or very wise men but he was so kind that he liked every one and every one liked him We had an apartment as they call it there in the Rue de Lille we had the first floor of a grand hotel with the basement for our servants On the floor above us the owner of the house lived a Marquise de Crequy a widow They tell me that the Crequy coat of arms is still emblazoned after all these terrible years on a shield above the arched porte cochere just as it was then though the family is quite extinct Madame de Crequy had only one son Clement who was just the same age as my Urian you may see his portrait in the great hall Urian s I mean I knew that Master Urian had been drowned at sea and often had I looked at the presentment of his bonny hopeful face in his sailor s dress with right hand outstretched to a ship on the sea in the distance as if he had just said Look at her all her sails are set and I m just off Poor Master Urian he went down in this very ship not a year after the picture was taken But now I will go back to my lady s story I can see those two boys playing now continued she softly shutting her eyes as if the better to call up the vision as they used to do five and twenty years ago in those old fashioned French gardens behind our hotel Many a time have I watched them from my windows It was perhaps a better play place than an English garden would have been for there were but few flower beds and no lawn at all to speak about but instead terraces and balustrades and vases and flights of stone steps more in the Italian style and there were jets d eau and little fountains that could be set playing by turning water cocks that were hidden here and there How Clement delighted in turning the water on to surprise Urian and how gracefully he did the honours as it were to my dear rough sailor lad Urian was as dark as a gipsy boy and cared little for his appearance and resisted all my efforts at setting off his black eyes and tangled curls but Clement without ever showing that he thought about himself and his dress was always dainty and elegant even though his clothes were sometimes but threadbare He used to be dressed in a kind of hunter s green suit open at the neck and half way down the chest to beautiful old lace frills his long golden curls fell behind just like a girl s and his hair in front was cut over his straight dark eyebrows in a line almost as straight Urian learnt more of a gentleman s carefulness and propriety of appearance from that lad in two months than he had done in years from all my lectures I recollect one day when the two boys were in full romp and my window being open I could hear them perfectly and Urian was daring Clement to some scrambling or climbing which Clement refused to undertake but in a hesitating way as though he longed to do it if some reason had not stood in the way and at times Urian who was hasty and thoughtless poor fellow told Clement that he was afraid Fear said the French boy drawing himself up you do not know what you say If you will be here at six to morrow morning when it is only just light I will take that starling s nest on the top of yonder chimney But why not now Clement said Urian putting his arm round Clement s neck Why then and not now just when we are in the humour for it Because we De Crequys are poor and my mother cannot afford me another suit of clothes this year and yonder stone carving is all jagged and would tear my coat and breeches Now to morrow morning I could go up with nothing on but an old shirt But you would tear your legs My race do not care for pain said the boy drawing himself from Urian s arm and walking a few steps away with a becoming pride and reserve for he was hurt at being spoken to as if he were afraid and annoyed at having to confess the true reason for declining the feat But Urian was not to be thus baffled He went up to Clement and put his arm once more about his neck and I could see the two lads as they walked down the terrace away from the hotel windows first Urian spoke eagerly looking with imploring fondness into Clement s face which sought the ground till at last the French boy spoke and by and by his arm was round Urian too and they paced backwards and forwards in deep talk but gravely as became men rather than boys All at once from the little chapel at the corner of the large garden belonging to the Missions Etrangeres I heard the tinkle of the little bell announcing the elevation of the host Down on his knees went Clement hands crossed eyes bent down while Urian stood looking on in respectful thought What a friendship that might have been I never dream of Urian without seeing Clement too Urian speaks to me or does something but Clement only flits round Urian and never seems to see any one else But I must not forget to tell you that the next morning before he was out of his room a footman of Madame de Crequy s brought Urian the starling s nest Well we came back to England and the boys were to correspond and Madame de Crequy and I exchanged civilities and Urian went to sea After that all seemed to drop away I cannot tell you all However to confine myself to the De Crequys I had a letter from Clement I knew he felt his friend s death deeply but I should never have learnt it from the letter he sent It was formal and seemed like chaff to my hungering heart Poor fellow I dare say he had found it hard to write What could he or any one say to a mother who has lost her child The world does not think so and in general one must conform to the customs of the world but judging from my own experience I should say that reverent silence at such times is the tenderest balm Madame de Crequy wrote too But I knew she could not feel my loss so much as Clement and therefore her letter was not such a disappointment She and I went on being civil and polite in the way of commissions and occasionally introducing friends to each other for a year or two and then we ceased to have any intercourse Then the terrible Revolution came No one who did not live at those times can imagine the daily expectation of news the hourly terror of rumours affecting the fortunes and lives of those whom most of us had known as pleasant hosts receiving us with peaceful welcome in their magnificent houses Of course there was sin enough and suffering enough behind the scenes but we English visitors to Paris had seen little or nothing of that and I had sometimes thought indeed how even death seemed loth to choose his victims out of that brilliant throng whom I had known Madame de Crequy s one boy lived while three out of my six were gone since we had met I do not think all lots are equal even now that I know the end of her hopes but I do say that whatever our individual lot is it is our duty to accept it without comparing it with that of others The times were thick with gloom and terror What next was the question we asked of every one who brought us news from Paris Where were these demons hidden when so few years ago we danced and feasted and enjoyed the brilliant salons and the charming friendships of Paris One evening I was sitting alone in Saint James s Square my lord off at the club with mister Fox and others he had left me thinking that I should go to one of the many places to which I had been invited for that evening but I had no heart to go anywhere for it was poor Urian s birthday and I had not even rung for lights though the day was fast closing in but was thinking over all his pretty ways and on his warm affectionate nature and how often I had been too hasty in speaking to him for all I loved him so dearly and how I seemed to have neglected and dropped his dear friend Clement who might even now be in need of help in that cruel bloody Paris I say I was thinking reproachfully of all this and particularly of Clement de Crequy in connection with Urian when Fenwick brought me a note sealed with a coat of arms I knew well though I could not remember at the moment where I had seen it I puzzled over it as one does sometimes for a minute or more before I opened the letter In a moment I saw it was from Clement de Crequy My mother is here he said she is very ill and I am bewildered in this strange country May I entreat you to receive me for a few minutes The bearer of the note was the woman of the house where they lodged I had her brought up into the anteroom and questioned her myself while my carriage was being brought round They had arrived in London a fortnight or so before she had not known their quality judging them according to her kind by their dress and their luggage poor enough no doubt The lady had never left her bedroom since her arrival the young man waited upon her did everything for her never left her in fact only she the messenger had promised to stay within call as soon as she returned while he went out somewhere She could hardly understand him he spoke English so badly He had never spoken it I dare say since he had talked to my Urian CHAPTER V In the hurry of the moment I scarce knew what I did I bade the housekeeper put up every delicacy she had in order to tempt the invalid whom yet I hoped to bring back with me to our house When the carriage was ready I took the good woman with me to show us the exact way which my coachman professed not to know for indeed they were staying at but a poor kind of place at the back of Leicester Square of which they had heard as Clement told me afterwards from one of the fishermen who had carried them across from the Dutch coast in their disguises as a Friesland peasant and his mother They had some jewels of value concealed round their persons but their ready money was all spent before I saw them and Clement had been unwilling to leave his mother even for the time necessary to ascertain the best mode of disposing of the diamonds For overcome with distress of mind and bodily fatigue she had reached London only to take to her bed in a sort of low nervous fever in which her chief and only idea seemed to be that Clement was about to be taken from her to some prison or other and if he were out of her sight though but for a minute she cried like a child and could not be pacified or comforted The landlady was a kind good woman and though she but half understood the case she was truly sorry for them as foreigners and the mother sick in a strange land I sent her forwards to request permission for my entrance In a moment I saw Clement a tall elegant young man in a curious dress of coarse cloth standing at the open door of a room and evidently even before he accosted me striving to soothe the terrors of his mother inside I went towards him and would have taken his hand but he bent down and kissed mine May I come in madame I asked looking at the poor sick lady lying in the dark dingy bed her head propped up on coarse and dirty pillows and gazing with affrighted eyes at all that was going on Clement Clement come to me she cried and when he went to the bedside she turned on one side and took his hand in both of hers and began stroking it and looking up in his face I could scarce keep back my tears He stood there quite still except that from time to time he spoke to her in a low tone At last I advanced into the room so that I could talk to him without renewing her alarm I asked for the doctor s address for I had heard that they had called in some one at their landlady s recommendation but I could hardly understand Clement s broken English and mispronunciation of our proper names and was obliged to apply to the woman herself I could not say much to Clement for his attention was perpetually needed by his mother who never seemed to perceive that I was there But I told him not to fear however long I might be away for that I would return before night and bidding the woman take charge of all the heterogeneous things the housekeeper had put up and leaving one of my men in the house who could understand a few words of French with directions that he was to hold himself at Madame de Crequy s orders until I sent or gave him fresh commands I drove off to the doctor s What I wanted was his permission to remove Madame de Crequy to my own house and to learn how it best could be done for I saw that every movement in the room every sound except Clement s voice brought on a fresh access of trembling and nervous agitation The doctor was I should think a clever man but he had that kind of abrupt manner which people get who have much to do with the lower orders I told him the story of his patient the interest I had in her and the wish I entertained of removing her to my own house It can t be done said he Any change will kill her But it must be done I replied And it shall not kill her Then I have nothing more to say said he turning away from the carriage door and making as though he would go back into the house Stop a moment You must help me and if you do you shall have reason to be glad for I will give you fifty pounds down with pleasure If you won t do it another shall He looked at me then furtively at the carriage hesitated and then said You do not mind expense apparently I suppose you are a rich lady of quality Such folks will not stick at such trifles as the life or death of a sick woman to get their own way I suppose I must e en help you for if I don t another will I did not mind what he said so that he would assist me I was pretty sure that she was in a state to require opiates and I had not forgotten Christopher Sly you may be sure so I told him what I had in my head That in the dead of night the quiet time in the streets she should be carried in a hospital litter softly and warmly covered over from the Leicester Square lodging house to rooms that I would have in perfect readiness for her As I planned so it was done I let Clement know by a note of my design I had all prepared at home and we walked about my house as though shod with velvet while the porter watched at the open door At last through the darkness I saw the lanterns carried by my men who were leading the little procession The litter looked like a hearse on one side walked the doctor on the other Clement they came softly and swiftly along I could not try any farther experiment we dared not change her clothes she was laid in the bed in the landlady s coarse night gear and covered over warmly and left in the shaded scented room with a nurse and the doctor watching by her while I led Clement to the dressing room adjoining in which I had had a bed placed for him Farther than that he would not go and there I had refreshments brought Meanwhile he had shown his gratitude by every possible action for we none of us dared to speak he had kneeled at my feet and kissed my hand and left it wet with his tears He had thrown up his arms to Heaven and prayed earnestly as I could see by the movement of his lips I allowed him to relieve himself by these dumb expressions if I may so call them and then I left him and went to my own rooms to sit up for my lord and tell him what I had done Of course it was all right and neither my lord nor I could sleep for wondering how Madame de Crequy would bear her awakening I had engaged the doctor to whose face and voice she was accustomed to remain with her all night the nurse was experienced and Clement was within call But it was with the greatest relief that I heard from my own woman when she brought me my chocolate that Madame de Crequy Monsieur had said had awakened more tranquil than she had been for many days To be sure the whole aspect of the bed chamber must have been more familiar to her than the miserable place where I had found her and she must have intuitively felt herself among friends My lord was scandalized at Clement s dress which after the first moment of seeing him I had forgotten in thinking of other things and for which I had not prepared Lord Ludlow He sent for his own tailor and bade him bring patterns of stuffs and engage his men to work night and day till Clement could appear as became his rank In short in a few days so much of the traces of their flight were removed that we had almost forgotten the terrible causes of it and rather felt as if they had come on a visit to us than that they had been compelled to fly their country Their diamonds too were sold well by my lord s agents though the London shops were stocked with jewellery and such portable valuables some of rare and curious fashion which were sold for half their real value by emigrants who could not afford to wait Madame de Crequy was recovering her health although her strength was sadly gone and she would never be equal to such another flight as the perilous one which she had gone through and to which she could not bear the slightest reference For some time things continued in this state the De Crequys still our honoured visitors many houses besides our own even among our own friends open to receive the poor flying nobility of France driven from their country by the brutal republicans and every freshly arrived emigrant bringing new tales of horror as if these revolutionists were drunk with blood and mad to devise new atrocities One day Clement I should tell you he had been presented to our good King George and the sweet Queen and they had accosted him most graciously and his beauty and elegance and some of the circumstances attendant on his flight made him be received in the world quite like a hero of romance he might have been on intimate terms in many a distinguished house had he cared to visit much but he accompanied my lord and me with an air of indifference and languor which I sometimes fancied made him be all the more sought after Monkshaven that was the title my eldest son bore tried in vain to interest him in all young men s sports But no it was the same through all His mother took far more interest in the on dits of the London world into which she was far too great an invalid to venture than he did in the absolute events themselves in which he might have been an actor One day as I was saying an old Frenchman of a humble class presented himself to our servants several of them understood French and through Medlicott I learnt that he was in some way connected with the De Crequys not with their Paris life but I fancy he had been intendant of their estates in the country estates which were more useful as hunting grounds than as adding to their income However there was the old man and with him wrapped round his person he had brought the long parchment rolls and deeds relating to their property These he would deliver up to none but Monsieur de Crequy the rightful owner and Clement was out with Monkshaven so the old man waited and when Clement came in I told him of the steward s arrival and how he had been cared for by my people Clement went directly to see him He was a long time away and I was waiting for him to drive out with me for some purpose or another I scarce know what but I remember I was tired of waiting and was just in the act of ringing the bell to desire that he might be reminded of his engagement with me when he came in his face as white as the powder in his hair his beautiful eyes dilated with horror I saw that he had heard something that touched him even more closely than the usual tales which every fresh emigrant brought What is it Clement I asked He clasped his hands and looked as though he tried to speak but could not bring out the words They have guillotined my uncle said he at last Now I knew that there was a Count de Crequy but I had always understood that the elder branch held very little communication with him in fact that he was a vaurien of some kind and rather a disgrace than otherwise to the family So perhaps I was hard hearted but I was a little surprised at this excess of emotion till I saw that peculiar look in his eyes that many people have when there is more terror in their hearts than they dare put into words He wanted me to understand something without his saying it but how could I I had never heard of a Mademoiselle de Crequy Virginie at last he uttered In an instant I understood it all and remembered that if Urian had lived he too might have been in love Your uncle s daughter I inquired My cousin he replied I did not say your betrothed but I had no doubt of it I was mistaken however O madame he continued her mother died long ago her father now and she is in daily fear alone deserted Is she in the Abbaye asked I No she is in hiding with the widow of her father s old concierge Any day they may search the house for aristocrats They are seeking them everywhere Then not her life alone but that of the old woman her hostess is sacrificed The old woman knows this and trembles with fear Even if she is brave enough to be faithful her fears would betray her should the house be searched Yet there is no one to help Virginie to escape She is alone in Paris I saw what was in his mind He was fretting and chafing to go to his cousin s assistance but the thought of his mother restrained him I would not have kept back Urian from such on errand at such a time How should I restrain him And yet perhaps I did wrong in not urging the chances of danger more Still if it was danger to him was it not the same or even greater danger to her for the French spared neither age nor sex in those wicked days of terror So I rather fell in with his wish and encouraged him to think how best and most prudently it might be fulfilled never doubting as I have said that he and his cousin were troth plighted But when I went to Madame de Crequy after he had imparted his or rather our plan to her I found out my mistake She who was in general too feeble to walk across the room save slowly and with a stick was going from end to end with quick tottering steps and if now and then she sank upon a chair it seemed as if she could not rest for she was up again in a moment pacing along wringing her hands and speaking rapidly to herself When she saw me she stopped Madame she said you have lost your own boy You might have left me mine I was so astonished I hardly knew what to say I had spoken to Clement as if his mother s consent were secure as I had felt my own would have been if Urian had been alive to ask it Of coarse both he and I knew that his mother s consent must be asked and obtained before he could leave her to go on such an undertaking but somehow my blood always rose at the sight or sound of danger perhaps because my life had been so peaceful Poor Madame de Crequy it was otherwise with her she despaired while I hoped and Clement trusted Dear Madame de Crequy said I he will return safely to us every precaution shall be taken that either he or you or my lord or Monkshaven can think of but he cannot leave a girl his nearest relation save you his betrothed is she not His betrothed cried she now at the utmost pitch of her excitement Virginie betrothed to Clement no thank heaven not so bad as that Yet it might have been But mademoiselle scorned my son She would have nothing to do with him Now is the time for him to have nothing to do with her Clement had entered at the door behind his mother as she thus spoke His face was set and pale till it looked as gray and immovable as if it had been carved in stone He came forward and stood before his mother She stopped her walk threw back her haughty head and the two looked each other steadily in the face After a minute or two in this attitude her proud and resolute gaze never flinching or wavering he went down upon one knee and taking her hand her hard stony hand which never closed on his but remained straight and stiff Mother he pleaded withdraw your prohibition Let me go What were her words Madame de Crequy replied slowly as if forcing her memory to the extreme of accuracy My cousin she said when I marry I marry a man not a petit maitre I marry a man who whatever his rank may be will add dignity to the human race by his virtues and not be content to live in an effeminate court on the traditions of past grandeur She borrowed her words from the infamous Jean Jacques Rousseau the friend of her scarce less infamous father nay I will say it if not her words she borrowed her principles And my son to request her to marry him It was my father s written wish said Clement But did you not love her You plead your father s words words written twelve years before and as if that were your reason for being indifferent to my dislike to the alliance But you requested her to marry you and she refused you with insolent contempt and now you are ready to leave me leave me desolate in a foreign land Desolate my mother and the Countess Ludlow stands there Pardon madame But all the earth though it were full of kind hearts is but a desolation and a desert place to a mother when her only child is absent And you Clement would leave me for this Virginie this degenerate De Crequy tainted with the atheism of the Encyclopedistes She is only reaping some of the fruit of the harvest whereof her friends have sown the seed Let her alone Doubtless she has friends it may be lovers among these demons who under the cry of liberty commit every licence Let her alone Clement She refused you with scorn be too proud to notice her now Mother I cannot think of myself only of her Think of me then I your mother forbid you to go Clement bowed low and went out of the room instantly as one blinded She saw his groping movement and for an instant I think her heart was touched But she turned to me and tried to exculpate her past violence by dilating upon her wrongs and they certainly were many The Count her husband s younger brother had invariably tried to make mischief between husband and wife He had been the cleverer man of the two and had possessed extraordinary influence over her husband She suspected him of having instigated that clause in her husband s will by which the Marquis expressed his wish for the marriage of the cousins The Count had had some interest in the management of the De Crequy property during her son s minority Indeed I remembered then that it was through Count de Crequy that Lord Ludlow had first heard of the apartment which we afterwards took in the Hotel de Crequy and then the recollection of a past feeling came distinctly out of the mist as it were and I called to mind how when we first took up our abode in the Hotel de Crequy both Lord Ludlow and I imagined that the arrangement was displeasing to our hostess and how it had taken us a considerable time before we had been able to establish relations of friendship with her Years after our visit she began to suspect that Clement whom she could not forbid to visit at his uncle s house considering the terms on which his father had been with his brother though she herself never set foot over the Count de Crequy s threshold was attaching himself to mademoiselle his cousin and she made cautious inquiries as to the appearance character and disposition of the young lady Mademoiselle was not handsome they said but of a fine figure and generally considered as having a very noble and attractive presence In character she was daring and wilful said one set original and independent said another She was much indulged by her father who had given her something of a man s education and selected for her intimate friend a young lady below her in rank one of the Bureaucracie a Mademoiselle Necker daughter of the Minister of Finance Mademoiselle de Crequy was thus introduced into all the free thinking salons of Paris among people who were always full of plans for subverting society And did Clement affect such people Madame de Crequy had asked with some anxiety No Monsieur de Crequy had neither eyes nor ears nor thought for anything but his cousin while she was by And she She hardly took notice of his devotion so evident to every one else The proud creature But perhaps that was her haughty way of concealing what she felt And so Madame de Crequy listened and questioned and learnt nothing decided until one day she surprised Clement with the note in his hand of which she remembered the stinging words so well in which Virginie had said in reply to a proposal Clement had sent her through her father that When she married she married a man not a petit maitre Clement was justly indignant at the insulting nature of the answer Virginie had sent to a proposal respectful in its tone and which was after all but the cool hardened lava over a burning heart He acquiesced in his mother s desire that he should not again present himself in his uncle s salons but he did not forget Virginie though he never mentioned her name Madame de Crequy and her son were among the earliest proscrits as they were of the strongest possible royalists and aristocrats as it was the custom of the horrid Sansculottes to term those who adhered to the habits of expression and action in which it was their pride to have been educated They had left Paris some weeks before they had arrived in England and Clement s belief at the time of quitting the Hotel de Crequy had certainly been that his uncle was not merely safe but rather a popular man with the party in power And as all communication having relation to private individuals of a reliable kind was intercepted Monsieur de Crequy had felt but little anxiety for his uncle and cousin in comparison with what he did for many other friends of very different opinions in politics until the day when he was stunned by the fatal information that even his progressive uncle was guillotined and learnt that his cousin was imprisoned by the licence of the mob whose rights as she called them she was always advocating When I had heard all this story I confess I lost in sympathy for Clement what I gained for his mother Virginie s life did not seem to me worth the risk that Clement s would run But when I saw him sad depressed nay hopeless going about like one oppressed by a heavy dream which he cannot shake off caring neither to eat drink nor sleep yet bearing all with silent dignity and even trying to force a poor faint smile when he caught my anxious eyes I turned round again and wondered how Madame de Crequy could resist this mute pleading of her son s altered appearance As for my Lord Ludlow and Monkshaven as soon as they understood the case they were indignant that any mother should attempt to keep a son out of honourable danger and it was honourable and a clear duty according to them to try to save the life of a helpless orphan girl his next of kin None but a Frenchman said my lord would hold himself bound by an old woman s whimsies and fears even though she were his mother As it was he was chafing himself to death under the restraint If he went to be sure the wretches might make an end of him as they had done of many a fine fellow but my lord would take heavy odds that instead of being guillotined he would save the girl and bring her safe to England just desperately in love with her preserver and then we would have a jolly wedding down at Monkshaven My lord repeated his opinion so often that it became a certain prophecy in his mind of what was to take place and one day seeing Clement look even paler and thinner than he had ever done before he sent a message to Madame de Crequy requesting permission to speak to her in private For by George said he she shall hear my opinion and not let that lad of hers kill himself by fretting He s too good for that if he had been an English lad he would have been off to his sweetheart long before this without saying with your leave or by your leave but being a Frenchman he is all for AEneas and filial piety filial fiddle sticks My lord had run away to sea when a boy against his father s consent I am sorry to say and as all had ended well and he had come back to find both his parents alive I do not think he was ever as much aware of his fault as he might have been under other circumstances No my lady he went on don t come with me A woman can manage a man best when he has a fit of obstinacy and a man can persuade a woman out of her tantrums when all her own sex the whole army of them would fail Allow me to go alone to my tete a tete with madame What he said what passed he never could repeat but he came back graver than he went However the point was gained Madame de Crequy withdrew her prohibition and had given him leave to tell Clement as much But she is an old Cassandra said he Don t let the lad be much with her her talk would destroy the courage of the bravest man she is so given over to superstition Something that she had said had touched a chord in my lord s nature which he inherited from his Scotch ancestors Long afterwards I heard what this was Medlicott told me However my lord shook off all fancies that told against the fulfilment of Clement s wishes All that afternoon we three sat together planning and Monkshaven passed in and out executing our commissions and preparing everything Towards nightfall all was ready for Clement s start on his journey towards the coast Madame had declined seeing any of us since my lord s stormy interview with her She sent word that she was fatigued and desired repose But of course before Clement set off he was bound to wish her farewell and to ask for her blessing In order to avoid an agitating conversation between mother and son my lord and I resolved to be present at the interview Clement was already in his travelling dress that of a Norman fisherman which Monkshaven had with infinite trouble discovered in the possession of one of the emigres who thronged London and who had made his escape from the shores of France in this disguise Clement s plan was to go down to the coast of Sussex and get some of the fishing or smuggling boats to take him across to the French coast near Dieppe There again he would have to change his dress Oh it was so well planned His mother was startled by his disguise of which we had not thought to forewarn her as he entered her apartment And either that or the being suddenly roused from the heavy slumber into which she was apt to fall when she was left alone gave her manner an air of wildness that was almost like insanity Go go she said to him almost pushing him away as he knelt to kiss her hand Virginie is beckoning to you but you don t see what kind of a bed it is Clement make haste said my lord in a hurried manner as if to interrupt madame The time is later than I thought and you must not miss the morning s tide Bid your mother good bye at once and let us be off For my lord and Monkshaven were to ride with him to an inn near the shore from whence he was to walk to his destination My lord almost took him by the arm to pull him away and they were gone and I was left alone with Madame de Crequy When she heard the horses feet she seemed to find out the truth as if for the first time She set her teeth together He has left me for her she almost screamed Left me for her she kept muttering and then as the wild look came back into her eyes she said almost with exultation But I did not give him my blessing CHAPTER VI All night Madame de Crequy raved in delirium If I could I would have sent for Clement back again I did send off one man but I suppose my directions were confused or they were wrong for he came back after my lord s return on the following afternoon By this time Madame de Crequy was quieter she was indeed asleep from exhaustion when Lord Ludlow and Monkshaven came in They were in high spirits and their hopefulness brought me round to a less dispirited state All had gone well they had accompanied Clement on foot along the shore until they had met with a lugger which my lord had hailed in good nautical language The captain had responded to these freemason terms by sending a boat to pick up his passenger and by an invitation to breakfast sent through a speaking trumpet Monkshaven did not approve of either the meal or the company and had returned to the inn but my lord had gone with Clement and breakfasted on board upon grog biscuit fresh caught fish the best breakfast he ever ate he said but that was probably owing to the appetite his night s ride had given him However his good fellowship had evidently won the captain s heart and Clement had set sail under the best auspices It was agreed that I should tell all this to Madame de Crequy if she inquired otherwise it would be wiser not to renew her agitation by alluding to her son s journey I sat with her constantly for many days but she never spoke of Clement She forced herself to talk of the little occurrences of Parisian society in former days she tried to be conversational and agreeable and to betray no anxiety or even interest in the object of Clement s journey and as far as unremitting efforts could go she succeeded But the tones of her voice were sharp and yet piteous as if she were in constant pain and the glance of her eye hurried and fearful as if she dared not let it rest on any object In a week we heard of Clement s safe arrival on the French coast He sent a letter to this effect by the captain of the smuggler when the latter returned We hoped to hear again but week after week elapsed and there was no news of Clement I had told Lord Ludlow in Madame de Crequy s presence as he and I had arranged of the note I had received from her son informing us of his landing in France She heard but she took no notice and evidently began to wonder that we did not mention any further intelligence of him in the same manner before her and daily I began to fear that her pride would give way and that she would supplicate for news before I had any to give her One morning on my awakening my maid told me that Madame de Crequy had passed a wretched night and had bidden Medlicott whom as understanding French and speaking it pretty well though with that horrid German accent I had put about her request that I would go to madame s room as soon as I was dressed I knew what was coming and I trembled all the time they were doing my hair and otherwise arranging me I was not encouraged by my lord s speeches He had heard the message and kept declaring that he would rather be shot than have to tell her that there was no news of her son and yet he said every now and then when I was at the lowest pitch of uneasiness that he never expected to hear again that some day soon we should see him walking in and introducing Mademoiselle de Crequy to us However at last I was ready and go I must Her eyes were fixed on the door by which I entered I went up to the bedside She was not rouged she had left it off now for several days she no longer attempted to keep up the vain show of not feeling and loving and fearing For a moment or two she did not speak and I was glad of the respite Clement she said at length covering her mouth with a handkerchief the minute she had spoken that I might not see it quiver There has been no news since the first letter saying how well the voyage was performed and how safely he had landed near Dieppe you know I replied as cheerfully as possible My lord does not expect that we shall have another letter he thinks that we shall see him soon There was no answer As I looked uncertain whether to do or say more she slowly turned herself in bed and lay with her face to the wall and as if that did not shut out the light of day and the busy happy world enough she put out her trembling hands and covered her face with her handkerchief There was no violence hardly any sound I told her what my lord had said about Clement s coming in some day and taking us all by surprise I did not believe it myself but it was just possible and I had nothing else to say Pity to one who was striving so hard to conceal her feelings would have been impertinent She let me talk but she did not reply She knew that my words were vain and idle and had no root in my belief as well as I did myself I was very thankful when Medlicott came in with Madame s breakfast and gave me an excuse for leaving But I think that conversation made me feel more anxious and impatient than ever I felt almost pledged to Madame de Crequy for the fulfilment of the vision I had held out She had taken entirely to her bed by this time not from illness but because she had no hope within her to stir her up to the effort of dressing In the same way she hardly cared for food She had no appetite why eat to prolong a life of despair But she let Medlicott feed her sooner than take the trouble of resisting And so it went on for weeks months I could hardly count the time it seemed so long Medlicott told me she noticed a preternatural sensitiveness of ear in Madame de Crequy induced by the habit of listening silently for the slightest unusual sound in the house Medlicott was always a minute watcher of any one whom she cared about and one day she made me notice by a sign madame s acuteness of hearing although the quick expectation was but evinced for a moment in the turn of the eye the hushed breath and then when the unusual footstep turned into my lord s apartments the soft quivering sigh and the closed eyelids At length the intendant of the De Crequy estates the old man you will remember whose information respecting Virginie de Crequy first gave Clement the desire to return to Paris came to saint James s Square and begged to speak to me I made haste to go down to him in the housekeeper s room sooner than that he should be ushered into mine for fear of madame hearing any sound The old man stood I see him now with his hat held before him in both his hands he slowly bowed till his face touched it when I came in Such long excess of courtesy augured ill He waited for me to speak Have you any intelligence I inquired He had been often to the house before to ask if we had received any news and once or twice I had seen him but this was the first time he had begged to see me Yes madame he replied still standing with his head bent down like a child in disgrace And it is bad I exclaimed It is bad For a moment I was angry at the cold tone in which my words were echoed but directly afterwards I saw the large slow heavy tears of age falling down the old man s cheeks and on to the sleeves of his poor threadbare coat I asked him how he had heard it it seemed as though I could not all at once bear to hear what it was He told me that the night before in crossing Long Acre he had stumbled upon an old acquaintance of his one who like himself had been a dependent upon the De Crequy family but had managed their Paris affairs while Flechier had taken charge of their estates in the country Both were now emigrants and living on the proceeds of such small available talents as they possessed Flechier as I knew earned a very fair livelihood by going about to dress salads for dinner parties His compatriot Le Febvre had begun to give a few lessons as a dancing master One of them took the other home to his lodgings and there when their most immediate personal adventures had been hastily talked over came the inquiry from Flechier as to Monsieur de Crequy Clement was dead guillotined Virginie was dead guillotined When Flechier had told me thus much he could not speak for sobbing and I myself could hardly tell how to restrain my tears sufficiently until I could go to my own room and be at liberty to give way He asked my leave to bring in his friend Le Febvre who was walking in the square awaiting a possible summons to tell his story I heard afterwards a good many details which filled up the account and made me feel which brings me back to the point I started from how unfit the lower orders are for being trusted indiscriminately with the dangerous powers of education I have made a long preamble but now I am coming to the moral of my story My lady was trying to shake off the emotion which she evidently felt in recurring to this sad history of Monsieur de Crequy s death She came behind me and arranged my pillows and then seeing I had been crying for indeed I was weak spirited at the time and a little served to unloose my tears she stooped down and kissed my forehead and said Poor child almost as if she thanked me for feeling that old grief of hers Being once in France it was no difficult thing for Clement to get into Paris The difficulty in those days was to leave not to enter He came in dressed as a Norman peasant in charge of a load of fruit and vegetables with which one of the Seine barges was freighted He worked hard with his companions in landing and arranging their produce on the quays and then when they dispersed to get their breakfasts at some of the estaminets near the old Marche aux Fleurs he sauntered up a street which conducted him by many an odd turn through the Quartier Latin to a horrid back alley leading out of the Rue l Ecole de Medecine some atrocious place as I have heard not far from the shadow of that terrible Abbaye where so many of the best blood of France awaited their deaths But here some old man lived on whose fidelity Clement thought that he might rely I am not sure if he had not been gardener in those very gardens behind the Hotel Crequy where Clement and Urian used to play together years before But whatever the old man s dwelling might be Clement was only too glad to reach it you may be sure he had been kept in Normandy in all sorts of disguises for many days after landing in Dieppe through the difficulty of entering Paris unsuspected by the many ruffians who were always on the look out for aristocrats The old gardener was I believe both faithful and tried and sheltered Clement in his garret as well as might be Before he could stir out it was necessary to procure a fresh disguise and one more in character with an inhabitant of Paris than that of a Norman carter was procured and after waiting in doors for one or two days to see if any suspicion was excited Clement set off to discover Virginie He found her at the old concierge s dwelling Madame Babette was the name of this woman who must have been a less faithful or rather perhaps I should say a more interested friend to her guest than the old gardener Jaques was to Clement I have seen a miniature of Virginie which a French lady of quality happened to have in her possession at the time of her flight from Paris and which she brought with her to England unwittingly for it belonged to the Count de Crequy with whom she was slightly acquainted I should fancy from it that Virginie was taller and of a more powerful figure for a woman than her cousin Clement was for a man Her dark brown hair was arranged in short curls the way of dressing the hair announced the politics of the individual in those days just as patches did in my grandmother s time and Virginie s hair was not to my taste or according to my principles it was too classical Her large black eyes looked out at you steadily One cannot judge of the shape of a nose from a full face miniature but the nostrils were clearly cut and largely opened I do not fancy her nose could have been pretty but her mouth had a character all its own and which would I think have redeemed a plainer face It was wide and deep set into the cheeks at the corners the upper lip was very much arched and hardly closed over the teeth so that the whole face looked from the serious intent look in the eyes and the sweet intelligence of the mouth as if she were listening eagerly to something to which her answer was quite ready and would come out of those red opening lips as soon as ever you had done speaking and you longed to know what she would say Well this Virginie de Crequy was living with Madame Babette in the conciergerie of an old French inn somewhere to the north of Paris so far enough from Clement s refuge The inn had been frequented by farmers from Brittany and such kind of people in the days when that sort of intercourse went on between Paris and the provinces which had nearly stopped now Few Bretons came near it now and the inn had fallen into the hands of Madame Babette s brother as payment for a bad wine debt of the last proprietor He put his sister and her child in to keep it open as it were and sent all the people he could to occupy the half furnished rooms of the house They paid Babette for their lodging every morning as they went out to breakfast and returned or not as they chose at night Every three days the wine merchant or his son came to Madame Babette and she accounted to them for the money she had received She and her child occupied the porter s office in which the lad slept at nights and a little miserable bed room which opened out of it and received all the light and air that was admitted through the door of communication which was half glass Madame Babette must have had a kind of attachment for the De Crequys her De Crequys you understand Virginie s father the Count for at some risk to herself she had warned both him and his daughter of the danger impending over them But he infatuated would not believe that his dear Human Race could ever do him harm and as long as he did not fear Virginie was not afraid It was by some ruse the nature of which I never heard that Madame Babette induced Virginie to come to her abode at the very hour in which the Count had been recognized in the streets and hurried off to the Lanterne It was after Babette had got her there safe shut up in the little back den that she told her what had befallen her father From that day Virginie had never stirred out of the gates or crossed the threshold of the porter s lodge I do not say that Madame Babette was tired of her continual presence or regretted the impulse which made her rush to the De Crequy s well known house after being compelled to form one of the mad crowds that saw the Count de Crequy seized and hung and hurry his daughter out through alleys and backways until at length she had the orphan safe in her own dark sleeping room and could tell her tale of horror but Madame Babette was poorly paid for her porter s work by her avaricious brother and it was hard enough to find food for herself and her growing boy and though the poor girl ate little enough I dare say yet there seemed no end to the burthen that Madame Babette had imposed upon herself the De Crequys were plundered ruined had become an extinct race all but a lonely friendless girl in broken health and spirits and though she lent no positive encouragement to his suit yet at the time when Clement reappeared in Paris Madame Babette was beginning to think that Virginie might do worse than encourage the attentions of Monsieur Morin Fils her nephew and the wine merchant s son Of course he and his father had the entree into the conciergerie of the hotel that belonged to them in right of being both proprietors and relations The son Morin had seen Virginie in this manner He was fully aware that she was far above him in rank and guessed from her whole aspect that she had lost her natural protectors by the terrible guillotine but he did not know her exact name or station nor could he persuade his aunt to tell him However he fell head over ears in love with her whether she were princess or peasant and though at first there was something about her which made his passionate love conceal itself with shy awkward reserve and then made it only appear in the guise of deep respectful devotion yet by and by by the same process of reasoning I suppose that his aunt had gone through even before him Jean Morin began to let Hope oust Despair from his heart Sometimes he thought perhaps years hence that solitary friendless lady pent up in squalor might turn to him as to a friend and comforter and then and then Meanwhile Jean Morin was most attentive to his aunt whom he had rather slighted before He would linger over the accounts would bring her little presents and above all he made a pet and favourite of Pierre the little cousin who could tell him about all the ways of going on of Mam selle Cannes as Virginie was called Pierre was thoroughly aware of the drift and cause of his cousin s inquiries and was his ardent partisan as I have heard even before Jean Morin had exactly acknowledged his wishes to himself It must have required some patience and much diplomacy before Clement de Crequy found out the exact place where his cousin was hidden The old gardener took the cause very much to heart as judging from my recollections I imagine he would have forwarded any fancy however wild of Monsieur Clement s I will tell you afterwards how I came to know all these particulars so well After Clement s return on two succeeding days from his dangerous search without meeting with any good result Jacques entreated Monsieur de Crequy to let him take it in hand He represented that he as gardener for the space of twenty years and more at the Hotel de Crequy had a right to be acquainted with all the successive concierges at the Count s house that he should not go among them as a stranger but as an old friend anxious to renew pleasant intercourse and that if the Intendant s story which he had told Monsieur de Crequy in England was true that mademoiselle was in hiding at the house of a former concierge why something relating to her would surely drop out in the course of conversation So he persuaded Clement to remain indoors while he set off on his round with no apparent object but to gossip At night he came home having seen mademoiselle He told Clement much of the story relating to Madame Babette that I have told to you Of course he had heard nothing of the ambitious hopes of Morin Fils hardly of his existence I should think Madame Babette had received him kindly although for some time she had kept him standing in the carriage gateway outside her door But on his complaining of the draught and his rheumatism she had asked him in first looking round with some anxiety to see who was in the room behind her No one was there when he entered and sat down But in a minute or two a tall thin young lady with great sad eyes and pale cheeks came from the inner room and seeing him retired It is Mademoiselle Cannes said Madame Babette rather unnecessarily for if he had not been on the watch for some sign of Mademoiselle de Crequy he would hardly have noticed the entrance and withdrawal Clement and the good old gardener were always rather perplexed by Madame Babette s evident avoidance of all mention of the De Crequy family If she were so much interested in one member as to be willing to undergo the pains and penalties of a domiciliary visit it was strange that she never inquired after the existence of her charge s friends and relations from one who might very probably have heard something of them They settled that Madame Babette must believe that the Marquise and Clement were dead and admired her for her reticence in never speaking of Virginie The truth was I suspect that she was so desirous of her nephews success by this time that she did not like letting any one into the secret of Virginie s whereabouts who might interfere with their plan However it was arranged between Clement and his humble friend that the former dressed in the peasant s clothes in which he had entered Paris but smartened up in one or two particulars as if although a countryman he had money to spare should go and engage a sleeping room in the old Breton Inn where as I told you accommodation for the night was to be had This was accordingly done without exciting Madame Babette s suspicions for she was unacquainted with the Normandy accent and consequently did not perceive the exaggeration of it which Monsieur de Crequy adopted in order to disguise his pure Parisian But after he had for two nights slept in a queer dark closet at the end of one of the numerous short galleries in the Hotel Duguesclin and paid his money for such accommodation each morning at the little bureau under the window of the conciergerie he found himself no nearer to his object He stood outside in the gateway Madame Babette opened a pane in her window counted out the change gave polite thanks and shut to the pane with a clack before he could ever find out what to say that might be the means of opening a conversation Once in the streets he was in danger from the bloodthirsty mob who were ready in those days to hunt to death every one who looked like a gentleman as an aristocrat and Clement depend upon it looked a gentleman whatever dress he wore Yet it was unwise to traverse Paris to his old friend the gardener s grenier so he had to loiter about where I hardly know Only he did leave the Hotel Duguesclin and he did not go to old Jacques and there was not another house in Paris open to him At the end of two days he had made out Pierre s existence and he began to try to make friends with the lad Pierre was too sharp and shrewd not to suspect something from the confused attempts at friendliness It was not for nothing that the Norman farmer lounged in the court and doorway and brought home presents of galette Pierre accepted the galette reciprocated the civil speeches but kept his eyes open Once returning home pretty late at night he surprised the Norman studying the shadows on the blind which was drawn down when Madame Babette s lamp was lighted On going in he found Mademoiselle Cannes with his mother sitting by the table and helping in the family mending Pierre was afraid that the Norman had some view upon the money which his mother as concierge collected for her brother But the money was all safe next evening when his cousin Monsieur Morin Fils came to collect it Madame Babette asked her nephew to sit down and skilfully barred the passage to the inner door so that Virginie had she been ever so much disposed could not have retreated She sat silently sewing All at once the little party were startled by a very sweet tenor voice just close to the street window singing one of the airs out of Beaumarchais operas which a few years before had been popular all over Paris But after a few moments of silence and one or two remarks the talking went on again Pierre however noticed an increased air of abstraction in Virginie who I suppose was recurring to the last time that she had heard the song and did not consider as her cousin had hoped she would have done what were the words set to the air which he imagined she would remember and which would have told her so much For only a few years before Adam s opera of Richard le Roi had made the story of the minstrel Blondel and our English Coeur de Lion familiar to all the opera going part of the Parisian public and Clement had bethought him of establishing a communication with Virginie by some such means The next night about the same hour the same voice was singing outside the window again Pierre who had been irritated by the proceeding the evening before as it had diverted Virginie s attention from his cousin who had been doing his utmost to make himself agreeable rushed out to the door just as the Norman was ringing the bell to be admitted for the night Pierre looked up and down the street no one else was to be seen The next day the Norman mollified him somewhat by knocking at the door of the conciergerie and begging Monsieur Pierre s acceptance of some knee buckles which had taken the country farmer s fancy the day before as he had been gazing into the shops but which being too small for his purpose he took the liberty of offering to Monsieur Pierre Pierre a French boy inclined to foppery was charmed ravished by the beauty of the present and with monsieur s goodness and he began to adjust them to his breeches immediately as well as he could at least in his mother s absence The Norman whom Pierre kept carefully on the outside of the threshold stood by as if amused at the boy s eagerness Take care said he clearly and distinctly take care my little friend lest you become a fop and in that case some day years hence when your heart is devoted to some young lady she may be inclined to say to you here he raised his voice No thank you when I marry I marry a man not a petit maitre I marry a man who whatever his position may be will add dignity to the human race by his virtues Farther than that in his quotation Clement dared not go His sentiments so much above the apparent occasion met with applause from Pierre who liked to contemplate himself in the light of a lover even though it should be a rejected one and who hailed the mention of the words virtues and dignity of the human race as belonging to the cant of a good citizen But Clement was more anxious to know how the invisible Lady took his speech There was no sign at the time But when he returned at night he heard a voice low singing behind Madame Babette as she handed him his candle the very air he had sung without effect for two nights past As if he had caught it up from her murmuring voice he sang it loudly and clearly as he crossed the court Here is our opera singer exclaimed Madame Babette Why the Norman grazier sings like Boupre naming a favourite singer at the neighbouring theatre Pierre was struck by the remark and quietly resolved to look after the Norman but again I believe it was more because of his mother s deposit of money than with any thought of Virginie However the next morning to the wonder of both mother and son Mademoiselle Cannes proposed with much hesitation to go out and make some little purchase for herself A month or two ago this was what Madame Babette had been never weary of urging But now she was as much surprised as if she had expected Virginie to remain a prisoner in her rooms all the rest of her life I suppose she had hoped that her first time of quitting it would be when she left it for Monsieur Morin s house as his wife A quick look from Madame Babette towards Pierre was all that was needed to encourage the boy to follow her He went out cautiously She was at the end of the street She looked up and down as if waiting for some one No one was there Back she came so swiftly that she nearly caught Pierre before he could retreat through the porte cochere There he looked out again The neighbourhood was low and wild and strange and some one spoke to Virginie nay laid his hand upon her arm whose dress and aspect he had emerged out of a side street Pierre did not know but after a start and Pierre could fancy a little scream Virginie recognised the stranger and the two turned up the side street whence the man had come Pierre stole swiftly to the corner of this street no one was there they had disappeared up some of the alleys Pierre returned home to excite his mother s infinite surprise But they had hardly done talking when Virginie returned with a colour and a radiance in her face which they had never seen there since her father s death CHAPTER VII I have told you that I heard much of this story from a friend of the Intendant of the De Crequys whom he met with in London Some years afterwards the summer before my lord s death I was travelling with him in Devonshire and we went to see the French prisoners of war on Dartmoor We fell into conversation with one of them whom I found out to be the very Pierre of whom I had heard before as having been involved in the fatal story of Clement and Virginie and by him I was told much of their last days and thus I learnt how to have some sympathy with all those who were concerned in those terrible events yes even with the younger Morin himself on whose behalf Pierre spoke warmly even after so long a time had elapsed For when the younger Morin called at the porter s lodge on the evening of the day when Virginie had gone out for the first time after so many months confinement to the conciergerie he was struck with the improvement in her appearance It seems to have hardly been that he thought her beauty greater for in addition to the fact that she was not beautiful Morin had arrived at that point of being enamoured when it does not signify whether the beloved one is plain or handsome she has enchanted one pair of eyes which henceforward see her through their own medium But Morin noticed the faint increase of colour and light in her countenance It was as though she had broken through her thick cloud of hopeless sorrow and was dawning forth into a happier life And so whereas during her grief he had revered and respected it even to a point of silent sympathy now that she was gladdened his heart rose on the wings of strengthened hopes Even in the dreary monotony of this existence in his Aunt Babette s conciergerie Time had not failed in his work and now perhaps soon he might humbly strive to help Time The very next day he returned on some pretence of business to the Hotel Duguesclin and made his aunt s room rather than his aunt herself a present of roses and geraniums tied up in a bouquet with a tricolor ribbon Virginie was in the room sitting at the coarse sewing she liked to do for Madame Babette He saw her eyes brighten at the sight of the flowers she asked his aunt to let her arrange them he saw her untie the ribbon and with a gesture of dislike throw it on the ground and give it a kick with her little foot and even in this girlish manner of insulting his dearest prejudices he found something to admire As he was coming out Pierre stopped him The lad had been trying to arrest his cousin s attention by futile grimaces and signs played off behind Virginie s back but Monsieur Morin saw nothing but Mademoiselle Cannes However Pierre was not to be baffled and Monsieur Morin found him in waiting just outside the threshold With his finger on his lips Pierre walked on tiptoe by his companion s side till they would have been long past sight or hearing of the conciergerie even had the inhabitants devoted themselves to the purposes of spying or listening Chut said Pierre at last She goes out walking Well said Monsieur Morin half curious half annoyed at being disturbed in the delicious reverie of the future into which he longed to fall Well It is not well It is bad Why I do not ask who she is but I have my ideas She is an aristocrat Do the people about here begin to suspect her No no said Pierre But she goes out walking She has gone these two mornings I have watched her She meets a man she is friends with him for she talks to him as eagerly as he does to her mamma cannot tell who he is Has my aunt seen him No not so much as a fly s wing of him I myself have only seen his back It strikes me like a familiar back and yet I cannot think who it is But they separate with sudden darts like two birds who have been together to feed their young ones One moment they are in close talk their heads together chuckotting the next he has turned up some bye street and Mademoiselle Cannes is close upon me has almost caught me But she did not see you inquired Monsieur Morin in so altered a voice that Pierre gave him one of his quick penetrating looks He was struck by the way in which his cousin s features always coarse and common place had become contracted and pinched struck too by the livid look on his sallow complexion But as if Morin was conscious of the manner in which his face belied his feelings he made an effort and smiled and patted Pierre s head and thanked him for his intelligence and gave him a five franc piece and bade him go on with his observations of Mademoiselle Cannes movements and report all to him Pierre returned home with a light heart tossing up his five franc piece as he ran Just as he was at the conciergerie door a great tall man bustled past him and snatched his money away from him looking back with a laugh which added insult to injury Pierre had no redress no one had witnessed the impudent theft and if they had no one to be seen in the street was strong enough to give him redress Besides Pierre had seen enough of the state of the streets of Paris at that time to know that friends not enemies were required and the man had a bad air about him But all these considerations did not keep Pierre from bursting out into a fit of crying when he was once more under his mother s roof and Virginie who was alone there Madame Babette having gone out to make her daily purchases might have imagined him pommeled to death by the loudness of his sobs What is the matter asked she Speak my child What hast thou done He has robbed me he has robbed me was all Pierre could gulp out Robbed thee and of what my poor boy said Virginie stroking his hair gently Of my five franc piece of a five franc piece said Pierre correcting himself and leaving out the word my half fearful lest Virginie should inquire how he became possessed of such a sum and for what services it had been given him But of course no such idea came into her head for it would have been impertinent and she was gentle born Wait a moment my lad and going to the one small drawer in the inner apartment which held all her few possessions she brought back a little ring a ring just with one ruby in it which she had worn in the days when she cared to wear jewels Take this said she and run with it to a jeweller s It is but a poor valueless thing but it will bring you in your five francs at any rate Go I desire you But I cannot said the boy hesitating some dim sense of honour flitting through his misty morals Yes you must she continued urging him with her hand to the door Run if it brings in more than five francs you shall return the surplus to me Thus tempted by her urgency and I suppose reasoning with himself to the effect that he might as well have the money and then see whether he thought it right to act as a spy upon her or not the one action did not pledge him to the other nor yet did she make any conditions with her gift Pierre went off with her ring and after repaying himself his five francs he was enabled to bring Virginie back two more so well had he managed his affairs But although the whole transaction did not leave him bound in any way to discover or forward Virginie s wishes it did leave him pledged according to his code to act according to her advantage and he considered himself the judge of the best course to be pursued to this end And moreover this little kindness attached him to her personally He began to think how pleasant it would be to have so kind and generous a person for a relation how easily his troubles might be borne if he had always such a ready helper at hand how much he should like to make her like him and come to him for the protection of his masculine power First of all his duties as her self appointed squire came the necessity of finding out who her strange new acquaintance was Thus you see he arrived at the same end via supposed duty that he was previously pledged to via interest I fancy a good number of us when any line of action will promote our own interest can make ourselves believe that reasons exist which compel us to it as a duty In the course of a very few days Pierre had so circumvented Virginie as to have discovered that her new friend was no other than the Norman farmer in a different dress This was a great piece of knowledge to impart to Morin But Pierre was not prepared for the immediate physical effect it had on his cousin Morin sat suddenly down on one of the seats in the Boulevards it was there Pierre had met with him accidentally when he heard who it was that Virginie met I do not suppose the man had the faintest idea of any relationship or even previous acquaintanceship between Clement and Virginie If he thought of anything beyond the mere fact presented to him that his idol was in communication with another younger handsomer man than himself it must have been that the Norman farmer had seen her at the conciergerie and had been attracted by her and as was but natural had tried to make her acquaintance and had succeeded But from what Pierre told me I should not think that even this much thought passed through Morin s mind He seems to have been a man of rare and concentrated attachments violent though restrained and undemonstrative passions and above all a capability of jealousy of which his dark oriental complexion must have been a type I could fancy that if he had married Virginie he would have coined his life blood for luxuries to make her happy would have watched over and petted her at every sacrifice to himself as long as she would have been content to live with him alone But as Pierre expressed it to me When I saw what my cousin was when I learned his nature too late I perceived that he would have strangled a bird if she whom he loved was attracted by it from him When Pierre had told Morin of his discovery Morin sat down as I said quite suddenly as if he had been shot He found out that the first meeting between the Norman and Virginie was no accidental isolated circumstance Pierre was torturing him with his accounts of daily rendezvous if but for a moment they were seeing each other every day sometimes twice a day And Virginie could speak to this man though to himself she was coy and reserved as hardly to utter a sentence Pierre caught these broken words while his cousin s complexion grew more and more livid and then purple as if some great effect were produced on his circulation by the news he had just heard Pierre was so startled by his cousin s wandering senseless eyes and otherwise disordered looks that he rushed into a neighbouring cabaret for a glass of absinthe which he paid for as he recollected afterwards with a portion of Virginie s five francs By and by Morin recovered his natural appearance but he was gloomy and silent and all that Pierre could get out of him was that the Norman farmer should not sleep another night at the Hotel Duguesclin giving him such opportunities of passing and repassing by the conciergerie door He was too much absorbed in his own thoughts to repay Pierre the half franc he had spent on the absinthe which Pierre perceived and seems to have noted down in the ledger of his mind as on Virginie s balance of favour Altogether he was much disappointed at his cousin s mode of receiving intelligence which the lad thought worth another five franc piece at least or if not paid for in money to be paid for in open mouthed confidence and expression of feeling that he was for a time so far a partisan of Virginie s unconscious Virginie against his cousin as to feel regret when the Norman returned no more to his night s lodging and when Virginie s eager watch at the crevice of the closely drawn blind ended only with a sigh of disappointment If it had not been for his mother s presence at the time Pierre thought he should have told her all But how far was his mother in his cousin s confidence as regarded the dismissal of the Norman In a few days however Pierre felt almost sure that they had established some new means of communication Virginie went out for a short time every day but though Pierre followed her as closely as he could without exciting her observation he was unable to discover what kind of intercourse she held with the Norman She went in general the same short round among the little shops in the neighbourhood not entering any but stopping at two or three Pierre afterwards remembered that she had invariably paused at the nosegays displayed in a certain window and studied them long but then she stopped and looked at caps hats fashions confectionery all of the humble kind common in that quarter so how should he have known that any particular attraction existed among the flowers Morin came more regularly than ever to his aunt s but Virginie was apparently unconscious that she was the attraction She looked healthier and more hopeful than she had done for months and her manners to all were gentler and not so reserved Almost as if she wished to manifest her gratitude to Madame Babette for her long continuance of kindness the necessity for which was nearly ended Virginie showed an unusual alacrity in rendering the old woman any little service in her power and evidently tried to respond to Monsieur Morin s civilities he being Madame Babette s nephew with a soft graciousness which must have made one of her principal charms for all who knew her speak of the fascination of her manners so winning and attentive to others while yet her opinions and often her actions were of so decided a character For as I have said her beauty was by no means great yet every man who came near her seems to have fallen into the sphere of her influence Monsieur Morin was deeper than ever in love with her during these last few days he was worked up into a state capable of any sacrifice either of himself or others so that he might obtain her at last He sat devouring her with his eyes to use Pierre s expression whenever she could not see him but if she looked towards him he looked to the ground anywhere away from her and almost stammered in his replies if she addressed any question to him He had been I should think ashamed of his extreme agitation on the Boulevards for Pierre thought that he absolutely shunned him for these few succeeding days He must have believed that he had driven the Norman my poor Clement off the field by banishing him from his inn and thought that the intercourse between him and Virginie which he had thus interrupted was of so slight and transient a character as to be quenched by a little difficulty But he appears to have felt that he had made but little way and he awkwardly turned to Pierre for help not yet confessing his love though he only tried to make friends again with the lad after their silent estrangement And Pierre for some time did not choose to perceive his cousin s advances He would reply to all the roundabout questions Morin put to him respecting household conversations when he was not present or household occupations and tone of thought without mentioning Virginie s name any more than his questioner did The lad would seem to suppose that his cousin s strong interest in their domestic ways of going on was all on account of Madame Babette At last he worked his cousin up to the point of making him a confidant and then the boy was half frightened at the torrent of vehement words he had unloosed The lava came down with a greater rush for having been pent up so long Morin cried out his words in a hoarse passionate voice clenched his teeth his fingers and seemed almost convulsed as he spoke out his terrible love for Virginie which would lead him to kill her sooner than see her another s and if another stepped in between him and her and then he smiled a fierce triumphant smile but did not say any more Pierre was as I said half frightened but also half admiring This was really love a grande passion a really fine dramatic thing like the plays they acted at the little theatre yonder He had a dozen times the sympathy with his cousin now that he had had before and readily swore by the infernal gods for they were far too enlightened to believe in one God or Christianity or anything of the kind that he would devote himself body and soul to forwarding his cousin s views Then his cousin took him to a shop and bought him a smart second hand watch on which they scratched the word Fidelite and thus was the compact sealed Pierre settled in his own mind that if he were a woman he should like to be beloved as Virginie was by his cousin and that it would be an extremely good thing for her to be the wife of so rich a citizen as Morin Fils and for Pierre himself too for doubtless their gratitude would lead them to give him rings and watches ad infinitum A day or two afterwards Virginie was taken ill Madame Babette said it was because she had persevered in going out in all weathers after confining herself to two warm rooms for so long and very probably this was really the cause for from Pierre s account she must have been suffering from a feverish cold aggravated no doubt by her impatience at Madame Babette s familiar prohibitions of any more walks until she was better Every day in spite of her trembling aching limbs she would fain have arranged her dress for her walk at the usual time but Madame Babette was fully prepared to put physical obstacles in her way if she was not obedient in remaining tranquil on the little sofa by the side of the fire The third day she called Pierre to her when his mother was not attending having in fact locked up Mademoiselle Cannes out of door things See my child said Virginie Thou must do me a great favour Go to the gardener s shop in the Rue des Bons Enfans and look at the nosegays in the window I long for pinks they are my favourite flower Here are two francs If thou seest a nosegay of pinks displayed in the window if it be ever so faded nay if thou seest two or three nosegays of pinks remember buy them all and bring them to me I have so great a desire for the smell She fell back weak and exhausted Pierre hurried out Now was the time here was the clue to the long inspection of the nosegay in this very shop Sure enough there was a drooping nosegay of pinks in the window Pierre went in and with all his impatience he made as good a bargain as he could urging that the flowers were faded and good for nothing At last he purchased them at a very moderate price And now you will learn the bad consequences of teaching the lower orders anything beyond what is immediately necessary to enable them to earn their daily bread The silly Count de Crequy he who had been sent to his bloody rest by the very canaille of whom he thought so much he who had made Virginie indirectly it is true reject such a man as her cousin Clement by inflating her mind with his bubbles of theories this Count de Crequy had long ago taken a fancy to Pierre as he saw the bright sharp child playing about his court Monsieur de Crequy had even begun to educate the boy himself to try work out certain opinions of his into practice but the drudgery of the affair wearied him and beside Babette had left his employment Still the Count took a kind of interest in his former pupil and made some sort of arrangement by which Pierre was to be taught reading and writing and accounts and Heaven knows what besides Latin I dare say So Pierre instead of being an innocent messenger as he ought to have been as mister Horner s little lad Gregson ought to have been this morning could read writing as well as either you or I So what does he do on obtaining the nosegay but examine it well The stalks of the flowers were tied up with slips of matting in wet moss Pierre undid the strings unwrapped the moss and out fell a piece of wet paper with the writing all blurred with moisture It was but a torn piece of writing paper apparently but Pierre s wicked mischievous eyes read what was written on it written so as to look like a fragment Ready every and any night at nine All is prepared Have no fright Trust one who whatever hopes he might once have had is content now to serve you as a faithful cousin and a place was named which I forget but which Pierre did not as it was evidently the rendezvous After the lad had studied every word till he could say it off by heart he placed the paper where he had found it enveloped it in moss and tied the whole up again carefully Virginie s face coloured scarlet as she received it She kept smelling at it and trembling but she did not untie it although Pierre suggested how much fresher it would be if the stalks were immediately put into water But once after his back had been turned for a minute he saw it untied when he looked round again and Virginie was blushing and hiding something in her bosom Pierre was now all impatience to set off and find his cousin But his mother seemed to want him for small domestic purposes even more than usual and he had chafed over a multitude of errands connected with the Hotel before he could set off and search for his cousin at his usual haunts At last the two met and Pierre related all the events of the morning to Morin He said the note off word by word That lad this morning had something of the magpie look of Pierre it made me shudder to see him and hear him repeat the note by heart Then Morin asked him to tell him all over again Pierre was struck by Morin s heavy sighs as he repeated the story When he came the second time to the note Morin tried to write the words down but either he was not a good ready scholar or his fingers trembled too much Pierre hardly remembered but at any rate the lad had to do it with his wicked reading and writing When this was done Morin sat heavily silent Pierre would have preferred the expected outburst for this impenetrable gloom perplexed and baffled him He had even to speak to his cousin to rouse him and when he replied what he said had so little apparent connection with the subject which Pierre had expected to find uppermost in his mind that he was half afraid that his cousin had lost his wits My Aunt Babette is out of coffee I am sure I do not know said Pierre Yes she is I heard her say so Tell her that a friend of mine has just opened a shop in the Rue Saint Antoine and that if she will join me there in an hour I will supply her with a good stock of coffee just to give my friend encouragement His name is Antoine Meyer Number One hundred and Fifty at the sign of the Cap of Liberty I could go with you now I can carry a few pounds of coffee better than my mother said Pierre all in good faith He told me he should never forget the look on his cousin s face as he turned round and bade him begone and give his mother the message without another word It had evidently sent him home promptly to obey his cousins command Morin s message perplexed Madame Babette How could he know I was out of coffee said she I am but I only used the last up this morning How could Victor know about it I am sure I can t tell said Pierre who by this time had recovered his usual self possession All I know is that monsieur is in a pretty temper and that if you are not sharp to your time at this Antoine Meyer s you are likely to come in for some of his black looks Well it is very kind of him to offer to give me some coffee to be sure But how could he know I was out Pierre hurried his mother off impatiently for he was certain that the offer of the coffee was only a blind to some hidden purpose on his cousin s part and he made no doubt that when his mother had been informed of what his cousin s real intention was he Pierre could extract it from her by coaxing or bullying But he was mistaken Madame Babette returned home grave depressed silent and loaded with the best coffee Some time afterwards he learnt why his cousin had sought for this interview It was to extract from her by promises and threats the real name of Mam selle Cannes which would give him a clue to the true appellation of The Faithful Cousin He concealed the second purpose from his aunt who had been quite unaware of his jealousy of the Norman farmer or of his identification of him with any relation of Virginie s But Madame Babette instinctively shrank from giving him any information she must have felt that in the lowering mood in which she found him his desire for greater knowledge of Virginie s antecedents boded her no good And yet he made his aunt his confidante told her what she had only suspected before that he was deeply enamoured of Mam selle Cannes and would gladly marry her He spoke to Madame Babette of his father s hoarded riches and of the share which he as partner had in them at the present time and of the prospect of the succession to the whole which he had as only child He told his aunt of the provision for her Madame Babette s life which he would make on the day when he married Mam selle Cannes And yet and yet Babette saw that in his eye and look which made her more and more reluctant to confide in him By and by he tried threats She should leave the conciergerie and find employment where she liked Still silence Then he grew angry and swore that he would inform against her at the bureau of the Directory for harbouring an aristocrat an aristocrat he knew Mademoiselle was whatever her real name might be His aunt should have a domiciliary visit and see how she liked that The officers of the Government were the people for finding out secrets In vain she reminded him that by so doing he would expose to imminent danger the lady whom he had professed to love He told her with a sullen relapse into silence after his vehement outpouring of passion never to trouble herself about that At last he wearied out the old woman and frightened alike of herself and of him she told him all that Mam selle Cannes was Mademoiselle Virginie de Crequy daughter of the Count of that name Who was the Count Younger brother of the Marquis Where was the Marquis Dead long ago leaving a widow and child A son eagerly Yes a son Where was he Parbleu how should she know for her courage returned a little as the talk went away from the only person of the De Crequy family that she cared about But by dint of some small glasses out of a bottle of Antoine Meyer s she told him more about the De Crequys than she liked afterwards to remember For the exhilaration of the brandy lasted but a very short time and she came home as I have said depressed with a presentiment of coming evil She would not answer Pierre but cuffed him about in a manner to which the spoilt boy was quite unaccustomed His cousin s short angry words and sudden withdrawal of confidence his mother s unwonted crossness and fault finding all made Virginie s kind gentle treatment more than ever charming to the lad He half resolved to tell her how he had been acting as a spy upon her actions and at whose desire he had done it But he was afraid of Morin and of the vengeance which he was sure would fall upon him for any breach of confidence Towards half past eight that evening Pierre watching saw Virginie arrange several little things she was in the inner room but he sat where he could see her through the glazed partition His mother sat apparently sleeping in the great easy chair Virginie moved about softly for fear of disturbing her She made up one or two little parcels of the few things she could call her own one packet she concealed about herself the others she directed and left on the shelf She is going thought Pierre and as he said in giving me the account his heart gave a spring to think that he should never see her again If either his mother or his cousin had been more kind to him he might have endeavoured to intercept her but as it was he held his breath and when she came out he pretended to read scarcely knowing whether he wished her to succeed in the purpose which he was almost sure she entertained or not She stopped by him and passed her hand over his hair He told me that his eyes filled with tears at this caress Then she stood for a moment looking at the sleeping Madame Babette and stooped down and softly kissed her on the forehead Pierre dreaded lest his mother should awake for by this time the wayward vacillating boy must have been quite on Virginie s side but the brandy she had drunk made her slumber heavily Virginie went Pierre s heart beat fast He was sure his cousin would try to intercept her but how he could not imagine He longed to run out and see the catastrophe but he had let the moment slip he was also afraid of reawakening his mother to her unusual state of anger and violence CHAPTER VIII Pierre went on pretending to read but in reality listening with acute tension of ear to every little sound His perceptions became so sensitive in this respect that he was incapable of measuring time every moment had seemed so full of noises 
7265-74923-0000	train-other-500	from the beating of his heart up to the roll of the heavy carts in the distance He wondered whether Virginie would have reached the place of rendezvous and yet he was unable to compute the passage of minutes His mother slept soundly that was well
7265-74923-0001	train-other-500	By this time Virginie must have met the faithful cousin if indeed Morin had not made his appearance At length he felt as if he could no longer sit still awaiting the issue but must run out and see what course events had taken
7265-74923-0002	train-other-500	In vain his mother half rousing herself called after him to ask whither he was going he was already out of hearing before she had ended her sentence and he ran on until stopped by the sight of Mademoiselle Cannes walking along at so swift a pace that it was almost a run
none	none	 while at her side resolutely keeping by her Morin was striding abreast 
7265-74923-0003	train-other-500	Pierre had just turned the corner of the street when he came upon them
none	none	 Virginie would have passed him without recognizing him she was in such passionate agitation but for Morin s gesture by which he would fain have kept Pierre from interrupting them Then when Virginie saw the lad she caught at his arm and thanked God as if in that boy of twelve or fourteen she held a protector 
7265-74923-0004	train-other-500	Pierre felt her tremble from head to foot and was afraid lest she would fall there where she stood in the hard rough street Begone Pierre said Morin I cannot replied Pierre who indeed was held firmly by Virginie Besides I won t he added
none	none	 Who has been frightening mademoiselle in this way asked he very much inclined to brave his cousin at all hazards Mademoiselle is not accustomed to walk in the streets alone said Morin sulkily 
7265-74923-0005	train-other-500	She came upon a crowd attracted by the arrest of an aristocrat and their cries alarmed her I offered to take charge of her home Mademoiselle should not walk in these streets alone We are not like the cold blooded people of the Faubourg Saint Germain Virginie did not speak
none	none	 Pierre doubted if she heard a word of what they were saying She leant upon him more and more heavily 
7265-74923-0006	train-other-500	Will mademoiselle condescend to take my arm said Morin with sulky and yet humble uncouthness
none	none	 I dare say he would have given worlds if he might have had that little hand within his arm 
7265-74923-0007	train-other-500	but though she still kept silence she shuddered up away from him as you shrink from touching a toad He had said something to her during that walk you may be sure which had made her loathe him He marked and understood the gesture
7265-74923-0008	train-other-500	He held himself aloof while Pierre gave her all the assistance he could in their slow progress homewards But Morin accompanied her all the same He had played too desperate a game to be baulked now
none	none	 He had given information against the ci devant Marquis de Crequy as a returned emigre to be met with at such a time in such a place Morin had hoped that all sign of the arrest would have been cleared away before Virginie reached the spot 
7265-74923-0009	train-other-500	so swiftly were terrible deeds done in those days But Clement defended himself desperately Virginie was punctual to a second and though the wounded man was borne off to the Abbaye amid a crowd of the unsympathising jeerers who mingled with the armed officials of the Directory
none	none	 Morin feared lest Virginie had recognized him and he would have preferred that she should have thought that the faithful cousin was faithless than that she should have seen him in bloody danger on her account I suppose he fancied that if Virginie never saw or heard more of him her imagination would not dwell on his simple disappearance as it would do if she knew what he was suffering for her sake 
7265-74923-0010	train-other-500	At any rate Pierre saw that his cousin was deeply mortified by the whole tenor of his behaviour during their walk home When they arrived at Madame Babette s Virginie fell fainting on the floor her strength had but just sufficed for this exertion of reaching the shelter of the house
7265-74923-0011	train-other-500	Her first sign of restoring consciousness consisted in avoidance of Morin He had been most assiduous in his efforts to bring her round quite tender in his way Pierre said and this marked instinctive repugnance to him evidently gave him extreme pain
7265-74923-0012	train-other-500	I suppose Frenchmen are more demonstrative than we are for Pierre declared that he saw his cousin s eyes fill with tears
none	none	 as she shrank away from his touch if he tried to arrange the shawl they had laid under her head like a pillow 
7265-74923-0013	train-other-500	or as she shut her eyes when he passed before her Madame Babette was urgent with her to go and lie down on the bed in the inner room but it was some time before she was strong enough to rise and do this When Madame Babette returned from arranging the girl comfortably the three relations sat down in silence
7265-74923-0014	train-other-500	a silence which Pierre thought would never be broken He wanted his mother to ask his cousin what had happened But Madame Babette was afraid of her nephew and thought it more discreet to wait for such crumbs of intelligence as he might think fit to throw to her
7265-74923-0015	train-other-500	But after she had twice reported Virginie to be asleep without a word being uttered in reply to her whispers by either of her companions Morin s powers of self containment gave way It is hard he said
none	none	 What is hard asked Madame Babette after she had paused for a time to enable him to add to or to finish his sentence if he pleased It is hard for a man to love a woman as I do he went on I did not seek to love her 
7265-74923-0016	train-other-500	it came upon me before I was aware before I had ever thought about it at all I loved her better than all the world beside All my life before I knew her seems a dull blank I neither know nor care for what I did before then And now there are just two lives before me
none	none	 Either I have her or I have not That is all but that is everything And what can I do to make her have me Tell me aunt and he caught at Madame Babette s arm and gave it so sharp a shake that she half screamed out Pierre said and evidently grew alarmed at her nephew s excitement 
7265-74923-0017	train-other-500	Hush Victor said she There are other women in the world if this one will not have you None other for me he said sinking back as if hopeless I am plain and coarse not one of the scented darlings of the aristocrats Say that I am ugly brutish
none	none	 I did not make myself so any more than I made myself love her It is my fate But am I to submit to the consequences of my fate without a struggle 
7265-74923-0018	train-other-500	Not I As strong as my love is so strong is my will It can be no stronger continued he gloomily Aunt Babette you must help me you must make her love me He was so fierce here that Pierre said he did not wonder that his mother was frightened
none	none	 I Victor she exclaimed I make her love you How can I Ask me to speak for you to Mademoiselle Didot or to Mademoiselle Cauchois even 
7265-74923-0019	train-other-500	or to such as they and I ll do it and welcome But to Mademoiselle de Crequy why you don t know the difference Those people the old nobility I mean why they don t know a man from a dog out of their own rank
none	none	 And no wonder for the young gentlemen of quality are treated differently to us from their very birth If she had you to morrow you would be miserable Let me alone for knowing the aristocracy I have not been a concierge to a duke and three counts for nothing I tell you all your ways are different to her ways I would change my ways as you call them Be reasonable Victor No I will not be reasonable if by that you mean giving her up I tell you two lives are before me one with her one without her 
7265-74923-0020	train-other-500	But the latter will be but a short career for both of us You said aunt that the talk went in the conciergerie of her father s hotel that she would have nothing to do with this cousin whom I put out of the way to day So the servants said How could I know
7265-74923-0021	train-other-500	All I know is that he left off coming to our hotel and that at one time before then he had never been two days absent So much the better for him He suffers now for having come between me and my object in trying to snatch her away out of my sight Take you warning Pierre
7265-74923-0022	train-other-500	I did not like your meddling to night And so he went off leaving Madam Babette rocking herself backwards and forwards in all the depression of spirits consequent upon the reaction after the brandy and upon her knowledge of her nephew s threatened purpose combined
none	none	 In telling you most of this I have simply repeated Pierre s account which I wrote down at the time But here what he had to say came to a sudden break for the next morning when Madame Babette rose Virginie was missing 
7265-74923-0023	train-other-500	and it was some time before either she or Pierre or Morin could get the slightest clue to the missing girl And now I must take up the story as it was told to the Intendant Flechier by the old gardener Jacques with whom Clement had been lodging on his first arrival in Paris
7265-74923-0024	train-other-500	The old man could not I dare say remember half as much of what had happened as Pierre did the former had the dulled memory of age while Pierre had evidently thought over the whole series of events as a story as a play if one may call it so during the solitary hours in his after life
7265-74923-0025	train-other-500	wherever they were passed whether in lonely camp watches or in the foreign prison where he had to drag out many years Clement had as I said returned to the gardener s garret after he had been dismissed from the Hotel Duguesclin
7265-74923-0026	train-other-500	There were several reasons for his thus doubling back One was that he put nearly the whole breadth of Paris between him and an enemy though why Morin was an enemy and to what extent he carried his dislike or hatred Clement could not tell of course
none	none	 The next reason for returning to Jacques was no doubt the conviction that in multiplying his residences he multiplied the chances against his being suspected and recognized And then again the old man was in his secret and his ally although perhaps but a feeble kind of one 
7265-74923-0027	train-other-500	It was through Jacques that the plan of communication by means of a nosegay of pinks had been devised and it was Jacques who procured him the last disguise that Clement was to use in Paris as he hoped and trusted
none	none	 It was that of a respectable shopkeeper of no particular class a dress that would have seemed perfectly suitable to the young man who would naturally have worn it and yet as Clement put it on and adjusted it giving it a sort of finish and elegance which I always noticed about his appearance and which I believed was innate in the wearer I have no doubt it seemed like the usual apparel of a gentleman No coarseness of texture nor clumsiness of cut could disguise the nobleman of thirty descents it appeared for immediately on arriving at the place of rendezvous he was recognized by the men placed there on Morin s information to seize him 
7265-74923-0028	train-other-500	Jacques following at a little distance with a bundle under his arm containing articles of feminine disguise for Virginie saw four men attempt Clement s arrest
none	none	 saw him quick as lightning draw a sword hitherto concealed in a clumsy stick 
7265-74923-0029	train-other-500	saw his agile figure spring to his guard and saw him defend himself with the rapidity and art of a man skilled in arms But what good did it do as Jacques piteously used to ask Monsieur Flechier told me
7265-74923-0030	train-other-500	A great blow from a heavy club on the sword arm of Monsieur de Crequy laid it helpless and immovable by his side Jacques always thought that that blow came from one of the spectators who by this time had collected round the scene of the affray
7265-74923-0031	train-other-500	The next instant his master his little marquis was down among the feet of the crowd and though he was up again before he had received much damage so active and light was my poor Clement it was not before the old gardener had hobbled forwards and with many an old fashioned oath and curse
7265-74923-0032	train-other-500	proclaimed himself a partisan of the losing side
none	none	 a follower of a ci devant 
7265-74923-0033	train-other-500	aristocrat It was quite enough He received one or two good blows which were in fact aimed at his master and then almost before he was aware he found his arms pinioned behind him with a woman s garter which one of the viragos in the crowd had made no scruple of pulling off in public
none	none	 as soon as she heard for what purpose it was wanted 
7265-74923-0034	train-other-500	Poor Jacques was stunned and unhappy his master was out of sight on before and the old gardener scarce knew whither they were taking him
none	none	 His head ached from the blows which had fallen upon it it was growing dark June day though it was and when first he seems to have become exactly aware of what had happened to him it was when he was turned into one of the larger rooms of the Abbaye in which all were put who had no other allotted place wherein to sleep One or two iron lamps hung from the ceiling by chains giving a dim light for a little circle Jacques stumbled forwards over a sleeping body lying on the ground The sleeper wakened up enough to complain and the apology of the old man in reply caught the ear of his master who until this time could hardly have been aware of the straits and difficulties of his faithful Jacques And there they sat against a pillar the live long night holding one another s hands and each restraining expressions of pain for fear of adding to the other s distress That night made them intimate friends in spite of the difference of age and rank The disappointed hopes the acute suffering of the present the apprehensions of the future made them seek solace in talking of the past Monsieur de Crequy and the gardener found themselves disputing with interest in which chimney of the stack the starling used to build 
7265-74923-0035	train-other-500	the starling whose nest Clement sent to Urian you remember and discussing the merits of different espalier pears which grew and may grow still in the old garden of the Hotel de Crequy Towards morning both fell asleep The old man wakened first
7265-74923-0036	train-other-500	His frame was deadened to suffering I suppose for he felt relieved of his pain but Clement moaned and cried in feverish slumber His broken arm was beginning to inflame his blood He was besides much injured by some kicks from the crowd as he fell
none	none	 As the old man looked sadly on the white baked lips and the flushed cheeks 
7265-74923-0037	train-other-500	contorted with suffering even in his sleep Clement gave a sharp cry which disturbed his miserable neighbours all slumbering around in uneasy attitudes
none	none	 They bade him with curses be silent 
7265-74923-0038	train-other-500	and then turning round tried again to forget their own misery in sleep
none	none	 For you see the bloodthirsty canaille 
7265-74923-0039	train-other-500	had not been sated with guillotining and hanging all the nobility they could find but were now informing right and left even against each other and when Clement and Jacques were in the prison there were few of gentle blood in the place and fewer still of gentle manners
none	none	 At the sound of the angry words and threats Jacques thought it best to awaken his master from his feverish uncomfortable sleep lest he should provoke more enmity and tenderly lifting him up he tried to adjust his own body so that it should serve as a rest and a pillow for the younger man 
7265-74923-0040	train-other-500	The motion aroused Clement and he began to talk in a strange feverish way
none	none	 of Virginie too whose name he would not have breathed in such a place had he been quite himself But Jacques had as much delicacy of feeling as any lady in the land although mind you he knew neither how to read nor write and bent his head low down so that his master might tell him in a whisper what messages he was to take to Mademoiselle de Crequy 
7265-74923-0041	train-other-500	in case Poor Clement he knew it must come to that No escape for him now in Norman disguise or otherwise Either by gathering fever or guillotine death was sure of his prey Well when that happened Jacques was to go and find Mademoiselle de Crequy
7265-74923-0042	train-other-500	and tell her that her cousin loved her at the last as he had loved her at the first but that she should never have heard another word of his attachment from his living lips that he knew he was not good enough for her his queen and that no thought of earning her love by his devotion had prompted his return to France
7265-74923-0043	train-other-500	only that if possible he might have the great privilege of serving her whom he loved And then he went off into rambling talk about petit maitres and such kind of expressions said Jacques to Flechier the intendant
7265-74923-0044	train-other-500	little knowing what a clue that one word gave to much of the poor lad s suffering The summer morning came slowly on in that dark prison and when Jacques could look round his master was now sleeping on his shoulder still the uneasy starting sleep of fever he saw that there were many women among the prisoners
7265-74923-0045	train-other-500	I have heard some of those who have escaped from the prisons say that the look of despair and agony that came into the faces of the prisoners on first wakening as the sense of their situation grew upon them was what lasted the longest in the memory of the survivors
7265-74923-0046	train-other-500	This look they said passed away from the women s faces sooner than it did from those of the men Poor old Jacques kept falling asleep and plucking himself up again for fear lest if he did not attend to his master some harm might come to the swollen helpless arm
7265-74923-0047	train-other-500	Yet his weariness grew upon him in spite of all his efforts and at last he felt as if he must give way to the irresistible desire if only for five minutes But just then there was a bustle at the door Jacques opened his eyes wide to look
none	none	 The gaoler is early with breakfast said some one lazily It is the darkness of this accursed place that makes us think it early said another 
7265-74923-0048	train-other-500	All this time a parley was going on at the door
none	none	 Some one came in not the gaoler a woman 
7265-74923-0049	train-other-500	The door was shut to and locked behind her She only advanced a step or two for it was too sudden a change out of the light into that dark shadow for any one to see clearly for the first few minutes Jacques had his eyes fairly open now and was wide awake
none	none	 It was Mademoiselle de Crequy looking bright clear and resolute The faithful heart of the old man read that look like an open page Her cousin should not die there on her behalf without at least the comfort of her sweet presence Here he is 
7265-74923-0050	train-other-500	he whispered as her gown would have touched him in passing without her perceiving him in the heavy obscurity of the place The good God bless you my friend she murmured
none	none	 as she saw the attitude of the old man propped against a pillar and holding Clement in his arms 
7265-74923-0051	train-other-500	as if the young man had been a helpless baby while one of the poor gardener s hands supported the broken limb in the easiest position Virginie sat down by the old man and held out her arms Softly she moved Clement s head to her own shoulder
7265-74923-0052	train-other-500	softly she transferred the task of holding the arm to herself Clement lay on the floor but she supported him and Jacques was at liberty to arise and stretch and shake his stiff weary old body He then sat down at a little distance and watched the pair until he fell asleep
none	none	 Clement had muttered Virginie 
7265-74923-0053	train-other-500	as they half roused him by their movements out of his stupor but Jacques thought he was only dreaming nor did he seem fully awake when once his eyes opened and he looked full at Virginie s face bending over him and growing crimson under his gaze though she never stirred for fear of hurting him if she moved
7265-74923-0054	train-other-500	Clement looked in silence until his heavy eyelids came slowly down and he fell into his oppressive slumber again Either he did not recognize her or she came in too completely as a part of his sleeping visions for him to be disturbed by her appearance there
none	none	 When Jacques awoke it was full daylight at least as full as it would ever be in that place His breakfast the gaol allowance of bread and vin ordinaire was by his side 
7265-74923-0055	train-other-500	He must have slept soundly He looked for his master He and Virginie had recognized each other now hearts as well as appearance They were smiling into each other s faces as if that dull vaulted room in the grim Abbaye were the sunny gardens of Versailles with music and festivity all abroad
none	none	 Apparently they had much to say to each other for whispered questions and answers never ceased Virginie had made a sling for the poor broken arm nay she had obtained two splinters of wood in some way and one of their fellow prisoners having it appeared some knowledge of surgery had set it 
7265-74923-0056	train-other-500	Jacques felt more desponding by far than they did
none	none	 for he was suffering from the night he had passed which told upon his aged frame while they must have heard some good news as it seemed to him so bright and happy did they look Yet Clement was still in bodily pain and suffering and Virginie by her own act and deed was a prisoner in that dreadful Abbaye whence the only issue was the guillotine But they were together they loved they understood each other at length When Virginie saw that Jacques was awake and languidly munching his breakfast she rose from the wooden stool on which she was sitting and went to him 
7265-74923-0057	train-other-500	holding out both hands and refusing to allow him to rise while she thanked him with pretty eagerness for all his kindness to Monsieur Monsieur himself came towards him following Virginie but with tottering steps as if his head was weak and dizzy to thank the poor old man who now on his feet stood between them
none	none	 ready to cry while they gave him credit for faithful actions which he felt to have been almost involuntary on his part 
7265-74923-0058	train-other-500	for loyalty was like an instinct in the good old days before your educational cant had come up And so two days went on
none	none	 The only event was the morning call for the victims a certain number of whom were summoned to trial every day And to be tried was to be condemned Every one of the prisoners became grave as the hour for their summons approached Most of the victims went to their doom with uncomplaining resignation and for a while after their departure there was comparative silence in the prison 
7265-74923-0059	train-other-500	But by and by so said Jacques the conversation or amusements began again Human nature cannot stand the perpetual pressure of such keen anxiety without an effort to relieve itself by thinking of something else
none	none	 Jacques said that Monsieur and Mademoiselle 
7265-74923-0060	train-other-500	were for ever talking together of the past days it was Do you remember this or Do you remember that perpetually He sometimes thought they forgot where they were and what was before them
none	none	 But Jacques did not and every day he trembled more and more as the list was called over The third morning of their incarceration the gaoler brought in a man whom Jacques did not recognize and therefore did not at once observe for he was waiting as in duty bound upon his master and his sweet young lady as he always called her in repeating the story He thought that the new introduction was some friend of the gaoler as the two seemed well acquainted 
7265-74923-0061	train-other-500	and the latter stayed a few minutes talking with his visitor before leaving him in prison
none	none	 So Jacques was surprised when after a short time had elapsed he looked round and saw the fierce stare with which the stranger was regarding Monsieur and Mademoiselle de Crequy 
7265-74923-0062	train-other-500	as the pair sat at breakfast the said breakfast being laid as well as Jacques knew how on a bench fastened into the prison wall Virginie sitting on her low stool and Clement half lying on the ground by her side and submitting gladly to be fed by her pretty white fingers
none	none	 for it was one of her fancies Jacques said to do all she could for him in consideration of his broken arm And indeed Clement was wasting away daily for he had received other injuries internal and more serious than that to his arm during the melee which had ended in his capture The stranger made Jacques conscious of his presence by a sigh which was almost a groan 
7265-74923-0063	train-other-500	All three prisoners looked round at the sound Clement s face expressed little but scornful indifference
none	none	 but Virginie s face froze into stony hate Jacques said he never saw such a look and hoped that he never should again Yet after that first revelation of feeling her look was steady and fixed in another direction 
7265-74923-0064	train-other-500	to that in which the stranger stood still motionless still watching He came a step nearer at last Mademoiselle he said Not the quivering of an eyelash showed that she heard him
7265-74923-0065	train-other-500	Mademoiselle he said again with an intensity of beseeching that made Jacques not knowing who he was almost pity him when he saw his young lady s obdurate face
none	none	 There was perfect silence for a space of time which Jacques could not measure 
7265-74923-0066	train-other-500	Then again the voice hesitatingly saying Monsieur Clement could not hold the same icy countenance as Virginie he turned his head with an impatient gesture of disgust but even that emboldened the man Monsieur do ask mademoiselle to listen to me
7265-74923-0067	train-other-500	just two words Mademoiselle de Crequy only listens to whom she chooses Very haughtily my Clement would say that I am sure But mademoiselle lowering his voice and coming a step or two nearer Virginie must have felt his approach though she did not see it
none	none	 for she drew herself a little on one side so as to put as much space as possible between him and her Mademoiselle it is not too late I can save you 
7265-74923-0068	train-other-500	but to morrow your name is down on the list I can save you if you will listen Still no word or sign
none	none	 Jacques did not understand the affair Why was she so obdurate to one who might be ready to include Clement in the proposal as far as Jacques knew The man withdrew a little but did not offer to leave the prison He never took his eyes off Virginie he seemed to be suffering from some acute and terrible pain as he watched her Jacques cleared away the breakfast things as well as he could Purposely as I suspect he passed near the man 
7265-74923-0069	train-other-500	Hist said the stranger You are Jacques the gardener arrested for assisting an aristocrat
none	none	 I know the gaoler 
7265-74923-0070	train-other-500	You shall escape if you will Only take this message from me to mademoiselle You heard She will not listen to me I did not want her to come here I never knew she was here and she will die to morrow They will put her beautiful round throat under the guillotine
7265-74923-0071	train-other-500	Tell her good old man tell her how sweet life is and how I can save her and how I will not ask for more than just to see her from time to time She is so young and death is annihilation you know Why does she hate me so I want to save her I have done her no harm
7265-74923-0072	train-other-500	Good old man tell her how terrible death is and that she will die to morrow unless she listens to me Jacques saw no harm in repeating this message Clement listened in silence watching Virginie with an air of infinite tenderness Will you not try him my cherished one he said
7265-74923-0073	train-other-500	Towards you he may mean well which makes me think that Virginie had never repeated to Clement the conversation which she had overheard that last night at Madame Babette s you would be in no worse a situation than you were before No worse Clement and I should have known what you were and have lost you
7265-74923-0074	train-other-500	My Clement said she reproachfully Ask him said she turning to Jacques suddenly if he can save Monsieur de Crequy as well if he can O Clement we might escape to England we are but young And she hid her face on his shoulder
7265-74923-0075	train-other-500	Jacques returned to the stranger and asked him Virginie s question His eyes were fixed on the cousins he was very pale and the twitchings or contortions which must have been involuntary whenever he was agitated convulsed his whole body He made a long pause
none	none	 I will save mademoiselle and monsieur if she will go straight from prison to the mairie and be my wife 
7265-74923-0076	train-other-500	Your wife Jacques could not help exclaiming That she will never be never Ask her said Morin hoarsely
none	none	 But almost before Jacques thought he could have fairly uttered the words Clement caught their meaning 
7265-74923-0077	train-other-500	Begone said he not one word more Virginie touched the old man as he was moving away Tell him he does not know how he makes me welcome death And smiling as if triumphant she turned again to Clement
none	none	 The stranger did not speak as Jacques gave him the meaning not the words of their replies He was going away but stopped A minute or two afterwards he beckoned to Jacques The old gardener seems to have thought it undesirable to throw away even the chance of assistance from such a man as this for he went forward to speak to him 
7265-74923-0078	train-other-500	Listen I have influence with the gaoler He shall let thee pass out with the victims to morrow No one will notice it or miss thee
none	none	 They will be led to trial even at the last moment I will save her if she sends me word she relents 
7265-74923-0079	train-other-500	Speak to her as the time draws on Life is very sweet tell her how sweet Speak to him he will do more with her than thou canst Let him urge her to live
none	none	 Even at the last I will be at the Palais de Justice at the Greve I have followers I have interest Come among the crowd that follow the victims I shall see thee It will be no worse for him if she escapes Save my master and I will do all said Jacques Only on my one condition said Morin doggedly and Jacques was hopeless of that condition ever being fulfilled But he did not see why his own life might not be saved 
7265-74923-0080	train-other-500	By remaining in prison until the next day he should have rendered every service in his power to his master and the young lady
none	none	 He poor fellow shrank from death and he agreed with Morin to escape if he could by the means Morin had suggested 
7265-74923-0081	train-other-500	and to bring him word if Mademoiselle de Crequy relented Jacques had no expectation that she would
none	none	 but I fancy he did not think it necessary to tell Morin of this conviction of his 
7265-74923-0082	train-other-500	This bargaining with so base a man for so slight a thing as life was the only flaw that I heard of in the old gardener s behaviour Of course the mere reopening of the subject was enough to stir Virginie to displeasure
none	none	 Clement urged her it is true but the light he had gained upon Morin s motions made him rather try to set the case before her in as fair a manner as possible than use any persuasive arguments And even as it was what he said on the subject made Virginie shed tears the first that had fallen from her since she entered the prison So they were summoned and went together 
7265-74923-0083	train-other-500	at the fatal call of the muster roll of victims the next morning He feeble from his wounds and his injured health she calm and serene only petitioning to be allowed to walk next to him in order that she might hold him up when he turned faint and giddy from his extreme suffering
7265-74923-0084	train-other-500	Together they stood at the bar together they were condemned
none	none	 As the words of judgment were pronounced Virginie tuned to Clement and embraced him with passionate fondness Then making him lean on her they marched out towards the Place de la Greve Jacques was free now He had told Morin how fruitless his efforts at persuasion had been and scarcely caring to note the effect of his information upon the man he had devoted himself to watching Monsieur and Mademoiselle de Crequy 
7265-74923-0085	train-other-500	And now he followed them to the Place de la Greve He saw them mount the platform saw them kneel down together till plucked up by the impatient officials could see that she was urging some request to the executioner the end of which seemed to be that Clement advanced first to the guillotine
7265-74923-0086	train-other-500	was executed and just at this moment there was a stir among the crowd as of a man pressing forward towards the scaffold Then she standing with her face to the guillotine slowly made the sign of the cross and knelt down Jacques covered his eyes blinded with tears
none	none	 The report of a pistol made him look up She was gone another victim in her place and where there had been a little stir in the crowd not five minutes before some men were carrying off a dead body A man had shot himself they said Pierre told me who that man was CHAPTER IX After a pause I ventured to ask what became of Madame de Crequy Clement s mother She never made any inquiry about him said my lady She must have known that he was dead though how we never could tell Medlicott remembered afterwards that it was about if not on Medlicott to this day declares that it was on the very Monday June the nineteenth when her son was executed that Madame de Crequy left off her rouge and took to her bed as one bereaved and hopeless It certainly was about that time and Medlicott who was deeply impressed by that dream of Madame de Crequy s the relation of which I told you had had such an effect on my lord in which she had seen the figure of Virginie as the only light object amid much surrounding darkness as of night smiling and beckoning Clement on on till at length the bright phantom stopped motionless and Madame de Crequy s eyes began to penetrate the murky darkness and to see closing around her the gloomy dripping walls which she had once seen and never forgotten the walls of the vault of the chapel of the De Crequys in Saint Germain l Auxerrois and there the two last of the Crequys laid them down among their forefathers and Madame de Crequy had wakened to the sound of the great door which led to the open air being locked upon her I say Medlicott who was predisposed by this dream to look out for the supernatural always declared that Madame de Crequy was made conscious in some mysterious way of her son s death on the very day and hour when it occurred and that after that she had no more anxiety but was only conscious of a kind of stupefying despair And what became of her my lady I again asked What could become of her replied Lady Ludlow She never could be induced to rise again though she lived more than a year after her son s departure She kept her bed her room darkened her face turned towards the wall whenever any one besides Medlicott was in the room She hardly ever spoke and would have died of starvation but for Medlicott s tender care in putting a morsel to her lips every now and then feeding her in fact just as an old bird feeds her young ones In the height of summer my lord and I left London We would fain have taken her with us into Scotland but the doctor we had the old doctor from Leicester Square forbade her removal and this time he gave such good reasons against it that I acquiesced Medlicott and a maid were left with her Every care was taken of her She survived till our return Indeed I thought she was in much the same state as I had left her in when I came back to London But Medlicott spoke of her as much weaker and one morning on awakening they told me she was dead I sent for Medlicott who was in sad distress she had become so fond of her charge She said that about two o clock she had been awakened by unusual restlessness on Madame de Crequy s part that she had gone to her bedside and found the poor lady feebly but perpetually moving her wasted arm up and down and saying to herself in a wailing voice I did not bless him when he left me I did not bless him when he left me Medlicott gave her a spoonful or two of jelly and sat by her stroking her hand and soothing her till she seemed to fall asleep But in the morning she was dead It is a sad story your ladyship said I after a while Yes it is People seldom arrive at my age without having watched the beginning middle and end of many lives and many fortunes We do not talk about them perhaps for they are often so sacred to us from having touched into the very quick of our own hearts as it were or into those of others who are dead and gone and veiled over from human sight that we cannot tell the tale as if it was a mere story But young people should remember that we have had this solemn experience of life on which to base our opinions and form our judgments so that they are not mere untried theories I am not alluding to mister Horner just now for he is nearly as old as I am within ten years I dare say but I am thinking of mister Gray with his endless plans for some new thing schools education Sabbaths and what not Now he has not seen what all this leads to It is a pity he has not heard your ladyship tell the story of poor Monsieur de Crequy Not at all a pity my dear A young man like him who both by position and age must have had his experience confined to a very narrow circle ought not to set up his opinion against mine he ought not to require reasons from me nor to need such explanation of my arguments if I condescend to argue as going into relation of the circumstances on which my arguments are based in my own mind would be But my lady it might convince him I said with perhaps injudicious perseverance And why should he be convinced she asked with gentle inquiry in her tone He has only to acquiesce Though he is appointed by mister Croxton I am the lady of the manor as he must know But it is with mister Horner that I must have to do about this unfortunate lad Gregson I am afraid there will be no method of making him forget his unlucky knowledge His poor brains will be intoxicated with the sense of his powers without any counterbalancing principles to guide him Poor fellow I am quite afraid it will end in his being hanged The next day mister Horner came to apologize and explain He was evidently as I could tell from his voice as he spoke to my lady in the next room extremely annoyed at her ladyship s discovery of the education he had been giving to this boy My lady spoke with great authority and with reasonable grounds of complaint mister Horner was well acquainted with her thoughts on the subject and had acted in defiance of her wishes He acknowledged as much and should on no account have done it in any other instance without her leave Which I could never have granted you said my lady But this boy had extraordinary capabilities would in fact have taught himself much that was bad if he had not been rescued and another direction given to his powers And in all mister Horner had done he had had her ladyship s service in view The business was getting almost beyond his power so many letters and so much account keeping was required by the complicated state in which things were Lady Ludlow felt what was coming a reference to the mortgage for the benefit of my lord s Scottish estates which she was perfectly aware mister Horner considered as having been a most unwise proceeding and she hastened to observe All this may be very true mister Horner and I am sure I should be the last person to wish you to overwork or distress yourself but of that we will talk another time What I am now anxious to remedy is if possible the state of this poor little Gregson s mind Would not hard work in the fields be a wholesome and excellent way of enabling him to forget I was in hopes my lady that you would have permitted me to bring him up to act as a kind of clerk said mister Horner jerking out his project abruptly A what asked my lady in infinite surprise A kind of of assistant in the way of copying letters and doing up accounts He is already an excellent penman and very quick at figures mister Horner said my lady with dignity the son of a poacher and vagabond ought never to have been able to copy letters relating to the Hanbury estates and at any rate he shall not I wonder how it is that knowing the use he has made of his power of reading a letter you should venture to propose such an employment for him as would require his being in your confidence and you the trusted agent of this family Why every secret and every ancient and honourable family has its secrets as you know mister Horner would be learnt off by heart and repeated to the first comer I should have hoped to have trained him my lady to understand the rules of discretion Trained Train a barn door fowl to be a pheasant mister Horner That would be the easier task But you did right to speak of discretion rather than honour Discretion looks to the consequences of actions honour looks to the action itself and is an instinct rather than a virtue After all it is possible you might have trained him to be discreet mister Horner was silent My lady was softened by his not replying and began as she always did in such cases to fear lest she had been too harsh I could tell that by her voice and by her next speech as well as if I had seen her face But I am sorry you are feeling the pressure of the affairs I am quite aware that I have entailed much additional trouble upon you by some of my measures I must try and provide you with some suitable assistance Copying letters and doing up accounts I think you said mister Horner had certainly had a distant idea of turning the little boy in process of time into a clerk but he had rather urged this possibility of future usefulness beyond what he had at first intended in speaking of it to my lady as a palliation of his offence and he certainly was very much inclined to retract his statement that the letter writing or any other business had increased or that he was in the slightest want of help of any kind when my lady after a pause of consideration suddenly said I have it Miss Galindo will I am sure be glad to assist you I will speak to her myself The payment we should make to a clerk would be of real service to her I could hardly help echoing mister Horner s tone of surprise as he said Miss Galindo For you must be told who Miss Galindo was at least told as much as I know Miss Galindo had lived in the village for many years keeping house on the smallest possible means yet always managing to maintain a servant And this servant was invariably chosen because she had some infirmity that made her undesirable to every one else I believe Miss Galindo had had lame and blind and hump backed maids She had even at one time taken in a girl hopelessly gone in consumption because if not she would have had to go to the workhouse and not have had enough to eat Of course the poor creature could not perform a single duty usually required of a servant and Miss Galindo herself was both servant and nurse Her present maid was scarcely four feet high and bore a terrible character for ill temper Nobody but Miss Galindo would have kept her but as it was mistress and servant squabbled perpetually and were at heart the best of friends For it was one of Miss Galindo s peculiarities to do all manner of kind and self denying actions and to say all manner of provoking things Lame blind deformed and dwarf all came in for scoldings without number it was only the consumptive girl that never had heard a sharp word I don t think any of her servants liked her the worse for her peppery temper and passionate odd ways for they knew her real and beautiful kindness of heart and besides she had so great a turn for humour that very often her speeches amused as much or more than they irritated and on the other side a piece of witty impudence from her servant would occasionally tickle her so much and so suddenly that she would burst out laughing in the middle of her passion But the talk about Miss Galindo s choice and management of her servants was confined to village gossip and had never reached my Lady Ludlow s ears though doubtless mister Horner was well acquainted with it What my lady knew of her amounted to this It was the custom in those days for the wealthy ladies of the county to set on foot a repository as it was called in the assize town The ostensible manager of this repository was generally a decayed gentlewoman a clergyman s widow or so forth She was however controlled by a committee of ladies and paid by them in proportion to the amount of goods she sold and these goods were the small manufactures of ladies of little or no fortune whose names if they chose it were only signified by initials Poor water colour drawings indigo and Indian ink screens ornamented with moss and dried leaves paintings on velvet and such faintly ornamental works were displayed on one side of the shop It was always reckoned a mark of characteristic gentility in the repository to have only common heavy framed sash windows which admitted very little light so I never was quite certain of the merit of these Works of Art as they were entitled But on the other side where the Useful Work placard was put up there was a great variety of articles of whose unusual excellence every one might judge Such fine sewing and stitching and button holing Such bundles of soft delicate knitted stockings and socks and above all in Lady Ludlow s eyes such hanks of the finest spun flaxen thread And the most delicate dainty work of all was done by Miss Galindo as Lady Ludlow very well knew Yet for all their fine sewing it sometimes happened that Miss Galindo s patterns were of an old fashioned kind and the dozen nightcaps maybe on the materials for which she had expended bona fide money and on the making up no little time and eye sight would lie for months in a yellow neglected heap and at such times it was said Miss Galindo was more amusing than usual more full of dry drollery and humour just as at the times when an order came in to X the initial she had chosen for a stock of well paying things she sat and stormed at her servant as she stitched away She herself explained her practice in this way When everything goes wrong one would give up breathing if one could not lighten ones heart by a joke But when I ve to sit still from morning till night I must have something to stir my blood or I should go off into an apoplexy so I set to and quarrel with Sally Such were Miss Galindo s means and manner of living in her own house Out of doors and in the village she was not popular although she would have been sorely missed had she left the place But she asked too many home questions not to say impertinent respecting the domestic economies for even the very poor liked to spend their bit of money their own way and would open cupboards to find out hidden extravagances and question closely respecting the weekly amount of butter till one day she met with what would have been a rebuff to any other person but which she rather enjoyed than otherwise She was going into a cottage and in the doorway met the good woman chasing out a duck and apparently unconscious of her visitor Get out Miss Galindo she cried addressing the duck Get out O I ask your pardon she continued as if seeing the lady for the first time It s only that weary duck will come in Get out Miss Gal to the duck And so you call it after me do you inquired her visitor O yes ma am my master would have it so for he said sure enough the unlucky bird was always poking herself where she was not wanted Ha ha very good And so your master is a wit is he Well tell him to come up and speak to me to night about my parlour chimney for there is no one like him for chimney doctoring And the master went up and was so won over by Miss Galindo s merry ways and sharp insight into the mysteries of his various kinds of business he was a mason chimney sweeper and ratcatcher that he came home and abused his wife the next time she called the duck the name by which he himself had christened her But odd as Miss Galindo was in general she could be as well bred a lady as any one when she chose And choose she always did when my Lady Ludlow was by Indeed I don t know the man woman or child that did not instinctively turn out its best side to her ladyship So she had no notion of the qualities which I am sure made mister Horner think that Miss Galindo would be most unmanageable as a clerk and heartily wish that the idea had never come into my lady s head But there it was and he had annoyed her ladyship already more than he liked to day so he could not directly contradict her but only urge difficulties which he hoped might prove insuperable But every one of them Lady Ludlow knocked down Letters to copy Doubtless Miss Galindo could come up to the Hall she should have a room to herself she wrote a beautiful hand and writing would save her eyesight Capability with regard to accounts My lady would answer for that too and for more than mister Horner seemed to think it necessary to inquire about Miss Galindo was by birth and breeding a lady of the strictest honour and would if possible forget the substance of any letters that passed through her hands at any rate no one would ever hear of them again from her Remuneration Oh as for that Lady Ludlow would herself take care that it was managed in the most delicate manner possible She would send to invite Miss Galindo to tea at the Hall that very afternoon if mister Horner would only give her ladyship the slightest idea of the average length of time that my lady was to request Miss Galindo to sacrifice to her daily Three hours Very well mister Horner looked very grave as he passed the windows of the room where I lay I don t think he liked the idea of Miss Galindo as a clerk Lady Ludlow s invitations were like royal commands Indeed the village was too quiet to allow the inhabitants to have many evening engagements of any kind Now and then mister and missus Horner gave a tea and supper to the principal tenants and their wives to which the clergyman was invited and Miss Galindo missus Medlicott and one or two other spinsters and widows The glory of the supper table on these occasions was invariably furnished by her ladyship it was a cold roasted peacock with his tail stuck out as if in life missus Medlicott would take up the whole morning arranging the feathers in the proper semicircle and was always pleased with the wonder and admiration it excited It was considered a due reward and fitting compliment to her exertions that mister Horner always took her in to supper and placed her opposite to the magnificent dish at which she sweetly smiled all the time they were at table But since missus Horner had had the paralytic stroke these parties had been given up and Miss Galindo wrote a note to Lady Ludlow in reply to her invitation saying that she was entirely disengaged and would have great pleasure in doing herself the honour of waiting upon her ladyship Whoever visited my lady took their meals with her sitting on the dais in the presence of all my former companions So I did not see Miss Galindo until some time after tea as the young gentlewomen had had to bring her their sewing and spinning to hear the remarks of so competent a judge At length her ladyship brought her visitor into the room where I lay it was one of my bad days I remember in order to have her little bit of private conversation Miss Galindo was dressed in her best gown I am sure but I had never seen anything like it except in a picture it was so old fashioned She wore a white muslin apron delicately embroidered and put on a little crookedly in order as she told us even Lady Ludlow before the evening was over to conceal a spot whence the colour had been discharged by a lemon stain This crookedness had an odd effect especially when I saw that it was intentional indeed she was so anxious about her apron s right adjustment in the wrong place that she told us straight out why she wore it so and asked her ladyship if the spot was properly hidden at the same time lifting up her apron and showing her how large it was When my father was alive I always took his right arm so and used to remove any spotted or discoloured breadths to the left side if it was a walking dress That s the convenience of a gentleman But widows and spinsters must do what they can Ah my dear to me when you are reckoning up the blessings in your lot though you may think it a hard one in some respects don t forget how little your stockings want darning as you are obliged to lie down so much I would rather knit two pairs of stockings than darn one any day Have you been doing any of your beautiful knitting lately asked my lady who had now arranged Miss Galindo in the pleasantest chair and taken her own little wicker work one and having her work in her hands was ready to try and open the subject No and alas your ladyship It is partly the hot weather s fault for people seem to forget that winter must come and partly I suppose that every one is stocked who has the money to pay four and sixpence a pair for stockings Then may I ask if you have any time in your active days at liberty said my lady drawing a little nearer to her proposal which I fancy she found it a little awkward to make Why the village keeps me busy your ladyship when I have neither knitting or sewing to do You know I took X for my letter at the repository because it stands for Xantippe who was a great scold in old times as I have learnt But I m sure I don t know how the world would get on without scolding your ladyship It would go to sleep and the sun would stand still I don t think I could bear to scold Miss Galindo said her ladyship smiling No because your ladyship has people to do it for you Begging your pardon my lady it seems to me the generality of people may be divided into saints scolds and sinners Now your ladyship is a saint because you have a sweet and holy nature in the first place and have people to do your anger and vexation for you in the second place And Jonathan Walker is a sinner because he is sent to prison But here am I half way having but a poor kind of disposition at best and yet hating sin and all that leads to it such as wasting and extravagance and gossiping and yet all this lies right under my nose in the village and I am not saint enough to be vexed at it and so I scold And though I had rather be a saint yet I think I do good in my way No doubt you do dear Miss Galindo said Lady Ludlow But I am sorry to hear that there is so much that is bad going on in the village very sorry O your ladyship then I am sorry I brought it out It was only by way of saying that when I have no particular work to do at home I take a turn abroad and set my neighbours to rights just by way of steering clear of Satan For Satan finds some mischief still For idle hands to do you know my lady There was no leading into the subject by delicate degrees for Miss Galindo was evidently so fond of talking that if asked a question she made her answer so long that before she came to an end of it she had wandered far away from the original starting point So Lady Ludlow plunged at once into what she had to say Miss Galindo I have a great favour to ask of you My lady I wish I could tell you what a pleasure it is to hear you say so replied Miss Galindo almost with tears in her eyes so glad were we all to do anything for her ladyship which could be called a free service and not merely a duty It is this mister Horner tells me that the business letters relating to the estate are multiplying so much that he finds it impossible to copy them all himself and I therefore require the services of some confidential and discreet person to copy these letters and occasionally to go through certain accounts Now there is a very pleasant little sitting room very near to mister Horner s office you know mister Horner s office on the other side of the stone hall and if I could prevail upon you to come here to breakfast and afterwards sit there for three hours every morning mister Horner should bring or send you the papers Lady Ludlow stopped Miss Galindo s countenance had fallen There was some great obstacle in her mind to her wish for obliging Lady Ludlow What would Sally do she asked at length Lady Ludlow had not a notion who Sally was Nor if she had had a notion would she have had a conception of the perplexities that poured into Miss Galindo s mind at the idea of leaving her rough forgetful dwarf without the perpetual monitorship of her mistress Lady Ludlow accustomed to a household where everything went on noiselessly perfectly and by clock work conducted by a number of highly paid well chosen and accomplished servants had not a conception of the nature of the rough material from which her servants came Besides in her establishment so that the result was good no one inquired if the small economies had been observed in the production Whereas every penny every halfpenny was of consequence to Miss Galindo and visions of squandered drops of milk and wasted crusts of bread filled her mind with dismay But she swallowed all her apprehensions down out of her regard for Lady Ludlow and desire to be of service to her No one knows how great a trial it was to her when she thought of Sally unchecked and unscolded for three hours every morning But all she said was Sally go to the Deuce I beg your pardon my lady if I was talking to myself it s a habit I have got into of keeping my tongue in practice and I am not quite aware when I do it Three hours every morning I shall be only too proud to do what I can for your ladyship and I hope mister Horner will not be too impatient with me at first You know perhaps that I was nearly being an authoress once and that seems as if I was destined to employ my time in writing No indeed we must return to the subject of the clerkship afterwards if you please An authoress Miss Galindo You surprise me But indeed I was All was quite ready Doctor Burney used to teach me music not that I ever could learn but it was a fancy of my poor father s And his daughter wrote a book and they said she was but a very young lady and nothing but a music master s daughter so why should not I try Well Well I got paper and half a hundred good pens a bottle of ink all ready And then O it ended in my having nothing to say when I sat down to write But sometimes when I get hold of a book I wonder why I let such a poor reason stop me It does not others But I think it was very well it did Miss Galindo said her ladyship I am extremely against women usurping men s employments as they are very apt to do But perhaps after all the notion of writing a book improved your hand It is one of the most legible I ever saw I despise z s without tails said Miss Galindo with a good deal of gratified pride at my lady s praise Presently my lady took her to look at a curious old cabinet which Lord Ludlow had picked up at the Hague and while they were out of the room on this errand I suppose the question of remuneration was settled for I heard no more of it When they came back they were talking of mister Gray Miss Galindo was unsparing in her expressions of opinion about him going much farther than my lady in her language at least A little blushing man like him who can t say bo to a goose without hesitating and colouring to come to this village which is as good a village as ever lived and cry us down for a set of sinners as if we had all committed murder and that other thing I have no patience with him my lady And then how is he to help us to heaven by teaching us our a b ab b a ba And yet by all accounts that s to save poor children s souls O I knew your ladyship would agree with me I am sure my mother was as good a creature as ever breathed the blessed air and if she s not gone to heaven I don t want to go there and she could not spell a letter decently And does mister Gray think God took note of that I was sure you would agree with me Miss Galindo said my lady You and I can remember how this talk about education Rousseau and his writings stirred up the French people to their Reign of Terror and all those bloody scenes I m afraid that Rousseau and mister Gray are birds of a feather replied Miss Galindo shaking her head And yet there is some good in the young man too He sat up all night with Billy Davis when his wife was fairly worn out with nursing him Did he indeed said my lady her face lighting up as it always did when she heard of any kind or generous action no matter who performed it What a pity he is bitten with these new revolutionary ideas and is so much for disturbing the established order of society When Miss Galindo went she left so favourable an impression of her visit on my lady that she said to me with a pleased smile I think I have provided mister Horner with a far better clerk than he would have made of that lad Gregson in twenty years And I will send the lad to my lord s grieve in Scotland that he may be kept out of harm s way But something happened to the lad before this purpose could be accomplished CHAPTER X The next morning Miss Galindo made her appearance and by some mistake unusual to my lady s well trained servants was shown into the room where I was trying to walk for a certain amount of exercise was prescribed for me painful although the exertion had become She brought a little basket along with her and while the footman was gone to inquire my lady s wishes for I don t think that Lady Ludlow expected Miss Galindo so soon to assume her clerkship nor indeed had mister Horner any work of any kind ready for his new assistant to do she launched out into conversation with me It was a sudden summons my dear However as I have often said to myself ever since an occasion long ago if Lady Ludlow ever honours me by asking for my right hand I ll cut it off and wrap the stump up so tidily she shall never find out it bleeds But if I had had a little more time I could have mended my pens better You see I have had to sit up pretty late to get these sleeves made and she took out of her basket a pail of brown holland over sleeves very much such as a grocer s apprentice wears and I had only time to make seven or eight pens out of some quills Farmer Thomson gave me last autumn As for ink I m thankful to say that s always ready an ounce of steel filings an ounce of nut gall and a pint of water tea if you re extravagant which thank Heaven I m not put all in a bottle and hang it up behind the house door so that the whole gets a good shaking every time you slam it to and even if you are in a passion and bang it as Sally and I often do it is all the better for it and there s my ink ready for use ready to write my lady s will with if need be O Miss Galindo said I don t talk so my lady s will and she not dead yet And if she were what would be the use of talking of making her will Now if you were Sally I should say Answer me that you goose But as you re a relation of my lady s I must be civil and only say I can t think how you can talk so like a fool To be sure poor thing you re lame I do not know how long she would have gone on but my lady came in and I released from my duty of entertaining Miss Galindo made my limping way into the next room To tell the truth I was rather afraid of Miss Galindo s tongue for I never knew what she would say next After a while my lady came and began to look in the bureau for something and as she looked she said I think mister Horner must have made some mistake when he said he had so much work that he almost required a clerk for this morning he cannot find anything for Miss Galindo to do and there she is sitting with her pen behind her ear waiting for something to write I am come to find her my mother s letters for I should like to have a fair copy made of them O here they are don t trouble yourself my dear child When my lady returned again she sat down and began to talk of mister Gray Miss Galindo says she saw him going to hold a prayer meeting in a cottage Now that really makes me unhappy it is so like what mister Wesley used to do in my younger days and since then we have had rebellion in the American colonies and the French Revolution You may depend upon it my dear making religion and education common vulgarising them as it were is a bad thing for a nation A man who hears prayers read in the cottage where he has just supped on bread and bacon forgets the respect due to a church he begins to think that one place is as good as another and by and by that one person is as good as another and after that I always find that people begin to talk of their rights instead of thinking of their duties I wish mister Gray had been more tractable and had left well alone What do you think I heard this morning Why that the Home Hill estate which niches into the Hanbury property was bought by a Baptist baker from Birmingham A Baptist baker I exclaimed I had never seen a Dissenter to my knowledge but having always heard them spoken of with horror I looked upon them almost as if they were rhinoceroses I wanted to see a live Dissenter I believe and yet I wished it were over I was almost surprised when I heard that any of them were engaged in such peaceful occupations as baking Yes so mister Horner tells me A mister Lambe I believe But at any rate he is a Baptist and has been in trade What with his schismatism and mister Gray s methodism I am afraid all the primitive character of this place will vanish From what I could hear mister Gray seemed to be taking his own way at any rate more than he had done when he first came to the village when his natural timidity had made him defer to my lady and seek her consent and sanction before embarking in any new plan But newness was a quality Lady Ludlow especially disliked Even in the fashions of dress and furniture she clung to the old to the modes which had prevailed when she was young and though she had a deep personal regard for Queen Charlotte to whom as I have already said she had been maid of honour yet there was a tinge of Jacobitism about her such as made her extremely dislike to hear Prince Charles Edward called the young Pretender as many loyal people did in those days and made her fond of telling of the thorn tree in my lord s park in Scotland which had been planted by bonny Queen Mary herself and before which every guest in the Castle of Monkshaven was expected to stand bare headed out of respect to the memory and misfortunes of the royal planter We might play at cards if we so chose on a Sunday at least I suppose we might for my lady and mister Mountford used to do so often when I first went But we must neither play cards nor read nor sew on the fifth of November and on the thirtieth of January but must go to church and meditate all the rest of the day and very hard work meditating was I would far rather have scoured a room That was the reason I suppose why a passive life was seen to be better discipline for me than an active one But I am wandering away from my lady and her dislike to all innovation Now it seemed to me as far as I heard that mister Gray was full of nothing but new things and that what he first did was to attack all our established institutions both in the village and the parish and also in the nation To be sure I heard of his ways of going on principally from Miss Galindo who was apt to speak more strongly than accurately There he goes she said clucking up the children just like an old hen and trying to teach them about their salvation and their souls and I don t know what things that it is just blasphemy to speak about out of church And he potters old people about reading their Bibles I am sure I don t want to speak disrespectfully about the Holy Scriptures but I found old Job Horton busy reading his Bible yesterday Says I What are you reading and where did you get it and who gave it you So he made answer That he was reading Susannah and the Elders for that he had read Bel and the Dragon till he could pretty near say it off by heart and they were two as pretty stories as ever he had read and that it was a caution to him what bad old chaps there were in the world Now as Job is bed ridden I don t think he is likely to meet with the Elders and I say that I think repeating his Creed the Commandments and the Lord s Prayer and maybe throwing in a verse of the Psalms if he wanted a bit of a change would have done him far more good than his pretty stories as he called them And what s the next thing our young parson does Why he tries to make us all feel pitiful for the black slaves and leaves little pictures of negroes about with the question printed below Am I not a man and a brother just as if I was to be hail fellow well met with every negro footman They do say he takes no sugar in his tea because he thinks he sees spots of blood in it Now I call that superstition The next day it was a still worse story Well my dear and how are you My lady sent me in to sit a bit with you while mister Horner looks out some papers for me to copy Between ourselves mister Steward Horner does not like having me for a clerk It is all very well he does not for if he were decently civil to me I might want a chaperone you know now poor missus Horner is dead This was one of Miss Galindo s grim jokes As it is I try to make him forget I m a woman I do everything as ship shape as a masculine man clerk I see he can t find a fault writing good spelling correct sums all right And then he squints up at me with the tail of his eye and looks glummer than ever just because I m a woman as if I could help that I have gone good lengths to set his mind at ease I have stuck my pen behind my ear I have made him a bow instead of a curtsey I have whistled not a tune I can t pipe up that nay if you won t tell my lady I don t mind telling you that I have said Confound it and Zounds I can t get any farther For all that mister Horner won t forget I am a lady and so I am not half the use I might be and if it were not to please my Lady Ludlow mister Horner and his books might go hang see how natural that came out And there is an order for a dozen nightcaps for a bride and I am so afraid I shan t have time to do them Worst of all there s mister Gray taking advantage of my absence to seduce Sally To seduce Sally mister Gray Pooh pooh child There s many a kind of seduction mister Gray is seducing Sally to want to go to church There has he been twice at my house while I have been away in the mornings talking to Sally about the state of her soul and that sort of thing But when I found the meat all roasted to a cinder I said Come Sally let s have no more praying when beef is down at the fire Pray at six o clock in the morning and nine at night and I won t hinder you So she sauced me and said something about Martha and Mary implying that because she had let the beef get so overdone that I declare I could hardly find a bit for Nancy Pole s sick grandchild she had chosen the better part I was very much put about I own and perhaps you ll be shocked at what I said indeed I don t know if it was right myself but I told her I had a soul as well as she and if it was to be saved by my sitting still and thinking about salvation and never doing my duty I thought I had as good a right as she had to be Mary and save my soul So that afternoon I sat quite still and it was really a comfort for I am often too busy I know to pray as I ought There is first one person wanting me and then another and the house and the food and the neighbours to see after So when tea time comes there enters my maid with her hump on her back and her soul to be saved Please ma am did you order the pound of butter No Sally I said shaking my head this morning I did not go round by Hale s farm and this afternoon I have been employed in spiritual things Now our Sally likes tea and bread and butter above everything and dry bread was not to her taste I m thankful said the impudent hussy that you have taken a turn towards godliness It will be my prayers I trust that s given it you I was determined not to give her an opening towards the carnal subject of butter so she lingered still longing to ask leave to run for it But I gave her none and munched my dry bread myself thinking what a famous cake I could make for little Ben Pole with the bit of butter we were saving and when Sally had had her butterless tea and was in none of the best of tempers because Martha had not bethought herself of the butter I just quietly said Now Sally to morrow we ll try to hash that beef well and to remember the butter and to work out our salvation all at the same time for I don t see why it can t all be done as God has set us to do it all But I heard her at it again about Mary and Martha and I have no doubt that mister Gray will teach her to consider me a lost sheep I had heard so many little speeches about mister Gray from one person or another all speaking against him as a mischief maker a setter up of new doctrines and of a fanciful standard of life and you may be sure that where Lady Ludlow led missus Medlicott and Adams were certain to follow each in their different ways showing the influence my lady had over them that I believe I had grown to consider him as a very instrument of evil and to expect to perceive in his face marks of his presumption and arrogance and impertinent interference It was now many weeks since I had seen him and when he was one morning shown into the blue drawing room into which I had been removed for a change I was quite surprised to see how innocent and awkward a young man he appeared confused even more than I was at our unexpected tete a tete He looked thinner his eyes more eager his expression more anxious and his colour came and went more than it had done when I had seen him last I tried to make a little conversation as I was to my own surprise more at my ease than he was but his thoughts were evidently too much preoccupied for him to do more than answer me with monosyllables Presently my lady came in mister Gray twitched and coloured more than ever but plunged into the middle of his subject at once My lady I cannot answer it to my conscience if I allow the children of this village to go on any longer the little heathens that they are I must do something to alter their condition I am quite aware that your ladyship disapproves of many of the plans which have suggested themselves to me but nevertheless I must do something and I am come now to your ladyship to ask respectfully but firmly what you would advise me to do His eyes were dilated and I could almost have said they were full of tears with his eagerness But I am sure it is a bad plan to remind people of decided opinions which they have once expressed if you wish them to modify those opinions Now mister Gray had done this with my lady and though I do not mean to say she was obstinate yet she was not one to retract She was silent for a moment or two before she replied You ask me to suggest a remedy for an evil of the existence of which I am not conscious was her answer very coldly very gently given In mister Mountford s time I heard no such complaints whenever I see the village children and they are not unfrequent visitors at this house on one pretext or another they are well and decently behaved Oh madam you cannot judge he broke in They are trained to respect you in word and deed you are the highest they ever look up to they have no notion of a higher Nay mister Gray said my lady smiling they are as loyally disposed as any children can be They come up here every fourth of June and drink his Majesty s health and have buns and as Margaret Dawson can testify they take a great and respectful interest in all the pictures I can show them of the royal family But madam I think of something higher than any earthly dignities My lady coloured at the mistake she had made for she herself was truly pious Yet when she resumed the subject it seemed to me as if her tone was a little sharper than before Such want of reverence is I should say the clergyman s fault You must excuse me mister Gray if I speak plainly My Lady I want plain speaking I myself am not accustomed to those ceremonies and forms which are I suppose the etiquette in your ladyship s rank of life and which seem to hedge you in from any power of mine to touch you Among those with whom I have passed my life hitherto it has been the custom to speak plainly out what we have felt earnestly So instead of needing any apology from your ladyship for straightforward speaking I will meet what you say at once and admit that it is the clergyman s fault in a great measure when the children of his parish swear and curse and are brutal and ignorant of all saving grace nay some of them of the very name of God And because this guilt of mine as the clergyman of this parish lies heavy on my soul and every day leads but from bad to worse till I am utterly bewildered how to do good to children who escape from me as if I were a monster and who are growing up to be men fit for and capable of any crime but those requiring wit or sense I come to you who seem to me all powerful as far as material power goes for your ladyship only knows the surface of things and barely that that pass in your village to help me with advice and such outward help as you can give mister Gray had stood up and sat down once or twice while he had been speaking in an agitated nervous kind of way and now he was interrupted by a violent fit of coughing after which he trembled all over My lady rang for a glass of water and looked much distressed mister Gray said she I am sure you are not well and that makes you exaggerate childish faults into positive evils It is always the case with us when we are not strong in health I hear of your exerting yourself in every direction you overwork yourself and the consequence is that you imagine us all worse people than we are And my lady smiled very kindly and pleasantly at him as he sat a little panting a little flushed trying to recover his breath I am sure that now they were brought face to face she had quite forgotten all the offence she had taken at his doings when she heard of them from others and indeed it was enough to soften any one s heart to see that young almost boyish face looking in such anxiety and distress Oh my lady what shall I do he asked as soon as he could recover breath and with such an air of humility that I am sure no one who had seen it could have ever thought him conceited again The evil of this world is too strong for me I can do so little It is all in vain It was only to day and again the cough and agitation returned My dear mister Gray said my lady the day before I could never have believed she could have called him My dear you must take the advice of an old woman about yourself You are not fit to do anything just now but attend to your own health rest and see a doctor but indeed I will take care of that and when you are pretty strong again you will find that you have been magnifying evils to yourself But my lady I cannot rest The evils do exist and the burden of their continuance lies on my shoulders I have no place to gather the children together in that I may teach them the things necessary to salvation The rooms in my own house are too small but I have tried them I have money of my own and as your ladyship knows I tried to get a piece of leasehold property on which to build a school house at my own expense Your ladyship s lawyer comes forward at your instructions to enforce some old feudal right by which no building is allowed on leasehold property without the sanction of the lady of the manor It may be all very true but it was a cruel thing to do that is if your ladyship had known which I am sure you do not the real moral and spiritual state of my poor parishioners And now I come to you to know what I am to do Rest I cannot rest while children whom I could possibly save are being left in their ignorance their blasphemy their uncleanness their cruelty It is known through the village that your ladyship disapproves of my efforts and opposes all my plans If you think them wrong foolish ill digested I have been a student living in a college and eschewing all society but that of pious men until now I may not judge for the best in my ignorance of this sinful human nature tell me of better plans and wiser projects for accomplishing my end but do not bid me rest with Satan compassing me round and stealing souls away mister Gray said my lady there may be some truth in what you have said I do not deny it though I think in your present state of indisposition and excitement you exaggerate it much I believe nay the experience of a pretty long life has convinced me that education is a bad thing if given indiscriminately It unfits the lower orders for their duties the duties to which they are called by God of submission to those placed in authority over them of contentment with that state of life to which it has pleased God to call them and of ordering themselves lowly and reverently to all their betters I have made this conviction of mine tolerably evident to you and I have expressed distinctly my disapprobation of some of your ideas You may imagine then that I was not well pleased when I found that you had taken a rood or more of Farmer Hale s land and were laying the foundations of a school house You had done this without asking for my permission which as Farmer Hale s liege lady ought to have been obtained legally as well as asked for out of courtesy I put a stop to what I believed to be calculated to do harm to a village to a population in which to say the least of it I may be disposed to take as much interest as you can do How can reading and writing and the multiplication table if you choose to go so far prevent blasphemy and uncleanness and cruelty Really mister Gray I hardly like to express myself so strongly on the subject in your present state of health as I should do at any other time It seems to me that books do little character much and character is not formed from books I do not think of character I think of souls I must get some hold upon these children or what will become of them in the next world I must be found to have some power beyond what they have and which they are rendered capable of appreciating before they will listen to me At present physical force is all they look up to and I have none Nay mister Gray by your own admission they look up to me They would not do anything your ladyship disliked if it was likely to come to your knowledge but if they could conceal it from you the knowledge of your dislike to a particular line of conduct would never make them cease from pursuing it mister Gray surprise in her air and some little indignation they and their fathers have lived on the Hanbury lands for generations I cannot help it madam I am telling you the truth whether you believe me or not There was a pause my lady looked perplexed and somewhat ruffled mister Gray as though hopeless and wearied out Then my lady said he at last rising as he spoke you can suggest nothing to ameliorate the state of things which I do assure you does exist on your lands and among your tenants Surely you will not object to my using Farmer Hale s great barn every Sabbath He will allow me the use of it if your ladyship will grant your permission You are not fit for any extra work at present and indeed he had been coughing very much all through the conversation Give me time to consider of it Tell me what you wish to teach You will be able to take care of your health and grow stronger while I consider It shall not be the worse for you if you leave it in my hands for a time My lady spoke very kindly but he was in too excited a state to recognize the kindness while the idea of delay was evidently a sore irritation I heard him say And I have so little time in which to do my work Lord lay not this sin to my charge But my lady was speaking to the old butler for whom at her sign I had rung the bell some little time before Now she turned round mister Gray I find I have some bottles of Malmsey of the vintage of seventeen hundred and seventy eight yet left Malmsey as perhaps you know used to be considered a specific for coughs arising from weakness You must permit me to send you half a dozen bottles and depend upon it you will take a more cheerful view of life and its duties before you have finished them especially if you will be so kind as to see doctor Trevor who is coming to see me in the course of the week By the time you are strong enough to work I will try and find some means of preventing the children from using such bad language and otherwise annoying you My lady it is the sin and not the annoyance I wish I could make you understand He spoke with some impatience Poor fellow he was too weak exhausted and nervous I am perfectly well I can set to work to morrow I will do anything not to be oppressed with the thought of how little I am doing I do not want your wine Liberty to act in the manner I think right will do me far more good But it is of no use It is preordained that I am to be nothing but a cumberer of the ground I beg your ladyship s pardon for this call He stood up and then turned dizzy My lady looked on deeply hurt and not a little offended he held out his hand to her and I could see that she had a little hesitation before she took it He then saw me I almost think for the first time and put out his hand once more drew it back as if undecided put it out again and finally took hold of mine for an instant in his damp listless hand and was gone Lady Ludlow was dissatisfied with both him and herself I was sure Indeed I was dissatisfied with the result of the interview myself But my lady was not one to speak out her feelings on the subject nor was I one to forget myself and begin on a topic which she did not begin She came to me and was very tender with me so tender that that and the thoughts of mister Gray s sick hopeless disappointed look nearly made me cry You are tired little one said my lady Go and lie down in my room and hear what Medlicott and I can decide upon in the way of strengthening dainties for that poor young man who is killing himself with his over sensitive conscientiousness Oh my lady said I and then I stopped Well What asked she If you would but let him have Farmer Hale s barn at once it would do him more good than all Pooh pooh child though I don t think she was displeased he is not fit for more work just now I shall go and write for doctor Trevor And for the next half hour we did nothing but arrange physical comforts and cures for poor mister Gray At the end of the time missus Medlicott said Has your ladyship heard that Harry Gregson has fallen from a tree and broken his thigh bone and is like to be a cripple for life Harry Gregson That black eyed lad who read my letter It all comes from over education CHAPTER XI But I don t see how my lady could think it was over education that made Harry Gregson break his thigh for the manner in which he met with the accident was this mister Horner who had fallen sadly out of health since his wife s death had attached himself greatly to Harry Gregson Now mister Horner had a cold manner to every one and never spoke more than was necessary at the best of times And latterly it had not been the best of times with him I dare say he had had some causes for anxiety of which I knew nothing about my lady s affairs and he was evidently annoyed by my lady s whim as he once inadvertently called it of placing Miss Galindo under him in the position of a clerk Yet he had always been friends in his quiet way with Miss Galindo and she devoted herself to her new occupation with diligence and punctuality although more than once she had moaned to me over the orders for needlework which had been sent to her and which owing to her occupation in the service of Lady Ludlow she had been unable to fulfil The only living creature to whom the staid mister Horner could be said to be attached was Harry Gregson To my lady he was a faithful and devoted servant looking keenly after her interests and anxious to forward them at any cost of trouble to himself But the more shrewd mister Horner was the more probability was there of his being annoyed at certain peculiarities of opinion which my lady held with a quiet gentle pertinacity against which no arguments based on mere worldly and business calculations made any way This frequent opposition to views which mister Horner entertained although it did not interfere with the sincere respect which the lady and the steward felt for each other yet prevented any warmer feeling of affection from coming in It seems strange to say it but I must repeat it the only person for whom since his wife s death mister Horner seemed to feel any love was the little imp Harry Gregson with his bright watchful eyes his tangled hair hanging right down to his eyebrows for all the world like a Skye terrier This lad half gipsy and whole poacher as many people esteemed him hung about the silent respectable staid mister Horner and followed his steps with something of the affectionate fidelity of the dog which he resembled I suspect this demonstration of attachment to his person on Harry Gregson s part was what won mister Horner s regard In the first instance the steward had only chosen the lad out as the cleverest instrument he could find for his purpose and I don t mean to say that if Harry had not been almost as shrewd as mister Horner himself was both by original disposition and subsequent experience the steward would have taken to him as he did let the lad have shown ever so much affection for him But even to Harry mister Horner was silent Still it was pleasant to find himself in many ways so readily understood to perceive that the crumbs of knowledge he let fall were picked up by his little follower and hoarded like gold that here was one to hate the persons and things whom mister Horner coldly disliked and to reverence and admire all those for whom he had any regard mister Horner had never had a child and unconsciously I suppose something of the paternal feeling had begun to develop itself in him towards Harry Gregson I heard one or two things from different people which have always made me fancy that mister Horner secretly and almost unconsciously hoped that Harry Gregson might be trained so as to be first his clerk and next his assistant and finally his successor in his stewardship to the Hanbury estates Harry s disgrace with my lady in consequence of his reading the letter was a deeper blow to mister Horner than his quiet manner would ever have led any one to suppose or than Lady Ludlow ever dreamed of inflicting I am sure Probably Harry had a short stern rebuke from mister Horner at the time for his manner was always hard even to those he cared for the most But Harry s love was not to be daunted or quelled by a few sharp words I dare say from what I heard of them afterwards that Harry accompanied mister Horner in his walk over the farm the very day of the rebuke his presence apparently unnoticed by the agent by whom his absence would have been painfully felt nevertheless That was the way of it as I have been told mister Horner never bade Harry go with him never thanked him for going or being at his heels ready to run on any errands straight as the crow flies to his point and back to heel in as short a time as possible Yet if Harry were away mister Horner never inquired the reason from any of the men who might be supposed to know whether he was detained by his father or otherwise engaged he never asked Harry himself where he had been But Miss Galindo said that those labourers who knew mister Horner well told her that he was always more quick eyed to shortcomings more savage like in fault finding on those days when the lad was absent Miss Galindo indeed was my great authority for most of the village news which I heard She it was who gave me the particulars of poor Harry s accident You see my dear she said the little poacher has taken some unaccountable fancy to my master This was the name by which Miss Galindo always spoke of mister Horner to me ever since she had been as she called it appointed his clerk Now if I had twenty hearts to lose I never could spare a bit of one of them for that good gray square severe man But different people have different tastes and here is that little imp of a gipsy tinker ready to turn slave for my master and odd enough my master who I should have said beforehand would have made short work of imp and imp s family and have sent Hall the Bang beggar after them in no time my master as they tell me is in his way quite fond of the lad and if he could without vexing my lady too much he would have made him what the folks here call a Latiner However last night it seems that there was a letter of some importance forgotten I can t tell you what it was about my dear though I know perfectly well but service oblige as well as noblesse and you must take my word for it that it was important and one that I am surprised my master could forget till too late for the post The poor good orderly man is not what he was before his wife s death Well it seems that he was sore annoyed by his forgetfulness and well he might be And it was all the more vexatious as he had no one to blame but himself As for that matter I always scold somebody else when I m in fault but I suppose my master would never think of doing that else it s a mighty relief However he could eat no tea and was altogether put out and gloomy And the little faithful imp lad perceiving all this I suppose got up like a page in an old ballad and said he would run for his life across country to Comberford and see if he could not get there before the bags were made up So my master gave him the letter and nothing more was heard of the poor fellow till this morning for the father thought his son was sleeping in mister Horner s barn as he does occasionally it seems and my master as was very natural that he had gone to his father s And he had fallen down the old stone quarry had he not Yes sure enough mister Gray had been up here fretting my lady with some of his new fangled schemes and because the young man could not have it all his own way from what I understand he was put out and thought he would go home by the back lane instead of through the village where the folks would notice if the parson looked glum But however it was a mercy and I don t mind saying so ay and meaning it too though it may be like methodism for as mister Gray walked by the quarry he heard a groan and at first he thought it was a lamb fallen down and he stood still and then he heard it again and then I suppose he looked down and saw Harry So he let himself down by the boughs of the trees to the ledge where Harry lay half dead and with his poor thigh broken There he had lain ever since the night before he had been returning to tell the master that he had safely posted the letter and the first words he said when they recovered him from the exhausted state he was in were Miss Galindo tried hard not to whimper as she said it It was in time sir I see d it put in the bag with my own eyes But where is he asked I How did mister Gray get him out Ay there it is you see Why the old gentleman I daren t say Devil in Lady Ludlow s house is not so black as he is painted and mister Gray must have a deal of good in him as I say at times and then at others when he has gone against me I can t bear him and think hanging too good for him But he lifted the poor lad as if he had been a baby I suppose and carried him up the great ledges that were formerly used for steps and laid him soft and easy on the wayside grass and ran home and got help and a door and had him carried to his house and laid on his bed and then somehow for the first time either he or any one else perceived it he himself was all over blood his own blood he had broken a blood vessel and there he lies in the little dressing room as white and as still as if he were dead and the little imp in mister Gray s own bed sound asleep now his leg is set just as if linen sheets and a feather bed were his native element as one may say Really now he is doing so well I ve no patience with him lying there where mister Gray ought to be It is just what my lady always prophesied would come to pass if there was any confusion of ranks Poor mister Gray said I thinking of his flushed face and his feverish restless ways when he had been calling on my lady not an hour before his exertions on Harry s behalf And I told Miss Galindo how ill I had thought him Yes said she And that was the reason my lady had sent for Doctor Trevor Well it has fallen out admirably for he looked well after that old donkey of a Prince and saw that he made no blunders Now that old donkey of a Prince meant the village surgeon mister Prince between whom and Miss Galindo there was war to the knife as they often met in the cottages when there was illness and she had her queer odd recipes which he with his grand pharmacopoeia held in infinite contempt and the consequence of their squabbling had been not long before this very time that he had established a kind of rule that into whatever sick room Miss Galindo was admitted there he refused to visit But Miss Galindo s prescriptions and visits cost nothing and were often backed by kitchen physic so though it was true that she never came but she scolded about something or other she was generally preferred as medical attendant to mister Prince Yes the old donkey is obliged to tolerate me and be civil to me for you see I got there first and had possession as it were and yet my lord the donkey likes the credit of attending the parson and being in consultation with so grand a county town doctor as Doctor Trevor And Doctor Trevor is an old friend of mine she sighed a little some time I may tell you why and treats me with infinite bowing and respect so the donkey not to be out of medical fashion bows too though it is sadly against the grain and he pulled a face as if he had heard a slate pencil gritting against a slate when I told Doctor Trevor I meant to sit up with the two lads for I call mister Gray little more than a lad and a pretty conceited one too at times But why should you sit up Miss Galindo It will tire you sadly Not it You see there is Gregson s mother to keep quiet for she sits by her lad fretting and sobbing so that I m afraid of her disturbing mister Gray and there s mister Gray to keep quiet for Doctor Trevor says his life depends on it and there is medicine to be given to the one and bandages to be attended to for the other and the wild horde of gipsy brothers and sisters to be turned out and the father to be held in from showing too much gratitude to mister Gray who can t hear it and who is to do it all but me The only servant is old lame Betty who once lived with me and would leave me because she said I was always bothering there was a good deal of truth in what she said I grant but she need not have said it a good deal of truth is best let alone at the bottom of the well and what can she do deaf as ever she can be too So Miss Galindo went her ways but not the less was she at her post in the morning a little crosser and more silent than usual but the first was not to be wondered at and the last was rather a blessing Lady Ludlow had been extremely anxious both about mister Gray and Harry Gregson Kind and thoughtful in any case of illness and accident she always was but somehow in this the feeling that she was not quite what shall I call it friends seems hardly the right word to use as to the possible feeling between the Countess Ludlow and the little vagabond messenger who had only once been in her presence that she had hardly parted from either as she could have wished to do had death been near made her more than usually anxious Doctor Trevor was not to spare obtaining the best medical advice the county could afford whatever he ordered in the way of diet was to be prepared under missus Medlicott s own eye and sent down from the Hall to the Parsonage As mister Horner had given somewhat similar directions in the case of Harry Gregson at least there was rather a multiplicity of counsellors and dainties than any lack of them And the second night mister Horner insisted on taking the superintendence of the nursing himself and sat and snored by Harry s bedside while the poor exhausted mother lay by her child thinking that she watched him but in reality fast asleep as Miss Galindo told us for distrusting any one s powers of watching and nursing but her own she had stolen across the quiet village street in cloak and dressing gown and found mister Gray in vain trying to reach the cup of barley water which mister Horner had placed just beyond his reach In consequence of mister Gray s illness we had to have a strange curate to do duty a man who dropped his h s and hurried through the service and yet had time enough to stand in my Lady s way bowing to her as she came out of church and so subservient in manner that I believe that sooner than remain unnoticed by a countess he would have preferred being scolded or even cuffed Now I found out that great as was my lady s liking and approval of respect nay even reverence being paid to her as a person of quality a sort of tribute to her Order which she had no individual right to remit or indeed not to exact yet she being personally simple sincere and holding herself in low esteem could not endure anything like the servility of mister Crosse the temporary curate She grew absolutely to loathe his perpetual smiling and bowing his instant agreement with the slightest opinion she uttered his veering round as she blew the wind I have often said that my lady did not talk much as she might have done had she lived among her equals But we all loved her so much that we had learnt to interpret all her little ways pretty truly and I knew what particular turns of her head and contractions of her delicate fingers meant as well as if she had expressed herself in words I began to suspect that my lady would be very thankful to have mister Gray about again and doing his duty even with a conscientiousness that might amount to worrying himself and fidgeting others and although mister Gray might hold her opinions in as little esteem as those of any simple gentlewoman she was too sensible not to feel how much flavour there was in his conversation compared to that of mister Crosse who was only her tasteless echo As for Miss Galindo she was utterly and entirely a partisan of mister Gray s almost ever since she had begun to nurse him during his illness You know I never set up for reasonableness my lady So I don t pretend to say as I might do if I were a sensible woman and all that that I am convinced by mister Gray s arguments of this thing or t other For one thing you see poor fellow he has never been able to argue or hardly indeed to speak for Doctor Trevor has been very peremptory So there s been no scope for arguing But what I mean is this When I see a sick man thinking always of others and never of himself patient humble a trifle too much at times for I ve caught him praying to be forgiven for having neglected his work as a parish priest Miss Galindo was making horrible faces to keep back tears squeezing up her eyes in a way which would have amused me at any other time but when she was speaking of mister Gray when I see a downright good religious man I m apt to think he s got hold of the right clue and that I can do no better than hold on by the tails of his coat and shut my eyes if we ve got to go over doubtful places on our road to Heaven So my lady you must excuse me if when he gets about again he is all agog about a Sunday school for if he is I shall be agog too and perhaps twice as bad as him for you see I ve a strong constitution compared to his and strong ways of speaking and acting And I tell your ladyship this now because I think from your rank and still more if I may say so for all your kindness to me long ago down to this very day you ve a right to be first told of anything about me Change of opinion I can t exactly call it for I don t see the good of schools and teaching A B C any more than I did before only mister Gray does so I m to shut my eyes and leap over the ditch to the side of education I ve told Sally already that if she does not mind her work but stands gossiping with Nelly Mather I ll teach her her lessons and I ve never caught her with old Nelly since I think Miss Galindo s desertion to mister Gray s opinions in this matter hurt my lady just a little bit but she only said Of course if the parishoners wish for it mister Gray must have his Sunday school I shall in that case withdraw my opposition I am sorry I cannot alter my opinions as easily as you My lady made herself smile as she said this Miss Galindo saw it was an effort to do so She thought a minute before she spoke again Your ladyship has not seen mister Gray as intimately as I have done That s one thing But as for the parishioners they will follow your ladyship s lead in everything so there is no chance of their wishing for a Sunday school I have never done anything to make them follow my lead as you call it Miss Galindo said my lady gravely Yes you have replied Miss Galindo bluntly And then correcting herself she said Begging your ladyship s pardon you have Your ancestors have lived here time out of mind and have owned the land on which their forefathers have lived ever since there were forefathers You yourself were born amongst them and have been like a little queen to them ever since I might say and they ve never known your ladyship do anything but what was kind and gentle but I ll leave fine speeches about your ladyship to mister Crosse Only you my lady lead the thoughts of the parish and save some of them a world of trouble for they could never tell what was right if they had to think for themselves It s all quite right that they should be guided by you my lady if only you would agree with mister Gray Well said my lady I told him only the last day that he was here that I would think about it I do believe I could make up my mind on certain subjects better if I were left alone than while being constantly talked to about them My lady said this in her usual soft tones but the words had a tinge of impatience about them indeed she was more ruffled than I had often seen her but checking herself in an instant she said You don t know how mister Horner drags in this subject of education apropos of everything Not that he says much about it at any time it is not his way But he cannot let the thing alone I know why my lady said Miss Galindo That poor lad Harry Gregson will never be able to earn his livelihood in any active way but will be lame for life Now mister Horner thinks more of Harry than of any one else in the world except perhaps your ladyship Was it not a pretty companionship for my lady And he has schemes of his own for teaching Harry and if mister Gray could but have his school mister Horner and he think Harry might be schoolmaster as your ladyship would not like to have him coming to you as steward s clerk I wish your ladyship would fall into this plan mister Gray has it so at heart Miss Galindo looked wistfully at my lady as she said this But my lady only said drily and rising at the same time as if to end the conversation So mister Horner and mister Gray seem to have gone a long way in advance of my consent to their plans There exclaimed Miss Galindo as my lady left the room with an apology for going away I have gone and done mischief with my long stupid tongue To be sure people plan a long way ahead of to day more especially when one is a sick man lying all through the weary day on a sofa My lady will soon get over her annoyance said I as it were apologetically I only stopped Miss Galindo s self reproaches to draw down her wrath upon myself And has not she a right to be annoyed with me if she likes and to keep annoyed as long as she likes Am I complaining of her that you need tell me that Let me tell you I have known my lady these thirty years and if she were to take me by the shoulders and turn me out of the house I should only love her the more So don t you think to come between us with any little mincing peace making speeches I have been a mischief making parrot and I like her the better for being vexed with me So good bye to you Miss and wait till you know Lady Ludlow as well as I do before you next think of telling me she will soon get over her annoyance And off Miss Galindo went I could not exactly tell what I had done wrong but I took care never again to come in between my lady and her by any remark about the one to the other for I saw that some most powerful bond of grateful affection made Miss Galindo almost worship my lady Meanwhile Harry Gregson was limping a little about in the village still finding his home in mister Gray s house for there he could most conveniently be kept under the doctor s eye and receive the requisite care and enjoy the requisite nourishment As soon as he was a little better he was to go to mister Horner s house but as the steward lived some distance out of the way and was much from home he had agreed to leave Harry at the house to which he had first been taken until he was quite strong again and the more willingly I suspect from what I heard afterwards because mister Gray gave up all the little strength of speaking which he had to teaching Harry in the very manner which mister Horner most desired As for Gregson the father he wild man of the woods poacher tinker jack of all trades was getting tamed by this kindness to his child Hitherto his hand had been against every man as every man s had been against him That affair before the justice which I told you about when mister Gray and even my lady had interested themselves to get him released from unjust imprisonment was the first bit of justice he had ever met with it attracted him to the people and attached him to the spot on which he had but squatted for a time I am not sure if any of the villagers were grateful to him for remaining in their neighbourhood instead of decamping as he had often done before for good reasons doubtless of personal safety Harry was only one out of a brood of ten or twelve children some of whom had earned for themselves no good character in service one indeed had been actually transported for a robbery committed in a distant part of the county and the tale was yet told in the village of how Gregson the father came back from the trial in a state of wild rage striding through the place and uttering oaths of vengeance to himself his great black eyes gleaming out of his matted hair and his arms working by his side and now and then tossed up in his impotent despair As I heard the account his wife followed him child laden and weeping After this they had vanished from the country for a time leaving their mud hovel locked up and the door key as the neighbours said buried in a hedge bank The Gregsons had reappeared much about the same time that mister Gray came to Hanbury He had either never heard of their evil character or considered that it gave them all the more claims upon his Christian care and the end of it was that this rough untamed strong giant of a heathen was loyal slave to the weak hectic nervous self distrustful parson Gregson had also a kind of grumbling respect for mister Horner he did not quite like the steward s monopoly of his Harry the mother submitted to that with a better grace swallowing down her maternal jealousy in the prospect of her child s advancement to a better and more respectable position than that in which his parents had struggled through life But mister Horner the steward and Gregson the poacher and squatter had come into disagreeable contact too often in former days for them to be perfectly cordial at any future time Even now when there was no immediate cause for anything but gratitude for his child s sake on Gregson s part he would skulk out of mister Horner s way if he saw him coming and it took all mister Horner s natural reserve and acquired self restraint to keep him from occasionally holding up his father s life as a warning to Harry Now Gregson had nothing of this desire for avoidance with regard to mister Gray The poacher had a feeling of physical protection towards the parson while the latter had shown the moral courage without which Gregson would never have respected him in coming right down upon him more than once in the exercise of unlawful pursuits and simply and boldly telling him he was doing wrong with such a quiet reliance upon Gregson s better feeling at the same time that the strong poacher could not have lifted a finger against mister Gray though it had been to save himself from being apprehended and taken to the lock ups the very next hour He had rather listened to the parson s bold words with an approving smile much as mister Gulliver might have hearkened to a lecture from a Lilliputian But when brave words passed into kind deeds Gregson s heart mutely acknowledged its master and keeper And the beauty of it all was that mister Gray knew nothing of the good work he had done or recognized himself as the instrument which God had employed He thanked God it is true fervently and often that the work was done and loved the wild man for his rough gratitude but it never occurred to the poor young clergyman lying on his sick bed and praying as Miss Galindo had told us he did to be forgiven for his unprofitable life to think of Gregson s reclaimed soul as anything with which he had had to do It was now more than three months since mister Gray had been at Hanbury Court During all that time he had been confined to his house if not to his sick bed and he and my lady had never met since their last discussion and difference about Farmer Hale s barn This was not my dear lady s fault no one could have been more attentive in every way to the slightest possible want of either of the invalids especially of mister Gray And she would have gone to see him at his own house as she sent him word but that her foot had slipped upon the polished oak staircase and her ancle had been sprained So we had never seen mister Gray since his illness when one November day he was announced as wishing to speak to my lady She was sitting in her room the room in which I lay now pretty constantly and I remember she looked startled when word was brought to her of mister Gray s being at the Hall She could not go to him she was too lame for that so she bade him be shown into where she sat Such a day for him to go out she exclaimed looking at the fog which had crept up to the windows and was sapping the little remaining life in the brilliant Virginian creeper leaves that draperied the house on the terrace side He came in white trembling his large eyes wild and dilated He hastened up to Lady Ludlow s chair and to my surprise took one of her hands and kissed it without speaking yet shaking all over mister Gray said she quickly with sharp tremulous apprehension of some unknown evil What is it There is something unusual about you Something unusual has occurred replied he forcing his words to be calm as with a great effort A gentleman came to my house not half an hour ago a mister Howard He came straight from Vienna My son said my dear lady stretching out her arms in dumb questioning attitude The Lord gave and the Lord taketh away Blessed be the name of the Lord But my poor lady could not echo the words He was the last remaining child And once she had been the joyful mother of nine CHAPTER XII I am ashamed to say what feeling became strongest in my mind about this time next to the sympathy we all of us felt for my dear lady in her deep sorrow I mean for that was greater and stronger than anything else however contradictory you may think it when you hear all It might arise from my being so far from well at the time which produced a diseased mind in a diseased body but I was absolutely jealous for my father s memory when I saw how many signs of grief there were for my lord s death he having done next to nothing for the village and parish which now changed as it were its daily course of life because his lordship died in a far off city My father had spent the best years of his manhood in labouring hard body and soul for the people amongst whom he lived His family of course claimed the first place in his heart he would have been good for little even in the way of benevolence if they had not But close after them he cared for his parishioners and neighbours And yet when he died though the church bells tolled and smote upon our hearts with hard fresh pain at every beat the sounds of every day life still went on close pressing around us carts and carriages street cries distant barrel organs the kindly neighbours kept them out of our street life active noisy life pressed on our acute consciousness of Death and jarred upon it as on a quick nerve And when we went to church my father s own church though the pulpit cushions were black and many of the congregation had put on some humble sign of mourning yet it did not alter the whole material aspect of the place And yet what was Lord Ludlow s relation to Hanbury compared to my father s work and place in O it was very wicked in me I think if I had seen my lady if I had dared to ask to go to her I should not have felt so miserable so discontented But she sat in her own room hung with black all even over the shutters She saw no light but that which was artificial candles lamps and the like for more than a month Only Adams went near her mister Gray was not admitted though he called daily Even missus Medlicott did not see her for near a fortnight The sight of my lady s griefs or rather the recollection of it made missus Medlicott talk far more than was her wont She told us with many tears and much gesticulation even speaking German at times when her English would not flow that my lady sat there a white figure in the middle of the darkened room a shaded lamp near her the light of which fell on an open Bible the great family Bible It was not open at any chapter or consoling verse but at the page whereon were registered the births of her nine children Five had died in infancy sacrificed to the cruel system which forbade the mother to suckle her babies Four had lived longer Urian had been the first to die Ughtred Mortimar Earl Ludlow the last My lady did not cry missus Medlicott said She was quite composed very still very silent She put aside everything that savoured of mere business sent people to mister Horner for that But she was proudly alive to every possible form which might do honour to the last of her race In those days expresses were slow things and forms still slower Before my lady s directions could reach Vienna my lord was buried There was some talk so missus Medlicott said about taking the body up and bringing him to Hanbury But his executors connections on the Ludlow side demurred to this If he were removed to England he must be carried on to Scotland and interred with his Monkshaven forefathers My lady deeply hurt withdrew from the discussion before it degenerated to an unseemly contest But all the more for this understood mortification of my lady s did the whole village and estate of Hanbury assume every outward sign of mourning The church bells tolled morning and evening The church itself was draped in black inside Hatchments were placed everywhere where hatchments could be put All the tenantry spoke in hushed voices for more than a week scarcely daring to observe that all flesh even that of an Earl Ludlow and the last of the Hanburys was but grass after all The very Fighting Lion closed its front door front shutters it had none and those who needed drink stole in at the back and were silent and maudlin over their cups instead of riotous and noisy Miss Galindo s eyes were swollen up with crying and she told me with a fresh burst of tears that even hump backed Sally had been found sobbing over her Bible and using a pocket handkerchief for the first time in her life her aprons having hitherto stood her in the necessary stead but not being sufficiently in accordance with etiquette to be used when mourning over an earl s premature decease If it was this way out of the Hall you might work it by the rule of three as Miss Galindo used to say and judge what it was in the Hall We none of us spoke but in a whisper we tried not to eat and indeed the shock had been so really great and we did really care so much for my lady that for some days we had but little appetite But after that I fear our sympathy grew weaker while our flesh grew stronger But we still spoke low and our hearts ached whenever we thought of my lady sitting there alone in the darkened room with the light ever falling on that one solemn page We wished O how I wished that she would see mister Gray But Adams said she thought my lady ought to have a bishop come to see her Still no one had authority enough to send for one mister Horner all this time was suffering as much as any one He was too faithful a servant of the great Hanbury family though now the family had dwindled down to a fragile old lady not to mourn acutely over its probable extinction He had besides a deeper sympathy and reverence with and for my lady in all things than probably he ever cared to show for his manners were always measured and cold He suffered from sorrow He also suffered from wrong My lord s executors kept writing to him continually My lady refused to listen to mere business saying she intrusted all to him But the all was more complicated than I ever thoroughly understood As far as I comprehended the case it was something of this kind There had been a mortgage raised on my lady s property of Hanbury to enable my lord her husband to spend money in cultivating his Scotch estates after some new fashion that required capital As long as my lord her son lived who was to succeed to both the estates after her death this did not signify so she had said and felt and she had refused to take any steps to secure the repayment of capital or even the payment of the interest of the mortgage from the possible representatives and possessors of the Scotch estates to the possible owner of the Hanbury property saying it ill became her to calculate on the contingency of her son s death But he had died childless unmarried The heir of the Monkshaven property was an Edinburgh advocate a far away kinsman of my lord s the Hanbury property at my lady s death would go to the descendants of a third son of the Squire Hanbury in the days of Queen Anne This complication of affairs was most grievous to mister Horner He had always been opposed to the mortgage had hated the payment of the interest as obliging my lady to practise certain economies which though she took care to make them as personal as possible he disliked as derogatory to the family Poor mister Horner He was so cold and hard in his manner so curt and decisive in his speech that I don t think we any of us did him justice Miss Galindo was almost the first at this time to speak a kind word of him or to take thought of him at all any farther than to get out of his way when we saw him approaching I don t think mister Horner is well she said one day about three weeks after we had heard of my lord s death He sits resting his head on his hand and hardly hears me when I speak to him But I thought no more of it as Miss Galindo did not name it again My lady came amongst us once more From elderly she had become old a little frail old lady in heavy black drapery never speaking about nor alluding to her great sorrow quieter gentler paler than ever before and her eyes dim with much weeping never witnessed by mortal She had seen mister Gray at the expiration of the month of deep retirement But I do not think that even to him she had said one word of her own particular individual sorrow All mention of it seemed buried deep for evermore One day mister Horner sent word that he was too much indisposed to attend to his usual business at the Hall but he wrote down some directions and requests to Miss Galindo saying that he would be at his office early the next morning The next morning he was dead Miss Galindo told my lady Miss Galindo herself cried plentifully but my lady although very much distressed could not cry It seemed a physical impossibility as if she had shed all the tears in her power Moreover I almost think her wonder was far greater that she herself lived than that mister Horner died It was almost natural that so faithful a servant should break his heart when the family he belonged to lost their stay their heir and their last hope Yes mister Horner was a faithful servant I do not think there are many so faithful now but perhaps that is an old woman s fancy of mine When his will came to be examined it was discovered that soon after Harry Gregson s accident mister Horner had left the few thousands three I think of which he was possessed in trust for Harry s benefit desiring his executors to see that the lad was well educated in certain things for which mister Horner had thought that he had shown especial aptitude and there was a kind of implied apology to my lady in one sentence where he stated that Harry s lameness would prevent his being ever able to gain his living by the exercise of any mere bodily faculties as had been wished by a lady whose wishes he the testator was bound to regard But there was a codicil in the will dated since Lord Ludlow s death feebly written by mister Horner himself as if in preparation only for some more formal manner of bequest or perhaps only as a mere temporary arrangement till he could see a lawyer and have a fresh will made In this he revoked his previous bequest to Harry Gregson He only left two hundred pounds to mister Gray to be used as that gentleman thought best for Henry Gregson s benefit With this one exception he bequeathed all the rest of his savings to my lady with a hope that they might form a nest egg as it were towards the paying off of the mortgage which had been such a grief to him during his life I may not repeat all this in lawyer s phrase I heard it through Miss Galindo and she might make mistakes Though indeed she was very clear headed and soon earned the respect of mister Smithson my lady s lawyer from Warwick mister Smithson knew Miss Galindo a little before both personally and by reputation but I don t think he was prepared to find her installed as steward s clerk and at first he was inclined to treat her in this capacity with polite contempt But Miss Galindo was both a lady and a spirited sensible woman and she could put aside her self indulgence in eccentricity of speech and manner whenever she chose Nay more she was usually so talkative that if she had not been amusing and warm hearted one might have thought her wearisome occasionally But to meet mister Smithson she came out daily in her Sunday gown she said no more than was required in answer to his questions her books and papers were in thorough order and methodically kept her statements of matters of fact accurate and to be relied on She was amusingly conscious of her victory over his contempt of a woman clerk and his preconceived opinion of her unpractical eccentricity Let me alone said she one day when she came in to sit awhile with me That man is a good man a sensible man and I have no doubt he is a good lawyer but he can t fathom women yet I make no doubt he ll go back to Warwick and never give credit again to those people who made him think me half cracked to begin with O my dear he did He showed it twenty times worse than my poor dear master ever did It was a form to be gone through to please my lady and for her sake he would hear my statements and see my books It was keeping a woman out of harm s way at any rate to let her fancy herself useful I read the man And I am thankful to say he cannot read me At least only one side of me When I see an end to be gained I can behave myself accordingly Here was a man who thought that a woman in a black silk gown was a respectable orderly kind of person and I was a woman in a black silk gown He believed that a woman could not write straight lines and required a man to tell her that two and two made four I was not above ruling my books and had Cocker a little more at my fingers ends than he had But my greatest triumph has been holding my tongue He would have thought nothing of my books or my sums or my black silk gown if I had spoken unasked So I have buried more sense in my bosom these ten days than ever I have uttered in the whole course of my life before I have been so curt so abrupt so abominably dull that I ll answer for it he thinks me worthy to be a man But I must go back to him my dear so good bye to conversation and you But though mister Smithson might be satisfied with Miss Galindo I am afraid she was the only part of the affair with which he was content Everything else went wrong I could not say who told me so but the conviction of this seemed to pervade the house I never knew how much we had all looked up to the silent gruff mister Horner for decisions until he was gone My lady herself was a pretty good woman of business as women of business go Her father seeing that she would be the heiress of the Hanbury property had given her a training which was thought unusual in those days and she liked to feel herself queen regnant and to have to decide in all cases between herself and her tenantry But perhaps mister Horner would have done it more wisely not but what she always attended to him at last She would begin by saying pretty clearly and promptly what she would have done and what she would not have done If mister Horner approved of it he bowed and set about obeying her directly if he disapproved of it he bowed and lingered so long before he obeyed her that she forced his opinion out of him with her Well mister Horner and what have you to say against it For she always understood his silence as well as if he had spoken But the estate was pressed for ready money and mister Horner had grown gloomy and languid since the death of his wife and even his own personal affairs were not in the order in which they had been a year or two before for his old clerk had gradually become superannuated or at any rate unable by the superfluity of his own energy and wit to supply the spirit that was wanting in mister Horner Day after day mister Smithson seemed to grow more fidgety more annoyed at the state of affairs Like every one else employed by Lady Ludlow as far as I could learn he had an hereditary tie to the Hanbury family As long as the Smithsons had been lawyers they had been lawyers to the Hanburys always coming in on all great family occasions and better able to understand the characters and connect the links of what had once been a large and scattered family than any individual thereof had ever been As long as a man was at the head of the Hanburys the lawyers had simply acted as servants and had only given their advice when it was required But they had assumed a different position on the memorable occasion of the mortgage they had remonstrated against it My lady had resented this remonstrance and a slight unspoken coolness had existed between her and the father of this mister Smithson ever since I was very sorry for my lady mister Smithson was inclined to blame mister Horner for the disorderly state in which he found some of the outlying farms and for the deficiencies in the annual payment of rents mister Smithson had too much good feeling to put this blame into words but my lady s quick instinct led her to reply to a thought the existence of which she perceived and she quietly told the truth and explained how she had interfered repeatedly to prevent mister Horner from taking certain desirable steps which were discordant to her hereditary sense of right and wrong between landlord and tenant She also spoke of the want of ready money as a misfortune that could be remedied by more economical personal expenditure on her own part by which individual saving it was possible that a reduction of fifty pounds a year might have been accomplished But as soon as mister Smithson touched on larger economies such as either affected the welfare of others or the honour and standing of the great House of Hanbury she was inflexible Her establishment consisted of somewhere about forty servants of whom nearly as many as twenty were unable to perform their work properly and yet would have been hurt if they had been dismissed so they had the credit of fulfilling duties while my lady paid and kept their substitutes mister Smithson made a calculation and would have saved some hundreds a year by pensioning off these old servants But my lady would not hear of it Then again I know privately that he urged her to allow some of us to return to our homes Bitterly we should have regretted the separation from Lady Ludlow but we would have gone back gladly had we known at the time that her circumstances required it but she would not listen to the proposal for a moment If I cannot act justly towards every one I will give up a plan which has been a source of much satisfaction at least I will not carry it out to such an extent in future But to these young ladies who do me the favour to live with me at present I stand pledged I cannot go back from my word mister Smithson We had better talk no more of this As she spoke she entered the room where I lay She and mister Smithson were coming for some papers contained in the bureau They did not know I was there and mister Smithson started a little when he saw me as he must have been aware that I had overheard something But my lady did not change a muscle of her face All the world might overhear her kind just pure sayings and she had no fear of their misconstruction She came up to me and kissed me on the forehead and then went to search for the required papers I rode over the Connington farms yesterday my lady I must say I was quite grieved to see the condition they are in all the land that is not waste is utterly exhausted with working successive white crops Not a pinch of manure laid on the ground for years I must say that a greater contrast could never have been presented than that between Harding s farm and the next fields fences in perfect order rotation crops sheep eating down the turnips on the waste lands everything that could be desired Whose farm is that asked my lady Why I am sorry to say it was on none of your ladyship s that I saw such good methods adopted I hoped it was I stopped my horse to inquire A queer looking man sitting on his horse like a tailor watching his men with a couple of the sharpest eyes I ever saw and dropping his h s at every word answered my question and told me it was his I could not go on asking him who he was but I fell into conversation with him and I gathered that he had earned some money in trade in Birmingham and had bought the estate five hundred acres I think he said on which he was born and now was setting himself to cultivate it in downright earnest going to Holkham and Woburn and half the country over to get himself up on the subject It would be Brooke that dissenting baker from Birmingham said my lady in her most icy tone mister Smithson I am sorry I have been detaining you so long but I think these are the letters you wished to see If her ladyship thought by this speech to quench mister Smithson she was mistaken mister Smithson just looked at the letters and went on with the old subject Now my lady it struck me that if you had such a man to take poor Horner s place he would work the rents and the land round most satisfactorily I should not despair of inducing this very man to undertake the work I should not mind speaking to him myself on the subject for we got capital friends over a snack of luncheon that he asked me to share with him Lady Ludlow fixed her eyes on mister Smithson as he spoke and never took them off his face until he had ended She was silent a minute before she answered You are very good mister Smithson but I need not trouble you with any such arrangements I am going to write this afternoon to Captain James a friend of one of my sons who has I hear been severely wounded at Trafalgar to request him to honour me by accepting mister Horner s situation A Captain James A captain in the navy going to manage your ladyship s estate If he will be so kind I shall esteem it a condescension on his part but I hear that he will have to resign his profession his state of health is so bad and a country life is especially prescribed for him I am in some hopes of tempting him here as I learn he has but little to depend on if he gives up his profession A Captain James an invalid captain You think I am asking too great a favour continued my lady I never could tell how far it was simplicity or how far a kind of innocent malice that made her misinterpret mister Smithson s words and looks as she did But he is not a post captain only a commander and his pension will be but small I may be able by offering him country air and a healthy occupation to restore him to health Occupation My lady may I ask how a sailor is to manage land Why your tenants will laugh him to scorn My tenants I trust will not behave so ill as to laugh at any one I choose to set over them Captain James has had experience in managing men He has remarkable practical talents and great common sense as I hear from every one But whatever he may be the affair rests between him and myself I can only say I shall esteem myself fortunate if he comes There was no more to be said after my lady spoke in this manner I had heard her mention Captain James before as a middy who had been very kind to her son Urian I thought I remembered then that she had mentioned that his family circumstances were not very prosperous But I confess that little as I knew of the management of land I quite sided with mister Smithson He silently prohibited from again speaking to my lady on the subject opened his mind to Miss Galindo from whom I was pretty sure to hear all the opinions and news of the household and village She had taken a great fancy to me because she said I talked so agreeably I believe it was because I listened so well Well have you heard the news she began about this Captain James A sailor with a wooden leg I have no doubt What would the poor dear deceased master have said to it if he had known who was to be his successor My dear I have often thought of the postman s bringing me a letter as one of the pleasures I shall miss in heaven But really I think mister Horner may be thankful he has got out of the reach of news or else he would hear of mister Smithson s having made up to the Birmingham baker and of his one legged captain coming to dot and go one over the estate I suppose he will look after the labourers through a spy glass I only hope he won t stick in the mud with his wooden leg for I for one won t help him out Yes I would said she correcting herself I would for my lady s sake But are you sure he has a wooden leg asked I I heard Lady Ludlow tell mister Smithson about him and she only spoke of him as wounded Well sailors are almost always wounded in the leg Look at Greenwich Hospital I should say there were twenty one legged pensioners to one without an arm there But say he has got half a dozen legs what has he to do with managing land I shall think him very impudent if he comes taking advantage of my lady s kind heart However come he did In a month from that time the carriage was sent to meet Captain James just as three years before it had been sent to meet me His coming had been so much talked about that we were all as curious as possible to see him and to know how so unusual an experiment as it seemed to us would answer But before I tell you anything about our new agent I must speak of something quite as interesting and I really think quite as important And this was my lady s making friends with Harry Gregson I do believe she did it for mister Horner s sake but of course I can only conjecture why my lady did anything But I heard one day from Mary Legard that my lady had sent for Harry to come and see her if he was well enough to walk so far and the next day he was shown into the room he had been in once before under such unlucky circumstances The lad looked pale enough as he stood propping himself up on his crutch and the instant my lady saw him she bade John Footman place a stool for him to sit down upon while she spoke to him It might be his paleness that gave his whole face a more refined and gentle look but I suspect it was that the boy was apt to take impressions and that mister Horner s grave dignified ways and mister Gray s tender and quiet manners had altered him and then the thoughts of illness and death seem to turn many of us into gentlemen and gentlewomen as long as such thoughts are in our minds We cannot speak loudly or angrily at such times we are not apt to be eager about mere worldly things for our very awe at our quickened sense of the nearness of the invisible world makes us calm and serene about the petty trifles of to day At least I know that was the explanation mister Gray once gave me of what we all thought the great improvement in Harry Gregson s way of behaving My lady hesitated so long about what she had best say that Harry grew a little frightened at her silence A few months ago it would have surprised me more than it did now but since my lord her son s death she had seemed altered in many ways more uncertain and distrustful of herself as it were At last she said and I think the tears were in her eyes My poor little fellow you have had a narrow escape with your life since I saw you last To this there was nothing to be said but Yes and again there was silence And you have lost a good kind friend in mister Horner The boy s lips worked and I think he said Please don t But I can t be sure at any rate my lady went on And so have I a good kind friend he was to both of us and to you he wished to show his kindness in even a more generous way than he has done mister Gray has told you about his legacy to you has he not There was no sign of eager joy on the lad s face as if he realised the power and pleasure of having what to him must have seemed like a fortune mister Gray said as how he had left me a matter of money Yes he has left you two hundred pounds But I would rather have had him alive my lady he burst out sobbing as if his heart would break My lad I believe you We would rather have had our dead alive would we not and there is nothing in money that can comfort us for their loss But you know mister Gray has told you who has appointed all our times to die mister Horner was a good just man and has done well and kindly both by me and you You perhaps do not know and now I understood what my lady had been making up her mind to say to Harry all the time she was hesitating how to begin that mister Horner at one time meant to leave you a great deal more probably all he had with the exception of a legacy to his old clerk Morrison But he knew that this estate on which my forefathers had lived for six hundred years was in debt and that I had no immediate chance of paying off this debt and yet he felt that it was a very sad thing for an old property like this to belong in part to those other men who had lent the money You understand me I think my little man said she questioning Harry s face He had left off crying and was trying to understand with all his might and main and I think he had got a pretty good general idea of the state of affairs though probably he was puzzled by the term the estate being in debt But he was sufficiently interested to want my lady to go on and he nodded his head at her to signify this to her So mister Horner took the money which he once meant to be yours and has left the greater part of it to me with the intention of helping me to pay off this debt I have told you about It will go a long way and I shall try hard to save the rest and then I shall die happy in leaving the land free from debt She paused But I shall not die happy in thinking of you I do not know if having money or even having a great estate and much honour is a good thing for any of us But God sees fit that some of us should be called to this condition and it is our duty then to stand by our posts like brave soldiers Now mister Horner intended you to have this money first I shall only call it borrowing from you Harry Gregson if I take it and use it to pay off the debt I shall pay mister Gray interest on this money because he is to stand as your guardian as it were till you come of age and he must fix what ought to be done with it so as to fit you for spending the principal rightly when the estate can repay it you I suppose now it will be right for you to be educated That will be another snare that will come with your money But have courage Harry Both education and money may be used rightly if we only pray against the temptations they bring with them Harry could make no answer though I am sure he understood it all My lady wanted to get him to talk to her a little by way of becoming acquainted with what was passing in his mind and she asked him what he would like to have done with his money if he could have part of it now To such a simple question involving no talk about feelings his answer came readily enough Build a cottage for father with stairs in it and give mister Gray a school house O father does so want mister Gray for to have his wish Father saw all the stones lying quarried and hewn on Farmer Hale s land mister Gray had paid for them all himself And father said he would work night and day and little Tommy should carry mortar if the parson would let him sooner than that he should be fretted and frabbed as he was with no one giving him a helping hand or a kind word Harry knew nothing of my lady s part in the affair that was very clear My lady kept silence If I might have a piece of my money I would buy land from mister Brooks he has got a bit to sell just at the corner of Hendon Lane and I would give it to mister Gray and perhaps if your ladyship thinks I may be learned again I might grow up into the schoolmaster You are a good boy said my lady But there are more things to be thought of in carrying out such a plan than you are aware of However it shall be tried The school my lady I exclaimed almost thinking she did not know what she was saying Yes the school For mister Horner s sake for mister Gray s sake and last not least for this lad s sake I will give the new plan a trial Ask mister Gray to come up to me this afternoon about the land he wants He need not go to a Dissenter for it And tell your father he shall have a good share in the building of it and Tommy shall carry the mortar And I may be schoolmaster asked Harry eagerly We ll see about that said my lady amused It will be some time before that plan comes to pass my little fellow And now to return to Captain James My first account of him was from Miss Galindo He s not above thirty and I must just pack up my pens and my paper and be off for it would be the height of impropriety for me to be staying here as his clerk It was all very well in the old master s days But here am I not fifty till next May and this young unmarried man who is not even a widower O there would be no end of gossip Besides he looks as askance at me as I do at him My black silk gown had no effect He s afraid I shall marry him But I won t he may feel himself quite safe from that And mister Smithson has been recommending a clerk to my lady She would far rather keep me on but I can t stop I really could not think it proper What sort of a looking man is he O nothing particular Short and brown and sunburnt I did not think it became me to look at him Well now for the nightcaps I should have grudged any one else doing them for I have got such a pretty pattern But when it came to Miss Galindo s leaving there was a great misunderstanding between her and my lady Miss Galindo had imagined that my lady had asked her as a favour to copy the letters and enter the accounts and had agreed to do the work without the notion of being paid for so doing She had now and then grieved over a very profitable order for needlework passing out of her hands on account of her not having time to do it because of her occupation at the Hall but she had never hinted this to my lady but gone on cheerfully at her writing as long as her clerkship was required My lady was annoyed that she had not made her intention of paying Miss Galindo more clear in the first conversation she had had with her but I suppose that she had been too delicate to be very explicit with regard to money matters and now Miss Galindo was quite hurt at my lady s wanting to pay her for what she had done in such right down good will No Miss Galindo said my own dear lady you may be as angry with me as you like but don t offer me money Think of six and twenty years ago and poor Arthur and as you were to me then Besides I wanted money I don t disguise it for a particular purpose and when I found that God bless you for asking me I could do you a service I turned it over in my mind and I gave up one plan and took up another and it s all settled now Bessy is to leave school and come and live with me Don t please offer me money again You don t know how glad I have been to do anything for you Have not I Margaret Dawson Did you not hear me say one day I would cut off my hand for my lady for am I a stick or a stone that I should forget kindness O I have been so glad to work for you And now Bessy is coming here and no one knows anything about her as if she had done anything wrong poor child Dear Miss Galindo replied my lady I will never ask you to take money again Only I thought it was quite understood between us And you know you have taken money for a set of morning wrappers before now Yes my lady but that was not confidential Now I was so proud to have something to do for you confidentially But who is Bessy asked my lady I do not understand who she is or why she is to come and live with you Dear Miss Galindo you must honour me by being confidential with me in your turn CHAPTER XIII I had always understood that Miss Galindo had once been in much better circumstances but I had never liked to ask any questions respecting her But about this time many things came out respecting her former life which I will try and arrange not however in the order in which I heard them but rather as they occurred Miss Galindo was the daughter of a clergyman in Westmoreland Her father was the younger brother of a baronet his ancestor having been one of those of James the First s creation This baronet uncle of Miss Galindo was one of the queer out of the way people who were bred at that time and in that northern district of England I never heard much of him from any one besides this one great fact that he had early disappeared from his family which indeed only consisted of a brother and sister who died unmarried and lived no one knew where somewhere on the Continent it was supposed for he had never returned from the grand tour which he had been sent to make according to the general fashion of the day as soon as he had left Oxford He corresponded occasionally with his brother the clergyman but the letters passed through a banker s hands the banker being pledged to secrecy and as he told mister Galindo having the penalty if he broke his pledge of losing the whole profitable business and of having the management of the baronet s affairs taken out of his hands without any advantage accruing to the inquirer for Sir Lawrence had told Messrs Graham that in case his place of residence was revealed by them not only would he cease to bank with them but instantly take measures to baffle any future inquiries as to his whereabouts by removing to some distant country Sir Lawrence paid a certain sum of money to his brother s account every year but the time of this payment varied and it was sometimes eighteen or nineteen months between the deposits then again it would not be above a quarter of the time showing that he intended it to be annual but as this intention was never expressed in words it was impossible to rely upon it and a great deal of this money was swallowed up by the necessity mister Galindo felt himself under of living in the large old rambling family mansion which had been one of Sir Lawrence s rarely expressed desires mister and missus Galindo often planned to live upon their own small fortune and the income derived from the living a vicarage of which the great tithes went to Sir Lawrence as lay impropriator so as to put by the payments made by the baronet for the benefit of Laurentia our Miss Galindo But I suppose they found it difficult to live economically in a large house even though they had it rent free They had to keep up with hereditary neighbours and friends and could hardly help doing it in the hereditary manner One of these neighbours a mister Gibson had a son a few years older than Laurentia The families were sufficiently intimate for the young people to see a good deal of each other and I was told that this young mister Mark Gibson was an unusually prepossessing man he seemed to have impressed every one who spoke of him to me as being a handsome manly kind hearted fellow just what a girl would be sure to find most agreeable The parents either forgot that their children were growing up to man s and woman s estate or thought that the intimacy and probable attachment would be no bad thing even if it did lead to a marriage Still nothing was ever said by young Gibson till later on when it was too late as it turned out He went to and from Oxford he shot and fished with mister Galindo or came to the Mere to skate in winter time was asked to accompany mister Galindo to the Hall as the latter returned to the quiet dinner with his wife and daughter and so and so it went on nobody much knew how until one day when mister Galindo received a formal letter from his brother s bankers announcing Sir Lawrence s death of malaria fever at Albano and congratulating Sir Hubert on his accession to the estates and the baronetcy The king is dead Long live the king as I have since heard that the French express it Sir Hubert and his wife were greatly surprised Sir Lawrence was but two years older than his brother and they had never heard of any illness till they heard of his death They were sorry very much shocked but still a little elated at the succession to the baronetcy and estates The London bankers had managed everything well There was a large sum of ready money in their hands at Sir Hubert s service until he should touch his rents the rent roll being eight thousand a year And only Laurentia to inherit it all Her mother a poor clergyman s daughter began to plan all sorts of fine marriages for her nor was her father much behind his wife in his ambition They took her up to London when they went to buy new carriages and dresses and furniture And it was then and there she made my lady s acquaintance How it was that they came to take a fancy to each other I cannot say My lady was of the old nobility grand compose gentle and stately in her ways Miss Galindo must always have been hurried in her manner and her energy must have shown itself in inquisitiveness and oddness even in her youth But I don t pretend to account for things I only narrate them And the fact was this that the elegant fastidious countess was attracted to the country girl who on her part almost worshipped my lady My lady s notice of their daughter made her parents think I suppose that there was no match that she might not command she the heiress of eight thousand a year and visiting about among earls and dukes So when they came back to their old Westmoreland Hall and Mark Gibson rode over to offer his hand and his heart and prospective estate of nine hundred a year to his old companion and playfellow Laurentia Sir Hubert and Lady Galindo made very short work of it They refused him plumply themselves and when he begged to be allowed to speak to Laurentia they found some excuse for refusing him the opportunity of so doing until they had talked to her themselves and brought up every argument and fact in their power to convince her a plain girl and conscious of her plainness that mister Mark Gibson had never thought of her in the way of marriage till after her father s accession to his fortune and that it was the estate not the young lady that he was in love with I suppose it will never be known in this world how far this supposition of theirs was true My Lady Ludlow had always spoken as if it was but perhaps events which came to her knowledge about this time altered her opinion At any rate the end of it was Laurentia refused Mark and almost broke her heart in doing so He discovered the suspicions of Sir Hubert and Lady Galindo and that they had persuaded their daughter to share in them So he flung off with high words saying that they did not know a true heart when they met with one and that although he had never offered till after Sir Lawrence s death yet that his father knew all along that he had been attached to Laurentia only that he being the eldest of five children and having as yet no profession had had to conceal rather than to express an attachment which in those days he had believed was reciprocated He had always meant to study for the bar and the end of all he had hoped for had been to earn a moderate income which he might ask Laurentia to share This or something like it was what he said But his reference to his father cut two ways Old mister Gibson was known to be very keen about money It was just as likely that he would urge Mark to make love to the heiress now she was an heiress as that he would have restrained him previously as Mark said he had done When this was repeated to Mark he became proudly reserved or sullen and said that Laurentia at any rate might have known him better He left the country and went up to London to study law soon afterwards and Sir Hubert and Lady Galindo thought they were well rid of him But Laurentia never ceased reproaching herself and never did to her dying day as I believe The words She might have known me better told to her by some kind friend or other rankled in her mind and were never forgotten Her father and mother took her up to London the next year but she did not care to visit dreaded going out even for a drive lest she should see Mark Gibson s reproachful eyes pined and lost her health Lady Ludlow saw this change with regret and was told the cause by Lady Galindo who of course gave her own version of Mark s conduct and motives My lady never spoke to Miss Galindo about it but tried constantly to interest and please her It was at this time that my lady told Miss Galindo so much about her own early life and about Hanbury that Miss Galindo resolved if ever she could she would go and see the old place which her friend loved so well The end of it all was that she came to live there as we know But a great change was to come first Before Sir Hubert and Lady Galindo had left London on this their second visit they had a letter from the lawyer whom they employed saying that Sir Lawrence had left an heir his legitimate child by an Italian woman of low rank at least legal claims to the title and property had been sent into him on the boy s behalf Sir Lawrence had always been a man of adventurous and artistic rather than of luxurious tastes and it was supposed when all came to be proved at the trial that he was captivated by the free beautiful life they lead in Italy and had married this Neapolitan fisherman s daughter who had people about her shrewd enough to see that the ceremony was legally performed She and her husband had wandered about the shores of the Mediterranean for years leading a happy careless irresponsible life unencumbered by any duties except those connected with a rather numerous family It was enough for her that they never wanted money and that her husband s love was always continued to her She hated the name of England wicked cold heretic England and avoided the mention of any subjects connected with her husband s early life So that when he died at Albano she was almost roused out of her vehement grief to anger with the Italian doctor who declared that he must write to a certain address to announce the death of Lawrence Galindo For some time she feared lest English barbarians might come down upon her making a claim to the children She hid herself and them in the Abruzzi living upon the sale of what furniture and jewels Sir Lawrence had died possessed of When these failed she returned to Naples which she had not visited since her marriage Her father was dead but her brother inherited some of his keenness He interested the priests who made inquiries and found that the Galindo succession was worth securing to an heir of the true faith They stirred about it obtained advice at the English Embassy and hence that letter to the lawyers calling upon Sir Hubert to relinquish title and property and to refund what money he had expended He was vehement in his opposition to this claim He could not bear to think of his brother having married a foreigner a papist a fisherman s daughter nay of his having become a papist himself He was in despair at the thought of his ancestral property going to the issue of such a marriage He fought tooth and nail making enemies of his relations and losing almost all his own private property for he would go on against the lawyer s advice long after every one was convinced except himself and his wife At last he was conquered He gave up his living in gloomy despair He would have changed his name if he could so desirous was he to obliterate all tie between himself and the mongrel papist baronet and his Italian mother and all the succession of children and nurses who came to take possession of the Hall soon after mister Hubert Galindo s departure stayed there one winter and then flitted back to Naples with gladness and delight mister and missus Hubert Galindo lived in London He had obtained a curacy somewhere in the city They would have been thankful now if mister Mark Gibson had renewed his offer No one could accuse him of mercenary motives if he had done so Because he did not come forward as they wished they brought his silence up as a justification of what they had previously attributed to him I don t know what Miss Galindo thought herself but Lady Ludlow has told me how she shrank from hearing her parents abuse him Lady Ludlow supposed that he was aware that they were living in London His father must have known the fact and it was curious if he had never named it to his son Besides the name was very uncommon and it was unlikely that it should never come across him in the advertisements of charity sermons which the new and rather eloquent curate of Saint Mark s East was asked to preach All this time Lady Ludlow never lost sight of them for Miss Galindo s sake And when the father and mother died it was my lady who upheld Miss Galindo in her determination not to apply for any provision to her cousin the Italian baronet but rather to live upon the hundred a year which had been settled on her mother and the children of his son Hubert s marriage by the old grandfather Sir Lawrence mister Mark Gibson had risen to some eminence as a barrister on the Northern Circuit but had died unmarried in the lifetime of his father a victim so people said to intemperance Doctor Trevor the physician who had been called in to mister Gray and Harry Gregson had married a sister of his And that was all my lady knew about the Gibson family But who was Bessy That mystery and secret came out too in process of time Miss Galindo had been to Warwick some years before I arrived at Hanbury on some kind of business or shopping which can only be transacted in a county town There was an old Westmoreland connection between her and missus Trevor though I believe the latter was too young to have been made aware of her brother s offer to Miss Galindo at the time when it took place and such affairs if they are unsuccessful are seldom spoken about in the gentleman s family afterwards But the Gibsons and Galindos had been county neighbours too long for the connection not to be kept up between two members settled far away from their early homes Miss Galindo always desired her parcels to be sent to doctor Trevor s when she went to Warwick for shopping purchases If she were going any journey and the coach did not come through Warwick as soon as she arrived in my lady s coach or otherwise from Hanbury she went to Doctor Trevor s to wait She was as much expected to sit down to the household meals as if she had been one of the family and in after years it was missus Trevor who managed her repository business for her So on the day I spoke of she had gone to Doctor Trevor s to rest and possibly to dine The post in those times came in at all hours of the morning and Doctor Trevor s letters had not arrived until after his departure on his morning round Miss Galindo was sitting down to dinner with missus Trevor and her seven children when the Doctor came in He was flurried and uncomfortable and hurried the children away as soon as he decently could Then rather feeling Miss Galindo s presence an advantage both as a present restraint on the violence of his wife s grief and as a consoler when he was absent on his afternoon round he told missus Trevor of her brother s death He had been taken ill on circuit and had hurried back to his chambers in London only to die She cried terribly but Doctor Trevor said afterwards he never noticed that Miss Galindo cared much about it one way or another She helped him to soothe his wife promised to stay with her all the afternoon instead of returning to Hanbury and afterwards offered to remain with her while the Doctor went to attend the funeral When they heard of the old love story between the dead man and Miss Galindo brought up by mutual friends in Westmoreland in the review which we are all inclined to take of the events of a man s life when he comes to die they tried to remember Miss Galindo s speeches and ways of going on during this visit She was a little pale a little silent her eyes were sometimes swollen and her nose red but she was at an age when such appearances are generally attributed to a bad cold in the head rather than to any more sentimental reason They felt towards her as towards an old friend a kindly useful eccentric old maid She did not expect more or wish them to remember that she might once have had other hopes and more youthful feelings Doctor Trevor thanked her very warmly for staying with his wife when he returned home from London where the funeral had taken place He begged Miss Galindo to stay with them when the children were gone to bed and she was preparing to leave the husband and wife by themselves He told her and his wife many particulars then paused then went on And Mark has left a child a little girl But he never was married exclaimed missus Trevor A little girl continued her husband whose mother I conclude is dead At any rate the child was in possession of his chambers she and an old nurse who seemed to have the charge of everything and has cheated poor Mark I should fancy not a little But the child asked missus Trevor still almost breathless with astonishment How do you know it is his The nurse told me it was with great appearance of indignation at my doubting it I asked the little thing her name and all I could get was Bessy and a cry of Me wants papa The nurse said the mother was dead and she knew no more about it than that mister Gibson had engaged her to take care of the little girl calling it his child One or two of his lawyer friends whom I met with at the funeral told me they were aware of the existence of the child What is to be done with her asked missus Gibson Nay I don t know replied he Mark has hardly left assets enough to pay his debts and your father is not inclined to come forward That night as Doctor Trevor sat in his study after his wife had gone to bed Miss Galindo knocked at his door She and he had a long conversation The result was that he accompanied Miss Galindo up to town the next day that they took possession of the little Bessy and she was brought down and placed at nurse at a farm in the country near Warwick Miss Galindo undertaking to pay one half of the expense and to furnish her with clothes and doctor Trevor undertaking that the remaining half should be furnished by the Gibson family or by himself in their default Miss Galindo was not fond of children and I dare say she dreaded taking this child to live with her for more reasons than one My Lady Ludlow could not endure any mention of illegitimate children It was a principle of hers that society ought to ignore them And I believe Miss Galindo had always agreed with her until now when the thing came home to her womanly heart Still she shrank from having this child of some strange woman under her roof She went over to see it from time to time she worked at its clothes long after every one thought she was in bed and when the time came for Bessy to be sent to school Miss Galindo laboured away more diligently than ever in order to pay the increased expense For the Gibson family had at first paid their part of the compact but with unwillingness and grudging hearts then they had left it off altogether and it fell hard on doctor Trevor with his twelve children and latterly Miss Galindo had taken upon herself almost all the burden One can hardly live and labour and plan and make sacrifices for any human creature without learning to love it And Bessy loved Miss Galindo too for all the poor girl s scanty pleasures came from her and Miss Galindo had always a kind word and latterly many a kind caress for Mark Gibson s child whereas if she went to doctor Trevor s for her holiday she was overlooked and neglected in that bustling family who seemed to think that if she had comfortable board and lodging under their roof it was enough I am sure now that Miss Galindo had often longed to have Bessy to live with her but as long as she could pay for her being at school she did not like to take so bold a step as bringing her home knowing what the effect of the consequent explanation would be on my lady And as the girl was now more than seventeen and past the age when young ladies are usually kept at school and as there was no great demand for governesses in those days and as Bessy had never been taught any trade by which to earn her own living why I don t exactly see what could have been done but for Miss Galindo to bring her to her own home in Hanbury For although the child had grown up lately in a kind of unexpected manner into a young woman Miss Galindo might have kept her at school for a year longer if she could have afforded it but this was impossible when she became mister Horner s clerk and relinquished all the payment of her repository work and perhaps after all she was not sorry to be compelled to take the step she was longing for At any rate Bessy came to live with Miss Galindo in a very few weeks from the time when Captain James set Miss Galindo free to superintend her own domestic economy again For a long time I knew nothing about this new inhabitant of Hanbury My lady never mentioned her in any way This was in accordance with Lady Ludlow s well known principles She neither saw nor heard nor was in any way cognisant of the existence of those who had no legal right to exist at all If Miss Galindo had hoped to have an exception made in Bessy s favour she was mistaken My lady sent a note inviting Miss Galindo herself to tea one evening about a month after Bessy came but Miss Galindo had a cold and could not come The next time she was invited she had an engagement at home a step nearer to the absolute truth And the third time she had a young friend staying with her whom she was unable to leave My lady accepted every excuse as bona fide and took no further notice I missed Miss Galindo very much we all did for in the days when she was clerk she was sure to come in and find the opportunity of saying something amusing to some of us before she went away And I as an invalid or perhaps from natural tendency was particularly fond of little bits of village gossip There was no mister Horner he even had come in now and then with formal stately pieces of intelligence and there was no Miss Galindo in these days I missed her much And so did my lady I am sure Behind all her quiet sedate manner I am certain her heart ached sometimes for a few words from Miss Galindo who seemed to have absented herself altogether from the Hall now Bessy was come Captain James might be very sensible and all that but not even my lady could call him a substitute for the old familiar friends He was a thorough sailor as sailors were in those days swore a good deal drank a good deal without its ever affecting him in the least and was very prompt and kind hearted in all his actions but he was not accustomed to women as my lady once said and would judge in all things for himself My lady had expected I think to find some one who would take his notions on the management of her estate from her ladyship s own self but he spoke as if he were responsible for the good management of the whole and must consequently be allowed full liberty of action He had been too long in command over men at sea to like to be directed by a woman in anything he undertook even though that woman was my lady I suppose this was the common sense my lady spoke of but when common sense goes against us I don t think we value it quite so much as we ought to do Lady Ludlow was proud of her personal superintendence of her own estate She liked to tell us how her father used to take her with him in his rides and bid her observe this and that and on no account to allow such and such things to be done But I have heard that the first time she told all this to Captain James he told her point blank that he had heard from mister Smithson that the farms were much neglected and the rents sadly behind hand and that he meant to set to in good earnest and study agriculture and see how he could remedy the state of things My lady would I am sure be greatly surprised but what could she do Here was the very man she had chosen herself setting to with all his energy to conquer the defect of ignorance which was all that those who had presumed to offer her ladyship advice had ever had to say against him Captain James read Arthur Young s Tours in all his spare time as long as he was an invalid and shook his head at my lady s accounts as to how the land had been cropped or left fallow from time immemorial Then he set to and tried too many new experiments at once My lady looked on in dignified silence but all the farmers and tenants were in an uproar and prophesied a hundred failures Perhaps fifty did occur they were only half as many as Lady Ludlow had feared but they were twice as many four eight times as many as the captain had anticipated His openly expressed disappointment made him popular again The rough country people could not have understood silent and dignified regret at the failure of his plans but they sympathized with a man who swore at his ill success sympathized even while they chuckled over his discomfiture mister Brooke the retired tradesman did not cease blaming him for not succeeding and for swearing But what could you expect from a sailor mister Brooke asked even in my lady s hearing though he might have known Captain James was my lady s own personal choice from the old friendship mister Urian had always shown for him I think it was this speech of the Birmingham baker s that made my lady determine to stand by Captain James and encourage him to try again For she would not allow that her choice had been an unwise one at the bidding as it were of a dissenting tradesman the only person in the neighbourhood too who had flaunted about in coloured clothes when all the world was in mourning for my lady s only son Captain James would have thrown the agency up at once if my lady had not felt herself bound to justify the wisdom of her choice by urging him to stay He was much touched by her confidence in him and swore a great oath that the next year he would make the land such as it had never been before for produce It was not my lady s way to repeat anything she had heard especially to another person s disadvantage So I don t think she ever told Captain James of mister Brooke s speech about a sailor s being likely to mismanage the property and the captain was too anxious to succeed in this the second year of his trial to be above going to the flourishing shrewd mister Brooke and asking for his advice as to the best method of working the estate I dare say if Miss Galindo had been as intimate as formerly at the Hall we should all of us have heard of this new acquaintance of the agent s long before we did As it was I am sure my lady never dreamed that the captain who held opinions that were even more Church and King than her own could ever have made friends with a Baptist baker from Birmingham even to serve her ladyship s own interests in the most loyal manner We heard of it first from mister Gray who came now often to see my lady for neither he nor she could forget the solemn tie which the fact of his being the person to acquaint her with my lord s death had created between them For true and holy words spoken at that time though having no reference to aught below the solemn subjects of life and death had made her withdraw her opposition to mister Gray s wish about establishing a village school She had sighed a little it is true and was even yet more apprehensive than hopeful as to the result but almost as if as a memorial to my lord she had allowed a kind of rough school house to be built on the green just by the church and had gently used the power she undoubtedly had in expressing her strong wish that the boys might only be taught to read and write and the first four rules of arithmetic while the girls were only to learn to read and to add up in their heads and the rest of the time to work at mending their own clothes knitting stockings and spinning My lady presented the school with more spinning wheels than there were girls and requested that there might be a rule that they should have spun so many hanks of flax and knitted so many pairs of stockings before they ever were taught to read at all After all it was but making the best of a bad job with my poor lady but life was not what it had been to her I remember well the day that mister Gray pulled some delicately fine yarn and I was a good judge of those things out of his pocket and laid it and a capital pair of knitted stockings before my lady as the first fruits so to say of his school I recollect seeing her put on her spectacles and carefully examine both productions Then she passed them to me This is well mister Gray I am much pleased You are fortunate in your schoolmistress She has had both proper knowledge of womanly things and much patience Who is she One out of our village My lady said mister Gray stammering and colouring in his old fashion Miss Bessy is so very kind as to teach all those sorts of things Miss Bessy and Miss Galindo sometimes My lady looked at him over her spectacles but she only repeated the words Miss Bessy and paused as if trying to remember who such a person could be and he if he had then intended to say more was quelled by her manner and dropped the subject He went on to say that he had thought it his duty to decline the subscription to his school offered by mister Brooke because he was a Dissenter that he mister Gray feared that Captain James through whom mister Brooke s offer of money had been made was offended at his refusing to accept it from a man who held heterodox opinions nay whom mister Gray suspected of being infected by Dodwell s heresy I think there must be some mistake said my lady or I have misunderstood you Captain James would never be sufficiently with a schismatic to be employed by that man Brooke in distributing his charities I should have doubted until now if Captain James knew him Indeed my lady he not only knows him but is intimate with him I regret to say I have repeatedly seen the captain and mister Brooke walking together going through the fields together and people do say My lady looked up in interrogation at mister Gray s pause I disapprove of gossip and it may be untrue but people do say that Captain James is very attentive to Miss Brooke Impossible said my lady indignantly Captain James is a loyal and religious man I beg your pardon mister Gray but it is impossible CHAPTER XIV Like many other things which have been declared to be impossible this report of Captain James being attentive to Miss Brooke turned out to be very true The mere idea of her agent being on the slightest possible terms of acquaintance with the Dissenter the tradesman the Birmingham democrat who had come to settle in our good orthodox aristocratic and agricultural Hanbury made my lady very uneasy Miss Galindo s misdemeanour in having taken Miss Bessy to live with her faded into a mistake a mere error of judgment in comparison with Captain James s intimacy at Yeast House as the Brookes called their ugly square built farm My lady talked herself quite into complacency with Miss Galindo and even Miss Bessy was named by her the first time I had ever been aware that my lady recognized her existence but I recollect it was a long rainy afternoon and I sat with her ladyship and we had time and opportunity for a long uninterrupted talk whenever we had been silent for a little while she began again with something like a wonder how it was that Captain James could ever have commenced an acquaintance with that man Brooke My lady recapitulated all the times she could remember that anything had occurred or been said by Captain James which she could now understand as throwing light upon the subject He said once that he was anxious to bring in the Norfolk system of cropping and spoke a good deal about mister Coke of Holkham who by the way was no more a Coke than I am collateral in the female line which counts for little or nothing among the great old commoners families of pure blood and his new ways of cultivation of course new men bring in new ways but it does not follow that either are better than the old ways However Captain James has been very anxious to try turnips and bone manure and he really is a man of such good sense and energy and was so sorry last year about the failure that I consented and now I begin to see my error I have always heard that town bakers adulterate their flour with bone dust and of course Captain James would be aware of this and go to Brooke to inquire where the article was to be purchased My lady always ignored the fact which had sometimes I suspect been brought under her very eyes during her drives that mister Brooke s few fields were in a state of far higher cultivation than her own so she could not of course perceive that there was any wisdom to be gained from asking the advice of the tradesman turned farmer But by and by this fact of her agent s intimacy with the person whom in the whole world she most disliked with that sort of dislike in which a large amount of uncomfortableness is combined the dislike which conscientious people sometimes feel to another without knowing why and yet which they cannot indulge in with comfort to themselves without having a moral reason why came before my lady in many shapes For indeed I am sure that Captain James was not a man to conceal or be ashamed of one of his actions I cannot fancy his ever lowering his strong loud clear voice or having a confidental conversation with any one When his crops had failed all the village had known it He complained he regretted he was angry or owned himself a fool all down the village street and the consequence was that although he was a far more passionate man than mister Horner all the tenants liked him far better People in general take a kindlier interest in any one the workings of whose mind and heart they can watch and understand than in a man who only lets you know what he has been thinking about and feeling by what he does But Harry Gregson was faithful to the memory of mister Horner Miss Galindo has told me that she used to watch him hobble out of the way of Captain James as if to accept his notice however good naturedly given would have been a kind of treachery to his former benefactor But Gregson the father and the new agent rather took to each other and one day much to my surprise I heard that the poaching tinkering vagabond as the people used to call Gregson when I first had come to live at Hanbury had been appointed gamekeeper mister Gray standing godfather as it were to his trustworthiness if he were trusted with anything which I thought at the time was rather an experiment only it answered as many of mister Gray s deeds of daring did It was curious how he was growing to be a kind of autocrat in the village and how unconscious he was of it He was as shy and awkward and nervous as ever in any affair that was not of some moral consequence to him But as soon as he was convinced that a thing was right he shut his eyes and ran and butted at it like a ram as Captain James once expressed it in talking over something mister Gray had done People in the village said they never knew what the parson would be at next or they might have said where his reverence would next turn up For I have heard of his marching right into the middle of a set of poachers gathered together for some desperate midnight enterprise or walking into a public house that lay just beyond the bounds of my lady s estate and in that extra parochial piece of ground I named long ago and which was considered the rendezvous of all the ne er do weel characters for miles round and where a parson and a constable were held in much the same kind of esteem as unwelcome visitors And yet mister Gray had his long fits of depression in which he felt as if he were doing nothing making no way in his work useless and unprofitable and better out of the world than in it In comparison with the work he had set himself to do what he did seemed to be nothing I suppose it was constitutional those attacks of lowness of spirits which he had about this time perhaps a part of the nervousness which made him always so awkward when he came to the Hall Even missus Medlicott who almost worshipped the ground he trod on as the saying is owned that mister Gray never entered one of my lady s rooms without knocking down something and too often breaking it He would much sooner have faced a desperate poacher than a young lady any day At least so we thought I do not know how it was that it came to pass that my lady became reconciled to Miss Galindo about this time Whether it was that her ladyship was weary of the unspoken coolness with her old friend or that the specimens of delicate sewing and fine spinning at the school had mollified her towards Miss Bessy but I was surprised to learn one day that Miss Galindo and her young friend were coming that very evening to tea at the Hall This information was given me by missus Medlicott as a message from my lady who further went on to desire that certain little preparations should be made in her own private sitting room in which the greater part of my days were spent From the nature of these preparations I became quite aware that my lady intended to do honour to her expected visitors Indeed Lady Ludlow never forgave by halves as I have known some people do Whoever was coming as a visitor to my lady peeress or poor nameless girl there was a certain amount of preparation required in order to do them fitting honour I do not mean to say that the preparation was of the same degree of importance in each case I dare say if a peeress had come to visit us at the Hall the covers would have been taken off the furniture in the white drawing room they never were uncovered all the time I stayed at the Hall because my lady would wish to offer her the ornaments and luxuries which this grand visitor who never came I wish she had I did so want to see that furniture uncovered was accustomed to at home and to present them to her in the best order in which my lady could The same rule mollified held good with Miss Galindo Certain things in which my lady knew she took an interest were laid out ready for her to examine on this very day and what was more great books of prints were laid out such as I remembered my lady had had brought forth to beguile my own early days of illness mister Hogarth s works and the like which I was sure were put out for Miss Bessy No one knows how curious I was to see this mysterious Miss Bessy twenty times more mysterious of course for want of her surname And then again to try and account for my great curiosity of which in recollection I am more than half ashamed I had been leading the quiet monotonous life of a crippled invalid for many years shut up from any sight of new faces and this was to be the face of one whom I had thought about so much and so long Oh I think I might be excused Of course they drank tea in the great hall with the four young gentlewomen who with myself formed the small bevy now under her ladyship s charge Of those who were at Hanbury when first I came none remained all were married or gone once more to live at some home which could be called their own whether the ostensible head were father or brother I myself was not without some hopes of a similar kind My brother Harry was now a curate in Westmoreland and wanted me to go and live with him as eventually I did for a time But that is neither here nor there at present What I am talking about is Miss Bessy After a reasonable time had elapsed occupied as I well knew by the meal in the great hall the measured yet agreeable conversation afterwards and a certain promenade around the hall and through the drawing rooms with pauses before different pictures the history or subject of each of which was invariably told by my lady to every new visitor a sort of giving them the freedom of the old family seat by describing the kind and nature of the great progenitors who had lived there before the narrator I heard the steps approaching my lady s room where I lay I think I was in such a state of nervous expectation that if I could have moved easily I should have got up and run away And yet I need not have been for Miss Galindo was not in the least altered her nose a little redder to be sure but then that might only have had a temporary cause in the private crying I know she would have had before coming to see her dear Lady Ludlow once again But I could almost have pushed Miss Galindo away as she intercepted me in my view of the mysterious Miss Bessy Miss Bessy was as I knew only about eighteen but she looked older Dark hair dark eyes a tall firm figure a good sensible face with a serene expression not in the least disturbed by what I had been thinking must be such awful circumstances as a first introduction to my lady who had so disapproved of her very existence those are the clearest impressions I remember of my first interview with Miss Bessy She seemed to observe us all in her quiet manner quite as much as I did her but she spoke very little occupied herself indeed as my lady had planned with looking over the great books of engravings I think I must have foolishly intended to make her feel at her ease by my patronage but she was seated far away from my sofa in order to command the light and really seemed so unconcerned at her unwonted circumstances that she did not need my countenance or kindness One thing I did like her watchful look at Miss Galindo from time to time it showed that her thoughts and sympathy were ever at Miss Galindo s service as indeed they well might be When Miss Bessy spoke her voice was full and clear and what she said to the purpose though there was a slight provincial accent in her way of speaking After a while my lady set us two to play at chess a game which I had lately learnt at mister Gray s suggestion Still we did not talk much together though we were becoming attracted towards each other I fancy You will play well said she You have only learnt about six months have you And yet you can nearly beat me who have been at it as many years I began to learn last November I remember mister Gray s bringing me Philidor on Chess one very foggy dismal day What made her look up so suddenly with bright inquiry in her eyes What made her silent for a moment as if in thought and then go on with something I know not what in quite an altered tone My lady and Miss Galindo went on talking while I sat thinking I heard Captain James s name mentioned pretty frequently and at last my lady put down her work and said almost with tears in her eyes I could not I cannot believe it He must be aware she is a schismatic a baker s daughter and he is a gentleman by virtue and feeling as well as by his profession though his manners may be at times a little rough My dear Miss Galindo what will this world come to Miss Galindo might possibly be aware of her own share in bringing the world to the pass which now dismayed my lady for of course though all was now over and forgiven yet Miss Bessy s being received into a respectable maiden lady s house was one of the portents as to the world s future which alarmed her ladyship and Miss Galindo knew this but at any rate she had too lately been forgiven herself not to plead for mercy for the next offender against my lady s delicate sense of fitness and propriety so she replied Indeed my lady I have long left off trying to conjecture what makes Jack fancy Gill or Gill Jack It s best to sit down quiet under the belief that marriages are made for us somewhere out of this world and out of the range of this world s reason and laws I m not so sure that I should settle it down that they were made in heaven t other place seems to me as likely a workshop but at any rate I ve given up troubling my head as to why they take place Captain James is a gentleman I make no doubt of that ever since I saw him stop to pick up old Goody Blake when she tumbled down on the slide last winter and then swear at a little lad who was laughing at her and cuff him till he tumbled down crying but we must have bread somehow and though I like it better baked at home in a good sweet brick oven yet as some folks never can get it to rise I don t see why a man may not be a baker You see my lady I look upon baking as a simple trade and as such lawful There is no machine comes in to take away a man s or woman s power of earning their living like the spinning jenny the old busybody that she is to knock up all our good old women s livelihood and send them to their graves before their time There s an invention of the enemy if you will That s very true said my lady shaking her head But baking bread is wholesome straight forward elbow work They have not got to inventing any contrivance for that yet thank Heaven It does not seem to me natural nor according to Scripture that iron and steel whose brows can t sweat should be made to do man s work And so I say all those trades where iron and steel do the work ordained to man at the Fall are unlawful and I never stand up for them But say this baker Brooke did knead his bread and make it rise and then that people who had perhaps no good ovens came to him and bought his good light bread and in this manner he turned an honest penny and got rich why all I say my lady is this I dare say he would have been born a Hanbury or a lord if he could and if he was not it is no fault of his that I can see that he made good bread being a baker by trade and got money and bought his land It was his misfortune not his fault that he was not a person of quality by birth That s very true said my lady after a moment s pause for consideration But although he was a baker he might have been a Churchman Even your eloquence Miss Galindo shan t convince me that that is not his own fault I don t see even that begging your pardon my lady said Miss Galindo emboldened by the first success of her eloquence When a Baptist is a baby if I understand their creed aright he is not baptized and consequently he can have no godfathers and godmothers to do anything for him in his baptism you agree to that my lady My lady would rather have known what her acquiescence would lead to before acknowledging that she could not dissent from this first proposition still she gave her tacit agreement by bowing her head And you know our godfathers and godmothers are expected to promise and vow three things in our name when we are little babies and can do nothing but squall for ourselves It is a great privilege but don t let us be hard upon those who have not had the chance of godfathers and godmothers Some people we know are born with silver spoons that s to say a godfather to give one things and teach one s catechism and see that we re confirmed into good church going Christians and others with wooden ladles in their mouths These poor last folks must just be content to be godfatherless orphans and Dissenters all their lives and if they are tradespeople into the bargain so much the worse for them but let us be humble Christians my dear lady and not hold our heads too high because we were born orthodox quality You go on too fast Miss Galindo I can t follow you Besides I do believe dissent to be an invention of the Devil s Why can t they believe as we do It s very wrong Besides its schism and heresy and you know the Bible says that s as bad as witchcraft My lady was not convinced as I could see After Miss Galindo had gone she sent missus Medlicott for certain books out of the great old library up stairs and had them made up into a parcel under her own eye If Captain James comes to morrow I will speak to him about these Brookes I have not hitherto liked to speak to him because I did not wish to hurt him by supposing there could be any truth in the reports about his intimacy with them But now I will try and do my duty by him and them Surely this great body of divinity will bring them back to the true church I could not tell for though my lady read me over the titles I was not any the wiser as to their contents Besides I was much more anxious to consult my lady as to my own change of place I showed her the letter I had that day received from Harry and we once more talked over the expediency of my going to live with him and trying what entire change of air would do to re establish my failing health I could say anything to my lady she was so sure to understand me rightly For one thing she never thought of herself so I had no fear of hurting her by stating the truth I told her how happy my years had been while passed under her roof but that now I had begun to wonder whether I had not duties elsewhere in making a home for Harry and whether the fulfilment of these duties quiet ones they must needs be in the case of such a cripple as myself would not prevent my sinking into the querulous habit of thinking and talking into which I found myself occasionally falling Add to which there was the prospect of benefit from the more bracing air of the north It was then settled that my departure from Hanbury my happy home for so long was to take place before many weeks had passed And as when one period of life is about to be shut up for ever we are sure to look back upon it with fond regret so I happy enough in my future prospects could not avoid recurring to all the days of my life in the Hall from the time when I came to it a shy awkward girl scarcely past childhood to now when a grown woman past childhood almost from the very character of my illness past youth I was looking forward to leaving my lady s house as a residence for ever As it has turned out I never saw either her or it again Like a piece of sea wreck I have drifted away from those days quiet happy eventless days very happy to remember I thought of good jovial mister Mountford and his regrets that he might not keep a pack a very small pack of harriers and his merry ways and his love of good eating of the first coming of mister Gray and my lady s attempt to quench his sermons when they tended to enforce any duty connected with education And now we had an absolute school house in the village and since Miss Bessy s drinking tea at the Hall my lady had been twice inside it to give directions about some fine yarn she was having spun for table napery And her ladyship had so outgrown her old custom of dispensing with sermon or discourse that even during the temporary preaching of mister Crosse she had never had recourse to it though I believe she would have had all the congregation on her side if she had And mister Horner was dead and Captain James reigned in his stead Good steady severe silent mister Horner with his clock like regularity and his snuff coloured clothes and silver buckles I have often wondered which one misses most when they are dead and gone the bright creatures full of life who are hither and thither and everywhere so that no one can reckon upon their coming and going with whom stillness and the long quiet of the grave seems utterly irreconcilable so full are they of vivid motion and passion or the slow serious people whose movements nay whose very words seem to go by clockwork who never appear much to affect the course of our life while they are with us but whose methodical ways show themselves when they are gone to have been intertwined with our very roots of daily existence I think I miss these last the most although I may have loved the former best Captain James never was to me what mister Horner was though the latter had hardly changed a dozen words with me at the day of his death Then Miss Galindo I remembered the time as if it had been only yesterday when she was but a name and a very odd one to me then she was a queer abrupt disagreeable busy old maid Now I loved her dearly and I found out that I was almost jealous of Miss Bessy mister Gray I never thought of with love the feeling was almost reverence with which I looked upon him I have not wished to speak much of myself or else I could have told you how much he had been to me during these long weary years of illness But he was almost as much to every one rich and poor from my lady down to Miss Galindo s Sally The village too had a different look about it I am sure I could not tell you what caused the change but there were no more lounging young men to form a group at the cross road at a time of day when young men ought to be at work I don t say this was all mister Gray s doing for there really was so much to do in the fields that there was but little time for lounging now a days And the children were hushed up in school and better behaved out of it too than in the days when I used to be able to go my lady s errands in the village I went so little about now that I am sure I can t tell who Miss Galindo found to scold and yet she looked so well and so happy that I think she must have had her accustomed portion of that wholesome exercise Before I left Hanbury the rumour that Captain James was going to marry Miss Brooke Baker Brooke s eldest daughter who had only a sister to share his property with her was confirmed He himself announced it to my lady nay more with a courage gained I suppose in his former profession where as I have heard he had led his ship into many a post of danger he asked her ladyship the Countess Ludlow if he might bring his bride elect the Baptist baker s daughter and present her to my lady I am glad I was not present when he made this request I should have felt so much ashamed for him and I could not have helped being anxious till I heard my lady s answer if I had been there Of course she acceded but I can fancy the grave surprise of her look I wonder if Captain James noticed it I hardly dared ask my lady after the interview had taken place what she thought of the bride elect but I hinted my curiosity and she told me that if the young person had applied to missus Medlicott for the situation of cook and missus Medlicott had engaged her she thought that it would have been a very suitable arrangement I understood from this how little she thought a marriage with Captain James R N suitable About a year after I left Hanbury I received a letter from Miss Galindo I think I can find it Yes this is it Hanbury May four eighteen eleven DEAR MARGARET You ask for news of us all Don t you know there is no news in Hanbury Did you ever hear of an event here Now if you have answered Yes in your own mind to these questions you have fallen into my trap and never were more mistaken in your life Hanbury is full of news and we have more events on our hands than we know what to do with I will take them in the order of the newspapers births deaths and marriages In the matter of births Jenny Lucas has had twins not a week ago Sadly too much of a good thing you ll say Very true but then they died so their birth did not much signify My cat has kittened too she has had three kittens which again you may observe is too much of a good thing and so it would be if it were not for the next item of intelligence I shall lay before you Captain and missus James have taken the old house next Pearson s and the house is overrun with mice which is just as fortunate for me as the King of Egypt s rat ridden kingdom was to Dick Whittington For my cat s kittening decided me to go and call on the bride in hopes she wanted a cat which she did like a sensible woman as I do believe she is in spite of Baptism Bakers Bread and Birmingham and something worse than all which you shall hear about if you ll only be patient As I had got my best bonnet on the one I bought when poor Lord Ludlow was last at Hanbury in ninety nine I thought it a great condescension in myself always remembering the date of the Galindo baronetcy to go and call on the bride though I don t think so much of myself in my every day clothes as you know But who should I find there but my Lady Ludlow She looks as frail and delicate as ever but is I think in better heart ever since that old city merchant of a Hanbury took it into his head that he was a cadet of the Hanburys of Hanbury and left her that handsome legacy I ll warrant you that the mortgage was paid off pretty fast and mister Horner s money or my lady s money or Harry Gregson s money call it which you will is invested in his name all right and tight and they do talk of his being captain of his school or Grecian or something and going to college after all Harry Gregson the poacher s son Well to be sure we are living in strange times But I have not done with the marriages yet Captain James s is all very well but no one cares for it now we are so full of mister Gray s Yes indeed mister Gray is going to be married and to nobody else but my little Bessy I tell her she will have to nurse him half the days of her life he is such a frail little body But she says she does not care for that so that his body holds his soul it is enough for her She has a good spirit and a brave heart has my Bessy It is a great advantage that she won t have to mark her clothes over again for when she had knitted herself her last set of stockings I told her to put G for Galindo if she did not choose to put it for Gibson for she should be my child if she was no one else s And now you see it stands for Gray So there are two marriages and what more would you have And she promises to take another of my kittens Now as to deaths old Farmer Hale is dead poor old man I should think his wife thought it a good riddance for he beat her every day that he was drunk and he was never sober in spite of mister Gray I don t think as I tell him that mister Gray would ever have found courage to speak to Bessy as long as Farmer Hale lived he took the old gentleman s sins so much to heart and seemed to think it was all his fault for not being able to make a sinner into a saint The parish bull is dead too I never was so glad in my life But they say we are to have a new one in his place In the meantime I cross the common in peace which is very convenient just now when I have so often to go to mister Gray s to see about furnishing Now you think I have told you all the Hanbury news don t you Not so The very greatest thing of all is to come I won t tantalize you but just out with it for you would never guess it My Lady Ludlow has given a party just like any plebeian amongst us We had tea and toast in the blue drawing room old John Footman waiting with Tom Diggles the lad that used to frighten away crows in Farmer Hale s fields following in my lady s livery hair powdered and everything missus Medlicott made tea in my lady s own room My lady looked like a splendid fairy queen of mature age in black velvet and the old lace which I have never seen her wear before since my lord s death But the company you ll say Why we had the parson of Clover and the parson of Headleigh and the parson of Merribank and the three parsonesses and Farmer Donkin and two Miss Donkins and mister Gray of course and myself and Bessy and Captain and missus James yes and mister and missus Brooke think of that I am not sure the parsons liked it but he was there For he has been helping Captain James to get my lady s land into order and then his daughter married the agent and mister Gray who ought to know says that after all Baptists are not such bad people and he was right against them at one time as you may remember missus Brooke is a rough diamond to be sure People have said that of me I know But being a Galindo I learnt manners in my youth and can take them up when I choose But missus Brooke never learnt manners I ll be bound When John Footman handed her the tray with the tea cups she looked up at him as if she were sorely puzzled by that way of going on I was sitting next to her so I pretended not to see her perplexity and put her cream and sugar in for her and was all ready to pop it into her hands when who should come up but that impudent lad Tom Diggles I call him lad for all his hair is powdered for you know that it is not natural gray hair with his tray full of cakes and what not all as good as missus Medlicott could make them By this time I should tell you all the parsonesses were looking at missus Brooke for she had shown her want of breeding before and the parsonesses who were just a step above her in manners were very much inclined to smile at her doings and sayings Well what does she do but pull out a clean Bandanna pocket handkerchief all red and yellow silk spread it over her best silk gown it was like enough a new one for I had it from Sally who had it from her cousin Molly who is dairy woman at the Brookes that the Brookes were mighty set up with an invitation to drink tea at the Hall There we were Tom Diggles even on the grin I wonder how long it is since he was own brother to a scarecrow only not so decently dressed and missus Parsoness of Headleigh I forget her name and it s no matter for she s an ill bred creature I hope Bessy will behave herself better was right down bursting with laughter and as near a hee haw as ever a donkey was when what does my lady do Ay there s my own dear Lady Ludlow God bless her She takes out her own pocket handkerchief all snowy cambric and lays it softly down on her velvet lap for all the world as if she did it every day of her life just like missus Brooke the baker s wife and when the one got up to shake the crumbs into the fire place the other did just the same But with such a grace and such a look at us all Tom Diggles went red all over and missus Parsoness of Headleigh scarce spoke for the rest of the evening and the tears came into my old silly eyes and mister Gray who was before silent and awkward in a way which I tell Bessy she must cure him of was made so happy by this pretty action of my lady s that he talked away all the rest of the evening and was the life of the company Oh Margaret Dawson I sometimes wonder if you re the better off for leaving us To be sure you re with your brother and blood is blood But when I look at my lady and mister Gray for all they re so different I would not change places with any in England Alas alas I never saw my dear lady again She died in eighteen hundred and fourteen and mister Gray did not long survive her As I dare say you know the Reverend Henry Gregson is now vicar of Hanbury and his wife is the daughter of mister Gray and Miss Bessy END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MY LADY LUDLOW This file should be named twenty
