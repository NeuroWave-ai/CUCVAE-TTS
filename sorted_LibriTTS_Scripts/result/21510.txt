none	none	With loud outcries of glad recognition and whoops of laughter the line swung in about her close Bodies crowded against her a hand was clapped over her mouth Other hands held her arms Her feet came off the ground and she had a momentary awareness of being rushed expertly forward There was a lurching twist as the aircar shot upward SHE S ABOUT TO ENTER THE MYSTERY OF HER LIFE IN Legacy Also by James H Schmitz THE DEMON BREED THE UNIVERSE AGAINST HER ACE SCIENCE FICTION Legacy JAMES H SCHMITZ SF ace books A Division of Charter Communications Inc A GROSSET DUNLAP COMPANY three hundred sixty Park Avenue South New York New York ten thousand ten LEGACY Originally published as A TALE OF TWO CLOCKS An ACE Book Cover art by Bob Adragna First Ace printing May nineteen seventy nine Printed in U S A This book is dedicated affectionately to my father one It was the time of sunrise in Ceyce the White City placidly beautiful capital of Maccadon the University World of the Hub In the Colonial School s sprawling five mile complex of buildings and tropical parks the second student shift was headed for breakfast while a larger part of the fourth shift moved at a more leisurely rate toward their bunks The school s organized activities were not much affected by the hour but the big exercise quadrangle was almost deserted for once Behind the railing of the firing range a young woman stood by herself gun in hand waiting for the automatic range monitor to select a new string of targets for release She was around twenty four slim and trim in the school s comfortable hiking outfit Tan shirt and knee length shorts knee stockings soft soled shoes Her sun hat hung on the railing and the dawn wind whipped strands of shoulder length modishly white silver hair along her cheeks She held a small beautifully worked handgun loosely beside her the twin barrelled sporting Denton which gunwise citizens of the Hub rated as a weapon for the precisionist and expert only In institutions like the Colonial School it wasn t often seen At the exact instant the monitor released its new flight of targets she became aware of the aircar gliding down toward her from the administration buildings on the right Startled she glanced sideways long enough to identify the car s two occupants shifted her attention back to the cluster of targets speeding toward her studied the flight pattern for another unhurried half second finally raised the Denton The little gun spat its noiseless invisible needle of destruction eight times Six small puffs of crimson smoke hung in the air The two remaining targets swerved up in a mocking curve and shot back to their discharge huts The girl bit her lip in moderate annoyance safetied and holstered the gun and waved her hand left right at the range attendant to indicate she was finished Then she turned to face the aircar as it settled slowly to the ground twenty feet away Her gray eyes studied its occupants critically Fine example you set the students she remarked Flying right into a hot gun range Doctor Plemponi principal of the Colonial School smiled soothingly Eight years ago your father bawled me out for the very same thing Trigger Much more abusively I must say You know that was my first meeting with old Runser Argee and I Plemp Mihul Chief of Physical Conditioning Women s Division cautioned sharply from the seat behind him Watch what you re doing you ass Confused Doctor Plemponi turned to look at her The aircar dropped the last four feet to a jolting landing Mihul groaned Plemponi apologized Trigger walked over to them Does he do that often she asked interestedly Every other time Mihul asserted She was a tall lean muscular slab of a woman

none	none	She gave Trigger a wink behind Plemponi s back We keep the chiropractors on stand by duty when we go riding with Plemp Now then Now then Doctor Plemponi said You distracted my attention for a moment that s all Now Trigger the reason we re here is that Mihul told me at our prebreakfast conference you weren t entirely happy at the good old Colonial School So climb in if you don t have much else to do and we ll run up to the office and discuss it He opened the door for her Much else to do Trigger gave him a look All right Doctor We ll run up and discuss it She went back for her sun hat climbed in closed the door and sat down beside him shoving the holstered Denton forward on her thigh Plemponi eyed the gun dubiously Brushing up in case there s another grabber raid he inquired He reached out for the guide stick Trigger shook her head Just working off hostility I guess She waited till he had lifted the car off the ground in a reckless swoop That business yesterday it really was a grabber raid We re almost sure it was Mihul said behind her though I did hear some talk they might have been after those two top secret plasmoids in your Project That s not

none	none	Trigger remarked The raiders were a half mile away from where they should have come down if the plasmoids were what they wanted And from what I saw of them they weren t nearly a big enough gang for a job of that kind I thought so too Mihul said They were topflight professionals in any case I got a glimpse of some of their equipment Knockout guns foggers and that was a fast car Very fast car Trigger agreed It s what made me suspicious when I first saw them come in They also said Mihul had a high speed interplanetary hopper waiting for them in the hills Two more men in it The cops caught them too She added They were grabbers all right Anything to indicate whom they were after Trigger asked No Mihul said Too many possibilities Twenty or more of the students in that area at the time had important enough connections to class as grabber bait The cops won t talk except to admit they were tipped off about the raid Which was obvious The way they popped up out of nowhere and closed in on those boys was a beautiful sight to see I Trigger admitted didn t see it When that car homed in I yelled a warning to the nearest bunch of students and dropped flat behind a rock By the time I risked a look the cops had them You showed very good sense Plemponi told her earnestly I hope they burn those thugs Grabbing s a filthy business That large object coming straight at you Mihul observed calmly is another aircar In this lane it has the right of way You do not have the right of way Got all that Plemp Are you sure Doctor Plemponi asked her bewilderedly Confound it I shall blow my siren He did Trigger winced There Plemponi said triumphantly as the other driver veered off in fright Trigger told herself to relax Aircars were so nearly accident proof that even Plemponi couldn t do more than snarl up traffic in one Have there been other raids in the school area since I left she asked as he shot up out of the quadrangle and turned toward the balcony of his office That was just under four years ago wasn t it Mihul said No you were still with us when we had the last one Six years back Remember Trigger did Two students had been picked up on that occasion sons of some Federation official The grabbers had made a clean getaway and it had been several months later before she heard the boys had been redeemed safely Plemponi descended to a teetery but gentle landing on the office balcony He gave Trigger a self satisfied look See he said tersely Let s go in ladies Had breakfast yet Trigger Trigger had finished breakfast a half hour earlier but she accepted a cup of coffee Mihul all athlete declined She went over to Plemponi s desk and stood leaning against it arms folded across her chest calm blue eyes fixed thoughtfully on Trigger With her lithe length of body Mihul sometimes reminded Trigger of a ferret but the tanned face was a pleasant one and there was humor around the mouth Even in Trigger s pregraduate days she and Mihul had been good friends Doctor Plemponi removed a crammed breakfast tray from a wall chef took a chair across from Trigger sat down with the tray on his knees excused himself and began to eat and talk simultaneously Before we go into that very reasonable complaint you made to Mihul yesterday he said I wish you d let me point out a few things Trigger nodded Please do You Trigger Plemponi told her are an honored guest here at the Colonial School You re the daughter of our late friend and colleague Runser Argee You were one of our star pupils not just as a small arms medallist either And now you re the secretary and assistant of the famous Precolonial Commissioner Holati Tate which makes you almost a participant in what may well turn out to be the greatest scientific event of the century I m referring of course Plemponi added to Tate s discovery of the Old Galactic plasmoids Of course agreed Trigger And what is all this leading up to Plemp He waved a piece of toast at her No Don t interrupt I still have to point out that because of the exceptional managerial abilities you revealed under Tate you ve been sent here on detached duty for the Precolonial Department to aid the Commissioner and Professor Mantelish in the University League s Plasmoid Project That means you re a pretty important person Trigger Mantelish for all his idiosyncrasies is undoubtedly the greatest living biologist in the League And the Plasmoid Project here at the school is without question the League s most important current undertaking So I ve been told said Trigger That s why I want to find out what s gone haywire with it In a moment Plemponi said In a moment He located his napkin wiped his lips carefully Now I ve mentioned all this simply to make it very very clear that we ll do anything we can to keep you satisfied We re delighted to have you with us We are honored He beamed at her Right Trigger smiled If you say so And thanks very much for all the lovely compliments Doctor But now let s get down to business Plemponi glanced over at Mihul and looked evasive That being he asked You know Trigger said But I ll put it into specific questions if you like Where s Commissioner Tate I don t know Where is Mantelish He shook his head I don t know that either He began to look unhappy Oh said Trigger Who does know then I m not allowed to tell you Doctor Plemponi said firmly Trigger raised an eyebrow Why not Federation security Plemponi said frowning He added I wasn t supposed to tell you that either but what could I do Federation security Because of the plasmoids

none	none	Well I d I don t know Trigger sighed Is it just me you re not supposed to tell these things to No no no Plemponi said hastily Nobody I m not supposed to admit to anyone that I know anything of the whereabouts of Holati Tate or Professor Mantelish Fibber Trigger said quietly So you know Plemponi looked appealingly at Mihul She was grinning My lips are sealed Trigger I can t help it Please believe me Let me sum it up then Trigger said tapping the arm of her chair with a finger tip Eight weeks ago I get pulled off my job in the Manon System and sent here to arrange the organizational details of this Plasmoid Project The only reason I took on the job as a temporary assignment was that Commissioner Tate convinced me it was important to him to have me do it I even let him talk me into doing it under the assumed name of Ruya Farn and she reached up and touched the side of her head and to dye my hair For no sane reason that I could discover He said the U League had requested it Doctor Plemponi coughed Well you know Trigger how sensitive the League is to personal notoriety The eyebrow went up again Notoriety Not in the wrong sense Plemponi said hastily But your name has become much more widely known than you may believe The news viewers mentioned you regularly in their reports on Harvest Moon and the Commissioner Didn t they Mihul Mihul nodded You made good copy kid We saw you in the solidopics any number of times Well maybe Trigger said The cloak and dagger touches still don t make much sense to me But let s forget them and go on When we get here I manage to see Mantelish just once to try to find out what his requirements will be He s pretty vague about them Commissioner Tate is in and out of the Project usually out He s also turned pretty vague About everything Three weeks ago today I m told he s gone Nobody here can or will tell me where he s gone or how he can be contacted The same thing in the Maccadon Precol office Same thing at the Evalee Home office Same thing at the U League any office Then I try to contact Mantelish I m informed he s with Tate The two of them have left word I m to carry on She spread her hands Carry on with what I ve done all I can do until I get further instructions from the people supposedly directing this supposedly very urgent and important project Mantelish doesn t even seem to have a second in command Plemponi nodded I was told he hadn t selected his Project assistants yet Except said Trigger for that little flock of Junior Scientists who keep themselves locked in with the plasmoids They know less than nothing and would be too scared to tell me that if I asked them Plemponi looked confused for a moment The last sentence He checked himself Well let s not quibble Go on Trigger said That s it Holati didn t need me on this job to begin with There s nothing involved about the organizational aspects Unless something begins to happen and rather soon there s no excuse for me to stay here Couldn t you Plemponi suggested regard this as a kind of well earned little vacation I ve tried to regard it as that Holati impressed on me that one of us had to remain in the area of the Project at all times so I haven t even been able to leave the school grounds I ve caught up with my reading and Mihul has put me through two of her tune up commando courses But the point is that I m not on vacation I don t believe Precol would feel that any of my present activities come under the heading of detached duty work There was a short silence Plemponi stared down at his empty tray said Excuse me got up and walked over to the wall chef with the tray Wrong slot Trigger told him He looked back Eh You want to put it in the disposal don t you Thanks Plemponi said absently Always doing that Confusing them He dropped the tray where it belonged shoved his hands into the chef s cleaning recess and waved them around then came back still looking absent minded and stopped before Trigger s chair He studied her face for a moment Commissioner Tate gave me a message for you he said suddenly Trigger s eyes narrowed slightly When The day after he left Plemponi lifted a hand Now wait You ll see how it was He called in and said and I quote Plemp you don t stand much of a chance at keeping secrets from Trigger so I ll give you no unnecessary secrets to keep If this business we re on won t let us get back to the Project in the next couple of weeks she ll get mighty restless When she starts to complain but no earlier just tell her there are reasons why I can t contact her at present or let her know what I m doing and that I will contact her as soon as I possibly can End of quote That was all asked Trigger Yes He didn t say a thing about how long this situation might continue No I ve given you the message word for word My memory is excellent Trigger So it could be more weeks Or months Yes Possibly I imagine Plemponi had begun to perspire Plemp said Trigger will you give Holati a message from me Gladly said Plemponi What oh oh He flushed Right said Trigger You can contact him I thought so Doctor Plemponi looked reproachful That was unfair Trigger You re quick witted Trigger shrugged I can t see any justification for all this mystery that s all She stood up Anyway here s the message Tell him that unless somebody rather promptly gives me a good sane reason for hanging around here I ll ask Precol to transfer me back to the Manon job Plemponi tut tutted gloomily Trigger he said I ll do my best about the message But otherwise She smiled nicely at him I know she said your lips are sealed Sorry if I ve disturbed you Plemp But I m just a Precol employee after all If I m to waste their time I d like to know at least why it s necessary Plemponi watched her walk out of the room and off down the adjoining hall In his face consternation struggled with approval Lovely little figure hasn t she he said to Mihul He made vague curving motions in the air with one hand more or less opposing ones with the other That sort of an up and sideways lilt when she walks Uh huh said Mihul Old goats Eh said Doctor Plemponi I overheard you discussing Trigger s lilt with Mantelish Plemponi sat down at his desk You shouldn t eavesdrop Mihul he said severely I d better get that message promptly to Tate I suppose She meant what she said don t you think Every bit of it said Mihul Tate warned me she might get very difficult about this time She s too conscientious I feel She also said Mihul has a boy friend in the Manon System They ve been palsy ever since they went through the school here together Ought to get married then Plemponi said He shuddered My blood runs cold every time I think of how close those grabbers got to her yesterday Mihul shrugged Relax They never had a chance The characters Tate has guarding her are the fastest moving squad I ever saw go into action That Plemponi said reflectively doesn t sound much like our Maccadon police I don t think they are Imported talent of some kind for my money Anyway if someone wants to pick up Trigger Argee here he d better come in with a battleship Plemponi glanced nervously across the balcony at the cloudless blue sky about the quadrangle The impression I got from Holati Tate he said is that somebody might two There was a tube portal at the end of the hall outside Doctor Plemponi s office Mihul stepped into the portal punched the number of her personal quarters waited till the overhead light flashed green a few seconds later and stepped out into another hall seventeen floors below Plemponi s office and a little over a mile and a half away from it Mihul crossed the hall went into her apartment locked the door behind her and punched a shield button In her bedroom she opened a wall safe and swung out a high powered transmitter She switched the transmitter to active Yes said a voice Mihul here said Mihul Quillan or the Commissioner Quillan here the transmitter said a few seconds later in a different voice a deep male one Go ahead doll Mihul grunted I m calling she said because I feel strongly that you boys had better take some immediate action in the Argee matter Oh said the voice What kind of action How the devil would I know I m just telling you I can t be responsible for her here much longer Has something happened Quillan asked quickly If you mean has somebody taken another swing at her no But she s all wound up to start swinging herself She isn t going to do much waiting either Quillan said thoughtfully Hasn t she been that way for quite a while Not like she s been the last few days Mihul hesitated Would it be against security if you told me whether something has happened to her Happened to her Quillan repeated cautiously To her mind What makes you think so Mihul frowned at the transmitter Trigger always had a temper she said She was always obstinate She was always an individualist and ready to fight for her own rights and anyone else s But she used to show good sense She s got one of the highest I Q s we ever processed through this place The way she s acting now doesn t look too rational How would she have acted earlier Quillan asked Mihul considered She would have been very annoyed with Commissioner Tate she said I don t blame her for that I d be too in the circumstances When he got back she d have wanted a reasonable explanation for what has been going on If she didn t get one that satisfied her she d have quit But she would have waited till he got back Why not after all You don t think she s going to wait now I do not Mihul said She s forwarded him a kind of ultimatum through Plemponi Communicate or else in effect Frankly I wouldn t care to guarantee she ll stay around to hear the answer Hm What do you expect she ll do Take off Mihul said One way or the other Ungh Quillan said disgustedly You make it sound like the chick s got built in space drives You can stop her can t you Certainly I can stop her Mihul said If I can lock her in her room and sit on her to make sure she doesn t leave by the window But unobtrusively You re the one who stressed she isn t to know she s being watched True Quillan said promptly I spoke like a loon Mihul True Major Quillan sir said Mihul Now try again The transmitter was silent a few seconds Could you guarantee her for three days he asked I could not said Mihul I couldn t guarantee her another three hours As bad as that Yes said Mihul As bad as that She was controlling herself with Plemponi But I ve been observing her in the physical workouts I ve fed it to her as heavy as I could but there s a limit to what you can do that way She s kept herself in very good shape One of the best I ve been told said Quillan Condition I meant said Mihul Anyway she s trained down fine right now Any more of it would just make her edgier You know how it goes Uh huh he said Fighter nerves Same deal Mihul agreed There was a short pause How about slapping a guard on all Colonial school exits he suggested Can you send me an army No Then forget it She was a student here remember Last year a bunch of our students smuggled the stuffed restructured mastodon out and left it in the back garden of the mayor of Ceyce just for laughs Too many exits And Trigger was a trickier monkey than most that way when she felt like it She ll fade out of here whenever she wants to It s those damn tube portal systems said Quillan with feeling Most gruesome invention that ever hit the tailing profession He sighed You win Mihul The Commissioner isn t in at the moment But whether he gets in or not I ll have someone over today to pick her up Matter of fact I ll come along myself Good for you boy Mihul said relievedly Did you get anything out of yesterday s grabbers A little Get her don t harm her were their instructions Otherwise it was like with those other slobs A hole in the head where the real info should be But at least we know for sure now that someone is specifically after Argee The price was kind of interesting What was it Flat half million credits Mihul whistled Poor Trigger Well nobody s very likely to earn the money I hope not She s a good kid All right Major Signing off now Hold on a minute said Quillan You asked a while ago if the girl had gone ta ta So I did Mihul said surprised You didn t say I figured it was against security It

none	none	is Quillan admitted Everything seems to be right now I ve given up trying to keep up with that Anyway I don t know that she has Neither does the Commissioner But he s worried And Argee has a date she doesn t know about with the Psychology Service four days from now The eggheads Mihul was startled What do they want with her You know Quillan remarked reflectively that s odd They didn t think to tell me Why are you letting me know Mihul asked You ll find out doll he said The U League guard leaning against the wall opposite the portal snapped to attention as it opened Trigger stepped out He gave her a fine flourish of a salute Good morning Miss Farn Morning Trigger said She flashed him a smile Did the mail get in Just twenty minutes ago She nodded smiled again and walked past him to her office She always got along fine with cops of almost any description and these League boys were extraordinarily pleasant and polite They were also she d noticed a remarkably muscled group She locked the office door behind her part of the Plasmoid Project s elaborate security precautions went over to her mail file and found it empty Which meant that whatever had come in was purely routine and already being handled by her skeleton office staff Later in the day she might get a chance to scrawl Ruya Farn s signature on a few dozen letters and checks Big job Trigger sat down at her desk She brooded there a minute or two tapping her teeth with her thumbnail The Honorable Precolonial Commissioner Tate whatever else might be said of him undoubtedly was one of the brainiest little characters she d ever come across He probably saw some quite valid reason for keeping her here isolated and uninformed The question was what the reason could be Security Trigger wrinkled her nose Security didn t mean a thing Everybody and everything associated with the Old Galactic plasmoids had been wrapped up in Federation security measures since the day the plasmoid discovery was announced And she d been in the middle of the operations concerning them right along Why should Holati Tate have turned secretive on her now When even blabby old Plemponi could contact him It was more than a little annoying Trigger shrugged reached into a desk drawer and took out a small solidopic She set it on the desk and regarded it moodily The face of an almost improbably handsome young man looked back at her Startling dark blue eyes a strong chin curly brown hair There was a gleam of white teeth behind the quick warm smile which always awoke a responsive glow in her She and Brule Inger had been the nearest thing to engaged for the last two and a half years ever since Precol sent them out together to its project on Manon Planet They d been dating before that while they were both still attending the Colonial School But now she was here perhaps stuck here indefinitely unless she did something about it and Brule was on Manon Planet By the very fastest subspace ships the Manon System was a good nine days away For the standard Grand Commerce express freighter or the ordinary liner it was a solid two months run Manon was a long way away It was almost a month since she d even heard from Brule She could make up another personal tape to him today if she felt like it He would get it in fourteen days or so via a Federation packet But she d already sent him three without reply Brule wasn t at all good at long distance love making and she didn t blame him much She was a little awkward herself when it came to feeding her personal feelings into a tape And because of security again there was very little else she could feed into it She couldn t even let Brule know just where she was She put the solido back in its drawer reached for one of the bank of buttons on the right side of the desk and pushed it down A desk panel slid up vertically in front of her disclosing a news viewer switched to the index of current headlines Trigger glanced over the headlines while a few items dissolved slowly here and there and were replaced by more recent developments Under the Science heading a great deal seemed to be going on as usual in connection with plasmoid experiments around the Hub She dialed in the heading skimmed through the first item that appeared Essentially it was a summary of reports on Hubwide rumors that nobody could claim any worthwhile progress in determining what made the Old Galactic plasmoids tick Which so far as Trigger knew was quite true Other rumors rather unpleasant ones were that the five hundred or so scientific groups to whom individual plasmoids had been issued by the Federation s University League actually had gained important information but were keeping it to themselves The summary plowed through a few of the learned opinions and counteropinions most recently obtained then boiled them down to the statement that a plasmoid might be compared to an engine which appeared to lack nothing but an energy source Or perhaps more correctly assuming it might have an as yet unidentified energy source a starter button One group claimed to have virtually duplicated the plasmoid loaned to it by the Federation producing a biochemical structure distinguishable from the Old Galactic model only by the fact that it had quite predictably fallen apart within hours But plasmoids didn t fall apart The specimens undergoing study had shown no signs of deterioration A few still absorbed nourishment from time to time some had been observed to move slightly But none could be induced to operate It was all very puzzling It was very puzzling Trigger conceded Back in the Manon System when they had been discovered the plasmoids were operating with high efficiency on the protein collecting station which the mysterious Old Galactics appeared to have abandoned or forgotten about some hundreds of centuries ago It was only when humans entered the base and switched off its mechanical operations that the plasmoids stopped working and then when the switches which appeared to have kept them going were expectantly closed again they had stayed stopped Personally Trigger couldn t have cared less if they never did move It was nice that old Holati Tate had made an almost indecently vast fortune out of his first discovery rights to the things because she was really very fond of the Commissioner when he wasn t being irritating But in some obscure way she found the plasmoids themselves and the idea of unlimited plastic life which they embodied rather appalling However she was in a minority there Practically everybody else seemed to feel that plasmoids were the biggest improvement since the creation of Eve She switched the viewer presently to its local news setting and dialed in the Manon System s reference number Keeping tab on what was going on out there had become a private little ritual of late Occasionally she even picked up references to Brule Inger who functioned nowadays as Precol s official greeter and contact man in the system He was very popular with the numerous important Hub citizens who made the long run out to the Manon some bent on getting a firsthand view of the marvels of Old Galactic science and a great many more bent on getting an early stake in the development of Manon Planet which was rapidly approaching the point where its status would shift from Precol Project to Federation Territory opening it to all qualified comers Today there was no news about Brule Grand Commerce had opened its first business and recreation center on Manon not ten miles from the Precol Headquarters dome where Trigger recently had been working The subspace net which was being installed about the Old Galactic base was very nearly completed The permanent Hub population on Manon Planet had just passed the forty three thousand mark There had been Trigger recalled a trifle nostalgically barely eight hundred Precol employees and not another human being on that world in the days before Holati Tate announced his discovery She was just letting the viewer panel slide back into the desk when the office ComWeb gave forth with a musical ping She switched it on Hi Rak she said cheerily Anything new The bony faced young man looking out at her wore the lusterless black uniform of a U League Junior Scientist His expression was worried He said I believe there is Miss Farn Rak was the group leader of the thirty four Junior Scientists the League had installed in the Project Like all the Juniors he took his duties very seriously Unfortunately it s nothing I can discuss over a communicator Would it be possible for you to come over and meet with us during the day That Trigger stated was a ridiculous question Rak Want me over right now He grinned Thanks Miss Farn In twenty minutes then I ll get my advisory committee together and we can meet in the little conference room off the Exhibition Hall Trigger nodded I ll be wandering around the Hall Just send a guard out to get me when you re ready three She switched off the ComWeb and stood up Rak and his group were stuck with the Plasmoid Project a lot more solidly than she was They d been established here confined to their own wing of the Project area when she came in from Manon with the Commissioner Until the present security rulings were relaxed which might not be for another two years they would remain on the project Trigger felt a little sorry for them though the Junior Scientists didn t seem to mind the setup Dedication stood out all over them Since about half were young women one could assume that at any rate they weren t condemned to a completely monastic existence A couple of workmen were guiding a dozen big cleaning robots around the Plasmoid Exhibition Hall which wouldn t be open to students or visitors for another few hours Trigger strolled across the floor of the huge area toward a couple of exhibits that hadn t been there the last time she d come through Life sized replicas of two O G Plasmoids Numbers fourteen thirty two and fourteen thirty three she discovered She regarded the waxy looking lumpish partially translucent forms with some distaste She d been all over the Old Galactic Station itself and might have stood close enough to the originals of these models to touch them Not that she would have She glanced at her watch walked around a scale model of Harvest Moon the O G station which occupied the center of the Hall and went on among the exhibits There were views taken on Manon Planet in one alcove mainly of Manon s aerial plankton belt and of the giant plasmoids called Harvesters which had moved about the belt methodically engulfing its clouds of living matter A whale sized replica of a Harvester dominated one end of the Hall a giant dark green sausage in external appearance though with some extremely fancy internal arrangements Miss Farn She turned A League cop standing at the entrance of a hallway thirty feet away pitched her the old flourish and followed it up with a bow Excellent manners these guard boys had Trigger gave him a smile Coming she said Junior Scientist Rak and his advisory committee two other young men and a young woman were waiting in the conference room for her They all stood up when she came in This room marked the border of their territory they would have violated several League rules by venturing out into the hall through which Trigger had entered And that would have been unthinkable Rak did the talking as on the previous occasions when Trigger had met with this group The advisory committee simply sat there and watched him As far as Trigger could figure it they were present at these sessions only to check Rak if it looked as if he were about to commit some ghastly indiscretion We were wondering Miss Farn Rak said questioningly whether you have the authority to requisition additional University League guards for the Plasmoid Project Trigger shook her head I ve got no authority of any kind that I know of as far as the League is concerned No doubt Professor Mantelish could arrange it for you Rak nodded Is it possible for you to contact Professor Mantelish No Trigger said She smiled Is it possible for you to contact him Rak glanced around his committee as if looking for approval then said No it isn t As a matter of fact Miss Farn we ve been isolated here in the most curious fashion for the past few weeks So have I said Miss Farn Rak looked startled Oh he said We were hoping you would be willing to give us a little information I would Trigger assured him if I had any to give I don t unfortunately She considered Why do you feel additional League guards are required We heard Rak remarked cautiously that there were raiders in the Colonial School area yesterday Grabbers Trigger said They wouldn t bother you Your section of the project is supposed to be raidproof anyway Rak glanced at his companions again and apparently received some undetectable sign of consent Miss Farn as you know our group has been entrusted with the care of two League plasmoids here Are you aware that six of the plasmoids which were distributed to responsible laboratories throughout the Hub have been lost to unknown raiders She was startled No I didn t know that I heard there d been some unsuccessful attempts to steal distributed plasmoids These six attempts Rak said primly were completely successful One must assume that the victimized laboratories also had been regarded as raidproof Trigger admitted it was a reasonable assumption There is another matter Rak went on When we arrived here we understood Doctor Gess Fayle was to bring Plasmoid Unit one hundred twelve one hundred thirteen to this project It seems possible that Doctor Fayle s failure to appear indicates that League Headquarters does not consider the project a sufficiently safe place for one hundred twelve one hundred thirteen Why don t you ask Headquarters Trigger suggested They stirred nervously That would be a violation of the Principle of the Chain of Command Miss Farn Rak explained Oh she said The Juniors were overdisciplined all right Is that one hundred twelve one hundred thirteen such a particularly important item If Doctor Fayle is in personal charge of it Rak said carefully I would say yes Recalling her meetings with Doctor Gess Fayle in the Manon System Trigger silently agreed He was one of the U League s big shots a political scientist who had got himself appointed as Mantelish s chief assistant when that eminent biologist was first sent to Manon to take over League operations there Trigger had disliked Fayle on sight and hadn t changed her mind on closer acquaintance I remember that one hundred twelve one hundred thirteen unit now she said suddenly Big ugly thing well that describes a lot of them doesn t it Rak and the others looked quietly affronted In a moment Trigger realized one of them was going to go into a lecture on functional esthetics unless she could head them off and she d already heard quite enough about functional esthetics in connection with the plasmoids Now one hundred thirteen she hurried on is a very small plasmoid she held her hands fifteen inches or so apart like that and it s attached to the big one Correct Rak nodded a little stiffly Essentially correct Miss Farn Well Trigger said I can t blame you for worrying a bit How about your Guard Captain Isn t it all right to ask him about reinforcements Rak pursed his lips Yes And I did This morning Before I called you What did he say Rak grimaced unhappily He implied Miss Farn that his present guard complement could handle any emergency How would he know That s his job Trigger pointed out gently The Juniors did look badly worried He didn t have any helpful ideas None said Rak He said that if someone wanted to put up the money to hire a battle squad of Special Federation Police he could always find some use for them But that s hopeless of course Trigger straightened up She reached out and poked Rak s bony chest with a finger tip You know something she said It s not The four faces lit up together The fact is Trigger went on that I m handling the Project budget until someone shows up to take over So I think I ll just buy you that Federation battle squad Rak I ll get on it right away She stood up The Juniors bounced automatically out of their chairs You go tell your guard Captain she instructed them from the hall door there ll be a squad showing up in time for dinner tonight The Federation Police Office in Ceyce informed Trigger that a Class A Battle Squad twenty trained men with full equipment would report for two months duty at the Colonial School during the afternoon She made them out a check and gave it the Ruya Farn signature via telewriter The figure on that check was going to cause some U League auditor s eyebrows to fly off the top of his head one of these days but if the League insisted on remaining aloof to the problems of its Plasmoid Project a little financial anguish was the least it could expect in return Trigger felt quite cheerful for a while Then she had a call from Precol s Maccadon office She was requested to stand by while a personal interstellar transmission was switched to her ComWeb It looked like her day She hummed softly waiting She knew just one individual affluent enough to be able to afford personal interstellar conversations and that was Commissioner Tate Fast work Plemp she thought approvingly But it was Brule Inger s face that flashed into view on the ComWeb Trigger s heart jumped Her breath caught in her throat Brule she yelled then She shot up out of her chair Where are you calling from Brule s eyes crinkled around the edges He gave her the smile The good old smile Unfortunately darling I m still in the Manon System He blinked What happened to your hair Manon said Trigger She started to settle back weak with disappointment Then she shot up again Brule Lunatic You re blowing a month s salary a minute on this I love you Switch off fast Brule threw back his head and laughed You haven t changed much in two months anyway Don t worry It s for free I m calling from the yacht of a friend Some friend Trigger said startled It isn t costing her anything either She had to transmit to the Hub today anyway Asked me if I d like to take over the last few minutes of contact and see if I could locate you Been missing me properly Trigger Trigger smiled Very properly Well that was lovely of her Someone I know Hardly said Brule Nelauk arrived a week or so after you left Nelauk Pluly Her father s the Pluly Lines Let s talk about you What s the silver haired idea Got talked into it she told him It s all the rage again right now He surveyed her critically I like you better as a redhead So do I Oops Trigger thought Security girl So I ll change back tonight she went on quickly Golly Brule It s nice to see that homely old mug again Be a lot nicer when it won t have to be over a transmitter Right you are When are you coming back She shook her head glumly Don t know He was silent a moment I ve had to take a bit of chitchat now and then he remarked about you and old Tate vanishing together Trigger felt herself coloring So don t take it she said shortly Just pop them one The smile returned Wouldn t be gentlemanly to pop a lady would it She smiled back So stay away from the ladies Somehow Brule and Holati Tate never had worked up a really warm regard for each other It had caused a little trouble before Okay to tell me where you are he asked Afraid not Brule Precol Home Office apparently knows he pointed out Apparently Trigger admitted They looked at each other a moment then Brule grinned Well keep your little secret he said All I really want to know is when you re getting back Very soon I hope Brule Trigger said unhappily Then there was a sudden burst of sound from the ComWeb gusts of laughing chattering voices a faint wash of music Brule glanced aside Party going on he explained And here comes Nelauk She wanted to say hello to you A dozen feet behind him a figure strolled gracefully into view on the screen and came forward A slender girl with high piled violet hair and eyes that very nearly matched the hair s tint She was dressed in something resembling a dozen blossoms blossoms which in Trigger s opinion had been rather carelessly scattered But presumably it was a very elegant party costume She was quite young certainly not yet twenty Brule laid a brotherly hand on a powdered shoulder Meet Trigger Nelauk Nelauk murmured it was indeed an honor one she had long looked forward to The violet eyes blinked sleepily at Trigger Trigger gave her a great big smile Thanks so much for arranging for the call I ve been wondering how Brule was doing Wrong thing to say probably she thought She was right Nelauk reached for it with no effort Oh he s doing wonderfully she assured Trigger without expression I m keeping an eye on him And this small favor it was the very least I could do for Brule For you too of course Trigger dear Trigger held the smile firmly Thanks so much again she said Nelauk nodded smiled back and drifted gracefully off the screen Brule blew Trigger a kiss They ll be cutting contact now See you very very soon Trigger I hope His image vanished before she could answer She paced her office muttering softly She went over to the ComWeb once reached out toward it and drew her hand back again Better think this over It might not be an emergency Brule didn t exactly chase women He let them chase him now and then Long before she left Manon Trigger had discovered without much surprise that the wives daughters and girl friends of visiting Hub tycoons were as susceptible to the Inger charm as any Precol clerks The main difference was that they were a lot more direct about showing it It hadn t really worried her In fact she found Brule s slightly startled reports of maneuverings of various amorous Hub ladies very entertaining But she had put in a little worrying about something else Brule s susceptibility seemed to be more to the overwhelming mass display of wealth with which he was suddenly in almost constant contact Many of the yachts he went flitting around among as Precol s representative were elaborate spacegoing palaces and it appeared Brule Inger was soon regarded as a highly welcome guest on most of them Brule talked about that a little too much Trigger resumed her pacing Little Nelauk mightn t be twenty yet but she d flipped out a challenge just now with all the languid confidence of a veteran campaigner Which Trigger thought cattily little Nelauk undoubtedly was And a girl she added cattily whose father represented the Pluly Lines did have some slight reason for confidence Miaow she reproved herself Nelauk to be honest about it was also a dish But if she happened to be serious about Brule the dish Brule might be tempted by was said Pluly Lines Trigger went over to the window and looked down at the exercise quadrangle forty floors below If he s that much of a meathead she thought He could be that much of a meathead He was also Brule She went back to her desk and sat down She looked at the ComWeb A girl had a right to consider her own interests And there was the completely gruesome possibility now that Holati Tate might call in at any moment give her an entirely reasonable satisfactory valid convincing explanation for everything that had happened lately and then show her why it would be absolutely necessary for her to stay here a while longer If it was a choice between inconveniencing Holati Tate and losing that meathead Brule Trigger switched on the ComWeb four The head of the personnel department of Precol s Maccadon office said You don t want me Argee That s not my jurisdiction I ll connect you with Undersecretary Rozan Trigger blinked Under she began But he d already cut off She stared at the ComWeb feeling a little shaken All she d done was to say she wanted to apply for a transfer Undersecretary Rozan was one of Precol s Big Four For a moment Trigger had an uncanny notion Some strange madness was spreading insidiously through the Hub She shook the thought off A businesslike blonde showed up in the screen She might be about thirty five She smiled a small cold smile Rozan she said You re Trigger Argee I know about you What s the trouble Trigger looked at her wondering No trouble she said Personnel just routed me through to you They ve been instructed to do so said Rozan Go ahead I m on detached duty at the moment I know I d like to apply for a transfer back to my previous job The Manon System That s your privilege said Rozan She half turned swung a telewriter forward and snapped it into her ComWeb She glanced out at Trigger s desk Your writer s connected I see We ll want thumbprint and signature She slid a form into her telewriter shifted it twice as Trigger deposited thumbprint and signature and drew it out The application will be processed promptly Argee Good day Not a gabby type that Rozan If not gabby the Precol blonde was a woman of her word Trigger had just started lunch when the office mail tube receiver tinkled brightly at her She reached in took out a flat plastic carrier snapped it open The paper that unfolded itself in her hand was her retransfer application At the bottom of the form was stamped Application Denied followed by the signature of the Secretary of the Department of Precolonization Home Office Evalee Trigger s gaze shifted incredulously from the signature to the two words and back They d taken the trouble to get that signature transmitted from Evalee just to make it clear that there were no heads left to be gone over in the matter Precol was not transferring her back to Manon That was final Then she realized that there was a second sheet attached to the application form On it in handwriting were a few more words In accordance with the instructions of Commissioner Tate And a signature Rozan And three final words Destroy this note Trigger crumpled up the application in one hand Her other hand darted to the ComWeb Then she checked herself To fire an as of now resignation back at Precol had been the immediate impulse But something some vague warning chill was saying it might be a very poor impulse to follow She sat back to think it over It was very probable that Undersecretary Rozan disliked Holati Tate intensely A lot of the Home Office big shots disliked Holati Tate He d stamped on their toes more than once very justifiably but he d stamped The Home Office wouldn t go an inch out of its way to do something just because Commissioner Tate happened to want it done So somebody else was backing up Commissioner Tate s instructions Trigger shook her head helplessly The only somebody else who could give instructions to the Precolonization Department was the Council of the Federation And how could the Federation possibly care what Trigger Argee was doing She made a small incredulous noise in her throat Then she sat there a while feeling frightened The fright didn t really wear off but it settled down slowly inside her Up on the surface she began to think again Assume it s so she instructed herself It made no sense but everything else made even less sense Just assume it s so Set it up as a practical problem Don t worry about the why The problem became very simple then She wanted to go to Manon The Federation or something else something quite unthinkable at the moment but comparable to the Federation in power and influence wanted to keep her here She uncrumpled the application detached Rozan s note tore up the note and dropped its shreds into the wall disposal That obligation was cancelled She didn t have any other obligations She d liked Holati Tate When all this was cleared up she might find she still liked him At the moment she didn t owe him a thing Now Assume they hadn t just blocked the obvious route to Manon They couldn t block all routes to everywhere that was impossible But they could very well be watching to see that she didn t simply get up and walk off And they might be very well prepared to take quite direct action to stop her from doing it She would Trigger decided leave the method she d use to get out of the Colonial School unobserved to the last That shouldn t present any serious difficulties Once she was outside what would she do Principally she had to buy transportation And that since she had no intention of spending a few months on the trip and since a private citizen didn t have the ghost of a chance at squeezing aboard a Federation packet on the Manon run was going to be expensive In fact it was likely to take the bulk of her savings Under the circumstances however expense wasn t important If Precol refused to give her back her job when she showed up on Manon a number of the industrial outfits preparing to move in as soon as the plant got its final clearance would be very happy to have her She d already turned down a dozen offers at considerably more than her present salary So she d get off the school grounds take a tube strip into downtown Ceyce step into a ComWeb booth and call Grand Commerce transportation for information on the earliest subspace runs to Manon She d reserve a berth on the first fast boat out In the name of let s see in the name of Birna Drellgannoth who had been a friend of hers when they were around the age of ten Since Manon was a Precol preserve she wouldn t have to meet the problem of precise personal identification such as one ran into when booking passage to some of the member worlds The ticket office would have her thumbprints then That was unavoidable But there were millions of thumbprints being deposited every hour of the day on Maccadon If somebody started checking for her by that method it should take them a good long while to sort out hers Next stop the Ceyce branch of the Bank of Maccadon And it was lucky she d done all her banking in Ceyce since she was a teen ager because she would have to present herself in person to draw out her savings She d better lose no time getting to the bank either It was one place where theoretical searchers could expect her to show up She could pay for her ship reservation at the bank Then to a store for some clothes and a suitcase for the trip And finally into some big middle class hotel where she would stay quietly until a few hours before the ship was due to take off That seemed to cover it It probably wasn t foolproof But trying to work out a foolproof plan would be a waste of time when she didn t know just what she was up against This should give her a running start a long one When should she leave Right now she decided Commissioner Tate presumably would be informed that she had applied for a transfer and that the transfer had been denied He knew her too well not to become suspicious if it looked as if she were just sitting there and taking it She got her secretary on the ComWeb I m thinking of leaving the office she said Anything for me to take care of first It was a safe question She d signed the day s mail and checks before lunch Not a thing Miss Farn Fine said Ruya Farn If anyone wants me in the next three or four hours I ll be either down in the main library or out at the lake And that would give somebody two rather extensive areas to look for her if and when they started to look along with the fact that for all anyone knew she might be anywhere between those two points A few minutes later Trigger sauntered humming blithely into her room and gave it a brief survey There were some personal odds and ends she would have liked to take with her but she could send for them from Manon The Denton however was coming along The little gun had a very precisely calibrated fast acting stunner attachment and old Runser Argee had instructed Trigger in its use with his customary thoroughness before he formally presented her with the gun She had never had occasion to turn the stunner on a human being but she d used it on game If this cloak and dagger business became too realistic she d already decided she would use it as needed She slipped the Denton into the side pocket of a lightweight rain robe draped the robe over her arm slung her purse beside it picked up the sun hat and left the room The Colonial School s kitchen area was on one of the underground levels Unless they d modified their guard system very considerably since Trigger had graduated that was the route by which she would leave As far as she could tell they hadn t modified anything The whole kitchen level looked so unchanged that she had a moment of nostalgia Groups of students went chattering along the hallways between the storerooms and the cooking and processing plants The big mess hall Trigger noticed in passing smelled as good as it always had Bells sounded the end of a period and a loudspeaker system began directing Class so and so to Room such and such Standing around were a few uniformed guards mainly for the purpose of helping out newcomers who had lost their direction She came out on the equally familiar big and brightly lit platform of the loading ramp Some sixty or seventy great cylindrical vans floated alongside the platform most of them disgorging their contents some still sealed Trigger walked unhurriedly down the ramp staying in the background observing the movements of two ramp guards and marking four vans which were empty and looked ready to go The driver of the farthest of the four empties stood in the back of his vehicle a few feet above the platform When Trigger came level with him he was studying her He was a big young man with tousled black hair and a rough and ready look He was grinning very faintly He knew the ways of Colonial School students Trigger raised her left hand a few inches three fingers up His grin widened He shook his head and raised both hands in a corresponding gesture Eight fingers Trigger frowned at him stopped and looked back along the row of vans Then left hand up again four fingers and thumb The driver made a circle with finger and thumb A deal for five Maccadon crowns Which was about standard fare for unauthorized passage out of the school Trigger wandered on to the end of the platform turned and came back still unhurriedly but now close to the edge of the ramp Down the line another van slammed open in back and a stream of crates swooped out riding a gravity beam from the roof toward a waiting storeroom carrier The guard closest to Trigger turned to watch the process Trigger took six quick steps and reached her driver He put down a hand to help her step up She slipped the five crown piece into his palm Up front he whispered hoarsely Next to the driver s seat and keep down How far Nearest tube line He grinned again and nodded Can do Twenty minutes later Trigger was in a downtown ComWeb booth There had been a minor modification in her plans and she d stopped off in a store a few doors away and picked up a carefully nondescript street dress and a scarf She changed into the dress now and bundled the school costume into a deposit box which she dispatched to Central Deposit with a one crown piece getting a numbered slip in return It had occurred to her that there was a chance otherwise of getting caught in a Colonial School roundup if it was brought to Doctor Plemponi s attention that there appeared to be considerably more students out on the town at the moment than could be properly overlooked Or even Trigger thought if somebody simply happened to have missed Trigger Argee She slipped the rain robe over her shoulders dropped a coin into the ComWeb and covered the silver blonde hair with the scarf The screen lit up She asked for Grand Commerce Transportation Waiting she realized suddenly that so far she was rather enjoying herself There had been a little argument with the van driver who it turned out had ideas of his own about modifying Trigger s plans a complication she d run into frequently in her school days too As usual it didn t develop into a very serious argument Truckers who dealt with the Colonial School knew or learned in one or two briefly horrid lessons that Mihul s commando trained charges were prone to ungirlish methods of discouragement when argued with too urgently The view screen switched on The transportation clerk s glance flicked over Trigger s street dress when she told him her destination His expression remained bland Yes the Dawn City was leaving Ceyce Port for the Manon System tomorrow evening Yes it was subspace express one of the newest and fastest in fact His eyes slipped over the dress again Also one of the most luxurious he might add There would be only two three hour stops in the Hub beyond Maccadon one each off Evalee and Garth Then a straight dive to Manon unless of course gravitic storm shifts forced the ship to surface temporarily Average time for the Dawn City on the run was eleven days the slowest trip so far had required sixteen But unfortunately madam there are only a very few cabins left and not very desirable ones I m afraid He looked apologetic There hasn t been a vacancy on the Manon run for the past three months I can stand it I imagine Trigger said How much for the cheapest The clerk cleared his throat gently and told her She couldn t help blinking though she was braced for it But it was more than she had counted on A great deal more It would leave her in fact with exactly one hundred and twenty six crowns out of her entire savings plus the coins she had in her purse Any extras she asked a little hoarsely He shrugged There s Traveler s Rest he said negligently Nine hundred for the three dive periods But Rest is optional of course Some passengers prefer the experience of staying awake during a subspace dive He smiled rather sadistically Trigger felt and added Till they ve lived through one of them that is Trigger nodded She d lived through quite a few of them She didn t like subspace particularly nobody did but except for an occasional touch of nausea or dizziness at the beginning of a dive it didn t bother her much Many people got hallucinations went into states of panic or just got very sick Anything else she asked Just the usual tips and things said the clerk He looked surprised Do you does madam wish to make the reservation Madam does Trigger told him coldly How long will it hold It would be good up to an hour before take off time she learned If not claimed then it would be filled from the last minute waiting list She left the booth thoughtfully At least the Dawn City would be leaving in less than twenty six hours She wouldn t have to spend much of her remaining capital before she got off Maccadon She d skip meals she decided Except breakfast next morning which would be covered by her hotel room fee And it wasn t going to be any middle class hotel There was no one obviously waiting for her at the Bank of Maccadon In fact since that venerable institution covered a city block with entrances running up from the street level to the fifty eighth floor a small army would have been needed to make sure of spotting her She had to identify herself to get into the vaults but there was a solution to that Seven years ago when Runser Argee died suddenly and she had to get his property and records straightened out a gray haired little vault attendant with whom she dealt with had taken a fatherly interest in her When she saw he was still on the job Trigger was certain the matter would go off all right It did He didn t take a really close look at her until she shoved her signature and Federation identification in front of him Then his head bobbed up briskly His eyes lit up Trigger He bounced out of his chair His right hand shot out Good to see you again I ve been hearing about you They shook hands She put a finger to her lips I m here incog she cautioned in a low voice Can you handle this quietly The faded blue eyes widened slightly but he asked no questions Trigger Argee s name was known rather widely as a matter of fact particularly on her home world And as he remembered Trigger she wasn t a girl who d go look for a spotlight to stand in He nodded Sure can He glanced suspiciously at the nearest customers then looked down at what Trigger had written He frowned You drawing out everything Not leaving Ceyce for good are you No Trigger said I ll be back This is just a temporary emergency That was all the explaining she had to do Four minutes later she had her money Three minutes after that she had paid for the Dawn City reservation as Birna Drellgannoth and deposited her thumbprints with the ticket office Counting what was left she found it came to just under a hundred and thirty eight Definitely no dinner tonight She needed a suitcase and a change of clothing And then she d just better go sit in that hotel room The street level traffic was moderate around the bank but it began to thicken as she approached a shopping center two blocks farther on Striding along neither hurrying nor idling Trigger decided she had it made The only real chance to catch up with her had been at the bank And the old vault attendant wouldn t talk Half a block from the shopping center a row of spacers on planet leave came rollicking cheerily toward her uniform jackets unbuttoned three Ceyce girls in arm linked formation among them all happily high Trigger shifted toward the edge of the sidewalk to let them pass As the line swayed up on her left there was a shadowy settling of an aircar at the curb to her right With loud outcries of glad recognition and whoops of laughter the line swung in about her close Bodies crowded against her a hand was clapped over her mouth Other hands held her arms Her feet came off the ground and she had a momentary awareness of being rushed expertly forward Then she was in the car half on her side over the rear seat two very strong hands clamping her wrists together behind her back As she sucked in her breath for a yell the door snapped shut behind her cutting off the rollicking ha ha ha s and other noises outside There was a lurching twist as the aircar shot upward five The man who held Trigger s wrists shifted his grip up her arms and turned her a little so that she could sit upright on the seat faced half away from him She had got only a glimpse of him as he caught her but he seemed to be wearing the same kind of commercial spacer s uniform as the group which had hustled her into the car The other man in the car the driver sat up front with his back to them He looked like any ordinary middle aged civilian Trigger let her breath out slowly There was no point in yelling now She could feel her legs tremble a little but she didn t seem to be actually frightened At least not yet Spot anything so far the man who held her asked It was a deep voice It sounded matter of fact quite unexcited Three possibles anyway the driver said with equal casualness He didn t turn his head Make it two One very definite possible now I d say Better feed it to her then The driver didn t reply but the car s renewed surge of power pushed Trigger down hard on the seat She couldn t see much more than a shifting piece of the sky line through the front view plate Their own car seemed to be rising at a tremendous rate They were probably she thought already above the main traffic arteries over Ceyce Now Miss Argee the man sitting beside her said I d like to reassure you a little first Go ahead and reassure me Trigger said unsteadily You re in no slightest danger from us he said We re your friends Nice friends remarked Trigger I ll explain it all in a couple of minutes There may be some fairly dangerous characters on our tail at the moment and if they start to catch up Which they seem to be doing the driver interrupted Hang on for a few fast turns when we hit the next cloud bank We ll probably shake them there the other man explained to Trigger In case we don t though I ll need both hands free to handle the guns So she asked So I d like to slip a set of cuffs on you for just a few minutes I ve been informed you re a fairly tricky lady and we don t want you to do anything thoughtless You won t have them on very long All right Trigger bit her lip It wasn t all right and she didn t feel at all reassured so far Go ahead she said He let go of her left arm presumably to reach for the handcuffs She twisted around on him and went into fast action She was fairly proficient at the practice of unarmed mayhem The trouble was that the big ape she was trying the stuff on seemed at least as adept and with twice her muscle She lost a precious instant finding out that the Denton was no longer in her robe pocket After that she never got back the initiative It didn t help either that the car suddenly seemed to be trying to fly in three directions at once All in all about forty seconds passed before she was plumped back on the seat her hands behind her again linked at the wrists by the smooth plastic cords of the cuffs The ape stood behind the driver his hands resting on the back of the seat He wasn t Trigger observed bitterly even breathing hard The view plate was full of the cottony whiteness of a cloud heart They seemed to be dropping again One more violent swerve and they came flashing out into wet gray cloud shadow and on into brilliant sunlight A few seconds passed Then the ape remarked Looks like you lost them chum Right said the driver Almost at the river now I ll turn north there and drop down Right said the ape Get us that far and we ll be out of trouble A few minutes passed in silence Presently Trigger sensed they were slowing and losing altitude Then a line of trees flashed by in the view plate Nice flying the ape said He punched the driver approvingly in the shoulder and turned back to Trigger They looked at each other for a few seconds He was tall dark eyed very deeply tanned with thick sloping shoulders He probably wasn t more than five or six years older than she was He was studying her curiously and his eyes were remarkably steady Something stirred in her for a moment a small chill of fear Something passed through her thoughts a vague odd impression like a half aroused memory of huge cold dangerous things far away It was gone before she could grasp it more clearly She frowned The ape smiled It wasn t Trigger saw an entirely unpleasant face Sorry the party got rough he said Will you give parole if I take those cuffs off and tell you what this is about She studied him again Better tell me first she said shortly All right We re taking you to Commissioner Tate We ll be there in about an hour He ll tell you himself why he wanted to see you Trigger s eyes narrowed for an instant Secretly she felt very much relieved Holati Tate at any rate wouldn t let anything really unpleasant happen to her and she would find out at last what had been going on You ve got an odd way of taking people places she observed He laughed The grabber party wasn t scheduled You d indicated you wanted to speak to the Commissioner We were sent to the Colonial School to pick you up and escort you to him When we found out you d disappeared we had to do some fast improvising Not my business to tell you the reasons for that Trigger said hesitantly Those people who were chasing this car What about them he asked thoughtfully Were they after me Well he said they weren t after me Better let the Commissioner tell you about that too Now how about parole She nodded Till you turn me over to the Commissioner Fair enough he said You re his problem then He took a small flat piece of metal out of a pocket and reached back of her with it He didn t seem to do more than touch the cuffs but she felt the slick coils loosen and drop away Trigger rubbed her wrists Where s my gun she asked I ve got it I ll give it to the Commissioner How did you people find me so fast Police keep bank entrances under twenty four hour visual survey We had someone watching their screens You were spotted going in He sat down companionably beside her I d introduce myself but I don t know if that would fit in with the Commissioner s plans Trigger shrugged It still was quite possible she decided that her own plans weren t completely spoiled Holati and his friends didn t necessarily know about that vault account If they did know she d had one and had closed it out they could make a pretty good guess at what she d done with the money But if she just kept quiet there might be an opportunity to get back to Ceyce and the Dawn City by tomorrow evening Cigarette the Commissioner s overmuscled henchman inquired amiably Trigger glanced at him from the side Not amiably No thanks No hard feelings are there He looked surprised Yes she said evenly There are Maybe the driver suggested from the front what Miss Argee could do with is a shot of Puya Flask s in my coat pocket Left side There s an idea remarked Trigger s companion He looked at her It s very good Puya So choke on it Trigger told him gently She settled back into the corner of the seat and closed her eyes You can wake me up when we get to the Commissioner In some way Holati Tate said this little item here seems to be at the core of the whole plasmoid problem Know what it is Trigger looked at the little item with some revulsion Dark green marbled with pink streakings it lay on the table between them rather like a plump leech a foot and a half long It was motionless except that the end nearest her shifted in a short arc from side to side as if the thing suffered from a very slow twitch One of the plasmoids obviously she said A jumpy one She blinked at it Looks like that one hundred thirteen Is it She glanced around Commissioner Tate and Professor Mantelish who sat in an armchair off to her right were staring at her eyebrows up apparently surprised about something What s the matter she asked We re
3242_8112_000055_000000	train-clean-100	 just wondering 
none	none	said Holati how you happen to remember one hundred thirteen in particular out of the thousands of plasmoids on Harvest Moon Oh One of the Junior Scientists on your Project mentioned the one hundred twelve one hundred thirteen unit That brought it to mind Is this one hundred thirteen No said Holati Tate But it appears to be a duplicate of it He was a mild looking little man well along in years sparse and spruce in his Precol uniform The small gray eyes in the sun darkened leathery face weren t really mild if you considered them more closely or if you knew the Commissioner Have to fill you in on some of the background first Trigger girl he d said when she was brought to his little private office and inquired with some heat what the devil was up The tall grabber hadn t come into the office with her He asked the Commissioner from the door whether he should get Professor Mantelish to the conference room and the Commissioner nodded Then 
3242_8112_000003_000001	train-clean-100	the door closed 
none	none	and the two of them were alone I know it s looked odd Commissioner Tate admitted but the circumstances have been very odd Still are And I didn t want to worry you any more than I had to Trigger unmollified pointed out that the methods he d used not to worry her hardly had been soothing I know that too said the Commissioner But if I d told you everything immediately you would have had reason enough to be worried for the past two months rather than just for a day or so The situation has improved now very considerably In fact in another few days you shouldn t have any more reason to worry at all He smiled briefly At least no more than the rest of us Trigger felt a bit dry lipped suddenly I do at present she asked You did till today There s been some pretty heavy heat on you Trigger girl We re switching most of it off tonight For good I think You mean some heat will be left In a way he said But that should be cleared up too in the next three or four days Anyway we can drop most of the mystery act tonight Trigger shook her head It isn t being dropped very fast she observed I told you I couldn t tell it backwards the Commissioner said patiently All right if we start filling in the background now I guess we d better she admitted Fine said Commissioner Tate He got to his feet Then let s go join Mantelish Why the professor He could help a lot with the explaining If he s in the mood Anyway he s got a kind of pet I d like you to look at A pet cried Trigger She shook her head again and stood up resignedly Lead on Commissioner They joined Mantelish and his plasmoid weirdie in what looked like the dining room of what had looked like an old fashioned hunting lodge when the aircar came diving down on it between two ice sheeted mountain peaks Trigger wasn t sure in just what section of the main continent they were but there were only two or three alternatives it was high in the mountains and night came a lot faster here than it did around Ceyce She greeted Mantelish and sat down at the table Then the Commissioner locked the doors and introduced her to the professor s pet It s labelled one hundred thirteen A he said now Even the professor isn t certain he could distinguish between the two Right Mantelish That is true said Mantelish at present He was a very big rather fat but healthy looking old man with a thick thatch of white hair and a ruddy face Without a physical comparison He shrugged What s so important about the critter Trigger asked eyeing the leech again One good thing about it she thought it wasn t equipped to eye her back It goes back to the time the Commissioner said when Mantelish and Fayle and Azol were conducting the first League investigation of the plasmoids on Harvest Moon You recall the situation If you mean their attempts to get the things to show some signs of life I do naturally One of them got lively enough for poor old Azol didn t it Professor Mantelish rumbled from his armchair Trigger grimaced Doctor Azol s fate might be one of the things that had given her a negative attitude towards plasmoids With Mantelish and Doctor Gess Fayle Azol had been the third of the three big U League boys in charge of the initial investigation on Harvest Moon As she remembered it it was Azol who discovered that Plasmoids occasionally could be induced to absorb food Almost any kind of food it turned out so long as it contained a sufficient quantity of protein What had happened to Azol looked like a particularly unfortunate result of the discovery It was assumed an untimely coronary had been the reason he had fallen helplessly into the feeding trough of one of the largest plasmoids By the time he was found all of him from the knees on up already had been absorbed I meant your efforts to get them to work she said Commissioner Tate looked at Mantelish You tell her about that part of it he suggested Mantelish shook his head I d get too technical he said resignedly I always do At least they say so You tell her But Holati Tate s eyes had shifted suddenly to the table Hey now he said in a low voice Trigger followed his gaze After a moment she made a soft sucking sound of alarmed distaste Ugh she remarked It s moving So it is Holati said Towards me said Trigger I think Don t get startled Mantelish Mantelish already was coming up slowly behind Trigger s chair Don t move he cautioned her Why not said Trigger Hush my dear Mantelish laid a large heavy hand on each of her shoulders and bore down slightly It s sensitive This is very interesting Very Perhaps it was She kept watching the plasmoid It had thinned out somewhat and was gliding very slowly but very steadily across the table Definitely in her direction Ho ho said Mantelish in a thunderous murmur Perhaps it likes you Trigger Ho ho He seemed immensely pleased Well Trigger said helplessly I don t like it She wriggled slightly under Mantelish s hands And I d sooner get out of this chair Don t be childish Trigger said the professor annoyedly You re behaving as if it were in some manner offensive It is she said Hush my dear Mantelish said absently putting on a little more pressure Trigger hushed resignedly They watched In about a minute the gliding thing reached the edge of the table Trigger gathered herself to duck out from under Mantelish s hands and go flying out of the chair if it looked as if the plasmoid was about to drop into her lap But it stopped For a few seconds it lay motionless Then it gradually raised its front end and began waving it gently back and forth in the air At her Trigger suspected Yipes she said horrified The front end sank back The plasmoid lay still again After a minute it was still lying still Show s over for the moment I guess said the Commissioner I m afraid so said Professor Mantelish His big hands went away from Trigger s aching shoulders You startled it Trigger he boomed at her accusingly six The point of it Holati Tate explained was that this had been more activity than one hundred thirteen A normally displayed over a period of a week And one hundred thirteen A was easily the most active plasmoid of them all nowadays It is of course possible Mantelish said arousing from deep thought that it was attracted by your body odor Thank you Mantelish said Trigger You re welcome my dear Mantelish had pulled his chair up to the table he hitched himself forward in it We shall now he announced try a little experiment Pick it up Trigger She stared at him Pick it up No Mantelish We shall now try some other little experiment Mantelish furrowed his Jovian brows Holati gave her a small smile across the table Just touch it with the tip of a finger he suggested You can do that much for the professor can t you Barely Trigger told him grimly But she reached out and put a cautious finger tip to the less lively end of one hundred thirteen A After a moment she said Hey She moved the finger lightly along the thing s surface It had a velvety smooth warm feeling rather like a kitten You know she said surprised it feels sort of nice It just looks disgusting Disgusting Mantelish boomed offended again The Commissioner held up a hand Just a moment he said He d picked up some signal Trigger hadn t noticed for he went over to the wall now and touched something there A release button apparently The door to the room opened Trigger s grabber came in The door closed behind him He was carrying a tray with a squat brown flask and four rather small glasses on it He gave Trigger a grin She gave him a tentative smile in return The Commissioner had introduced him Heslet Quillan Major Heslet Quillan of the Subspace Engineers For a Subspace Engineer Trigger had thought skeptically he was a pretty good grabber But there was a qualified truce in the room It would last at least until Holati finished his explaining There was no really good reason not to include Major Quillan in it Ah Puya Professor Mantelish exclaimed advancing on the tray as Quillan set it on the table Mantelish seemed to have forgotten about plasmoid experiments for the moment and Trigger didn t intend to remind him She drew her hand back quietly from one hundred thirteen A The professor unstoppered the flask You ll have some Trigger I m sure The only really good thing the benighted world of Rumli ever produced My great grandmother Trigger remarked was a Rumlian She watched him fill the four glasses with a thin purple liquid I ve never tried it but yes thanks Quillan put one of the glasses in front of her And we shall drink Mantelish suggested with a suave flourish of his Puya to your great grandmother We shall also suggested Major Quillan pulling a chair up to the table for himself Advise Trigger to take a very small sip on her first go at the stuff Nobody had invited him to sit down But nobody was objecting either Well that fitted Trigger thought She sipped It was tart and hot Very hot She set the glass back on the table inhaled with difficulty exhaled quiveringly Tears gathered in her eyes Very good she husked Very good the Commissioner agreed He put down his empty glass and smacked his lips lightly And now he said briskly let s get on with this conference Trigger glanced around the room while Quillan refilled three glasses The small live coal she had swallowed was melting away a warm glow began to spread through her It did look like the dining room of a hunting lodge The woodwork was dark old looking worn with much polishing Horned heads of various formidable Maccadon life forms adorned the walls But it was open season now on a different kind of game Three men had walked briskly past them when Quillan brought her in by the front door They hadn t even looked at her There were sounds now and then from some of the other rooms and that general feeling of a considerable number of people around of being at an operating headquarters of some sort which hummed with quiet activity One of the things Holati Tate said which had not become public knowledge so far was that Professor Mantelish actually succeeded in getting some of the plasmoids on the Old Galactic base back into operation One plasmoid in particular The reason the achievement hadn t been announced was that for nearly six weeks no one except the three men directly involved in the experiments had known about them And during that time other things occurred which made subsequent publicity seem very inadvisable Mantelish scowled We made up a report to the League the day of the initial discovery he informed Trigger It was a complete and detailed report True Holati said but the report the U League got didn t happen to be the one Professor Mantelish helped make up We ll go into that later The plasmoid the professor was experimenting with was the one hundred twelve one hundred thirteen unit He shifted his gaze to Mantelish Still want me to tell it Yes yes Mantelish said impatiently You will oversimplify grossly of course but it should do for the moment At a more leisurely time I shall be glad to give Trigger an accurate description of the processes Trigger smiled at him Thank you Professor She took her second sip of the Puya Not bad Well Mantelish was dosing this plasmoid with mild electrical stimulations Holati went on He noticed suddenly that as he did it other plasmoids in that section of Harvest Moon were indicating signs of activity So he called in Doctor Fayle and Doctor Azol The three scientists discovered quickly that stimulation of the one hundred twelve part of the unit was in fact producing random patterns of plasmoid motion throughout the entire base while an electrical prod at one hundred thirteen brought everything to an abrupt stop again After a few hours of this one hundred twelve suddenly extruded a section of its material which detached itself and moved off slowly under its own power through half the station trailed with great excitement by Mantelish and Azol It stopped at a point where another plasmoid had been removed for laboratory investigations climbed up and settled down in the place left vacant by its predecessor It then reshaped itself into a copy of the predecessor and remained where it was Obviously a replacement There was dignified scientific jubilation among the three This was precisely the kind of information the U League and everybody else had been hoping to obtain one hundred twelve one hundred thirteen tentatively could be assumed to be a kind of monitor of the station s activities It could be induced to go into action and to activate the other plasmoids With further observation and refinement of method its action undoubtedly could be shifted from the random to the purposeful Finally and most importantly it had shown itself capable of producing a different form of plasmoid life to fulfill a specific requirement In essence the riddles presented by the Old Galactic Station appeared to be solved The three made up their secret report to the U League Included was a recommendation to authorize distribution of ten per cent of the less significant plasmoids to various experimental centers in the Hub the big and important centers which had been bringing heavy political pressure to bear on the Federation to let them in on the investigation That should keep them occupied while the U League concluded the really important work Next day said Holati Doctor Gess Fayle presented Mantelish with a transmitted message from U League Headquarters It contained instructions to have Fayle mount the one hundred twelve one hundred thirteen unit immediately in one of the League ships at Harvest Moon and bring it quietly to Maccadon Mantelish frowned The message was faked he boomed Not only that said Holati The actual report Doctor Fayle had transmitted the day before to the League was revised to the extent that it omitted any reference to one hundred twelve one hundred thirteen He glanced thoughtfully at Mantelish As a matter of fact it was almost a month and a half before League Headquarters became aware of the importance of the unit The professor snorted Azol he explained to Trigger had become a victim of his scientific zeal And I Doctor Azol said the Commissioner as you may remember had his little mishap with the plasmoid just two days after Fayle departed And I Mantelish went on was involved in other urgent research How was I to know what that villain Fayle had been up to A vice president of the University League Well Trigger said what had Doctor Fayle been up to We don t know yet Holati told her Obviously he had something in mind with the faked order and the alteration of the report But the only thing we can say definitely is that he disappeared on the League ship he had requisitioned along with its personnel and the one hundred twelve one hundred thirteen plasmoid and hasn t shown up again And that plasmoid unit now appears to have been almost certainly the key unit of the entire Old Galactic Station the unit that kept everything running along automatically there for thirty thousand years He glanced at Quillan Someone at the door We ll hold it while you see what they want seven The burly character who had appeared at the door said diffidently that Professor Mantelish had wanted to be present while his lab equipment was stowed aboard 
3242_8112_000002_000001	train-clean-100	If the professor didn t mind things were about that far along 
none	none	Mantelish excused himself and went off with the messenger The door closed 
3242_8112_000003_000002	train-clean-100	Quillan came back to his chair 
none	none	We re moving the outfit later tonight the Commissioner explained Mantelish is coming along plus around eight tons of his lab equipment Plus his special U League guards
3242_8112_000005_000000	train-clean-100	 Oh Trigger picked up the Puya glass 
3242_8112_000005_000001	train-clean-100	She looked into it 
none	none	It was empty
3242_8112_000005_000003	train-clean-100	 Moving where she asked 
none	none	Manon said the Commissioner
3242_8112_000006_000001	train-clean-100	 Tell you about that later 
none	none	Every last muscle in Trigger s body seemed to go limp simultaneously She settled back slightly in the chair surprised by the force of the reaction She hadn t realized by now how keyed up she was She sighed a small sigh 
3242_8112_000007_000003	train-clean-100	Then she smiled at Quillan 
3242_8112_000008_000000	train-clean-100	 Major she said how about a tiny little refill on that Puya about half 
none	none	Quillan took care of the tiny little refill Commissioner Tate said By the way Quillan does have a degree in subspace engineering and gets assigned to the Engineers now and then But his real job s Space Scout Intelligence Trigger nodded I d almost guessed it She gave Quillan another smile She nearly gave one hundred thirteen A a smile And now said the Commissioner we ll talk more freely We tell Mantelish just as little as we can To tell you the truth Trigger the professor is a terrible handicap on an operation like this I understand he was a great friend of your father s Yes she said Going over for visits to Mantelish s garden with my father is one of the earliest things I remember I can imagine he s a problem She shifted her gaze curiously from one to the other of the two men
3242_8112_000013_000003	train-clean-100	 What are you people doing 
none	none	Looking for Gess Fayle and the key unit 
3242_8112_000014_000000	train-clean-100	Holati Tate said That s about it 
none	none	We re one of a few thousand Federation groups assigned to the same general job 
3242_8112_000014_000002	train-clean-100	Each group works at its specialties and the information gets correlated He paused 
3242_8112_000014_000003	train-clean-100	 The Federation Council they re the ones we re working for directly the Council s biggest concern is the very delicate political situation that s involved 
none	none	They feel it could develop suddenly into a dangerous one 
3242_8112_000014_000005	train-clean-100	They may be right 
3242_8112_000015_000000	train-clean-100	 In what way Trigger asked 
3242_8112_000016_000000	train-clean-100	 Well suppose that key unit is lost and stays lost 
none	none	Suppose all the other plasmoids put together don t contain enough information to show how the Old Galactics produced the things and got them to operate Somebody would get that worked out pretty soon wouldn t they Not necessarily or even probably according to Mantelish and some other people who know what s happened 
3242_8112_000018_000001	train-clean-100	There seem to be too many basic factors missing 
none	none	It might be necessary to develop a whole new class of sciences first 
3242_8112_000018_000003	train-clean-100	And that could take a few centuries 
3242_8112_000019_000000	train-clean-100	 Well Trigger admitted I could get along without the things indefinitely 
none	none	Same here the plasmoid nabob agreed ungratefully
3242_8112_000020_000001	train-clean-100	 Weird beasties But let s see 
none	none	At present there are twelve hundred and fifty eight member worlds to the Federation aren t there More or less And the number of planetary confederacies subplanetary governments industrial financial and commercial combines assorted power groups et cetera and so on is something I d hate to have to calculate What are you driving at she asked They ve all been told we re heading for a new golden age courtesy of the plasmoid science Practically everybody has believed it 
3242_8112_000024_000002	train-clean-100	Now there s considerable doubt 
none	none	Oh she said Of course practically everybody is going to get very unhappy eh
3242_8112_000026_000000	train-clean-100	 That said Commissioner Tate is only a little of it 
none	none	Yes the thing isn t just lost 
3242_8112_000027_000001	train-clean-100	Somebody s got it 
none	none	Very likely Trigger nodded
3242_8112_000029_000001	train-clean-100	 Fayle s ship might have got wrecked accidentally of course 
none	none	But the way he took off shows he planned to disappear a crack up on top of that would be too much of a coincidence So any one of umpteen thousands of organizations in the Hub might be the one that has that plasmoid now Including said Holati any one of the two hundred and fourteen restricted worlds Their treaties of limitation wouldn t have let them get into the plasmoid pie until the others had been at it a decade or so They would have been quite eager 
3242_8112_000031_000000	train-clean-100	There was a little pause 
none	none	Then Trigger said Lordy The thing could even set off another string of wars
3242_8112_000032_000000	train-clean-100	 That s a point the Council is nervous about he said 
none	none	Well it certainly is a mess You would have thought the Federation might have had a Security Chief in on that first operation 
3242_8112_000033_000002	train-clean-100	Right there on Harvest Moon 
none	none	They did he said
3242_8112_000034_000001	train-clean-100	 It was Fayle 
none	none	Oh Pretty embarrassing Trigger was silent a moment
3242_8112_000035_000002	train-clean-100	 Holati could those things ever become as valuable as people keep saying 
none	none	It s all sounded a little exaggerated to me The Commissioner said he d wondered about it too I m not enough of a biologist to make an educated guess 
3242_8112_000036_000002	train-clean-100	What it seems to boil down to is that they might 
3242_8112_000036_000003	train-clean-100	Which would be enough to tempt a lot of people to gamble very high for a chance to get control of the plasmoid process and we know definitely that some people are gambling for it 
none	none	How do you know We ve been working a couple of leads here Pretty short leads so far but you work with what you can get He nodded at the table We picked up the first lead through one hundred thirteen A 
3242_8112_000039_000000	train-clean-100	Trigger glanced down 
none	none	The plasmoid lay there some inches from the side of her hand
3242_8112_000039_000002	train-clean-100	 You know she said uncomfortably old Repulsive moved again while we were talking 
none	none	Towards my hand She drew the hand away I was watching it Major Quillan said reassuringly from the end of the table I would have warned you but it stopped when it got as far as it is now 
3242_8112_000040_000002	train-clean-100	That was around five minutes ago 
none	none	Trigger reached back and gave old Repulsive a cautious pat Very lively character 
3242_8112_000041_000002	train-clean-100	He does feel pleasant to touch 
3242_8112_000041_000003	train-clean-100	Kitty cat pleasant 
3242_8112_000041_000004	train-clean-100	How did you get a lead through him 
none	none	Mantelish brought it back to Maccadon with him mainly because of its similarity to one hundred thirteen He was curious because he couldn t even guess at what its function was 
3242_8112_000042_000002	train-clean-100	It was just lying there in a cubicle 
none	none	So he did considerable experimenting with it while he waited for Gess Fayle to show up and League Headquarters fidgeted around hoping to get the kind of report from Mantelish and Fayle that Mantelish thought they d already received They were wondering where Fayle was too But they knew Fayle was Security so they didn t like to get too nosy Trigger shook her head
3242_8112_000043_000001	train-clean-100	 Wonderful 
none	none	So what happened with one hundred thirteen A
3242_8112_000044_000000	train-clean-100	 Mantelish began to get results with it the Commissioner said 
3242_8112_000044_000001	train-clean-100	 One experiment was rather startling 
none	none	He d been trying that electrical stimulation business 
3242_8112_000044_000003	train-clean-100	Nothing happened until he had finished 
3242_8112_000044_000004	train-clean-100	Then he touched the plasmoid and it fed the whole charge back to him Apparently it was a fairly hefty dose 
3242_8112_000045_000000	train-clean-100	She laughed delightedly 
3242_8112_000045_000001	train-clean-100	 Good for Repulsive 
3242_8112_000045_000002	train-clean-100	Stood up for his rights eh 
none	none	Mantelish gained some such impression anyway 
3242_8112_000046_000001	train-clean-100	He became more cautious with it after that 
3242_8112_000046_000002	train-clean-100	And then he learned something that should be important 
none	none	He was visiting another lab where they had a couple of plasmoids which actually moved now and then He had one hundred thirteen A in his coat pocket The two lab plasmoids stopped moving while he was there They haven t moved since Like the Harvest Moon plasmoids when they stimulated one hundred thirteen Right He thought about that and then located another moving plasmoid He dropped in to look it over with one hundred thirteen A in his pocket again and it stopped 
3242_8112_000048_000002	train-clean-100	He did the same thing in one more place and then quit 
none	none	There aren t that many moving plasmoids around Those three labs are still wondering what hit their specimens She studied one hundred thirteen A curiously A mighty mite 
3242_8112_000049_000002	train-clean-100	What does Mantelish make of it 
none	none	He thinks the one hundred twelve one hundred thirteen unit forms a kind of self regulating system 
3242_8112_000050_000001	train-clean-100	The big one induces plasmoid activity the little one modifies it 
none	none	This one hundred thirteen A might be a spare regulator 
3242_8112_000050_000003	train-clean-100	But it seems to be more than a spare which brings us to that first lead we got 
none	none	A gang of raiders crashed Mantelish s lab one night
3242_8112_000051_000000	train-clean-100	 When was that 
none	none	Some months ago 
3242_8112_000052_000001	train-clean-100	Before you and I left Manon 
none	none	The professor was out and one hundred thirteen A had gone along in his pocket as usual But his two lab guards and one of the raiders were killed The others got away Gess Fayle s defection was a certainty by then and everybody was very nervous 
3242_8112_000052_000006	train-clean-100	The Feds got there fast and dead brained the raider 
none	none	They learned just two things One he d been mind blocked and couldn t have spilled any significant information even if they had got him alive The other item they drew from his brain was a clear impression of the target of the raid the professor s pal here
3242_8112_000053_000000	train-clean-100	 Uh huh Trigger said lost in thought 
none	none	She poked Repulsive lightly That would be Fayle and his associates then Or somebody who knew about them 
3242_8112_000053_000003	train-clean-100	Did they want to kill it or grab it 
3242_8112_000054_000000	train-clean-100	The Commissioner looked at her 
3242_8112_000054_000001	train-clean-100	 Grab it was the dead brain report Why 
none	none	Just wondering 
3242_8112_000055_000001	train-clean-100	Would make a difference wouldn t it 
3242_8112_000055_000002	train-clean-100	Did they try again 
none	none	There ve been five more attempts he said
3242_8112_000057_000000	train-clean-100	 And what s everybody concluded from that 
none	none	They want one hundred thirteen A in a very bad way 
3242_8112_000058_000001	train-clean-100	So they need it 
3242_8112_000059_000000	train-clean-100	 In connection with the key unit Trigger asked 
none	none	Probably That makes everything look very much better doesn t it Quite a little he said The unit may not work or may not work satisfactorily unless one hundred thirteen A is in the area 
3242_8112_000062_000002	train-clean-100	Mantelish talks of something he calls proximity influence 
none	none	Whatever that is one hundred thirteen A has demonstrated it has it So Trigger said they might have two thirds of what everybody wants and you might have one third 
3242_8112_000063_000001	train-clean-100	Right here on the table 
none	none	How many of the later raiders did you catch All of them said the Commissioner Around forty We got them dead we got them alive 
3242_8112_000064_000003	train-clean-100	It didn t make much difference 
none	none	They were hired hands 
3242_8112_000064_000005	train-clean-100	Very expensive hired hands but still just that 
3242_8112_000064_000006	train-clean-100	Most of them didn t know a thing we could use 
none	none	The ones that did know something were mind blocked again I thought Trigger said reflectively you could un block someone like that You can sometimes If you re very good at it and if you have time enough We couldn t afford to wait a year They died before they could tell us anything 
3242_8112_000067_000000	train-clean-100	There was a pause 
none	none	Then Trigger asked How did you get involved in this personally More or less by accident the Commissioner said
3242_8112_000068_000001	train-clean-100	 It was in connection with our second lead 
none	none	That s me huh she said unhappily Yes Why would anyone want to grab me I don t know anything He shook his head
3242_8112_000072_000001	train-clean-100	 We haven t found out yet 
none	none	We re hoping we will in a very few days
3242_8112_000073_000000	train-clean-100	 Is that one of the things you can t tell me about 
3242_8112_000074_000000	train-clean-100	 I can tell you most of what I know at the moment said the Commissioner 
none	none	Remember the night we stopped off at Evalee on the way in from Manon Yes she said That big hotel eight About an hour after you d decided to hit the bunk Holati said I portaled back to your rooms to pick up some Precol reports we d been setting up Trigger nodded I remember the reports A couple of characters were working on your doors when I got there They went for their guns unfortunately But I called the nearest Scout Intelligence office and had them dead brained Why that she asked It could have been an accident a couple of ordinary thugs But their equipment looked a little too good for ordinary thugs I didn t know just what to be suspicious of but I got suspicious anyway That s you all right Trigger acknowledged What were they They had an Evalee record which told us more than the brains did They were high priced boys Their brains told us they d allowed themselves to be mind blocked on this particular job High priced boys won t do that unless they can set their standard price very much higher It didn t look at all any more as if they d come to your door by accident No she admitted The Feds got in on it then There d been that business in Mantelish s lab There were similarities in the pattern You knew Mantelish You d been on Harvest Moon with him They thought there could be a connection But what connection she protested I know I don t know anything that could do anybody any good He shrugged I can t figure it either Trigger girl But the upshot of it was that I was put in charge of this phase of the general investigation If there is a connection it ll come out eventually In any case we want to know who s been trying to have you picked up and why She studied his face with troubled eyes That s quite definite is it she asked There couldn t possibly still be a mistake No It s definite So that s what the grabber business in the Colonial School yesterday was about He nodded It was their first try since the Evalee matter Why do you think they waited so long Because they suspected you were being guarded It s difficult to keep an adequate number of men around without arousing doubts in interested observers Trigger glanced at the plasmoid That sounds she remarked as if you d let other interested observers feel you d left them a good opening to get at Repulsive He didn t quite smile I might have done that Don t tell the Council Trigger pursed her lips I won t So the grabbers who were after me figured I was booby trapped But then they came in anyway That doesn t seem very bright Or did you do something again to make them think the road was clear No he said They were trying to clear the road for themselves We thought they would finally The deal was set up as a one two As a what One two You slug into what could be a trap like that with one gang If it was a trap they were sacrifices You hope the opposition will now relax its precautions Sometimes it does and a day or so later you re back for the real raid That works occasionally Anyway it was the plan in this case How do you know They d started closing in for the grab in Ceyce when Quillan s group located you So Quillan grabbed you first She flushed I wasn t as smart as I thought was I The Commissioner grunted Smart enough to give us a king sized headache But they didn t have any trouble finding you We discovered tonight that some kind of tracer material had been worked into all your clothes Even the flimsies Somebody may have been planted in the school laundry but that s not important now He looked at her for a moment What made you decide to take off so suddenly he asked Trigger shrugged I was getting pretty angry with you she admitted More or less with everybody Then I applied for a transfer and the application bounced from Evalee I figured I d had enough and that I d just quietly clear out So I did or thought I did Can t blame you said Holati Trigger said I still think it would have been smarter to keep me informed right from the start of what was going on He shook his head I wouldn t be telling you a thing even now he said if it hadn t been definitely established that you re already involved in the matter This could develop into a pretty messy operation I wouldn t have wanted you in on it if it could have been avoided And if you weren t going to be in on it I couldn t go spilling Federation secrets to you I m in on it definitely eh He nodded For the duration But you re still not telling me everything There re a few things I can t tell you he said I m following orders in that Trigger smiled faintly That s a switch I didn t know you knew how I ve followed plenty of orders in my time the Commissioner said when I thought they made sense And I think these do Trigger was silent a moment You said a while ago that most of the heat was to go off me tonight Can you talk about that Yes that s all right He considered I ll have to tell you something else again first why we re going to Manon She settled back in her chair Go ahead Somebody got the idea that one of the things Gess Fayle might have done is to arrange things so he wouldn t have to come back to the Hub for a while If he could set up shop on some outworld far enough away and tinker around with that plasmoid unit for a year or so until he knew all about it he might do better for himself than by simply selling it to somebody But that would be pretty risky wouldn t it said Trigger With just the equipment he could pack on a League transport Not very much risk said the Commissioner if he had an agreement to have an Independent Fleet meet him Oh She nodded And by what is at all events an interesting coincidence the Commissioner went on we ve had word that an outfit called Vishni s Fleet hasn t been heard from for some months Their I Fleet area is a long way out beyond Manon but Fayle could have made it there at League ship speeds in about twenty days Less if Vishni sent a few pilots to meet him and guide him out of subspace If he s bought Vishni s he s had his pick of a few hundred uncharted habitable planets and a few thousand very expert outworlders to see nothing happens to him planetside And Vishni s boys are exactly the kind of crumbs you could buy for a deal like that Now what s been done is to hire a few of the other I Fleets around there and set them and as many Space Scout squadrons as could be kicked loose from duty elsewhere to surveying the Vishni territory Our outfit is in charge of that operation And Manon of course is a lot better point from which to conduct it than the Hub If something is discovered that looks interesting enough to investigate in detail we ll only be a week s run away So we ve been ready to move for the past two weeks now which was when the first reports started coming in from the Vishni area negative reports so far by the way I ve kept stalling from day to day because there were also indications that your grabber friends might be getting set to swing at you finally It seemed tidier to get that matter cleared up first Now they ve swung and we ll go He rubbed his chin The nice thing about it all he remarked is that we re going there with the two items the opposition has revealed it wants We re letting them know those items will be available in the Manon System henceforward They might get discouraged and just drop the whole project If they do that s fine We ll go ahead with cleaning up the Vishni phase of the operation But he continued the indications are they can t drop their project any more than we can drop looking for that key unit So we ll expect them to show up in Manon When they do they ll be working in unfamiliar territory and in a system where they have only something like fifty thousand people to hide out in instead of a planetary civilization I think they ll find things getting very hot for them very fast in Manon Very good said Trigger That I like But what makes you think the opposition is just one group There might be a bunch of them by now Maybe even fighting among themselves I d bet on at least two groups myself he said And if they re fighting they ve got our blessing They re still all opposition as far as we re concerned She nodded How are you letting them know about the move The mountains around here are lousy with observers Very cute tricks some of them use one boy has been sitting in a hollow tree for weeks We let them see what we want to This evening they saw you coming in Later tonight they ll see you climbing into the ship with the rest of the party and taking off They ve already picked up messages to tell them just where the ship s going He paused But you ve got a job to finish up here first Trigger That ll take about four days So it won t really be you they see climbing into the ship What She straightened up We ve got a facsimile for you he explained Girl agent She goes along to draw the heat to Manon Trigger felt herself tightening up slowly all over What s this job you re talking about she asked evenly Can t tell you in too much detail But around four days from now somebody is coming in to Maccadon to interview you Interview me What about He hesitated a moment There s a theory he said that you might have information you don t know you have And that the people who sent grabbers after you want that information If it s true the interview will bring it out Her mouth went dry suddenly She turned her head to Quillan Major she said I think I d like that cigarette now He came over and lit one for her Trigger thanked him and puffed And she d almost spilled everything she was thinking The paid up reservation Every last thing I d like to get it straight she said What you re talking about sounds like it s a mind search job Holati It s in that class he said But it won t be an ordinary mind search The people who are coming here are top experts at that kind of work She nodded I don t know much about it Do they think somebody s got to me with a hypno spray or something That I ve been conditioned Something like that I don t know Trigger he said It may be something in that line But whatever it is they ll be able to handle it Trigger moistened her lips I was thinking you know she said Supposing I m mind blocked He shook his head I can tell you that anyway he said We already know you re not Trigger was silent a moment Then she said After that interview s over I m to ship out to Manon is that it That s right But it would depend on the outcome of that interview too wouldn t it Trigger pointed out I mean you can t really be sure what those people might decide can you Yes I can he said This thing s been all scheduled out Trigger And the next step of the schedule for you is Manon Nothing else She didn t believe him in the least He couldn t know She nodded Guess I might as well play along She looked at him I don t think I really had much choice did I Afraid not he admitted It s one of those things that just have to be done But you won t find it all bad Your companion by the way for the next three days will be Mihul Mihul Trigger exclaimed Right there said Mihul s voice Trigger swung around in her chair Mihul stood in a door which had appeared in the full wall of the room She gave Trigger a smile Trigger looked back at the Commissioner I don t get it she said Oh Mihul s in Scout Intelligence he said wouldn t be here if she weren t Been an agent for eighteen years Mihul said coming forward Hi Trigger surprised Yes Trigger admitted Very They brought me into this job Mihul said because they figured you and I would get along together just fine nine It was really infernally bad luck Mihul was going to be the least easy of wardens to get away from particularly in time to catch a liner tomorrow night Mihul knew her much too well Like to come along and meet your facsimile now Mihul inquired She grinned Most people find the first time quite an experience Trigger stood up resignedly All right she said They were being polite about it but it was clear that it was still a cop and prisoner situation And old friend Mihul She remembered something then I believe Major Quillan has my gun He looked at her thoughtfully not smiling No he said Gave it to Mihul That s right said Mihul Let s go kid They went out through the door that had appeared in the wall It closed again behind them The facsimile stood up from behind a table at which she had been sitting as Trigger and Mihul came into the room She gave Trigger a brief impersonal glance then looked at Mihul Mihul performed no introductions Dress robe and scarf she said to the facsimile The shoes are close enough She turned to Trigger She ll be wearing your street clothes when she leaves she said Could we have the dress now Trigger pulled the dress over her head tossed it to Mihul and stood in her underwear looking at her double slip out of her street clothes They did seem to be a very close match in size and proportions Watching the shifting play of slim muscles in the long legs and smooth back Trigger decided the similarity was largely a natural one The silver blonde hair was the same of course The gray eyes seemed almost identical and the rest of the face was a little too identical They must have used a life mask there It was a bit uncanny Like seeing one s mirror image start moving about independently If the girl had talked it might have reduced the effect But she remained silent She put on the dress Trigger had been wearing and smoothed it down Mihul surveyed the result She nodded Perfect She took Trigger s robe and scarf from the back of a chair where someone had draped them and handed them over You won t wear the scarf she said Just shove it into a pocket of the coat The girl slung the cloak over her shoulder and stood holding the scarf Mihul looked her over once more You ll do she said She smiled briefly All right The facsimile glanced at Trigger again turned and moved attractively out of the room Trigger frowned Something wrong Mihul asked She had gone over to a wall basin and was washing out a tumbler Why does she walk like that The little swing in the rear She s studied it Mihul half filled the tumbler with water fished a transparent splinter of something out of a pocket and cracked the splinter over the edge of the glass Among your friends it s referred to as the Argee Lilt She s got you down pat kid Trigger didn t comment Am I supposed to put on her clothes No We ve got another costume for you Mihul came over holding out the glass This is for you Trigger looked at the glass suspiciously What s in it The blue eyes regarded her mildly You could call it a sedative Don t need any Thanks Better take it anyway Mihul patted her hip with her other hand Little hypo gun here That s the alternative What That s right Same type of charge as in your fancy Denton Stuff in the glass is easier to take and won t leave you groggy What s the idea I ve known you quite a while said Mihul And I was watching you the last twenty minutes in that room through a screen You ll take off again if you get the least chance I don t blame you a bit You re being pushed around But now it s my job to see you don t take off and until we get to where you re going I want to be sure you ll stay quiet She still held out the glass in a long tanned capable hand She stood three inches taller than Trigger weighted thirty five pounds more Not an ounce of that additional thirty five pounds was fat If she d needed assistance the hunting lodge was full of potential helpers She didn t I never claimed I liked this arrangement Trigger said carefully I did say I d go along with it I will Isn t that enough Sure Mihul said promptly Give word of parole There was a long pause No Trigger said I thought not Drink or gun Drink Trigger said coldly She took the glass How long will it put me out Eight to nine hours Mihul stood by watchfully while Trigger emptied the tumbler After a moment the tumbler fell to the floor She reached out and caught Trigger as she started down All right she said across her shoulder to the open doorway behind her Let s move Trigger awoke and instantly went taut with tension She lay quiet a few seconds not even opening her eyes There was cool sunlight on her eyelids but she was indoors There was a subdued murmur of sound somewhere after a moment she knew it came from a news viewer turned low in some adjoining room But there didn t seem to be anybody immediately around her Warily she opened her eyes She was on a couch in an airy spacious room furnished in the palest of greens and ivory One entire side of the room was either a window or a solido screen In it was a distant mountain range with many snowy peaks an almost cloudless blue sky Sun at midmorning or midafternoon Sun and all had the look of Maccadon they probably still were on the planet That was where the interview was to take place But she also could have been sent on a three day space cruise which would be a rather good way to make sure a prisoner stayed exactly where you wanted her This could be a spaceliner suite with a packaged view of any one of some hundreds of worlds and with packaged sunlight thrown in There was one door to the room It stood open and the news viewer talk came from there Trigger sat up quietly and looked down at the clothes she wore All white A short sleeved half blouse of some soft rather heavy very comfortable unfamiliar stuff Bare midriff White kid trousers which flared at the thighs and were drawn in to a close fit just above the knees and down the calves vanishing into kid boots with thick flexible soles Sporting outfit That meant Maccadon She pulled a handful of hair forward and looked at it They d recolored it this time to a warm mahogany brown She swung her legs off the couch and stood up quietly A dozen soft steps across the springy thick napped turf of ivory carpet took her to the window The news viewer clicked and went silent Not bad Trigger said She saw a long range of woodlands and open heath rising gradually into the flanks of the mountains On the far right was the still silver glitter of two lakes Where are we Byla Uplands Game Preserve That s the game bird area before you Mihul appeared in the doorframe in an outfit almost a duplicate of Trigger s in pearl gray tones Feel all right Feeling fine Trigger said Byla Uplands the southern tip of the continent She could make it back to Ceyce in two hours or less She turned and grinned at Mihul I also feel hungry How long was I out Mihul glanced at her wrist watch Eight hours ten minutes You woke up on schedule I had breakfast sent up thirty minutes ago I ve already eaten mine took one sniff and plunged in It s good Mihul s hair Trigger saw had been cropped short and a streak of gray added over the right side and they d changed the color of her eyes to hazel She wondered what had been done to her along that line Want to come in Mihul said We can talk while you eat Trigger nodded After I ve freshened up The bathroom mirror showed they d left her eyes alone But there was a very puzzling impression that she was staring at an image considerably plumper shorter younger than it should be a teen ager around seventeen or eighteen Her eyes narrowed If they d done flesh sculpting on her it could cause complications She stripped hurriedly and checked They hadn t tampered with her body So it had to be the clothes though it was difficult to see how even the most cunning cut could provide such a very convincing illusion of being more rounded out heavier around the thighs larger breasts just missing being dumpy in fact She dressed again looked again and came out of the bathroom still puzzled Choice of three game birds for breakfast Mihul announced Never heard of any of them All good Plus regular stuff She patted her flat midriff Ate too much she admitted Now dig in and I ll brief you Trigger dug in I had a look at myself in the mirror she remarked What s this now you see it now you don t business of fifteen or so pounds of baby fat Mihul laughed You don t really have it I know that too How do they do it Subcolor job in the clothes They re not really white Anyone looking at you gets his vision distorted a little without realizing it Takes a wider view of certain areas for example You can play it around in a lot of ways I never heard of that one Trigger said You d think it would be sensational in fashions It would be Right now it s top secret for as long as Intelligence can keep it that way Trigger chewed a savory morsel of something Then why did you tell me You re one of the gang however reluctant And you re good at keeping the mouth shut Your name by the way is now Comteen Lod just turned eighteen I am your dear mama You call me Drura We re from Slyth Talgon on Evalee here for a few days shooting Trigger nodded Do we do any shooting Mihul pointed a finger at a side table The Denton lay there looking like a toy beside a standard slender barrelled sporting pistol Bet your life Comteen she said I ve always been too stingy to try out a first class preserve on my own money And this one is first class She paused Comteen and Drura Lod really exist We re a very fair copy of what they look like and they ll be kept out of sight till we re done here Now She leaned back comfortably tilting the chair and clasping her hands around one knee Aside from the sport we re here because you re a convalescent You re recovering from a rather severe attack of Dykart Fever Heard of it Trigger reflected Something you pick up in some sections of the Evalee tropics isn t it Mihul nodded That s what you did child Skipped your shots on the last trip we took and six months later you re still paying for it You were in one of those typical Dykart fever comas when we brought you in last night Very clever Trigger commented acidly Very Mihul pursed her lips The Dykart bug causes temporary derangements you know spells during which convalescents talk wildly imagine things Trigger popped another fragment of meat between her teeth and chewed thoughtfully looking over at Mihul Very good duck or whatever she said Like imagining they ve been more or less kidnapped you mean Things like that Mihul agreed Trigger shook her head I wouldn t anyway You types are bound to have all the legal angles covered Sure said Mihul Just thought I d mention it Have you used the Denton much on game Not too often Trigger had been wondering whether they d left the stunner compartment loaded But it s a very fair gun for it I know The other one s a Yool Good game gun too You ll use that Trigger swallowed She met the calm eyes watching her I ve never handled a Yool Why the switch They re easy to handle The reason for the switch is that you can t just stun someone with a Yool It s better if we both stay armed though it isn t really necessary so much money comes to play around here they can afford to keep the Uplands very thoroughly policed and they do But an ace in the hole never hurts She considered Changed your mind about that parole business yet I hadn t really thought about it Trigger said I d let you carry your own gun then Trigger looked reflective then shook her head I d rather not Suit yourself Mihul said agreeably In that case though there should be something else understood What s that We ll have up to three four days to spend here together before Whatzzit shows up Whatzzit For future reference Mihul said Whatzzit will be that which or he or she who wishes to have that interview with you and has arranged for it That s in case you want to talk about it I might as well tell you that I ll do very little talking about Whatzzit I thought Trigger suggested I was one of the gang I ve got special instructions on the matter Mihul said Anyway Whatzzit shows up You have your interview After that we do whatever Whatzzit says we re to do As you know Trigger nodded Meanwhile said Mihul we re here Very pleasant place to spend three four days in my opinion and I think in yours Very pleasant Trigger agreed I ve been suspecting it was you who suggested it would be a good place to wait in No Mihul said Though I might have if anyone had asked me But Whatzzit s handling all the arrangements it seems Now we could have fun here which I suspect would be the purpose as far as you re concerned Fun Trigger said To put you into a good frame of mind for that interview might be the idea Mihul said I don t know Three days here should relax almost anyone Get in a little shooting Loaf around the pools Go for rides Things like that The only trouble is I m afraid you re nourishing dark notions which are likely to take all the enjoyment out of it Not to mention the possibility of really relaxing Like what Trigger asked Oh Mihul said there re all sorts of possibilities of course She nodded her head at the guns Like yanking the Denton out of my holster and feeding me a dose of the stunner Or picking up that coffee pot there and tapping me on the skull with it It s about the right weight Trigger said thoughtfully I don t think either of those would work They might Mihul said They just might You re fast You ve been taught to improvise And there s something eating you You re edgy as a cat So Trigger said So Mihul said there are a number of alternatives I ll lay them out for you You take your pick For one I could just keep you doped Three days in dope won t hurt you and you ll certainly be no problem then Another way I ll let you stay awake but we stay in our rooms I can lock you in at night and that window is escape proof I checked It would be sort of boring but we can have tapes and stuff brought up I d have the guns put away and I d watch you like a hawk every minute of the day She looked at Trigger inquiringly Like either of those Not much Trigger said They re safe Mihul said Quite safe Maybe I should Well the heat s off and it s just a matter now of holding you for Whatzzit There re a couple of other choices One of them has an angle you won t like much either On the other hand it would give you a sporting chance to take off if you re really wild about it And it s entirely in line with my instructions I warned them you re tricky Trigger stopped eating Let s hear that one Mihul tilted the chair back a little farther and studied her a moment Pretty much like I said before Everything friendly and casual Gun a bit swim a bit Go for a ride or soar Lie around in the sun But because of those notions of yours there d be one thing added An un incentive An un incentive Trigger repeated Exactly said Mihul That isn t at all in line with my instructions But you re a pretty dignified little character and I think it should work Just what does this un incentive consist of Trigger inquired warily If you make a break and get away Mihul said that s one thing Something s eating you and I m not sure I like the way this matter s been handled In fact I don t like it So I ll try to stop you from leaving but if it turns out I couldn t I won t hold any grudges Even if I wake up with lumps She paused On the other hand she said there we are together for three four days I don t want to spend them fighting off attempts to clobber me every thirty seconds So any time you try and miss Comteen mama is going to pin you down fast and hot up your seat with whatever is handiest Trigger stared at her She cleared her throat While I m carrying a gun she said shakily Don t be ridiculous Mihul You re not going to gun me for keeps to get out of a licking Mihul said And that s all the Yool can do How else will you stop me Trigger s fingernails drummed the table top briefly She wet her lips I don t know she admitted Of course said Mihul all this unpleasantness can be avoided very easily There s always the fourth method What s that Just give parole No parole Trigger said thinly All right Which of the other ways will it be Trigger didn t hesitate The sporting chance she said The others aren t choices Fair enough said Mihul She stood up and went over to the wall She selected a holster belt from the pair hanging there and fastened it around her I rather thought you d pick it she said She gave Trigger a brief grin Just make sure it s a good opening I will Trigger said Mihul moved to the side table took up the Denton looked at it and slid it into her holster She turned to gaze out the window Nice country she said If you re done with breakfast how about going out right now for a first try at the birds Trigger hefted the coffee pot gently It was about the right weight at that But the range was a little more than she liked considering the un incentive Besides it might crack the monster s skull She set the pot gently down again Great idea she said And I m all finished eating ten Half an hour later there still hadn t been any decent openings Trigger was maintaining a somewhat brooding silence at the moment Mihul beside her in the driver s seat of the tiny sports hopper chatted pleasantly about this and that But she didn t appear to expect any answers There weren t many half hours left to be wasted Trigger stared thoughtfully out through the telescopic ground view plate before her while the hopper soared at a thousand feet toward the two mile square of preserve area which had been assigned to them to hunt over that morning Dimly reflected in the view plate she could see the head of the gun pup who went with that particular area lifted above the seat back behind her He was gazing straight ahead between the two humans absorbed in canine reflections There was plenty of bird life down there Some were original Terran forms maintained unchanged in the U League s genetic banks Probably many more were inspired modifications produced on Grand Commerce game ranches At any other time Trigger would have found herself enjoying the outing almost as much as Mihul Not now Other things kept running through her head Money for example They hadn t returned her own cash to her and apparently didn t intend to at least not until after the interview But Mihul was carrying at least part of their spending money in a hip pocket wallet The rest of it might be in a concealed room safe or deposited with the resort hotel s cashier She glanced over at Mihul again Good friend Mihul never before had looked quite so large lithe alert and generally fit for a rough and tumble That un incentive idea was fiendishly ingenious It was difficult to plan things through clearly and calmly while one s self esteem kept quailing at vivid visualizations of the results of making a mistake The hopper settled down near the center of their territory guided the last half mile by Mihul who had fancied the looks of some shrub cluttered ravines ahead Trigger opened the door on her side The gun pup leaped lightly across the seat and came out behind her He turned to look over his huntresses and gave them a wag a polite but perfunctory one Then he stood waiting for orders Mihul considered him Guess he s in charge here she said She waved a hand at the pup Go find em old boy We ll string along He loped off swiftly a lean brown houndlike creature a Grand Commerce development of some aristocratic Terran breed and probably a considerable improvement on the best of his progenitors He curved around a thick clump of shrubs like a low flying hawk Two plump feather shapes emerald green and crimson whirred up out of the near side of the shrubbery saw the humans before them and rose steeply picking up speed A great many separate clearly detailed things seemed to be going on within the next four or five seconds Mihul swore scooping the Denton out of its holster Trigger already had the Yool out but the gun was unfamiliar she hesitated Fascinated she glanced from the speeding soaring feather balls to Mihul watched the tall woman straighten for an overhead shot left hand grasping right wrist to steady the lightweight Denton and in that particular instant Trigger knew exactly what was going to happen next The Denton flicked forth one bolt Mihul stretched a little more for the next shot Trigger wheeled matter of factly dropping the Yool left elbow close in to her side Her left fist rammed solidly into Mihul s bare brown midriff just under the arch of the rib cage That punch in those precise circumstances would have paralyzed the average person It didn t quite paralyze Mihul She dropped forward doubled up and struggling for breath but already twisting around toward Trigger Trigger stepped across her picked up the Denton shifted its setting thumbed it to twelve hour stunner max and let Mihul have it between the shoulder blades Mihul jerked forward and went limp Trigger stood there shaking violently looking down at Mihul and fighting the irrational conviction that she had just committed cold blooded murder The gun pup trotted up with the one downed bird He placed it reverently by Mihul s outflung hand Then he sat back on his haunches and regarded Trigger with something of the detached compassion of a good undertaker Apparently this wasn t his first experience with a hunting casualty The story Trigger babbled into the hopper s communicator a minute later was that Drura Lod had succumbed to an attack of Dykart fever coma and that an ambulance and a fast flit to a hospital in the nearest city were indicated The preserve hotel was startled but reassuring That the mother should be afflicted with the same ailment as the daughter was news to them but plausible enough Within eight minutes a police ambulance was flying Mihul and Trigger at emergency speeds towards a small Uplands City behind the mountains Trigger never found out the city s name Three minutes after she d followed Mihul s floating stretcher into the hospital she quietly left the building again by a street entrance Mihul s wallet had contained two hundred and thirteen crowns It was enough barely She got a complete change of clothes in the first Automatic Service store she came to and left the store in them carrying the sporting outfit in a bag The aircab she hired to take her to Ceyce had to be paid for in advance which left her eighty two crowns As they went flying over a lake a while later the bag with the sporting clothes and accessories was dumped out of the cab s rear window It was just possible that the Space Scouts had been able to put that tracer material idea to immediate use In Ceyce a short two hours after she d felled Mihul Trigger called the interstellar spaceport and learned that the Dawn City was open to passengers and their guests Birna Drellgannoth picked up her tickets and went on board mingling unostentatiously with a group in a mood of festive leave taking She went fading even more unostentatiously down a hallway when the group stopped cheerfully to pose for a solidopic girl from one of the news agencies She located her cabin after a lengthy search set the door to don t disturb glanced around the cabin and decided to inspect it in more detail later She pulled off her slippers climbed on the outsized divan which passed here for a bunk and stretched out She lay there a while blinking at the ceiling and worrying a little about Mihul Even theoretically a stunner max blast couldn t cause Mihul the slightest permanent damage It might however leave her in a fairly peevish mood after the grogginess wore off since the impact wasn t supposed to be pleasant But Mihul had stated she would hold no grudges over a successful escape attempt and even if they caught up with her again before she got to Manon this attempt certainly had to be rated a technical success They might catch up of course Trigger thought The Federation must have an enormous variety of means at its disposal when it set out seriously to locate one of its missing citizens But the Dawn City would be some hours on its way before Mihul even began to think coherently again She d spread the alarm then but it should be a while before they started to suspect Trigger had left the planet Maccadon was her home world after all If she d just wanted to hole up that was where she would have had the best chance to do it successfully Evalee the first Hub stop was only nine hours flight away Garth lay less than five hours beyond Evalee After that there was only the long subspace run to Manon They d have to work very fast to keep her from leaving the Hub this time Trigger glanced over at the Denton lying by the bedside ComWeb on a little table at the head of the divan thing She was aware of a feeling of great contentment of growing relaxation She closed her eyes By and large she thought all things considered she hadn t come off badly among the cloak and dagger experts She was on her way to Manon Some hours later she slept through the Dawn City s thunderous takeoff When she woke up next she was in semidarkness But she knew where she was and a familiar feeling of low weight told her the ship was in flight She sat up At her motion the area about her brightened and the cabin grew visible again It was rather large oval shaped There were three closed doors in the walls and the walls themselves were light amber of oddly insubstantial appearance A rosy tinge was flowing up from the floor level through them and as the color surged higher and deepened there came an accompanying stir of far off barely audible music The don t disturb sign still reflected dimly from the interior panels of the passage door Trigger found its control switch on the bedstand and shut it off At once a soft chiming sounded from the miniature ComWeb on the bedstand Its screen filled with a pulsing glow and there was a voice This is a recording Miss Drellgannoth the voice told her If Room Service may intrude with an audio message please be so good as to touch the blue circle at the base of your ComWeb Trigger touched the blue circle Go ahead she invited Thank you Miss Drellgannoth said the voice For the duration of the voyage your personal ComWeb will be opened to callers for either audio or visual intrusion only by your verbal permission or by your touch on the blue circle It stopped Another voice picked up This is your Personal Room Stewardess Miss Drellgannoth Forgive the intrusion but the ship will dive in one hour Do you wish to have a rest cubicle prepared No thanks Trigger said I ll stay awake Thank you Miss Drellgannoth As a formality and in accordance with Federation regulations allow me to remind you that Federation Law does not permit the bearing of personal weapons by passengers during a dive Her glance went to the Denton All right she said I won t It s because of dive hallucinations I suppose Thank you very much Miss Drellgannoth Yes it is because of the misapprehensions which may be caused by dive hallucinations May I be of service to you at this time Perhaps you would like me to demonstrate the various interesting uses of your personal ComWeb Cabinet Trigger s eyes shifted to the far end of the cabin A rather large very elegant piece of furniture stood there Its function hadn t been immediately obvious but she had heard of ComWeb Service Cabinets She thanked the stewardess but declined the offer The lady switched off apparently a trifle distressed at not having discovered anything Birna Drellgannoth s personal stewardess might do for Birna right now Trigger went curiously over to the cabinet It opened at her touch and she sat down before it glancing over its panels A remarkable number of uses were indicated which might make it confusing to the average Hub citizen But she had been trained in communications and the service cabinet was as simple as any gadget in its class could get She punched in the ship s location diagram The Dawn City was slightly more than an hour out of Ceyce Port but it hadn t yet cleared the subspace nets which created interlocking and impenetrable fields of energy about the Maccadon System A ship couldn t dive in such an area without risking immediate destruction but the nets were painstakingly maintained insurance against a day when subspace warfare might again explode through the Hub Trigger glanced over the diagrammed route ahead Evalee Garth A tiny green spark in the far remoteness of space beyond them represented Manon s sun Eleven days or so With the money to afford a rest cubicle the time could be cut to a subjective three or four hours But it would have been foolish anyway to sleep through the one trip on a Hub luxury liner she was ever likely to take in her life She set the cabinet to a review of the Dawn City s passenger facilities and was informed that everything would remain at the disposal of waking passengers throughout all dives She glanced over bars fashion shows dining and gaming rooms The Cascade Plunge from the looks of it would have been something for Mihul Our Large Staff of Traveler s Companions just what she needed The Solido Auditorium and the Inferno our Sensations Unlimited Hall A dulcet voice informed her regretfully that Federation Law did not permit the transmission of full SU effects to individual cabins It did however permit a few sample glimpses Trigger took her glimpses sniffed austerely switched back to the fashions There had been a neat little black suit on display there While she didn t intend to start roaming about the ship until it dived and the majority of her fellow travelers were immersed in their rest cubicles she probably still would be somewhat conspicuous in her Automatic Sales dress on a boat like the Dawn City That little black suit hadn t looked at all expensive Twelve hundred forty two Federation credits she repeated evenly a minute later I see Came to roughly eight hundred fifty Maccadon crowns was what she saw May we model it in your suite madam the store manager inquired No thanks Trigger told her Just looking them over a bit She switched off frowned absently at a panel labeled Your Selection of Personalized Illusion Arrangements shook her head snapped the cabinet shut and stood up It looked like she had a choice between being conspicuous and staying in her cabin and playing around with things like the creation of illusion scenes And she was really a little old for that kind of entertainment She opened the door to the narrow passageway outside the cabin and glanced tentatively along it It was very quiet here One of the reasons this was the cheapest cabin they d had available presumably was that it lay outside the main passenger areas To the right the corridor opened on a larger hall which ran past a few hundred yards of storerooms before it came to a stairway At the head of the stairway one came out eventually on one of the passenger levels To the left the corridor ended at the door of what seemed to be the only other cabin in this section Trigger looked back toward the other cabin Oh she said Well hello The other cabin door stood open A rather odd looking little person sat in a low armchair immediately inside it She had lifted a thin green sleeved arm in a greeting or beckoning gesture as Trigger turned She repeated the gesture now Come here girl she called amiably in a quavery old woman voice Well it couldn t do any harm Trigger put on her polite smile and walked down the hall toward the open door A quite tiny old woman it was with a head either shaved or naturally bald dressed in a kind of dark green pajamas Long glassy earrings of the same color pulled down the lobes of her small ears The oddness of the face was due mainly to the fact that she wore a great deal of make up and that the make up was a matching green She twisted her head to the left as Trigger came up and chirped something Another woman appeared behind the door almost a duplicate of the first except that this one had gone all out for pink Tiny things They both beamed up at her Trigger beamed back She stopped just outside the door Greetings said the pink one Greetings Trigger replied wondering what world they came from The style wasn t exactly like anything she d seen before We the green lady informed her with a not unkindly touch of condescension are with the Askab of Elfkund Oh said Trigger in the tone of one who is impressed Elfkund hadn t rung any bells And with whom are you girl the pink one inquired Well Trigger said I m not actually with anybody The smiles faded abruptly They glanced at each other then looked back at Trigger Rather severely it seemed Did you mean the green one asked carefully that you are not a retainer Trigger nodded I m from Maccadon she explained The name is Birna Drellgannoth Maccadon the pink one repeated You are a commoner then young Birna Of course she is The green one looked offended Maccadon She got out of her chair with remarkable spryness and moved to the door It s quite drafty she said looking pointedly past Trigger The door closed on Trigger s face A second later she heard the lock snap shut A moment after that the don t disturb sign appeared Well she thought wandering back to her cabin it didn t look as if she were going to be bothered with excessively friendly neighbors on this trip She had a bath and then discovered a mechanical stylist in a recess beside the bathroom mirror She swung the gadget out into the room set it for a dye removal operation and sat down beneath it A redhead again a minute or so later she switched the machine to Orado styles and left it to make up its electronic mind as to what would be the most suitable creation under the circumstances The stylist hovered above her for over a minute muttering and clucking as it conducted an apparently disapproving survey of the job Then it went swiftly and silently to work When it shut itself off Trigger checked the results in the mirror She wasn t too pleased An upswept arrangement which brought out the bone structure of her face rather well but didn t do much else for her Possibly the stylist had included the Automatic Sales dress in its computations Well it would have to do for her first tour of the ship eleven The bedside ComWeb warned her politely that it was now ten minutes to dive point Waking passengers who experienced subspace distress in any form could obtain immediate assistance by a call on any ComWeb If they preferred they could have their cabins kept under the continuous visual supervision of their personal steward or stewardess The Dawn City s passenger areas still looked rather well populated when Trigger arrived But some of the passengers were showing signs of regretting their decision to stay awake Presently she became aware of a faint queasiness herself It wasn t bad mainly a sensation as if the ship were trying continuously to turn over on its axis around her and not quite making it and she knew from previous experience that after the first hour or so she would be completely free of that She walked into a low dimly lit very swank looking gambling room still well patronized by the hardier section of her fellow travelers searching for a place where she could sit down unobtrusively for a while and let the subspace reaction work itself out A couch beside a closed door near the unlit end of the room seemed about right for the purpose Trigger sat down and glanced around There were a variety of games in progress all unfamiliar to her The players were mostly men but a remarkable number of beautiful women beautifully gowned stood around the tables as observers Traveler s Companions Trigger realized suddenly the Dawn City s employees naturally would be inured to subspace effects From the scraps of talk she could pick up the stakes seemed uniformly high A swirl of vertigo suddenly built up in her again This one was stronger than most for a moment she couldn t be sure whether she was going to be sick or not She stood up stepped over to the door a few feet away pulled it open and went through drawing it shut behind her There had been a shielding black light screen in the doorway On the other side was bottled sunshine She found herself on a long balcony which overlooked a formal garden enclosure thirty feet below There was no one else in sight She leaned back against the wall beside the door closed her eyes and breathed slowly and deeply for some seconds The sickish sensation began to fade When she opened her eyes again she saw the little yellow man He stood motionless at the far end of the garden next to some flowering shrubbery out of which he might have just stepped He seemed to be peering along the sand path which curved in toward the balcony and vanished beneath it below the point where Trigger stood It was sheer fright which immobilized her at first Because there was not anything really human about that small squat manshaped figure A dwarfish yellow demon he seemed evil and menacing The garden she realized suddenly might be an illusion scene Or else The thing moved in that instant It became a blur of motion along the curving path and disappeared under the balcony After a second or so she heard the sound of a door closing some distance away The garden lay still again Trigger stayed where she was her knees shaking a little The fright appeared to have driven every trace of nausea out of her and gradually her heartbeat began to return to normal She took three cautious steps forward to the balcony railing where the tip of a swaying green tree branch was in reach She put her hand out hesitantly felt the smooth vegetable texture of a leaf grasped it pulled it away She moved back to the door and examined the leaf It was a quite real leaf Thin sap formed a bead of amber moisture at the break in the stalk as she looked at it No illusion structure could be elaborated to that extent So she d just had her first dive hallucination and it had been a dilly Trigger dropped the leaf pushed shakily at the balcony door and stepped back through the black light screen into the reassuring murmur of human voices in the gambling room An hour later the ship s loudspeaker system went on It announced that the Dawn City would surface in fifteen minutes because of gravitic disturbances and proceed the rest of the way to Evalee in normal space arriving approximately five hours behind schedule Rest cubicle passengers would not be disturbed unless this was specifically requested by a qualified associate Trigger turned her attention back to her viewer feeling rather relieved She hadn t experienced any further hallucinations or other indications of subspace distress but the one she d had would do her for a while The little viewer library she was in was otherwise deserted and she d been going about her studies there just the least bit nervously Subject of the studies were the Hub s principal games of chance She d identified a few of those she d been watching and one of them did look as if someone who went at it with an intelligent understanding of the odds A part of Trigger kept tut tutting and shaking its head at such reckless notions But another part pointed out that they couldn t be much worse off financially than they were right now So what if they arrived in Manon dead broke instead of practically Besides there was the problem of remaining inconspicuous till they got there On the Dawn City no one whose wardrobe was limited to one Automatic Sales dress was going to remain inconspicuous very long Trigger in toto went on calculating the odds for various possible play combinations She developed her first betting system presently discovered several holes in it and began to develop another The loudspeaker system went on again She was too absorbed to pay much attention to it at first Then she suddenly straightened up and listened frowning The man speaking now was the liner s First Security Officer He was being very polite and regretful Under Section such and such Number so and so of the Federation s Legal Code a cabin by cabin search of the passenger area of the Dawn City had become necessary The persons of passengers would not be searched Passengers might if they wished be present while their cabins were inspected but this was not required Baggage need not be opened providing its spyproofing was not activated Any information revealed by the search which did not pertain to a violation of the Code Section and Number in question would not be recorded and could not be introduced as future legal evidence under any circumstances Complaints regarding the search could be addressed to any Planetary Moderator s office This wasn t good at all Trigger stood up The absence of luggage in her cabin mightn t arouse more than passing interest in the searchers Her gun was a different matter Discreet inquiries regarding a female passenger who carried a double barreled sporting Denton might be one of the check methods used by the Scout Intelligence boys if they started thinking of liners which recently had left Maccadon in connection with Trigger s disappearance There weren t likely to be more than two or three guns of that type on board and it was almost certain that she would be the only woman who owned one She d better go get the Denton immediately and then vanish again into the public sections of the ship Some Security officer with a good memory and a habit of noticing faces might identify her otherwise from the news viewer pictures taken on Manon And he just might start wondering then why she was traveling as Birna Drellgannoth and start to check She paused long enough to get the Legal Code article referred to into the viewer Somebody on board appeared to have got himself murdered She reached the cabin too late A couple of young Security men already were going over it Trigger said hello pleasantly It was too bad but it wasn t their fault They just had a job to do They smiled back at her apologized for the intrusion and went on with their business She sat down and watched them The Denton was there in plain sight Dropping it into her purse now would be more likely to fix it in their memory than leaving it where it was The gadgets they were using were in concealing casings and she couldn t guess what they were looking for by the way they used them It didn t seem that either of them was trying to haul up an identifying memory about her They did look a little surprised when the second cabin closet was opened and found to be as empty as the first but no comments were made about that Two minutes after Trigger had come in they were finished and bowed themselves out of the cabin again They turned then toward the cabin occupied by the ancient retainers of the Askab of Elfkund Trigger left her door open This she wanted to hear if she could She heard The Elfkund door also stayed open while the racket beyond it grew shriller by the moment Finally a ComWeb chimed A feminine voice spoke sternly The Quavering outcries subsided It looked as if Security had been obliged to call on someone higher up in the Elfkund entourage to come to its aid Trigger closed her door grinning On the screen of her secluded library she presently watched a great port shuttle swing in from Evalee to meet the hovering Dawn City It would bring another five hundred or so passengers on board and take off the few who had merely been making the short run from Maccadon to Evalee in style Solidopic operators were quite likely to be on the shuttle so she had decided to keep away from the entry area The transfer operation was carried out very expeditiously probably to make up for some of the time lost on the surface When the shuttle shoved off the loudspeaker announced that normal space flight would be maintained till after the stopover at Garth Trigger wandered thoughtfully back to her cabin She closed the door behind her Then she saw the man sitting by the ComWeb cabinet Her breath sucked in She crouched a little ready to wheel and bolt Take it easy Trigger Major Quillan said He was in civilian clothes of rather dudish cut Trigger swallowed There was too obviously no place to bolt to How did you find me He shrugged Longish story You re not under arrest I m not No said Quillan When we get to Manon the Commissioner will have a suggestion to make to you Suggestion Trigger said warily I believe you re to take back your old Precol job in Manon but as cover for your participation in our little project If you agree to it What if I don t He shrugged again It seems you ll be writing your own ticket from here on out Trigger stared at him wondering Why Quillan grinned New instructions have been handed down he said If you re still curious ask Whatzzit Oh Trigger said Then why are you here I said Quillan am to make damn sure you get to Manon I brought a few people with me Mihul too Trigger asked a shade diffidently No She s on Maccadon Is she how s she doing Doing all right Quillan said She sends her regards and says a little less heft on the next solar plexus you torpedo should be good enough Trigger flushed She isn t sore is she Not the way you mean he considered Not many people have jumped Mihul successfully In her cockeyed way she seemed pretty proud of her student Trigger felt the flush deepen I got her off her guard she said Obviously said Quillan In any ordinary argument she could pull your legs off and tie you up with them Still that wasn t bad Have you talked to anybody since you came on board Just the room stewardess And a couple of old ladies in the next cabin Yeah he said Couple of old ladies What did you talk about Trigger recounted the conversation He reflected nodded and stood up I put a couple of suitcases in that closet over there he said Your personal stuff is in them de tracered Another thing somebody checked over your finances and came to the conclusion you re broke Not exactly broke said Trigger Quillan reached into a pocket pulled out an envelope and laid it on the cabinet Here s a little extra spending money then he said The balance of your Precol pay to date I had it picked up on Evalee this morning Seven hundred twenty eight FC Thanks Trigger said I can use some of that They stood looking at each other Any questions he asked Sure Trigger said But you wouldn t answer them Try me doll said Quillan But let s shift operations to the fanciest cocktail lounge on this thing before you start I feel like relaxing a little For just one girl you ve given us a fairly rough time these last forty eight hours I m sorry Trigger said I ll bet said Quillan Trigger glanced at the closet If he d brought everything along there was a dress in one of those suitcases that would have been a little too daring for Maccadon It should therefore be just about right for a cocktail lounge on the Dawn City and she hadn t had a chance to wear it yet Give me ten minutes to change Fine Quillan started toward the door By the way I m your neighbor now The cabin at the end of the hall she asked startled That s right He smiled at her I ll be back in ten minutes Well that was going to be cosy Trigger found the dress shook it out and slipped into it enormously puzzled but also enormously relieved That Whatzzit Freshening up her make up she wondered how he had induced the Elfkund ladies to leave Perhaps he d managed to have a better cabin offered to them It must be convenient to have that kind of a pull twelve Well we didn t just leave it up to them Quillan said Ship s Engineering spotted a radiation leak in their cabin Slight but definite They got bundled out in a squawking hurry He added They did get a better cabin though Might have been less trouble to get me to move Trigger remarked Might have been I didn t know what mood you d be in Trigger decided to let that ride This cocktail lounge was a very curious place By the looks of it there were thirty or forty people in their immediate vicinity but if one looked again in a couple of minutes there might be an entirely different thirty or forty people around Sitting in easy chairs or at tables standing about in small groups talking drinking laughing they drifted past slowly overhead below sometimes tilted at odd angles fading from sight and presently returning In actual fact she and Quillan were in a little room by themselves and with more than ordinary privacy via an audio block and a reconstruct scrambler which Quillan had switched on at their entry I ll leave us out of the viewer circuit he remarked until you ve finished your questions Viewer circuit she repeated Quillan waved a hand around That he said There are more commercial and industrial spies political agents top class confidence men and whatnot on board this ship than you d probably believe A good percentage of them are pretty fair lip readers and the things you want to talk about are connected with the Federation s hottest current secret So while it s a downright crime not to put you on immediate display in a place like this we won t take the chance Trigger let that ride too A group had materialized at an oblong table eight feet away while Quillan was speaking Everybody at the table seemed fairly high and two of the couples were embarrassingly amorous but she couldn t quite picture any of them as somebody s spies or agents She listened to the muted chatter Some Hub dialect she didn t know None of those people can see or hear us then she asked Not until we want them to Viewer gives you as much privacy as you like Most of the crowd here just doesn t see much point to privacy Like those two Trigger followed his glance At a tilted angle above them a matched pair of black haired black gowned young sirens sat at a small table sipping their drinks looking languidly around Twins Trigger said No said Quillan That s Blent and Company Oh Blent s a lady of leisure and somewhat excessively narcissistic tendencies he explained He gave the matched pair another brief study Perhaps one can t really blame her One of them s her facsimile Blent whichever it is is never without her face Oh Trigger said She d been studying the gowns That she said a trifle enviously is why I m not at all eager to go on display here Eh said Quillan Trigger turned to regard herself in the wall mirror on the right which she had noticed remained carefully unobscured by drifting viewers and viewees A thoughtful touch on the lounge management s part Until we walked in here she explained I thought this was a pretty sharp little outfit I m wearing Hmmm Quillan said judiciously He made a detailed appraisal of the mirror image of the slim green backless half thigh length sheath which had looked so breath taking and seductive in a Ceyce display window Trigger s eyes narrowed a little The major had appraised the dress in detail before It s about as sharp a little outfit as you could get for around a hundred and fifty credits he remarked Most of the items the girls are sporting here are personality conceptions That starts at around ten to twenty times as high I wasn t talking about displaying the dress Now what were those questions Trigger took a small sip of her drink considering She hadn t made up her mind about Major Quillan but until she could evaluate him more definitely it might be best to go by appearances The appearances so far indicated small sips in his company How did you people find me so quickly she asked Next time you want to sneak off a civilized planet Quillan advised her pick something like a small freighter Or hire a small boat to get you out of the system and flag down a freighter for you Plenty of tramp captains will make a space stop to pick up a paying passenger Liners we can check Sorry Trigger said meekly I m still new at this business And thank God for that said Quillan If you have the time and the money it s also a good idea of course to zig a few times before you zag towards where you re really heading Actually I suppose the credit for picking you up so fast should go to those collating computers Oh Yes Major Quillan looked broodingly at his drink for a moment There they sit he remarked suddenly with their stupid plastic faces hanging out Rows of them You feed them something you don t understand They don t understand it either Nobody can tell me they can But they kick it around and giggle a bit and out comes some ungodly suggestion So they helped you find me she said cautiously It was clear that the major had strong feelings about computers Oh sure he said It usually turns out it was a good idea to do what those CCs say Anything unusual that shows up in the area you re working on gets chunked into the things as a matter of course We were on the liners Dawn City reports back a couple of murders Dawn City to the head of the list cry the computers Nobody asks why They just plow into the ticket purchase records And right there are the little Argee thumbprints He looked at Trigger My own bet he said somewhat accusingly was that you were one of those that had just taken off We didn t know about that ticket reservation What I don t see Trigger said changing the subject is why two murders should seem so very unusual There must be quite a few of them after all True said Quillan But not murders that look like catassin killings Oh she said startled Is that what these were That s what Ship Security thinks Trigger frowned But what could be the connection Quillan reached across the table and patted her hand You ve got it he said with approval Exactly No connection Some day I m going to walk down those rows and give them each a blast where it will do the most good It will be worth being broken for Trigger said I thought that catassin planet was being guarded It is It would be very hard to sneak one out nowadays But somebody s breeding them in the Hub Just a few Keeps the price up Trigger grimaced uncomfortably She d seen recordings of those swift clever constitutionally murderous creatures in action You say it looked like catassin killings They haven t found it No But they think they got rid of it Emptied the air from most of the ship after they surfaced and combed over the rest of it with life detectors They ve got a detector system set up now that would spot a catassin if it moved twenty feet in any direction Life detectors go haywire out of normal space don t they she said That s why they surfaced then Quillan nodded You re a well informed doll They re pretty certain it s been sucked into space or disposed of by its owner but they ll go on looking till we dive beyond Garth Who got killed A Rest Warden and a Security officer In the rest cubicle area It might have been sent after somebody there Apparently it ran into the two men and killed them on the spot The officer got off one shot and that set off the automatic alarms So pussy cat couldn t finish the job that time It s all sort of gruesome isn t it Trigger said Catassins are Quillan agreed That s a fact Trigger took another sip She set down her glass There s something else she said reluctantly Yes When you said you d come on board to see I got to Manon I was thinking none of the people who d been after me on Maccadon could know I was on the Dawn City They might though Quite easily Oh said Quillan Yes You see I made two calls to the ticket office One from a street ComWeb and one from the bank If they already had spotted me by that tracer material they could have had an audio pick up on me I suppose I think we d better suppose it said Quillan You had a tail when you came out of the bank anyway His glance went past her We ll get back to that later Right now take a look at that entrance will you Trigger turned in the direction he d indicated They do look like they re somebody important she said Do you know them Some of them That gentleman who looks like he almost has to be the Dawn City s First Captain really is the Dawn City s First Captain The lady he s escorting into the lounge is Lyad Ermetyne The Ermetyne You ve heard of the Ermetynes The Ermetyne Wars Tranest Trigger said doubtfully They re the ones Lyad is the current head of the clan The history of Hub systems other than one s own became so involved so rapidly that its detailed study was engaged in only by specialists Trigger wasn t one Tranest is one of the restricted planets now isn t it she ventured It is Restriction is supposed to be a handicap But Tranest is also one of the wealthiest individual worlds in the Hub Trigger watched the woman with some interest as the party moved along a dim corridor followed by the viewer circuit s invisible pick up Lyad Ermetyne didn t look more than a few years older than she was herself Rather small slender with delicately pretty features She wore something ankle length and long sleeved in lusterless gray with an odd smoky quality to it Isn t she the empress of Tranest or something of the sort Trigger asked Quillan shook his head They ve had no emperors there technically since they had to sign their treaty with the Federation She just owns the planet that s all What would she be doing going to Manon I d like to know Quillan said The Ermetyne s a lady of many interests Now see the plump elderly man just behind her The ugly one with the big head who sort of keeps blinking That one He s Belchik Pluly and Pluly Trigger interrupted The Pluly Lines Yes Why Oh nothing really I heard a friend of mine Pluly s got a yacht out in the Manon System And a daughter Quillan nodded Nelauk How did you know I ve met her Quite a girl that Nelauk Only child of Pluly s old age and he dotes on her Anyway he s been on the verge of being black listed by Grand Commerce off and on through the past three decades But nobody s ever been able to pin anything more culpable on him than that he keeps skimming extremely close to the limits of a large number of laws He s very rich I imagine Trigger said thoughtfully Very He d be much richer even if it weren t for his hobby What s that Harems The Pluly harems rate among the most intriguing and best educated in the Hub Trigger looked at Pluly again Ugh she said faintly Quillan laughed The Pluly salaries are correspondingly high Viewer s dropping the group now so there s just one more I d like you to notice The tall girl with black hair in orange Trigger nodded Yes I see her She s beautiful So she is She s also Space Scout Intelligence Gaya Comes from Farnhart where they use the single name system A noted horsewoman very wealthy socially established Which is why we like to use her in situations like this Trigger was silent a moment Then she said What kind of situation is it I mean what s she doing with Lyad Ermetyne and the others She probably attached herself to the group as soon as she discovered Lyad had come on board Which Quillan said is exactly what I would have told Gaya to do if I d spotted Lyad first Trigger was silent a little longer this time Were you thinking this Lyad could be One of our suspects Well said Quillan judiciously let s say Lyad has all the basic qualifications Since she s come on board we d better consider her When something s going on that looks more than usually tricky Lyad is always worth considering And there s one point that looks even more interesting to me now than it did at first What s that Those two little old ladies I eased out of their rightful cabin Trigger looked at him What about them This about them The Askab of Elfkund is you might way one of the branch managers of the Ermetyne interests in the Hub He is also a hard working heel in his own right But he s not the right size to be one of the people we re thinking about Lyad is He might have been doing a job for her Job she asked She laughed Not with those odd little grannies We know the odd little grannies They re the Askab s poisoners and pretty slick at it They were sizing you up while you were having that little chat doll Probably not for a coffin this time You were just getting the equivalent of a pretty thorough medical check up Presumably though for some sinister ultimate purpose How do you know Trigger asked very uncomfortably One of those little suitcases in their cabin was a diagnostic recorder It would have been standing fairly close to the door while you were there If they didn t take your recordings out before I got there they re still inside They re being watched and they know it It seemed like a good idea to keep the Askab feeling fairly nervous until we found out whether those sweethearts of his had been parked next door to you on purpose Apparently they were Trigger admitted Nice bunch of people Oh they re not all bad Lyad has her points And old Belchik for example isn t really a heel He just had no ethics Or morals And revolting habits Anyway all this brings up the matter of what we should do with you now Trigger set her glass down on the table Refill Quillan inquired He reached for the iced crystal pitcher between them No she said I just want to make a statement State away He refilled his own glass For some reason said Trigger I ve been acting lately the last two days in a remarkably stupid manner Quillan choked He set his glass down hastily reached over and patted her hand Doll he said touched it s come to you At last She scowled at him I don t usually act that way That said Quillan was what had me so baffled According to the Commissioner and others you re as bright in the head as a diamond usually And frankly I know it Trigger said dangerously Don t rub it in I apologize said Quillan He patted her other hand At any rate Trigger said drawing her hands back now that I ve realized it I m going to make up for it From here on out I ll cooperate To the hilt She nodded To the hilt Whatever that is You can t imagine said Quillan how much that relieves me He filled her glass giving her a relieved look I had definite instructions of course not to do anything like grabbing you by the back of the neck flinging you into a rest cubicle and sitting on it guns drawn until we d berthed in Precol Port But I was tempted I can tell you He paused and thought You know he began again that really would be the best No Trigger said indignantly When I said cooperate I meant actively Mihul said I m considered one of the gang in this project From now on I ll behave like one And I ll also expect to be treated like one Hm said Quillan Well there is something you can do all right What s that Go on display here now What for she asked As bait you sweet ninny If the boss grabber is on this ship we should draw a new nibble from him He appraised the green dress in the mirror again His expression grew absent It might be best Trigger suspected a trifle uneasily to keep Major Quillan s thoughts turned away from things like nibbling All right she said briskly Let s do that But you ll have to brief me thirteen She had felt somewhat self conscious for the first two or three minutes But it helped when she caught a glimpse of their own table drifting by among the others and realized that the smiling red headed viewer image over there looked completely at her ease It helped too that Major Quillan turned suddenly into the light but ardent conversation type of companion In the short preceding briefing he had pointed out that a bit of flirting et cetera was a necessary or at least nearly necessary part of the act Trigger was going along with the flirting he could be right about that She intended to stay on the alert for the et cetera They got nibbles very promptly But not quite the right kind The concealed table ComWeb murmured A caller requests to be connected with Major Quillan Is it permitted Oho Quillan said poisonously I suspected we should have stayed off circuit Who s the caller The name given is Keth Deboll Quillan laughed Give the little wolf Major Quillan s regards and tell him it was a good try I ll look him up tomorrow He gave Trigger gentle wink Let em pant he said At a distance She smiled uncertainly If he had a mustache she thought he d be twirling it There were two more calls in the next few minutes of similar nature Quillan rebuffed them cheerfully It was rather flattering in a way She wondered how so many people in the cocktail lounge happened to know Quillan by name When the ComWeb reported the fourth caller it sounded awed The name given is the Lady Lyad Ermetyne it said Quillan beamed Lyad Bless her heart A pleasure Put her through A screen shaped itself on the wall mirror to the right Lyad Ermetyne s face appeared in it Heslet Quillan She smiled So you aren t permanently lost to your friends after all It was a light liquid voice It suited her appearance perfectly Only to the frivolous ones Quillan said His thick black brows went up His face took on a dedicated look I m headed for Manon on duty She nodded Still with the Subspace Engineers And with the rank of major by now Quillan said Congratulations But I d already observed that your fabulous good fortune hasn t deserted you in the least Lyad s glance switched to Trigger she smiled again It was a pleasant easy smile that showed white teeth Would you shield your ComWeb Quillan Shield it Quillan looked surprised Why certainly He reached under the edge of the table The drifting viewer images vanished Go ahead Lyad s eyes turned back to Trigger They were off color eyes like amber or a light wine fringed with long black lashes Very steady very knowing eyes Trigger felt herself tensing Forgive me the discourtesy of inquiring directly the light voice said But you are Trigger Argee aren t you Quillan s hand slapped the table He looked at Trigger and laughed Better give up Trigger I told you you were much more widely known than you believed Well Brule Trigger muttered moodily to the solidopic propped upright against the pillow before her you d bug those pretty blue eyes out if you knew who s invited me to dinner Brule smiled back winningly She lay on her cabin s bed chin on her crossed arms eyes a dozen inches from the pretty blue ones She studied Brule s features soberly Major Heslet Quillan she announced suddenly in cold even tones is a completely impossible character It was no more than the truth She didn t mind so much that Quillan wouldn t tell her what he thought of Lyad Ermetyne s standing on the suspect list now there hadn t really been much opportunity for open conversation so far But he and that unpleasant Belchik Pluly had engaged in some jovial back slapping and rib punching when he and Trigger went over to join Lyad s party at her request and Quillan cried out merrily that he and Belchik had long had one great interest in common ha ha ha Then those two great buddies vanished together for a full hour to take in some very special not publicly programmed Sensations Unlimited in the Dawn City s Inferno Lyad had smiled after them as they left Aren t men disgusting she said tolerantly That reflected on her didn t it She was supposed to be very good friends with somebody like that Of course Quillan must have some bit of Intelligence business in mind with Pluly but there should be other ways of going about it And later when she d been just a little stiff with him Quillan had had the nerve to tell her not to be a prude doll Trigger shoved the solidopic under the pillow Then she rolled on her side and blinked at the wall Naturally Major Quillan s personal habits were none of her business It was just that in less than an hour he was to pick her up and take her to the Ermetyne suite for that dinner She was wondering how she should behave towards him Reasonably pleasant but cool she decided But again not too cool since she d obligated herself to help him find out what the Tranest tycooness was after Any obvious lack of friendliness between them might make the job more difficult Trigger sighed Things were getting complicated again While Quillan was indulging his baser nature among the questionable attractions of the Inferno she d shot three hundred of her Precol credits on a formal black gown on what yesterday she would have considered a rather unbelievable gown Even at an Ermetyne dinner she couldn t actually look dowdy in it And then accompanied by Gaya who had turned out to be a very pleasant but not very communicative companion she d headed for a gambling room to make back the price of the gown It hadn t worked out The game she d particularly studied up on turned out to have a five hundred minimum play Which finished that scheme The system she d planned to use looked very sound but she needed more than one chance to try it in She and Gaya sat down at another table with a different game where you could get in for fifty credits In eight minutes Trigger lost a hundred and twenty and quit Gaya won seventy five It had been an interesting day but with some unsatisfactory aspects to it She hauled the solidopic out from under the pillow again And you she told Brule warningly seem to be playing around with some very bad company my friend Just luck I m coming back to see you don t get into serious trouble She d showered and was studying the black gown s effect before the mirror when the ComWeb chimed Permission for audio intrusion granted Trigger said casually without looking around She was getting used to this sort of thing Thank you Miss Drellgannoth said the ComWeb A package from the Beldon Shop has been deposited in your mail transmitter It signed off Beldon Shop Trigger frowned laid the gown across a chair and went over to the transmitter receptacle She opened it A flat small green package marked The Styles of Beldon slid out A delicate scent came trailing along with it A small white envelope clung to the package s top Inside the envelope was a card It read A peace offering Would you wear it to dinner in token of forgiveness Very humbly Q Trigger found herself smiling and wiped off the smile Then she let it come back No point in staying grim with the character She pulled the package tab and it opened up There were three smaller packages inside She opened the first of these and for a moment gazed doubtfully at four objects like green leaf buds each the size of her thumb She laid them down and opened the second package This one contained a pair of very fancy high heels green and pale gold Out of the third flowed something which was at all events extraordinarily beautiful material of some kind Velvety green shimmeringly alive Its touch was a caress Its perfume was like soft whispers Lifting one end with great care between thumb and finger Trigger let it unfold itself to the floor Tilting her head to the side she studied the shimmering featherweight cat s cradle of jewel green ribbons that hung there Wear it What was it She reflected found her dressing gown in one of the suitcases slipped it on sat down before the ComWeb with the mysterious ribbon arrangement and dialed Gaya s number The Intelligence girl was in her cabin and obviously had been napping But she was wide awake now Shielded here she said quickly as soon as her image cleared Go ahead It s nothing important Trigger said hastily Gaya relaxed It s just she held up the ribbons Major Quillan sent me this Gaya uttered a small squeal Oh Beautiful A Beldon That s what it says Gaya smiled He must like you Oh said Trigger She hesitated Gaya s face grew questioning She asked Is something the matter Probably not said Trigger She considered If you laugh she warned I ll hate you She indicated the ribbons again What is that Beldon really Gaya blinked You haven t been around our decadent circles long enough she said soberly Then she did laugh Don t hate me Trigger Anyway it s very high fashion It s also her glance went quickly over Trigger in excellent taste in this case It s a Beldon gown A gown Some of the beautiful ribbons were wider than others None of them looked as wide as they should have been Not for a gown Dubiously Trigger wriggled and fitted herself into the high fashion item Even before she went over to the mirror in it she knew it wouldn t do Not possibly Styles on many Hub worlds were rather bold of course but she was sure this effect wasn t what the Beldon s designers had intended She stepped in front of the mirror Her eyes widened Brother she breathed That Beldon did go with a woman like stripes went with a tiger After one look you couldn t quite understand why nature hadn t arranged for it first But just as obviously there wasn t nearly enough Beldon around at the moment Trigger checked the time and began to feel harried Probably she d wind up wearing the black gown anyway but at least she wanted to get this matter worked out before she decided She dialed for a drink took two swallows and reflected that she might have put the thing on backwards Or upside down Five minutes later she sat at the dresser tapping her fingers on its glassy surface gazing at the small pile of green ribbons before her and whistling softly There was a thoroughly bared look on her face Suddenly she stood up and went back to the ComWeb Ribbons said the lady who was the Beldon Shop s manager That would be seven hundred forty one A delightful little creation Delightful said Trigger May I see it on the model Immediately madam A few moments later a long limbed model strolled into the view screen displaying an exquisite arrangement of burnt sienna ribbons plus four largish leaf like designs Trigger glanced quickly back to the table where she had put down the strange green buds They had quietly opened out meanwhile She thanked the manager switched off the ComWeb got into the Beldon again and attached her leaf designs where the model had carried them They adhered softly molding themselves to her neatly completing the costume She stepped into the high heels and looked in the mirror again She breathed Brother again Maccadon wouldn t have approved She wasn t sure she approved either But one thing was certain there wasn t the remotest suggestion of dowdiness about a Beldon Objectively impersonally considered the effect was terrific Feeling tawny and feline Trigger slowly lifted one shoulder and lowered it again She turned and strolled toward the full length mirror across the cabin admiring the shifts of the Beldon effect in the flow of motion Terrific With another drink she could do it She dialed another drink and settled down with it beneath the mechanical stylist for a readjustment in the hairdo department This time the stylist purred as it surveyed and hummed while it worked And when the hairdo was done and Trigger moved to get up its flexible little tool pads pulled her back gently into the seat and tilted up her chin For a moment she was startled Then she saw that the stylist had produced a shining make up kit and was opening it This time she was getting the works Twenty minutes later Quillan s voice informed her via the ComWeb that he could be outside her cabin any time she was ready Trigger told him cheerily to come right over picked up her purse and swaggered toward the door smiling a cool feline smile Prude eh she muttered She opened the door Ya arghk cried Quillan shaken fourteen They were out on a terrace near the top of an illusion mountainside in a beautiful evening Dinner had been old style and delicious served by its creators two slim brown skinned red lipped girls who looked much too young to have acquired such skills They were natives of Tranest Lyad said proudly and two of the finest food technicians in the Hub They were at all events the two finest food technicians Trigger had run into as yet The brandy which followed the dinner seemed to represent no let down to the connoisseurs around Trigger She went at it cautiously though she had swallowed a couple of wake up capsules just before they walked into the Ermetyne suite The capsules took effect in the middle of the first course and what she woke up to was a disconcerting awareness of being the center of much careful attention The boys were all giving her plus Beldon the eye intensively even Lyad s giant sized butler or majordomo or whatever she d called him named Virod ogled coldly out of the background Trigger gave them the eye back one after the other in turn and that stopped it Lyad beautifully wearing something which would have passed muster at the U League s Annual Presidential Dinner in Ceyce looked amused It wasn t till the end of the second course that Trigger began to feel at ease again After that she forgot more or less about the Beldon The talk remained light during dinner When they switched off the illusion background for a look at the goings on during the Garth stopover she took the occasion to study her companions in more detail There were three men at the table Lyad and herself Quillan sat opposite her Belchik Pluly s unseemly person in a black silk robe which left his plump arms bare from the elbows down was on Quillan s right The third man fascinated her It was as if some strange cold creature had walked up out of a polar sea to come on board their ship It wasn t so much his appearance though the green tip of a Vethi sponge lying coiled lightly about his neck probably had something to do with the impression Trigger knew about Vethi sponges and their addicts though she hadn t seen either before It wasn t so serious an addiction except perhaps in the fact that it was rarely given up again The sponges soothed jangled nerves stabilized unstable emotions Balmordan didn t look like a man who needed one He was big not as tall as Quillan but probably heavier with strong features a boldly jutting nose Bleak pale eyes He was about fifty and wore a richly ornamented blue shirt and trousers The shirt hung loose perhaps to conceal the flattened contours of his odd companion s body Lyad had introduced him as a Devagas scientist and in a manner which indicated he was a man of considerable importance That meant he was almost certainly a member of the Devagas hierarchy which in itself would have made him very interesting Trigger had run into some of the odd ball missionaries the Devagas kept sending about the Hub and she d sometimes speculated curiously regarding the leaders of that chronically angry unpredictable nation which on its twenty eight restricted worlds formed more than six percent of the population of the Hub The Devagas seemed to like nobody and certainly nobody liked them Balmordan didn t fit her picture of a Devagas leader too badly His manner and talk were easygoing and agreeable But his particular brand of ogle when she first became aware of it had been disquieting Rather like a biologist planning the details of an interesting vivisection Of course he was a biologist But Trigger kept wondering why Lyad had invited him to dinner She was positive for one thing that Belchik Pluly wasn t at all happy about Balmordan s presence Dinner was over before the Garth take off and they switched themselves back to the mountainside and took other chairs A red haired green eyed tanned sinuous young woman called Flam appeared from time to time to renew brandy glasses and pass iced fruits around She gave Trigger coolly speculative looks now and then Then Virod showed up again with a flat tray of what turned out to be a very special brand of tobacco Trigger declined The men made connoisseur type sounds of high appreciation and everybody including Lyad lit up small pipes of a very special brand of coral and puffed away happily Quillan looked up at Virod Hi big boy he said pleasantly How s everything been with you Virod in a wide sleeved scarlet jacket and creased black trousers bowed his shaved bullet head very slightly Everything s been fine Major Quillan he said Thank you He turned and went out of the place Trigger glanced after him Virod awed her a little he was really huge Moving about among them he had seemed like a softly padding elephant And there was an elephant s steady deftness in the way he held out the tiny tobacco trays The Ermetyne winked at Quillan Quillan wrestled Virod to a pindown once she said to Trigger A fifty seven minute round wasn t it Thereabouts Quillan said He added Trigger doesn t know yet that I was a sports bum in my youth Really Trigger said He nodded Come from a long line of sports bums as a matter of fact But I broke tradition went into business for myself finally Nowadays I m old and soft Eh Belchy The two great pals sitting side by side dug elbows at each other and ha ha ha d Trigger winced Still in the same line of business on the side Lyad inquired Quillan looked steadily at her and grinned More or less he said We might Lyad said thoughtfully come back to that later As for that match with Virod she went on to Trigger it was really a terrific event Virod was a Tranest arena professional before I took him into my personal employ and he s very very rarely been beaten in any such contest She laughed And before such a large group of people too I m afraid he s never quite forgiven you for that Quillan I ll keep out of his way Quillan said easily Did you people know Lyad said that the trouble on the way between Maccadon and Evalee was caused by a catassin killing There was a touch of mischief in the question Trigger thought There were assorted startled responses The Ermetyne went briefly over some of the details Quillan had told essentially it was the same story And do you know Belchik what the creature was trying to do It was trying to get into the rest cubicle vaults Just think it might have been sent after you It was rather cruel Pluly s head jerked and he blinked rapidly at Lyad saying nothing He was a badly scared little man at that moment Trigger felt a little sorry for him but not too sorry Belchy s ogle had been of the straightforward loose lipped drooling variety You re safe when you re in one of those things Belchik Quillan said reassuringly Wouldn t you feel a little safer there yourself Lyad If you say they re not even sure they ve killed the creature I probably shall have a cubicle set up here Lyad said But not as protection against a catassin It would never get past Pilli for one thing She looked at Trigger Oh I forgot You haven t met Pilli Virod she called Virod appeared at the far end of the terrace Yes First Lady Bring in Pilli she told him Virod bowed Pilli is in the room First Lady He glanced about went over to a massive easy chair a few feet way and swung it aside Something like a huge ball of golden fur behind it moved and sat up It was an animal of some sort Its head seemed turned toward the group but whatever features it had remained hidden under the fur Then an arm like the arm of a bear reached out and Trigger saw a great furred hand that in shape seemed completely human clutch the chair s edge He was resting Lyad said Not sleeping Pilli doesn t sleep He s a perfect guardian Come here Pilli meet Trigger Argee Pilli swung up on his feet It was an impressively effortless motion There was a thick wide torso on short thick legs under the golden fur The structure was gorilla like Pilli might weigh around four hundred pounds He started silently forward and Trigger felt a tingle of alarm But he stopped six feet away She looked at him Do I say something to Pilli Lyad looked pleased No He s a biostructure A very intelligent one but speech isn t included in his pattern Trigger kept looking at the golden furred nightmare How can he see to guard you through all that hair He doesn t see Lyad said At least not as we do Pilli s part of one of our Tranest experiments the original stock came from the Maccadon life banks a small golden haired Earth monkey The present level of the experiment is on the fancy side it has four hearts for example and what amounts to a second brain at the lower half of its spine But it doesn t come equipped with visual organs Pilli is one of twenty three of the type They have compensatory perception of a kind that is still quite mysterious We hope to breed them past the speech barrier so they can tell us what they do instead of seeing All right Pilli Run along She said to Balmordan I believe he doesn t like that Vethi thing of yours very much Balmordan nodded I had the same impression Perhaps Trigger thought that was why Pilli had been lurking so close to them She watched the biostructure move off down the terrace grotesque and huge She had got its scent as it went past her a fresh rather pleasant whiff like the smell of ripe apples An almost amiable sort of nightmare figure Pilli was the apple smell went with that seemed to fit it But nightmare was there too She found herself feeling rather sorry for Pilli In a way Lyad said Pilli brings us to that matter of business I mentioned this afternoon The group s eyes shifted over to her She smiled We have good scientists on Tranest she said as Pilli I think demonstrates She nodded at Balmordan There are good scientists in the Devagas Union And everyone here is aware that the Treaties of Restriction imposed on both our governments have made it impossible for our citizens to engage seriously in plasmoid research Trigger nodded briefly as the light amber eyes paused on her for a moment Quillan had cautioned her not to show surprise at anything the Ermetyne might say or do If Trigger didn t know what to say herself she was merely to look inscrutable I ll scrut he explained The others won t I ll take over then and you just follow my lead Get it Balmordan Lyad said I understand you are going to Manon to attend the seminars and demonstrations on the plasmoid station That is true First Lady said Balmordan Now I Lyad told the company shall be more honest The information released in those seminars is of no value whatever He she nodded at the Devagas scientist and I are going to Manon with the same goal in mind That is to obtain plasmoids for our government laboratories Balmordan smiled amiably Trigger asked How do you intend to obtain them By offering very large sums of money or equivalent inducements to people who are in a position to get them for me said Lyad Quillan tut tutted disapprovingly The First Lady s mind he told Trigger turns readily to illegal methods When necessary Lyad said undisturbed as it is here How about you sir Quillan asked Balmordan Are we to understand that you also would be interested in the purchase of a middling plasmoid or two I would be naturally Balmordan said But not at the risk of causing trouble for my government Of course not Quillan said He thought a moment You Belchy he asked Pluly looked alarmed No No No he said hastily He blinked wildly I ll stick to the shipping business It s safer Quillan patted him fondly on the shoulder That s one law abiding citizen in this group He winked at Trigger Trigger s wondering he told Lyad why she and I are being told these things Well obviously Lyad said Trigger and you are in an excellent position or will be very soon to act as middlemen in the matter Wha Trigger began astounded Then as all eyes swiveled over to her she checked herself Did you really think she asked Lyad that we d agree to such a thing Certainly not said Lyad I don t expect anyone to agree to anything tonight though it s a safe assumption I m not the only one here who has made sure this conversation is not being recorded and will not be available for reconstruction Well Quillan She smiled How right you are First Lady Quillan said He tapped a breast pocket Scrambler and distorter present and in action And you Balmordan I must admit Balmordan said pleasantly that I thought it wise to take certain precautions Very wise said Lyad Her glance shifted with some amusement in it to Pluly Belchik You re a nerve wracking woman Lyad Belchik said unhappily Yes I m scrambling of course He shuddered I can t afford to take chances Not when you re around Of course not and even so said Lyad there are still reasons why an unconsidered word might be embarrassing in this company So no Trigger I m not expecting anybody to agree to anything tonight I m merely mentioning that I m interested in the purchase of plasmoids Incidentally I d be very much more interested even in seeing you and Quillan enter my employ directly Yes Belchik Pluly had begun giggling wildly I was ha ha having the same idea he gasped About one of ha ha of em anyway I He jerked and came to an abrupt stop transfixed by Trigger s stare Then he reached for his glass blinking at top speed Excuse me he muttered Hardly Belchik said Lyad She gave Trigger a small wink But I can assure you Trigger Argee that you d find my pay and working conditions very attractive indeed It seemed a good moment to look inscrutable Trigger did Serious about that Lyad asked Quillan The Ermetyne said Certainly I m serious Both of you could be of great value to me at present She looked at him a moment Did you ever happen to tell Trigger about the manner in which you re established the family fortune Not in any great detail Quillan said A very good hijacker and smuggler went to waste when you signed up with the Engineers Lyad said But perhaps not entirely to waste Perhaps not acknowledged Quillan He grinned But I m a modest man One fortune s enough for me There was a time you know Lyad said when I was rather afraid it would be necessary to have you killed Quillan laughed There was a time he admitted when I suspected you might be thinking along those lines First Lady Didn t lose too much did you I lost enough Lyad said She wrinkled her nose at him But that s all over and done with And now no more business tonight I promise She turned her head a little Flam she called Yes First Lady said the voice of the red headed girl Bring us Miss Argee s property please Flam brought in a small package of flat disks taped together Lyad took them Sometimes she told Quillan the Askab becomes a little independent He s been spoken to Here you keep them for Trigger She tossed the package lightly over to them Quillan put out a hand and caught it Thanks he said He put the package in a pocket I ll call off my beagles Suit yourself as to that said the Ermetyne It won t hurt the Askab to stay frightened a little longer She checked herself The room s ComWeb was signaling Virod went over to it A voice came through The Garth Manon subspace run begins in one hour Rest cubicles have been prepared That means me Belchik Pluly said He climbed hastily to his feet Can t stand dives Get hallucinations Nasty ones He staggered a little then and Trigger realized for the first time that Belchy had got pretty thoroughly drunk Better give our guest a hand Virod Lyad called over her shoulder Happy dreams Belchik Are you going by Rest Trigger No You re not of course Quillan Balmordan The Devagas scientist also shook his head Then by all means Lyad said let s stay together a little while longer fifteen She said Trigger is a remarkable woman Yeah said Quillan Remarkable May I ask you finally a few pertinent questions Trigger inquired humbly Not here sweet stuff said Quillan You re a bossy sort of slob Heslet Quillan she said equably Quillan didn t answer They had come down the stairway to the storerooms level and were walking along the big lit hallway toward their cabins Trigger felt pleasantly relaxed But she did have a great many pertinent questions to ask Quillan now and she wanted to get started on them Oh she said suddenly Just as suddenly Quillan s hand was on her shoulder moving her along Hush now he said And keep walking But you saw it didn t you Trigger asked trying to look back to the small open door into the storerooms they d just passed Quillan sighed Certainly he said Guy in space armor But what s he doing there Checking something I suppose His hand left her shoulder and for just a moment his finger rested lightly across her lips Trigger glanced up at him He was walking on beside her not looking at her All right she thought she could take a hint But she felt tense and uncomfortable now Something was going on again apparently They turned into the side passage and came up to her cabin Trigger started to turn to face him and Quillan picked her up and went on without a noticeable break in his stride Close to her ear his voice whispered Explain in a moment Dangerous here As the door to the end cabin closed behind them he put her back on her feet He looked at his watch We can talk here he said But there may not be much time for conversation He gestured toward a table against the wall Take a look at the setup Trigger looked The table was littered with instruments like an electronic workbench A visual screen showed a view of both her own cabin and a section of the passage outside it up to the point where it entered the big hall What is it she asked uncertainly Essentially said Quillan we ve set up a catassin trap Catassin Trigger squeaked That s right Don t get too nervous though I ve caught them before Used to be a sort of specialty of mine And there s one thing about them they ll blab their pointed little heads off if you can get one alive and promise it its catnip He d shucked off his jacket and taken out of it a very large handgun with a bell shaped mouth He laid the gun down next to the view screen In case he said unreassuringly Now just a moment He sat down in front of the view screen and did something to it All right he said then We re here and set Probability period starts in three minutes continues for sixty Signal on any blip Otherwise no gabbing And remember they re fast Don t get sappy There was no answer Quillan did something else to the screen and stood up again He looked broodingly at Trigger It s those damn computers again he said I don t see any sense in it In what she asked shakily Everything that s happening around here is being fed back to them at the moment he said When they heard about our invite to Lyad s dinner party and who was to be present they came up with a honey In the time period I mentioned a catassin is supposed to show up at your cabin They give it a pretty high probability Trigger didn t say anything If she had she probably would have squeaked again Now don t worry he said squeezing her shoulder reassuringly between a large thumb and four slightly less large fingers Nice muscle he said absently The cabin s trapped and I ve taken other precautions He massaged the muscle gently Probably the only thing that will happen is that we ll sit around here for an hour or so and then we ll have a hearty laugh together at those foolish computers He smiled I thought Trigger said without squeaking that everybody was pretty sure it was dead Quillan frowned Well that s something else again There are at least two ways I know of to sneak it past that search Jump it out and in with a subtub is one they could have done that from their own cabin as soon as they had its pattern So I don t really think it s dead It s just Quillan a tiny voice said from the viewer He turned took two steps and sat down fast before the viewer Go ahead Fast motion in B section Going your way Fast motion A thought flicked up Quillan Trigger began He raised a shushing hand Get a silhouette he asked His hands went to a set of control switches and stayed there No Pickup shows a haze like in the reconstruct An instant s pause Leaving B section Motion in C section said another voice Quillan said All right It s coming No more verbal reports unless it changes direction If you want to stay alive don t move unless you re in armor There was silence Quillan sat unmoving eyes fixed on the screen Trigger stood just behind him Her legs had begun to tremble She d better tell him Quillan For an instant in the screen there was something like heat shimmer at the far end of the passage Then she saw her cabin door pop open The interior of the cabin showed in a brief flare of blue light In it was a shape It vanished instantly again She heard Quillan make a shocked incredulous sound His left hand slashed at a switch on the panel Twenty feet from them just behind the closed door to the passage was a splatting noise like a tremendous slap Then another noise strangely like a brief cloudburst Then silence again She realized Quillan was on his feet beside her the oversized gun in his hand It was pointed at the door His eyes switched suddenly from the door to the screen and back again She felt him relaxing slowly Then she discovered she was clutching a handful of his shirt along with a considerable chunk of tough skin She went on clutching it Fly swatter got it he said Whew He looked down and patted the clutching hand No catassin The trap in the cabin just wasn t fast enough Had a gravity mine outside our door just in case That was barely fast enough For once Quillan looked almost awed L l l like Trigger began She tried again Like a little yellow man You saw it In the cabin Yes Never saw anything just like it before Trigger pressed her lips together to make them stay steady I have she said That s what I was trying to tell you Quillan stared at her for an instant You ll tell me about it in a couple of minutes I ve got some quick work to do first He checked himself A wide grin spread suddenly over his face Know something doll What The damn computers Major Quillan said happily They goofed The gravity mine would have reduced almost any life form which moved into its field to a rather thin smear but there wasn t even that left of the yellow demon shape Something presumably something it was carrying had turned it into a small blaze of incandescent energy as the mine flattened it out Which explained the sound like a cloudburst That had been the passage s automatic fire extinguishers going into brief but correspondingly violent action Quillan s group stayed out of sight for the time being He d barely got the mine put away along with a handful of warped metal slugs which was what the mine had left of their attacker s mechanical equipment and Trigger s cabin door locked again when three visitors came zooming down the storerooms hall in a small car A ship s engineer and two assistants had arrived to check on what had started the extinguishers They may Quillan said hopefully just go away again He and Trigger were watching the engineers through the viewer which had been extended to cover their end of the passage They didn t just go away again They checked the extinguishers looked at the floor still wet but rapidly absorbing the last drops of the brief deluge They exchanged puzzled comment They checked everything once more Finally the leader made use of the door announcer and asked if he might intrude Quillan switched off the viewer Come in he said resignedly The door opened The three glanced at Quillan and then at Trigger plus Beldon Their eyes widened only slightly Duty on the Dawn City produced hardened men Neither Quillan nor Trigger could offer the slightest explanation as to what had started the extinguishers The engineers apologized and withdrew The door closed again Quillan switched on the viewer Their voices came back into the cabin as they climbed into their car So that s how it happened one of the assistants was saying reflectively Right said the ship s engineer Like to burst into flames myself Ha ha ha They drove off Trigger flushed She looked at Quillan Perhaps I ought to get into something else she said Now that the party s over Perhaps Quillan admitted I ll have Gaya bring something down We want to stay out of your cabin for an hour or so till everything s been checked There ll be a few conferences to go through now Gaya arrived next with clothes Trigger retired to the cabin s bathroom with them and came out a few minutes later dressed again Meanwhile the Dawn City s First Security Officer also had arrived and was setting up a portable restructure stage in the center of the cabin He looked rather grim but he also looked like a very much relieved man I suggest we run your sequence off first Major he said Then we can put them on together and compare them Trigger sat down on a couch beside Gaya to watch She d been told that the momentary view of the little demon shape in the cabin had been deleted from Security s copy of their own sequence and wasn t to be mentioned Otherwise there really was not too much to see What the attacking creature had used to blur the restructure wasn t clear except that it wasn t a standard scrambler Amplified to the limits of clarity and stepped down in time to the limit of immobility all that emerged was a shifting haze of energy which very faintly hinted at a dwarfish human shape in outline A rather unusually small and heavy catassin the Security chief pointed out would present such an outline That something quite material was finally undergoing devastating structural disorganization on the gravity mine was unpleasantly obvious but it produced no further information The sequence ended with the short blaze of heat which had set off the extinguishers Then they ran the restructure of the preceding double killing Trigger watched gulping a little till it came to the point where the haze shape actually was about to touch its victims Then she studied the carpet carefully until Gaya nudged her to indicate the business was over Catassins almost invariably used their natural equipment in the kill it was a swift process of course but shockingly brutal and Trigger didn t care to remember what the results looked like in a human being Both men had been killed in that manner and the purpose obviously was to conceal the fact that the killer was not a catassin but something even more efficient along those lines It didn t occur to the Security chief to question Trigger A temporal restructure of a recent event was a far more reliable witness than any set of human senses and memory mechanisms He left presently reassured that the catassin incident was concluded It startled Trigger to realize that Security did not seem to be considering seriously the possibility of discovering the human agent behind the murders Quillan shrugged Whoever did it is covered three ways in every direction The chief knows it He can t psych four thousand people on general suspicions and he d hit mind blocks in every twentieth passenger presently on board if he did Anyway he knows we re on it and that we have a great deal better chance of nailing the responsible characters eventually More information for the computers eh Trigger said Uh huh You got this little chunk the hard way I feel she observed True Quillan admitted But we have to get it any way we can till we get enough to move on Then we move He looked at her with an air of regarding a new idea You know he said you don t do badly for an amateur She doesn t do badly Gaya s voice said behind Trigger for anybody How do you people feel about a drink I thought I could use one myself after looking at the chief s restructure Trigger felt herself coloring Praise from the cloak and dagger experts For some reason it pleased her immensely She turned her head to smile at Gaya standing there with three glasses on a tray Thanks she said She took one of the glasses Gaya held the tray out to Quillan and took the third glass herself It was some five minutes later when Trigger remarked You know I m getting sleepy Quillan looked around the viewer equipment he and Gaya were dismantling Why not hit the couch over there and take a nap he suggested It ll be about an hour before the boys can get down here for the real conference Good idea Trigger yawned finished her drink put the glass on a table and wandered over to the couch She stretched out on it A drowsy somnolence enveloped her almost instantly She closed her eyes Ten minutes later Gaya standing over her announced Well she s out Fine said Quillan packaging the rest of the equipment Tell them to haul in the rest cubicle I ll be done here in a minute Then you and the lady warden can take over Gaya looked down at Trigger There was a trace of regret in her face I think she said she s going to be fairly displeased with you when she wakes up and finds she s on Manon Wouldn t doubt it said Quillan But from what I ve seen of that chick she s going to get fairly displeased with me from time to time on this operation anyway Gaya looked at his back Major Quillan she said would you like a tip from a keen eyed operator Go ahead ole keen eyed op Quillan said in kindly tones Not that you don t have it coming boy said Gaya But watch yourself This one is dangerous This one could sink you for keeps You re going out of your mind doll said Quillan sixteen The Precol headquarters dome on Manon Planet was still in the spot where Trigger had left it looking unchanged but everything else in the area seemed to have been moved improved expanded or taken away entirely and unfamiliar features had appeared In the screens of Commissioner Tate s Precol offices Trigger could see both the new metropolitan sized spaceport on which the Dawn City had set down that morning and the towering glassy structures of the giant shopping and recreation center which had been opened here recently by Grand Commerce in its bid for a cut of prospective outworld salaries The salaries weren t entirely prospective either Ten miles away on the other side of Headquarters dome new squares of living domes were sprouting up daily At this morning s count they housed fifty two thousand people The Hub s major industries and assorted branches of Federation government had established a solid foothold on Manon Trigger turned her head as Holati Tate came into the office He closed the door carefully behind him How s the little critter doing he asked Still absorbing the goop Trigger said She held Mantelish s small mystery plasmoid cupped lightly between thumbs and fingers its bottom side down in a shallow bowl half full of something which Mantelish considered to be nutritive for plasmoids or at least for this one Its sides pulsed lightly and regularly against her palms The level of the stuff keeps going down she added Good said Holati He pulled a chair up to the table and sat down opposite her He looked broodingly at plasmoid one hundred thirteen A You really think this thing likes me personally Trigger inquired Her boss said It s eating isn t it And moving There were a couple of days before you got here when it looked pretty dead to me Hard to believe Trigger observed that a sort of leech looking thing could distinguish between people This one can Do you get any sensations while holding it Sensations She considered Nothing particular It s just like I said the other time little Repulsive is rather nice to feel For you he said I didn t tell you everything You rarely do Trigger remarked I ll tell you now said Holati The day after we left when it started acting very agitated and then very droopy Mantelish said it might be missing the female touch it had got from you He was being facetious I think But I couldn t see any reason not to try it so I called in your facsimile and had her sit down at the table where the thing was lying Yes Well first it came flying up to her crying Mama Not actually of course Then it touched her hand and recoiled in horror Trigger raised an eyebrow It looked like it he insisted We all commented on it So then she reached out and touched it Then she recoiled in horror Why She said it had given her a very nasty electric jolt Apparently like the one it gave Mantelish Trigger glanced down dubiously at Repulsive Gee thanks for letting me hold it Holati It seems to have stopped eating now by the way Or whatever it does Doesn t look much fatter if any does it The Commissioner looked No he said And if you weighed it you d probably find it still weighs an exact three and a half pounds Mantelish feels the thing turns any food intake directly into energy Then it should be able to produce a very nice jolt at the moment Trigger commented Now what do I do with Repulsive Holati took a towel from beneath the table and spread it out Absorbent material he said Lay it on that and just let it dry That s what we used to do Trigger shook her head Next thing I ll be changing its diapers It isn t that bad the Commissioner said Anyway you will adopt baby won t you I suppose I have to She placed the plasmoid on the towel wiped her hands and stepped back from it What happens if it falls on the floor Nothing Holati said It just moves on in the direction it was going Pretty hard to hurt those things In that case Trigger said let s check out its container now The Commissioner took Repulsive s container out of a desk safe and handed it to her Its outer appearance was that of a neat modern woman s handbag with a shoulder strap It had an antigrav setting which would reduce its overall weight with the plasmoid inside down to nine ounces if Trigger wanted it that way It also had a combination lock unmarked virtually invisible the settings of which Trigger already had memorized Without knowing the settings a determined man using a high powered needle blaster might have opened the handbag in around nine hours A very special job Trigger ran through the settings opened the container and peered inside Rather cramped she observed Not for one of them We needed room for the gadgetry Yes she said Subspace rotation She shook her head Is that another Space Scout invention No said Holati They stole it from Subspace Engineers Engineers don t know we have it yet Far as I know nobody else has got it from them Go ahead give it a try I was going to Trigger snapped the container shut slipped the strap over her shoulder and stood straight left hand closed over the lower rim of the purselike object She shifted the ball of her thumb and the tip of her middle finger to the correct spots and began to apply pressure Then she started Handbag and strap had vanished Feels odd She smiled And to bring it back I just have to be here the same place and say those words He nodded Want to try that now Trigger waved her left hand gently through the air beside her What happens she asked if the thing surfaces exactly where my hand happens to be It won t surface if there s anything bulkier than a few dust motes in the way That s one improvement the Sub Engineers haven t heard about yet Well She glanced around picked up a plastic ruler from the desk behind her and moved back a cautious step She waved the ruler s tip gingerly about in the area where the handbag had been Come Fido she said Nothing happened She drew the ruler back Come Fido Handbag and strap materialized in mid air and thumped to the floor Convinced Holati asked He picked up the handbag and gave it back to her It seems to work How long will that little plasmoid last if it s left in subspace like that He shrugged Indefinitely probably They re tough We know that twenty four hours at a stretch won t bother it in the least so we ve set that as the limit it s to stay rotated except in emergencies And you and one other person I m not to know about but who isn t anywhere near here can also bring it back Yes If we know the place from which it s been rotated So the agreement is that again except in absolute emergencies it will be rotated only from one of the six points specified and known to all three of us Trigger nodded She opened the container and went over to the table where the plasmoid still lay on its towel It was dry by now She picked it up You re a lot of trouble Repulsive she told it But these people think you must be worth it She slipped it into the container and it seemed to snuggle down comfortably inside Trigger closed the handbag lightened it to half its normal weight slipped the strap back over her left shoulder And now she inquired what am I to do with the stuff I usually keep in a purse You ll be in Precol uniform while you re here We ve had a special uniform made for you Extra pockets Trigger sighed Oh they re quite inconspicuous and convenient he assured her We checked with the girls on that I ll bet she said Did they okay the porgee pouch too Sure Porgee doping is a big thing all over the Hub at the moment Among the ladies anyway Shows you re the delicate sort or something like that I forget what they said Want to start carrying it Hand it over Trigger said resignedly I did see quite a few pouches on the ship Might as well get people used to thinking I ve turned into a porgee sniffer Holati went back to the desk safe and took out a flat pouch the length of his hand but narrower He gave it to her It appeared to be worked of gold thread one side was studded with tiny pearls the opposite surface was plain Trigger laid the plain side against the cloth of her skirt just below the right hip and let go It adhered there She stretched her right leg out to the side and considered the porgee pouch Doesn t look too bad she conceded That s real porgee in the top section The real article Close to nine hundred and fifty credits worth Suppose somebody wants to borrow a sniff Wouldn t be good to have them fumbling around the pouch very much They can t said the Commissioner That s why we made it porgee When you buy a supply it has to be adjusted to your individual chemistry exactly That s mainly what makes it expensive Try using someone else s and it ll flip you across the room Better get this adjusted to my chemistry then I might have to take a demonstration sniff now and then to make it look right We ve already done that he said Good said Trigger Now let s see She straightened up left hand closed lightly around the bottom of the purse right hand loose at her side Her eyes searched the office briefly Some object around here you don t particularly value she asked Something largish Several the Commissioner said He glanced around That overgrown flower pot in the corner is one Why Just practicing said Trigger She turned to face the flower pot That will do Now here I come along thinking of nothing She started walking toward the flower pot Then suddenly in front of me there stands a plasmoid snatcher She stopped in mid stride Handbag and strap vanished as her right hand slapped the porgee pouch The Denton popped into her palm The flower pot screeched and flew apart Golly she said startled Come Fido Handbag and strap reappeared and she reached out and caught the strap She looked around at Commissioner Tate Sorry about your pot Holati I was just going to shake it up a little I forgot you people had been handling my gun I keep it switched to stunner myself when I m carrying it she added pointedly Perfectly all right about the pot the Commissioner said I should have warned you Otherwise I d say all you d need is a moment to see them coming Trigger spun the Denton to its stunner setting and laid it back inside the slit which had appeared along the side of the porgee pouch She ran thumb and finger tip along the length of the slit and the pouch was sealed again That s the part that s worrying me she admitted When Trigger presented herself at Commissioner Tate s personal quarters early that evening she found him alone Sit down he said I ve been trying to get hold of Mantelish for the past hour He s over on the other side of the planet again Trigger sat down and lifted an eyebrow Should he be I don t think so said Holati But I ve been overruled on that He s still the best man the Federation has working on the various plasmoid problems so I m not to interfere with his investigations any more than I can show is absolutely necessary It s probably all right Those U League guards of his aren t a bad group If they compare with the boys the League had watching the Plasmoid Project they should be just about tops Trigger said The Space Scouts thank you for those kind words the Commissioner told her Those weren t League guards When it came to deciding who was to keep an eye on you I overruled everybody She smiled I might have guessed it What s there for the professor to be investigating on the other side of Manon He s hunting for some theoretical creatures he calls wild plasmoids Wild plasmoids Uh huh His idea is that some of the plasmoids the Old Galactics were using on Manon might have got away from them or just been left lying around so to speak and could have survived till now He thinks they might even be reproducing themselves He s looking for them with a special detector he built Trigger held up a finger on which was a slim gold ring with a small green stone in it Like this one she asked He s got a large version of that type of detector with him too But he thinks that if any wild plasmoids are around they re likely to be along the lines of one hundred thirteen A So he s also constructed a detector which reacts to one hundred thirteen A I see Trigger was silent a moment Does Mantelish have any idea why Repulsive is the only plasmoid known to which our ring detectors don t react Apparently he does Holati said But when he starts in on those subjects I find him difficult to follow He looked soberly at Trigger There are times he confessed when I suspect Professor Mantelish is somewhat daft But probably he s just so brilliant that he keeps fading beyond my mental range Trigger laughed My father used to come home from a session with Mantelish muttering the same sort of thing She glanced at the ring again By the way have any plasmoids actually been stolen around here for us to detect He nodded Quite a few have been snitched from Harvest Moon and various storage points by now I wouldn t be surprised if some of them turn up here in the dome eventually Not that it s a serious loss What the thieves have been getting away with is small stuff plasmoid nuts and bolts so to speak Still each of those would still fetch around a hundred thousand credits if you offered them to the right people Incidentally if asking you to this conference has interfered with any personal plans just say so We can put it off till tomorrow Especially since it s beginning to look as if Mantelish won t make it here either Either Trigger said Quillan s already had to cancel He got involved with something during the afternoon Oh she said coolly She looked at her watch I do have a dinner date with Brule Inger in an hour and a half But you said this meeting wasn t to take more than an hour anyway didn t you He nodded Then I m free My quarters are arranged and I m ready to go back on my old job in the morning Fine said the Commissioner There are things I wanted to discuss with you privately anyway If we can t get through to Mantelish in another ten minutes we ll go ahead with that I would have liked to have Quillan here to fill us in with data about some of the top level crooks in the Hub They re a specialty of his I don t know too much about them myself He paused That Lyad Ermetyne now he said looks as if she either already is part of the main problem or is working very hard to get there She s had a Tranest warship stationed here for the past two weeks A thing called the Aurora Trigger was startled But warships aren t allowed in Manon System It isn t in the system It s stationed a half light year away where it has a legal right to be Nothing to worry about as such It s just a heavy armed frigate which is the limit Tranest is allowed to build Since it s Lyad s private boat I imagine it s been souped up with everything they could throw in Anyway the fact that she sent it here ahead of her indicates she isn t just dropping in for a casual visit She made that pretty clear herself Trigger said Why do you think she s being so open about it He shrugged Might have a number of reasons One could be that she d get the beady eye anyway as soon as she showed up here When Lyad goes anywhere it s usually on business After Quillan reported on your dinner party I got all the information I could on her The First Lady stacks up as a tough cookie Also smart Most of those Ermetynes wind up being dead brained by some loving relative and apparently they have to know how to whip up a sharp brew of poison before they re let into kindergarten Lyad s been top dog among them since she was eighteen His head turned A bell had begun pinging in the next room He stood up Probably Mantelish s outfit on the transmitter he said I told them to call as soon as they located him He stopped at the door Care for a drink Trigger girl You know where the stuff is Not just now thanks The Commissioner came back in a couple of minutes Darn fool got lost in a swamp They found him finally but he s too tired to come over now He sat down and scratched his chin thoughtfully Do you remember the time you passed out on the Harvest Moon he asked Trigger looked at him puzzled The time I what Passed out Fainted Went out cold I You re out of your mind Holati I never fainted in my life Reason I asked he said is that I ve been told a spell in a rest cubicle same thing as a rest cubicle anyway only it s used for therapy sometimes resolves amnesias Amnesias What are you talking about The Commissioner said I m talking about you This is bound to be a jolt Trigger girl Might have been easier after a drink But I ll just give it to you straight About a week after Mantelish and his U League crew first arrived here you did pass out on one occasion while we were on the Harvest Moon with them And afterwards you didn t remember doing it I didn t Trigger said weakly No I thought it might have cleared up and you just had some reason for not wanting to mention it He got to his feet Like that drink now before I go on with the details She nodded seventeen Holati Tate brought her the drink and went on with the details Trigger and he and a dozen or so of the first group of U League investigators had been in what was now designated as Section fifty two of Harvest Moon The Commissioner was by himself checking over some equipment which had been installed in one of the compartments After a while Doctor Azol joined him and told him Mantelish and the others had gone on to another section Holati and Azol finished the check up together and were about to leave the area to catch up with the group when Holati saw Trigger lying on the floor in an adjoining compartment You seemed to be in some kind of coma he said We picked you up and put you into a chair by one of the survey screens and were trying to get out a call on Azol s suit communicator to the ambulance boat when you suddenly opened your eyes You looked at me and said Oh there you are I was just going to go looking for you It was obvious that you didn t realize anything unusual had happened Azol started to say something but I stepped on his foot and he caught on In fact he caught on so fast that I became a little suspicious of him Poor Azol Trigger said Poor nothing the Commissioner said cryptically I ll tell you about that some other time I cautioned Doctor Azol to say nothing to anybody until the incident had been clarified in view of the stringent security precautions being practiced supposedly being practiced he amended Then he d returned to Manon Planet with Trigger immediately where she was checked over by Precol s medical staff Physically there wasn t a thing wrong with her And that said Trigger feeling a little frightened is something else I don t remember Well you wouldn t the Commissioner said You were fed a hypno spray first You went out for three hours When you woke up you thought you d been having a good nap Since the medics were sure you hadn t picked up some odd plasmoid infection I wanted to know just what else had happened on Harvest Moon One of those scientific big shots might also have used a hypno spray on you with the idea of turning you into a conditioned assistant for future shenanigans Trigger grinned faintly You do have a suspicious mind The grin faded Was that what they were going to find out in that mind search interview on Maccadon I skipped out on It s one of the things they might have looked for he agreed Trigger gazed at him very thoughtfully for a moment Well I loused that deal up she remarked But why is everybody She shook her head Excuse me Go on The Commissioner went on Old Doc Leeharvis was handling the hypnosis herself She hit what she thought might be a mind block when she tried to get you to remember what happened We know now it wasn t a mind block But she wouldn t monkey with you any farther and told me to get in an expert So I called the Psychology Service s headquarters on Orado Trigger looked startled then laughed The eggheads You went right to the top there didn t you Tried to said Holati Tate It s a good idea when you want real service They told me to stay calm and to say nothing to you An expert would be shipped out promptly Was he Yes Trigger s eyes narrowed a little Same old hypno spray treatment Right said Commissioner Tate He came sprayed investigated Then he told me to stay calm and went off looking puzzled Puzzled she said If I hadn t known before that experts come in all grades the Commissioner said I d know it now That first one they sent was just sharp enough to realize there might be something involved in the case he wasn t getting But that was all Trigger was silent a moment So there ve been more of those investigations I don t know about she observed her voice taking on an edge Uh huh the Commissioner said cautiously How many Seven Trigger flushed straightened up eyes blazing and pronounced a very unladylike word Excuse me she added a moment later I got carried away Perfectly all right said the Commissioner I ve been getting just a bit fed up anyway Trigger went on voice and color still high with people knocking me for a loop one way or another whenever they happen to feel like it Don t blame you a bit he said And please don t think I don t appreciate your calling in all those experts I do It s just their sneaky underhanded secretive methods I don t go for Exactly how I feel about it said the Commissioner Trigger stared at him suspiciously You re a pretty sneaky type yourself she said Well excuse the blowup Holati They probably had some reason for it Have they found out anything at all with all the spraying and investigating Oh yes They seem to have made considerable progress The last report I had from them about a month ago shows that the original amnesia has been completely resolved Trigger looked surprised If it s been resolved she said reasonably why don t I remember what happened You aren t supposed to become conscious of it before the final interview I don t know the reason for that But the memory is available now On tap so to speak They ll give you a cue and then you ll remember it Just like that eh She paused So the Psychology Service is Whatzzit Whatzzit said the Commissioner She explained about Whatzzit He grinned Yes he said They re the ones who ve been giving the instructions as far as you re concerned Trigger was silent a moment I ve heard she said the eggheads have terrific pull when they want to use it You don t hear much about them otherwise Let me think just a little Go ahead said Holati A minute ticked away What it boils down to so far Trigger said then is still pretty much what you told me on Maccadon The Psychology Service thinks I know something that might help clean up the plasmoid problem Or at least help explain it He nodded And the people who ve been trying to grab me very probably are doing it for exactly the same reason He nodded again That s almost certain Do you think the eggheads might already have figured out what the connection is The Commissioner shook his head If they had we d be doing something about it The Federation Council is very nervous Well Trigger said She pursed her lips That Lyad she said What about her She tried to hire me said Trigger Major Quillan reported it I suppose Sure And it wouldn t be just to steal some stupid plasmoid Especially since you say a number of small ones are already available Then there re the ones that raiders picked up in the Hub She probably has a collection by now He nodded Probably She seems to know quite a bit about what s been going on Very likely she does Let s grab her said Trigger We can do it quietly And she s too big to be mind blocked We d get part of the answer Perhaps all of it Something flared briefly in the Commissioner s small gray eyes He reached over and patted her knee You re a girl after my own heart Trigger girl he said I m for it But half the Council would have fainted dead away if they d heard you make that suggestion They re as touchy as that she asked disappointed Yes and you can t quite blame them Fumbles could be pretty bad When it comes to someone around Lyad s level our own group is restricted to defensive counteraction If we get evidence against her it ll be up to the diplomats to decide what s to be done about it Tactfully We wouldn t be further involved Trigger nodded watching him Go on Well defensive counteraction can cover a lot of things of course If we actually run into the First Lady while we re engaged in it we ll hold her as long as we can And from all accounts now that she s showed up to take personal charge of things around here we can expect some very fast very direct action from Lyad How fast My own guess said the Commissioner would be around a week If she hasn t moved by then we might help things along a little Make a few of those openings for her eh Well that doesn t sound too bad Trigger reflected Then there s Point Number Two she said What s that She grimaced I m not real keen on it she confessed but I think we d better do something about that interview with Whatzzit I ducked out of If they still want to talk to me They do Very much so What s that business about their saying it was okay now for me to go on to Manon Commissioner Tate tugged gently at his left ear lobe Frankly he said that s something that shook me a little Shook you Why It s that matter of experts coming in grades The upper ranks in the Psychology Service are extremely busy people I understand After your first interview we were shifted upward promptly A couple of middling high bracket investigators took over for a while But after the fourth interview I was told I d have to bring you to the Hub to let somebody really competent handle the next stage of whatever they ve been doing They said they couldn t spare anybody of that caliber for a trip to Manon Was that the real reason we went to Maccadon Trigger asked startled Sure But we still hadn t got anywhere near the Service s top level then As I get it their topnotchers don t spend much time on individual cases They keep busy with things on the scale of our more bothersome planetary cultures and there are supposed to be only a hundred or so of them in that category So I was more than a little surprised when the Service informed me finally one of those people was coming to Maccadon to conduct your ninth interview One of the real eggheads Trigger smiled nervously And then I just took off They can t have too good an opinion of me at the moment you know Apparently that didn t upset them in the least the Commissioner said They told me to stay calm and make sure you got to Manon all right Then they said they had a ship operating in this area and they d route it over to Manon after you arrived here A ship Trigger asked I ve seen a few of their ships they looked like oversized flying mountains Camouflage jobs What they actually are is spacegoing superlaboratories from what I ve heard This one has a couple of those topnotchers on board and one of them will take you on It s due here in a day or so Trigger had paled somewhat You know she said I feel a little shaken myself now I m not surprised said the Commissioner She shook her head Well if they re topnotchers they must know what they re doing She gave him a smile Looks like I m something extremely unusual Like a bothersome planetary culture Weak joke she added The Commissioner ignored the weak joke There s another thing he said thoughtfully What s that When I mentioned your reluctance about being interviewed they told me not to worry about it that you wouldn t try to duck out again That s why I was surprised when you brought up the matter of the interview yourself just now Now that is odd Trigger admitted after a pause How would they know Right he said He sighed Guess we re both a little out of our depth there I ve come close to getting impatient with them a few times had the feeling they were stalling me off and holding back information But presumably they do know what they re doing He glanced at his watch That hour s about up now by the way Well if there s something else that should be discussed I can break my dinner date Trigger said somewhat reluctantly I had a chance to talk with Brule at the spaceport for a while when we came in this morning I wasn t suggesting that said Holati There still are things to be discussed but a few hours one way or the other won t make any difference We ll get together again around lunch tomorrow Then you ll be filled in pretty well on all the main points of this business Trigger nodded Fine What I had in mind right now was that the Service people suggested having you look over their last report on you after your arrival You d have just enough time for that before going to keep your date Care to do it I certainly would Trigger said The transmitter signaled for attention while she was studying the report Holati Tate went off to answer it The report was rather lengthy and Trigger was still going over it when he got back He sat down again and waited When she looked up finally he asked Can you make much sense of it Not very much Trigger admitted It just states what seems to have happened Not how or why Apparently they did get me to develop a total recall of that knocked out period in the last interview I even reported hearing you and Doctor Azol moving around and talking in the next compartment He nodded I remember enough of my conversation with Azol to be able to verify that part of it Then some time before I actually fell down said Trigger I was apparently already in that mysterious coma Getting deeper into it It started when I walked away from Mantelish s group without having any particular reason for doing it I just walked Then I was in another compartment by myself and still walking and the stuff kept getting deeper until I lost physical control of myself and fell down Then I lay there a while until you came down that aisle and saw me And after you d picked me up and put me in that chair just like that everything clears up Except that I don t remember what happened and think I ve just left Mantelish to go looking for you I don t even wonder how I happen to be sitting there in a chair The Commissioner smiled briefly That s right You didn t Her slim fingers tapped the pages of the report the green stone in the ring he d given her to wear reflecting little flashes of light They seem quite positive that nobody else came near me during that period And that nobody had used a hypno spray on me or shot a hypodermic pellet into me anything like that before the seizure or whatever it was came on How do you suppose they could be so sure of that I wouldn t know Holati said But I think we might as well assume they re right I suppose so What it seems to boil down to is they re saying I was undergoing something like a very much slowed down very profound emotional shock source still undetermined but profound enough to knock me completely out for a while Only they also say that for a whole list of reasons it couldn t possibly have been an emotional shock after all And when the effect left it went instantaneously That would be just the reverse to the pattern of an emotional shock wouldn t it Yes he said That occurred to me too but it didn t explain anything to me Possibly it s explained something to the Psychology Service Well Trigger said it s certainly all very odd Very disagreeable too She laid the report down on the arm of her chair and looked at the Commissioner Guess I d better run now she said But there was something you said before that made me wonder There was really very little of Doctor Azol left after that plasmoid got through with him He nodded True It wasn t Azol was it No Man oh man Trigger jumped up bent over his chair and gave him a quick peck on an ear tip If I ask one more question we ll be sitting here the next two hours I ll run instead See you around lunchtime Commissioner Right Trigger he said getting up He closed the door behind her and went back to the transmitter He looked rather unhappy Yes said a voice in the transmitter She just left Commissioner Tate said Get on the beam and stay there eighteen Well Trigger said regarding Brule critically I just meant to say that you re getting the least little bit plump here and there under all that tan I ll admit it doesn t show yet when you re dressed Brule smiled tolerantly In silver swimming trunks and sandals he was obviously a very handsome hunk of young man and he knew it So did Trigger So did a quartet of predatory young females eyeing them speculatively from a table only twenty feet away I ve come swimming here quite a bit since they opened the Center he said He flexed his right arm and regarded his biceps complacently That s just streamlined muscle you re looking at sweetheart Trigger reached over and poked the biceps with a finger tip Muscle she said smiling at him It dents See He clasped his other hand over hers and squeezed it lightly Oh golly Brule she said happily I m so glad I m back He gave her the smile You re not the only glad one She looked around humming softly They were having dinner in one of the Grand Commerce Center s restaurants This one happened to be beneath the surface of the artificial swimming lake installed in the Center a giant grotto surrounded by green gold chasms of water on every side Underwater swimmers and bottom walkers moved past beyond the wide windows A streak of silvery swiftness against a dark red canyon wall before her was trying to keep away from a trio of pursuing spear fishermen Even the lake fish were Hub imports advertised as such by the Center Her eyes widened suddenly Hey she said What That group of people up there Brule looked What about them No suits you idiot He grinned Oh a lot of them do that Okay by Federation law you know And seeing Manon s so close to becoming open Federation territory we haven t tried to enforce minor Precol regulations much lately Well Trigger began He was still smiling Have you been doing it she inquired suspiciously Swimming in the raw Certainly Depends on the company If you weren t such a little prude I d have suggested it tonight Want to try it later Trigger colored Prude again she thought Nope she said There are limits He patted her cheek On you it would look cute She shook her head aware of a small fluster of guilt There had been considerably less actual coverage in the Beldon costume than there was in the minute two piece counterpart to Brule s silver trunks she wore at the moment She d have to tell Brule about the Beldon stunt since it was more than likely he d hear about it from others Nelauk Pluly for one But not now Things were getting just a little delicate along that line at the moment Leave us change the subject pig she said cheerfully Tell me what else you ve been doing besides acquiring a gorgeous tan A couple of hours later things began to get delicate again Same subject Trigger had been somewhat startled at the spaceport when Brule told her he had shifted his living quarters to a Center apartment and that a large number of Precol s executives were taking similar liberties Holati s stand in Acting Commissioner Chelly apparently hadn t been too successful at keeping up personnel discipline She hadn t said anything It was true that Manon was still a precolonial planet only as a technicality They didn t know quite as much about it as they had to know before it could be officially released for unrestricted settling but by now there was considerable excuse for loosening up on many of the early precautionary measures For one thing there were just so many Hub people around nowadays that it would have been a practical impossibility to enforce all Precol rules What bothered her mainly about the business of Brule s Center apartment was that it might make the end of the evening less pleasant than she wanted it to be Brule had become the least bit swacked Not at all offensively but he tended to get pretty ambitious then And during the past few hours she d noticed that something had changed in his attitude toward her He d always been confident of himself when it came to women so it wasn t that It was perhaps Trigger thought like an unspoken ultimatum along those lines And she d felt herself freezing up a little in response to the thought The apartment was very beautiful Nelauk she guessed Or somebody else like that Brule s taste was good but he simply wouldn t have thought of a lot of the details here Neither Trigger conceded would she Some of the details looked pretty expensive He came back into the living room in a dressing gown carrying a couple of drinks It was going to get awkward all right Like it he asked waving a hand around It s beautiful Trigger said honestly She smiled She sipped at the drink and placed it on the arm of her chair Somebody like an interior decorator help you with it Brule laughed and sat down opposite her with his drink The laugh had sounded the least bit annoyed You re right he said How did you guess You never went in for art exactly she said This room is a work of art He nodded He didn t look annoyed any more He looked smug It is isn t it he said It didn t even cost so very much You just have to know how that s all Know how about what Trigger asked Know how to live Brule said Know what it s all about Then it s easy He was looking at her The smile was there The warm rich voice was there All the old charm was there It was Brule And it wasn t Trigger realized she was twisting her hands together She looked down at them The little jewel in the ring Holati Tate had given her to wear blinked back with crimson gleamings Crimson She drew a long slow breath Brule she said Yes said Brule At the edge of her vision she saw the smile turn eager Trigger said Give me the plasmoid She raised her eyes and looked at him He d stopped smiling Brule looked back at her a long time At least it seemed a long time to Trigger The smile suddenly returned What s that supposed to mean he asked almost plaintively If it s a joke I don t get it I just said Trigger repeated carefully give me the plasmoid The one you stole Brule took a swallow of his drink and put the glass down on the floor Aren t you feeling well he asked solicitously Give me the plasmoid Honestly Trigger He shook his head He laughed What are you talking about A plasmoid The one you took The one you ve got here Brule stood up He studied her face blinking puzzled Then he laughed richly Trigger I ve fed you one drink too many I never thought you d let me do it Be sensible now if I had a plasmoid here how could you tell I can tell Brule I don t know how you took it or why you took it I don t really care And that was a lie Trigger thought dismally She cared Just give it to me and I ll put it back We can talk about it afterwards Afterwards Brule said The laugh came again but it sounded a little hollow He moved a step toward her stopped again hands on his hips Trigger he said soberly if I ve ever done anything you mightn t approve of it was done for both of us You realize that don t you I think I do Trigger said warily Yes Give it to me Brule Brule leaped forward She slid sideways out of the chair to the floor as he leaped She was crying inside she realized vaguely Brule was going to kill her now if he could She caught his left foot with both hands as he came down and twisted viciously Brule shouted something His red furious face swept by above He thumped to the floor beside her one leg flung across her thighs gripping In colonial school Brule had received the same basic training in unarmed combat that Trigger had He was close to eighty pounds heavier than Trigger and it was still mostly muscle But it was nearly four years now since he had bothered himself with drills And he hadn t been put through Mihul s advanced students courses lately He stayed conscious a little less than nine seconds The plasmoids were in a small electronic safe built into a music cabinet The stamp to the safe was in Brule s billfold There were three of them about the size of mice starfish shaped lumps of translucent hard colorless jelly They didn t move Trigger laid them in a row on the polished surface of a small table and blinked at them for a moment from a streaming left eye The right eye was swelling shut Brule had got in one wild wallop somewhere along the line She picked up a small jar emptied some spicy smelling crumbly contents out on the table dropped the plasmoids inside closed the jar and left the apartment with it Brule was just beginning to stir and groan Commissioner Tate hadn t retired yet He let her in without a word Trigger put the jar down on a table Three of your nuts and bolts in there she said He nodded I know I thought you did said Trigger Thanks for the quick cure But right at the moment I don t like you very much Holati We can talk about that in the morning All right said the Commissioner He hesitated Anything that should be taken care of before then It s been taken care of Trigger said One of our employees has been moderately injured I dialed the medics to go pick him up They have Good night You might let me do something for that eye he said Trigger shook her head I ve got stuff in my quarters She locked herself into her quarters got out a jar of quick heal and anointed the eye and a few other minor bruises She put the jar away made a mechanical check of the newly installed anti intrusion devices dimmed the lights and climbed into her bunk For the next twenty minutes she wept violently Then she fell asleep An hour or so later she turned over on her side and said without opening her eyes Come Fido The plasmoid purse appeared just above the surface of the bunk between Trigger s pillow and the wall It dropped with a small thump and stood balanced uncertainly Trigger slept on Five minutes after that the purse opened itself A little later again Trigger suddenly shifted her shoulder uneasily frowned and made a little half angry half whimpering cry Then her face smoothed out Her breathing grew quiet and slow Major Heslet Quillan of the Subspace Engineers came breezing into Manon Planet s spaceport very early in the morning A Precol aircar picked him up and let him out on a platform of the Headquarters dome near Commissioner Tate s offices Quillan was handed on toward the offices through a string of underlings and reached the door just as it opened and Trigger Argee stepped through He grasped her cordially by the shoulders and cried out a cheery hello Trigger made a soft growling sound in her throat Her left hand chopped right her right hand chopped left Quillan grunted and let go What s the matter he inquired stepping back He rubbed one arm then the other Trigger looked at him growled again walked past him and disappeared through another door her back very straight Come in Quillan Commissioner Tate said from within the office Quillan went in and closed the door behind him What did I do he asked bewilderedly Nothing much said Holati You just share the misfortune of being a male human being At the moment Trigger s against em She blew up the Brule Inger setup last night Oh Quillan sat down I never did like that idea much he said The Commissioner shrugged You don t know the girl yet If I d hauled Inger in she would never have really forgiven me for it I had to let her handle it herself Actually she understands that How did it go Her cover reported it was one hell of a good fight for some seconds If you d looked closer you might have just spotted the traces of the shiner Inger gave her It was a beaut last night Quillan went white But if you re thinking of having a chat with Inger re that part of it the Commissioner went on forget it He glanced at a report from the medical department on his desk Dislocated shoulder broken thumb moderate concussion And so on It was the throat punch that finished the matter He can t talk yet We ll call it square Quillan grunted What are you going to do with him now Nothing Holati said We know his contacts Why bother He ll resign end of the month Quillan cleared his throat and glanced at the door I suppose she ll want him put up for rehabilitation seemed pretty fond of him Relax son said the Commissioner Trigger s an individualist If Inger goes up for rehabilitation it will be because he wants it And he doesn t of course Being a slob suits him fine He s just likely to be more cautious about it in future So we ll let him go his happy way Now let s get down to business How does Pluly s yacht harem stack up A reminiscent smile spread slowly over Quillan s face He shook his head Awesome brother he said Plain awesome Pick up anything useful Nothing definite But whenever Belchy comes out of the esthetic trances he s a worried man Count him in For sure Yes All right He s in Crack the Aurora yet No said Quillan The girls are working on it But the Ermetyne keeps a mighty taut ship and a mighty disciplined crew We ll have a couple of those boys wrapped up in another week No earlier A week might be soon enough said the Commissioner It also might not I know it said Quillan But the Aurora does look a little bit obvious doesn t she Yes Holati Tate admitted Just a little bit nineteen By lunchtime Trigger was acting almost cordial again I ve got the Precol job lined up she reported to Holati Tate I ll handle it like I used to whenever I can When I can t the kids will shift in automatically The kids were the five assistants among whom her duties had been divided in her absence Major Quillan called me up to Mantelish s lab around ten she went on They wanted to see Repulsive so I took him up there Then it turned out Mantelish wanted to take Repulsive along on a field trip this afternoon Holati looked startled He can t do that and he knows it He reached for the desk transmitter Don t bother Commissioner I told Mantelish I d been put in charge of Repulsive and that he d lose an arm if he tried to walk out of the lab with him Holati cleared his throat I see How did Mantelish react Oh he huffed a bit Like he does Then he calmed down and agreed he could get by without Repulsive out there So we stood by while he measured and weighed the thing and so on After that he got friendly and said you d asked him to fill me in on current plasmoid theory So I did said Holati Did he He tried I think But it s like you say I got lost in about three sentences and never caught up She looked curiously at the Commissioner I didn t have a chance to talk to Major Quillan alone so I m wondering why Mantelish was told the I Fleets in the Vishni area are hunting for planets with plasmoids on them I thought you felt he was too woolly minded to be trusted We couldn t keep that from him very well Holati said He was the boy who thought of it You didn t have to tell him they d found some possibles did you He did unfortunately He s had those plasmoid detectors of his for about a month but he didn t happen to think of mentioning them The reason he was to come back to Manon originally was to sort over the stuff the Fleets have been sending back here It s as weird a collection of low grade life forms as I ve ever seen but not plasmoid Mantelish went into a temper and wanted to know why the idiots weren t using detectors Oh Lord Trigger said That s what it s like when you re working with him said the Commissioner We started making up detectors wholesale and rushing them out there but the new results haven t come in yet Well that explains it Trigger looked down at the desk a moment then glanced up and met the Commissioner s eye She colored slightly Incidentally she said I did take the opportunity to apologize to Major Quillan for clipping him a couple this morning I shouldn t have done that He didn t seem offended said Holati No not really she agreed And I explained to him that you had a very good reason to feel disturbed Thanks said Trigger By the way was he really a smuggler at one time And a hijacker Yes very successful at it It s excellent cover for some phases of Intelligence work As I heard it though Quillan happened to scramble up one of the Hub s nastier dope rings in the process and was broken two grades in rank Broken Trigger said Why Unwarranted interference with a political situation The Scouts are rough about that You re supposed to see those things Sometimes you don t Sometimes you do and go ahead anyway They may pat you on the back privately but they also give you the axe I see she said She smiled Just how far did we get in bringing you up to date yesterday the Commissioner asked The remains that weren t Doctor Azol Trigger said If it hadn t been for the funny business with Trigger Holati said he mightn t have been immediately skeptical about Doctor Azol s supposed demise by plasmoid during a thrombosis induced spell of unconsciousness There had been no previous indications that the U League s screening of its scientists in connection with the plasmoid find might have been strategically loused up from the start But as things stood he did look on the event with very considerable skepticism Doctor Azol s death in that particular form seemed too much of a coincidence For beside himself only Azol knew that another person already had suddenly and mysteriously lost consciousness on Harvest Moon Only Azol therefore might expect that the Commissioner would quietly inform the official investigators of the preceding incident thus cinching the accidental death theory in Azol s case much more neatly than the assumed heart attack had done The Commissioner went on from there to the reflection that if Azol had chosen to disappear it might well have been with the intention of conveying important information secretly back to somebody waiting for it in the Hub He saw to it that the remains were preserved and that word of what could have happened was passed on to a high Federation official whom he knew to be trustworthy That was all he was in a position to do or interested in doing himself Security men presently came and took the supposed vestiges of Doctor Azol s body back to the Hub It wasn t until some months later when the works blew up and I was put on this job that I heard any more about it Holati Tate said It wasn t Azol It was part of some unidentifiable cadaver which he d presumably brought with him for just such a use Anyway they had Azol s gene patterns on record and they didn t jibe His desk transmitter buzzed and Trigger took it on an earphone extension Argee she said She listened a moment All right Coming over She stood up replacing the earphone Office tangle she explained Guess they feel I m fluffing now I m back I ll get back here as soon as it s straightened out Oh by the way Yes The Psychology Service ship messaged in during the morning It ll arrive some time tomorrow and wants a station assigned to it outside the system where it won t be likely to attract attention Are they really as huge as all that I ve seen one or two that were bigger the Commissioner said But not much When they re stationed they ll send someone over in a shuttle to pick me up The Commissioner nodded I ll check on the arrangements for that The idea of the interview still bothering you Well I d sooner it wasn t necessary Trigger admitted But I guess it is She grinned briefly Anyway I ll be able to tell my grandchildren some day that I once talked to one of the real egg heads The Psychology Service woman who stood up from a couch as Trigger came into the small spaceport lounge next evening looked startlingly similar to Major Quillan s Dawn City assistant Gaya Standing you could see that she was considerably more slender than Gaya She had all of Gaya s good looks The name is Pilch she said She looked at Trigger and smiled It was a good smile Trigger thought not the professional job she d expected And everyone who knows Gaya she went on thinks we must be twins Trigger laughed Aren t you Just first cousins The voice was all right too clear and easy Trigger felt herself relax somewhat That s one reason they picked me to come and get you We re already almost acquainted Another is that I ve been assigned to take you through the preliminary work for your interview after we get to the ship We can chat a bit on the way and that should make it seem less disagreeable Boat s in the speedboat park over there They started down a short hallway to the park area Just how disagreeable is it going to be Trigger asked Not at all bad in your case You re conditioned to the processes more than you know Your interviewer will just pick up where the last job ended and go on from there It s when you have to work down through barriers that you have a little trouble Trigger was still mulling that over as she stepped ahead of Pilch into the smaller of two needle nosed craft parked side by side Pilch followed her in and closed the lock behind them The other one s a combat job she remarked Our escort Commissioner Tate made very sure we had one too She motioned Trigger to a low soft seat that took up half the space of the tiny room behind the lock sat down beside her and spoke at a wall pickup All set Let s ride Blue green tinted sky moved past them in the little room s viewer screen then a tilted landscape flashed by and dropped back Pilch winked at Trigger Takes off like a scared yazong that boy He ll race the combat job to the ship About those barriers Supposing I told you something like this There s no significant privacy invasion in this line of work We go directly to the specific information we re looking for and deal only with that Your private life your personal thoughts remain secret sacred and inviolate What would you say I d say you re a liar Trigger said promptly Of course That sort of thing is sometimes told to nervous interviewees We don t bother with it But now supposing I told you very sincerely that no recording will be made of any little personal glimpses we may get Lying again Right again said Pilch You ve been scanned about as thoroughly as anyone ever gets to be outside of a total therapy Your personal secrets are already on record and since I m doing most of the preparatory work with you I ve studied all the significant looking ones very closely You re a pretty good person for my money All right Trigger studied her face uncomfortably Hardly all right but I guess I can stand it she said As far as you re concerned anyway She hesitated What s the egghead like Old Cranadon said Pilch You won t mind her a bit I think Very motherly old type Let s get through the preparations first and then I ll introduce you to her If you think it would make you more comfortable I ll just stay around while she s working I ve sat in on her interviews before How s that Sounds better Trigger said She did feel a good deal relieved They slid presently into a tunnel like lock of the space vehicle Holati Tate had described as a flying mountain From what Trigger could see of it in the guide lights on the approach it did rather closely resemble a very large mountain of the craggier sort They went through a series of lifts portals and passages and wound up in a small and softly lit room with a small desk a very large couch a huge wall screen and assorted gadgetry Pilch sat down at the desk and invited Trigger to make herself comfortable on the couch Trigger lay down on the couch She had a very brief sensation of falling gently through dimness Half an hour later she sat up on the couch Pilch switched on a desk light and looked at her thoughtfully Trigger blinked Then her eyes widened first with surprise then in comprehension Liar she said Hm m m said Pilch Yes That was the interview True Then you re the egghead Tcha said Pilch Well I believe I can modestly describe myself as being like that Yes You re another by the way We re just smart about different things Not so very different You were smart about this Trigger said She swung her legs off the couch and regarded Pilch dubiously Pilch grinned Took most of the disagreeableness out of it didn t it Yes Trigger admitted it did Now what do we do Now said Pilch I ll explain The thing that had caught their attention was a quite simple process It just happened to be a process the Psychology Service hadn t observed under those particular circumstances before Here s what our investigators had the last time Pilch said Lines and lines of stuff of course But here s a simple continuity which makes it clear Your mother dies when you re six months old Then there are a few nurses whom you don t like very much Good nurses but frankly much too stupid for you though you don t know that and they don t either naturally Next you re seven years old a bit over and there s a mud pond on the farm near Ceyce where you spend all your vacations You just love that old mud pond Trigger laughed A smelly old hole actually Full of froggy sorts of things I went out to that farm six years ago just to look around it again But you re right I did love that mud pond once Right up to that seventh summer Pilch said Which was the summer your father s cousin spent her vacation on the farm with you Trigger nodded Perhaps I don t remember the time too well Well Pilch said she was a brilliant woman In some ways She was about the age your mother had been when she died She was very good looking And she was nice She played games with a little girl sang to her Told her stories Cuddled her Trigger blinked Did she I don t However said Pilch she did not play games with tell stories to cuddle etcetera little girls who her voice went suddenly thin and edged come in all filthy and smelling from that dirty slimy old mud pond Trigger looked startled You know she said I do believe I remember her saying that just that way You remember it said Pilch now You never saw her again after that summer Your father had good sense He didn t marry her as he apparently intended to do before he saw how she was going to be with you You went back to your old mud pond just once more on your next vacation She wasn t there What had you done You waded around feeling pretty sad And you stepped on a sharp stick and cut your foot badly Sort of a self punishment She flipped over a few pages of some record on her desk Now before you start asking what s interesting about that I ll run over a few crossed in items Age twelve There s that Maccadon animal like a dryland jellyfish a mingo isn t it that swallowed your kitten The mingo Trigger said I remember that I killed it Right You kicked it apart and pulled out the kitten but the kitten was dead and partly digested You bawled all day and half the night about that I might have I suppose You did Now those are two centering points There s other stuff connected with them No need to go into details As classes you ve stepped now and then on things that squirmed or squashed Bad smells Etcetera How do you feel about plasmoids Trigger wrinkled her nose I just think they re unpleasant things All except Oops She checked herself Repulsive said Pilch It s quite all right about Repulsive We ve been informed of that supersecret little item you re guarding If we hadn t been told we d know now of course Go ahead Well it s odd Trigger remarked thoughtfully I just said I thought plasmoids were rather unpleasant But that s the way I used to feel about them I don t feel that way now Except again said Pilch for that little monstrosity on the ship If it was a plasmoid You rather suspect it was don t you Trigger nodded That would be pretty bad Very bad said Pilch Plasmoids generally you feel about them now as you feel about potatoes rocks neutral things like that That s about it Trigger said She still looked puzzled We ll go over what seems to have changed your attitude there in a minute or so Here s another thing Pilch paused a moment then said Night before last about an hour after you d gone to bed you had a very light touch of the same pattern of mental blankness you experienced on that plasmoid station While I was asleep Trigger said startled That s right Comparatively very light very brief Five or six minutes Dream activity etcetera smooths out Some blocking on various sense lines Then normal sleep until about five minutes before you woke up At that point there may have been another minute touch of the same pattern Too brief to be actually definable A few seconds at most The point is that this is a continuing process She looked at Trigger a moment Not particularly alarmed are you No said Trigger It just seems very odd She added I got rather frightened when Commissioner Tate was first telling me what had been going on Yes I know twenty Pilch was silent for some moments again considering the wall screen as if thinking about something connected with it Well we ll drop that for now she said finally Let me tell you what s been happening these months starting with that first amnesia covered blankout on Harvest Moon The Maccadon Colonial School has sound basic psychology courses so there won t be much explaining to do The connection between those incidents I mentioned and your earlier feeling of disliking plasmoids is obvious isn t it Trigger nodded Good When you got the first Service check up at Commissioner Tate s demand there was very little to go on The amnesia didn t lift immediately not very unusual The blankout might be interesting because of the circumstances Otherwise the check showed you were in a good deal better than normal condition Outside of total therapy processes and I believe you know that s a long haul there wasn t much to be done for you and no particular reason to do it So an amnesia resolving process was initiated and you were left alone for a while Actually something already was going on at the time but it wasn t spotted until your next check What it s amounted to has been a relatively minor but extremely precise and apparently purposeful therapy process Your unconscious memories of those groupings of incidents I was talking about along with various linked groupings have gradually been cleared up Emotion has been drained away fixed evaluations have faded Associative lines have shifted Now that s nothing remarkable in itself Any good therapist could have done the same for you and much more rapidly Say in a few hours hard work spread over several weeks to permit progressive assimilation without conscious disturbances The very interesting thing is that this orderly little process appears to have been going on all by itself And that just doesn t happen You disturbed now Trigger nodded A little Mainly I m wondering why somebody wants me to not dislike plasmoids So am I wondering said Pilch Somebody does obviously And a very slick somebody it is We ll find out by and by Incidentally this particular part of the business has been concluded Apparently somebody doesn t intend to make you wild for plasmoids It s enough that you don t dislike them Trigger smiled I can t see anyone making me wild for the things whatever they tried Pilch nodded Could be done she said Rather easily You d be bats of course But that s very different from a simple neutralizing process like the one we ve been discussing Now here s something else You were pretty unhappy about this business for a while That wasn t somebody s fault That was us I ll explain Your investigators could have interfered with the little therapy process in a number of ways That wouldn t have taught them a thing so they didn t But on your third check they found something else Again it wasn t in the least obtrusive in someone else they mightn t have given it a second look But it didn t fit at all with your major personality patterns You wanted to stay where you were Stay where I was In the Manon System Oh Trigger flushed a little Well I know Let s go on a moment We had this inharmonious inclination So we told Commissioner Tate to bring you to the Hub and keep you there to see what would happen And on Maccadon in just a few weeks you d begun working that moderate inclination to be back in the Manon System up to a dandy first rate compulsion Trigger licked her lips I Sure said Pilch You had to have a good sensible reason You gave yourself one Well Oh you were fond of that young man all right Who wouldn t be Wonderful looking lug I d go for him myself till I got him on that couch that is But that was the first time you hadn t been able to stand a couple of months away from him It was also the first time you d started worrying about competition You now had your justification And we Pilch said darkly had a fine solid compulsion with no doubt very revealing ramifications to it to work on Just one thing went wrong with that Trigger You don t have the compulsion any more Oh You don t even said Pilch have the original moderate inclination Now one might have some suspicions there But we ll let them ride for the moment She did something on the desk The huge wall screen suddenly lit up A soft amber glowing plane of blankness with a suggestion of receding depths within it Last night shortly before you woke up Pilch said you had a dream Actually you had a series of eight dreams during the night which seem pertinent here But the earlier ones were rather vague preliminary structures In one way and another their content is included in this final symbol grouping Let s see what we can make of them A shape appeared on the screen Trigger started then laughed What do you think of it Pilch asked A little green man she said Well it could be a sort of counterpart to the little yellow thing on the ship couldn t it The good little dwarf and the very bad little dwarf Could be said Pilch How do you feel about the notion Good plasmoids and bad plasmoids Trigger shook her head No It doesn t feel right What else feels right Pilch asked The farmer The little old man who owned the farm where the mud pond was Liked him didn t you Very much He knew a lot of fascinating things She laughed again You know I d hate to have him find out but that little green man also reminds me quite a bit of Commissioner Tate I don t think he d mind hearing it Pilch said She paused a moment All right what s this A second shape appeared A sort of caricature of a wild mean horse Trigger said She added thoughtfully there was a horse like that on that farm too I suppose you know that Yes Any thoughts about it No o o Well one The little farmer was the only one who could handle that horse It was mutated horse actually one of the Life Bank deals that didn t work out so well Enormously strong It could work forty eight hours at a stretch without even noticing it But it was just a plain mean animal Crazy mean observed Pilch was the dream feeling about it Trigger nodded I remember I used to think it was crazy for that horse to want to go around kicking and biting things to pieces Which was about all it really wanted to do I imagine it was crazy at that You weren t ever in any danger from it yourself were you Trigger laughed I couldn t have got anywhere near it You should have seen the kind of place the old farmer kept it when it wasn t working I did said Pilch Long wide straight walled pit in the ground Cover for shade plenty of food running water He was a good farmer Very high locked fence around it to keep little girls and anyone else from getting too close to his useful monster Right said Trigger She shook her head When you people look into somebody s mind you look We work at it Pilch said Let s see what you can do with this one Trigger was silent for almost a minute before she said in a subdued voice I just get what it shows It doesn t seem to mean anything What does it show Laughing giants stamping on a farm A tiny sort of farm It looks like it might be the little green man s farm No wait It s not his But it belongs to other little green people How do you feel about that Well I hate those giants Trigger said They re cruel And they laugh about being cruel Are you afraid of them Trigger blinked at the screen for a few seconds No she said in a low sleepy voice Not yet Pilch was silent a moment She said then One more Trigger looked and frowned Presently she said I have a feeling that does mean something But all I get is that it s the faces of two clocks On one of them the hands are going around very fast And on the other they go around slowly Yes Pilch said She waited a little No other thought about those clocks Just that they should mean something Trigger shook her head That s all Pilch s hand moved on the desk again The wall screen went blank and the light in the little room brightened slowly Pilch s face was reflective That will have to do for now she said Trigger this ship is working on an urgent job somewhere else We ll have to go back and finish that job But I ll be able to return to Manon in about ten days and then we ll have another session And I think that will get this little mystery cleared up All of it All of it I d say The whole pattern seems to be moving into view More details will show up in the ten day interval and one more cautious boost then should bring it out in full Trigger nodded That s good news I ve been getting a little fed up with being a kind of walking enigma Don t blame you at all Pilch said sounding almost exactly like Commissioner Tate Incidentally you re a busy lady at present but if you do have half an hour to spare from time to time you might just sit down comfortably somewhere and listen to yourself thinking The way things are going that should bring quite a bit of information to view Trigger looked doubtful Listen to myself thinking You ll find yourself getting the knack of it rather quickly Pilch said She smiled Just head off in that general direction whenever you find the time and don t work too hard at it Are there any questions now before we start back to Manon Trigger studied her a moment There s one thing I d like to be sure about she said But I suppose you people have your problems with Security too Who doesn t said Pilch You re secure enough for me Fire away All right Trigger said Commissioner Tate told me people like you don t work much with individuals Not as much as we d like to That s true So you wouldn t have been working with me if whatever has been going on weren t somehow connected with the plasmoids Oh yes I would said Pilch Or old Cranadon Someone like that We do give service as required when somebody has the good sense to ask for it But obviously we couldn t have dropped that other job just now and come to Manon to clear up some individual difficulty So I am involved with the plasmoid mess You re right in the middle of it Trigger That s definite In just what way is something we should be able to determine next session Pilch turned off the desk light and stood up I always hate to run off and leave something half finished like this she admitted but I ll have to run anyway The plasmoids are nowhere near the head of the Federation s problem list at present They re just coming up mighty fast When Trigger reached her office next morning she learned that the Psychology Service ship had moved out of the Manon area within an hour after she d been returned to the Headquarters dome the night before None of the members of the plasmoid team were around The Commissioner who had a poor opinion of sleep had been up for the past three hours he d left word Trigger could reach him if necessary in the larger of his two ships parked next to the dome in Precol Port Presumably he had the ship sealed up and was sitting in the transmitter cabinet swapping messages with the I Fleets in the Vishni area He was likely to be at that for hours more Professor Mantelish hadn t yet got back from his latest field trip and Major Heslet Quillan just wasn t there It looked Trigger decided not at all reluctantly like a good day to lean into her Precol job a bit She told the staff to pitch everything not utterly routine her way and leaned A set of vitally important reports from Precol s Giant Planet Survey Squad had been mislaid somewhere around Headquarters during yesterday s conferences She soothed down the G P Squad and instituted a check search A team of Hub ecologists who had decided for themselves that outworld booster shots weren t required on Manon called in nervously from a polar station to report that their hair was falling out Trigger tapped the Manon Fever button on her desk and suggested toupees The ecologists were displeased A medical emergency skip boat zoomed out of the dome to go to their rescue and Trigger gave it its directions while dialing for the medical checker who d allowed the visitors to avoid their shots She had a brief chat with the young man and left him twitching as the G P Squad came back on to inquire whether the reports had been found yet Trigger began to get a comfortable feeling of being back in the good old groove Then a message from the Medical Department popped out on her desk It was addressed to Commissioner Tate and stated that Brule Inger was now able to speak again Trigger frowned sighed bit her lip and thought a moment She dialed for Doctor Leehaven Got your message she said How s he doing All right the old medic said Has he said anything No He s scared If he could get up the courage he d ask for a personnel lawyer Yes I imagine Tell him this then from the Commissioner not from me there ll be no charges but Precol expects his resignation end of the month That on the level Doctor Leehaven demanded incredulously Of course The doctor snorted You people are getting soft headed But I ll tell him The morning went on Trigger was suspiciously studying a traffic control note stating that a Devagas missionary ship had checked in and berthed at the spaceport when the G C Center s management called in to report with some nervousness that the Center s much advertised meteor repellent roof had just flipped several dozen tons of falling Moon Belt material into the spaceport area Most of it unfortunately had dropped around and upon a Devagas missionary ship Not damaged is it she asked The Center said no but the Missionary Captain insisted on speaking to the person in charge here To whom should they refer him Refer him to me Trigger said expectantly She switched on the vision screen The Missionary Captain was a tall gray haired gray eyed square jawed man in uniform After confirming to his satisfaction that Trigger was indeed in charge he informed her in chilled tones that the Devagas Union would hold her personally responsible for the unprovoked outrage unless an apology was promptly forthcoming Trigger apologized promptly He acknowledged with a curt nod The ship will now require new spacepaint he pointed out unmollified Trigger nodded We ll send a work squad out immediately We the Missionary Captain said shall supervise the work Only the best grade of paint will be acceptable The very best only Trigger agreed He gave her another curt nod and switched off Ass she said She cut in the don t disturb barrier and dialed Holati s ship It took a while to get through he was probably busy somewhere in the crate Like Belchik Pluly the Commissioner while still a very wealthy man would have been a very much wealthier one if it weren t for his hobby In his case the hobby was ships of which he now owned two What made them expensive was that they had been tailor made to the Commissioner s specifications and his specifications had provided him with two rather exact duplicates of the two types of Scout fighting ships in which Squadron Commander Tate had made space hideous for evildoers in the good old days Nobody as yet had got up the nerve to point out to him that private battlecraft definitely were not allowable in the Manon System He came on finally Trigger told him about the Devagas Did you know those characters were in the area she asked The Commissioner knew They d stopped in at the system check station three days before The ship was clean Their missionaries all go armed of course but that s their privilege by treaty They ve been browsing around and going hither and yon in skiffs The ship s been in orbit till this morning Think they re here in connection with whatever Balmordan is up to Trigger inquired We ll take that for granted Balmordan by the way attended a big shindig on the Pluly yacht yesterday Unless his tail goofed he s still up there apparently staying on as a guest Are you having these other Devagas watched Not individually Too many of them and they re scattered all over the place Mantelish got back He checked in an hour ago You mean he s upstairs in his quarters now she asked Right He had a few more crates hauled into the lab and he s locked himself in with them and spy blocked the place May have got something important and may just be going through one of his secrecy periods again We ll find out by and by Oh and here s a social note The First Lady of Tranest is shopping in the Grand Commerce Center this morning Well that should boost business said Trigger Are you going to be back in the dome by lunchtime I think so Might have some interesting news too incidentally Fine she said See you then Twenty minutes later the desk transmitter gave her the to be shielded signal Up went the barrier again Major Quillan s face looked out at her from the screen He was Trigger saw in Mantelish s lab Mantelish stood at a work bench behind him Hi he said Hi yourself When did you get in Just now Could you pick up the whoosis and whichis and bring it up here Right now If you can Quillan said The professor s got something new he thinks I m on my way said Trigger Take about five minutes She hurried down to her quarters summoned Repulsive s container into the room and slung the strap over her shoulder Then she stood still a moment frowning slightly Something something like a wisp of memory something she should be remembering was stirring in the back of her mind Then it was gone Trigger shook her head It would keep She opened the door and stepped out into the hall She fell down As she fell she tried to give the bag the send off squeeze but she couldn t move her fingers She couldn t move anything There were people around her They were doing things swiftly She was turned over on her back and for a few moments then she saw her own face smiling down at her from just a few feet away twenty one She was suddenly in a large room well lit with elaborate furnishings sitting leaned back in a soft chair before a highly polished little table On the opposite side of the table two people sat looking at her with expressions of mild surprise One of them was Lyad Ermetyne The other was a man she didn t know The man glanced aside at Lyad Very fast snap back he said He looked again at Trigger He was a small man with salt and pepper hair a deeply lined face beautiful liquid black eyes Very Lyad said We must remember that Hello Trigger Hello Trigger said Her glance went once around the room and came back to Lyad s amiably observant face Repulsive s container was nowhere around There seemed to be nobody else in the room An ornamental ComWeb stood against one wall Two of the walls were covered with heavy hangings and a great gold brocaded canopy bellied from the ceiling No doors or portals in sight they might be camouflaged or behind those hangings Any number of people could be in call range and a few certainly must be watching her right now because that small man was no rough and tumble type The small man was regarding her with something like restrained amusement A cool one he murmured Very cool Trigger looked at him a moment then turned her eyes back to Lyad She didn t feel cool She felt tense and scared cold This was probably very bad What did you want to see me about she asked Lyad smiled A business matter Do you know where you are Not on your ship First Lady The light amber eyes barely narrowed But Lyad had become at that moment very alert Why do you think so she asked pleasantly This room said Trigger You don t gush I think What was the business matter In a moment Lyad said She smiled again Where else might you be Trigger thought she could guess But she didn t intend to Not out loud She shrugged It s no place I want to be She settled back a little in her chair Her right hand brushed the porgee pouch The porgee pouch It would have been like the Ermetyne to investigate the pouch carefully take out the gun and put the pouch back But they might not have Somebody was bound to be watching She couldn t find out not until the instant after she decided to try the Denton I can believe that Lyad said Forgive me the discourtesy of so urgent an invitation Trigger A quite recent event made it seem necessary As to the business as a start this gentleman is Doctor Veetonia He is an investigator of extraordinary talents along his line At the moment he is a trifle tired because of the very long hours he worked last night Doctor Veetonia turned his head to look at her I did First Lady Well that does explain this odd weariness Did I work well Splendidly Lyad assured him You were never better Doctor He nodded smiled vaguely and looked back at Trigger This must go too I suppose I m afraid it must Lyad said A great pity Doctor Veetonia said A great pity It would have been a pleasant memory This very cool one The vague smile shifted in the lined face again You are so beautiful child he told Trigger in your anger and terror and despair And above it still the gauging purpose the strong quick thinking You will not give in easily Oh no Not easily at all First Lady Doctor Veetonia said plaintively I should like to remember this one It should be possible I think Small icy fingers were working up and down Trigger s spine The Ermetyne gave her a light wink I m afraid it isn t Doctor she said There are such very important matters to be discussed Besides Trigger Argee and I will come to an amicable agreement very quickly No Doctor Veetonia s face had turned very sullen No said Lyad She will agree to nothing Any fool can see that I recommend then a simple chemical approach Your creatures can handle it Drain her Throw her away I will have nothing to do with the matter Oh but Doctor the Ermetyne protested That would be so crude And so very uncertain Why we might be here for hours still He shook his head Lyad smiled She stroked the lined cheek with light finger tips Have you forgotten the palace at Hamal Lake she asked The great library The laboratories Haven t I been very generous Doctor Veetonia turned his face toward her He smiled thoughtfully Now that is true he admitted For the moment I did forget He looked back at Trigger The First Lady gives he told her and the First Lady takes away She has given me wealth and much leisure She takes from me now and then a memory Very skillfully since she was my pupil But still the mind must be dim by a little each time it is done His face suddenly grew concerned He looked at Lyad again Two more years only he said In two years I shall be free to retire Lyad Lyad nodded That was our bargain Doctor You know I keep bargains Doctor Veetonia said Yes You do It is strange in an Ermetyne Very well I shall do it He looked at Trigger s face The black liquid eyes blinked once or twice She is almost certain she is being watched he said but she has been thinking of using the ComWeb The child I believe is prepared to attack us at any opportune moment He smiled Show her first why her position is hopeless Then we shall see Why it s not in the least hopeless Lyad said And please feel no concern about the Doctor Trigger His methods are quite painless and involve none of the indignities of a chemical investigation If you are at all reasonable we ll just sit here and talk for twenty minutes or so Then you will tell me what sum you wish to have deposited for you in what bank and you will be free to go What will we talk about Trigger said Well for one said the Ermetyne there is that rather handsome little purse you ve been carrying about lately My technicians inform me there may be some risk of damaging its contents if they attempt to force it open We don t want that So we ll talk a bit about the proper way of opening it She gave Trigger her little smile And Doctor Veetonia will verify the accuracy of any statements made on the matter She considered Oh and then I shall ask a few questions Not many And you will answer them It really will be quite simple But now let me tell you why I so very much wanted to see you today We had a guest here last night A gentleman whom you ve met Balmordan He was mind blocked on some quite important subjects and so though the doctor and I were very patient and careful he died in the end But before he died he had told me as much as I really needed to know from him Now with that information she went on and with the contents of your purse and with another little piece of information which you possess I shall presently go away On Orado a few hours later Tranest s ambassador will have a quiet talk with some members of the Federation Council And that will be all really She smiled No dramatic pursuit No hue and cry A few treaties will be considerably revised And the whole hubbub about the plasmoids will be over She nodded Because they can be made to work you know And very well Doctor Veetonia hadn t looked away from Trigger while Lyad was speaking He said now My congratulations First Lady But the girl has not been convinced in the least that she should cooperate She may hope to be rescued before the information you want can be forced from her The Ermetyne sighed Oh really now Trigger she very nearly pouted Well if I must explain about that to you too I shall She considered a moment Did you see your facsimile Trigger nodded Very briefly Lyad smiled How she and my other people passed in and out of that dome and how it happened that your room guards were found unconscious and were very hurriedly taken to the medical department s contagious ward makes an amusing little story But it would be too long in the telling just now Your facsimile is one of Tranest s finest actresses She s been studying and practicing being you for months She knows where to go and what to do in that dome to avoid contact with people who know you too intimately If it seems that discovery is imminent she needs only a minute by herself to turn into an entirely different personality So hours might pass without anyone even suspecting you were gone But on the other hand Lyad admitted fairly your double might be caught immediately or within minutes She would not be conscious then and I doubt your fierce little Commissioner would go to the unethical limits of dead braining a live woman If he did of course he would learn nothing from her Let s assume nevertheless that for one reason and another your friends suspect me immediately and only me At the time you were being taken from the dome I was observed leaving the Grand Commerce Center I d shopped rather freely a number of fairly large crates and so forth were loaded into my speedboat And we were observed returning to the Aurora Not bad Trigger admitted Another facsimile I suppose Of course The Ermetyne glanced at a small jeweled wrist watch Now the Aurora if my orders were being followed and they were dived approximately five minutes ago unless somebody who might be your wrathful rescuers approached her before that time in which case she dived then In either case the dive was seen by the Commissioner s watchers and the proper conclusions sooner or later will be drawn from that Supposing they dive after her and run her down Trigger said They might The Aurora is not an easy ship to run down in subspace but they might After some hours It would be of no consequence at all would it The amber eyes regarded Trigger with very little expression for a moment How many hours or minutes do you think you could hold out here Trigger Argee if it became necessary to put on real pressure I don t know Trigger admitted She moistened her lips I could give you a rather close estimate I think the Ermetyne said But forgive me for bringing up that matter It was an unnecessary discourtesy Let s assume instead that the rather clever people with whom you ve been working are quite clever enough to see through all these little maneuverings Let s assume further that they are even able to conclude immediately where you and I must be at the moment We are as it happens on the Griffin which is Belchik Pluly s outsize yacht and which is orbiting Manon at present This room is on a sealed level of the yacht where Belchik s private life normally goes on undisturbed I persuaded him two days ago to clear out this section of it for my own use There is only one portal entry to the level and that entry is locked and heavily guarded at the moment There are two portal exits One of them opens into a special lock in which there is a small speedboat of mine prepared to leave It s a very fast boat If there have been faster ones built in the Hub I haven t heard of them yet And it can dive directly from the lock She smiled at Trigger You have the picture now haven t you If your friends decide to board the Griffin they ll be able to do it without too much argument After all we don t want to be blown up accidentally But they ll have quite a time working their way into this level If a boarding party is reported we ll just all quietly go away together with no fuss or hurry I guarantee that no one is going to trace or overtake that boat You see Yes Trigger said disconsolately slumping back a little Her right hand dropped to her lap Well she thought last chance Doctor Veetonia frowned First he began Trigger slapped the porgee pouch And the Denton s soundless blast slammed the talented investigator back and over in his chair Gun Trigger explained unnecessarily The Ermetyne s face had turned white with shock She flicked a glance down at the man then looked back at Trigger There re guns on me too I imagine Trigger said But this one goes off very easily First Lady It would take hardly any jolt at all Lyad nodded slightly They re no fools They won t risk shooting Don t worry Her voice was careful but quite even A tough cookie as the Commissioner had remarked We won t bother about them at the moment Trigger said Let s stand up together They stood up We ll stay about five feet apart Trigger went on I don t know if you re the gun grabbing type The Ermetyne almost smiled I m not she said No point in taking chances Trigger said Five feet She gave Doctor Veetonia a quick glance He did look very unpleasantly dead We ll go over to that ComWeb in a moment she told Lyad I imagine you wouldn t have left it on open circuit Lyad shook her head Calls go through the ship s communication office Your own people on duty there No Pluly s Will they take your orders Certainly Can they listen in Trigger asked Not if we seal the set here Trigger nodded You ll do the talking she said I ll give you Commissioner Tate s personal number Tell them to dial it The Precol transmitters pick up ComWeb circuits Switch on the screen after the call is in he ll want to see me When he comes on just tell him what s happened where we are what the layout is He s to come over with a squad to get us I won t say much if anything I ll just keep the gun on you If there s any fumble we both get it There won t be any fumble Trigger Lyad said All right Let s set up the rest of it before we move After the Commissioner signs off he ll be up here in three minutes flat Or less How about this ship s officers do they take your orders too With the obvious exception of yourself Lyad said everyone on the Griffin takes my orders at the moment Then just tell whoever s in charge of the yacht to let the squad in before there s any shooting The Commissioner can get awfully short tempered Then get the guards away from that entry portal That s for their own good The Ermetyne nodded Will do All right That covers it I think They looked at each other for a moment With the information you got from Balmordan Trigger remarked you should still be able to make a very good dicker with the Council First Lady I understand they re very eager to get the plasmoid mess straightened out quietly Lyad lifted one shoulder in a brief shrug Perhaps she said Let s move said Trigger They walked toward the ComWeb rather edgily not very fast not very slow Trigger four or five steps behind There had been no sound from the walls and no other sign of what must be very considerable excitement nearby Trigger s spine kept tingling A needlebeam and a good marksman could pluck away the Denton and her hand along with it without much real risk to Ermetyne But probably even the smallest of risks was more than the Tranest people would be willing to take when the First Lady s person was involved Lyad reached the ComWeb and stopped Trigger stopped too five feet away Go ahead she said quietly Lyad turned to face her Let me make one last well call it an appeal she said Don t be an overethical fool Trigger Argee The arrangement I ve planned will do no harm to anybody Come in with me and you can write your own ticket for the rest of your life No ticket Trigger said She waggled the Denton slightly Go ahead You can talk to the Council later Lyad shrugged resignedly turned again and reached toward the ComWeb Trigger might have relaxed just a trifle at that moment Or perhaps there was some other cue that Pilli could pick up There came no sound from the ceiling canopy What she caught was a sense of something moving above her Then the great golden bulk landed with a terrifying lightness on the thick carpet between Lyad and herself The eyeless nightmare head wasn t three feet from her own The lights in the room went out Trigger flung herself backwards rolled six feet to one side stood up backed away and stopped again twenty two The blackness in the room was complete She spun the Denton to kill There was silence around her and then a soft rustling at some distance It might have been the cautious shuffle of a heavy foot over thick carpeting It stopped again Where was Lyad Her eyes shifted about trying to pierce the darkness Black light she thought She said Lyad Yes Lyad s voice came easily in the dark She might be standing about thirty feet away at the far end of the room Call your animal off Trigger said quietly I don t want to kill it She began moving in the direction from which Lyad had spoken Pilli won t hurt you Trigger the Ermetyne said He s been sent in to disarm you that s all Throw your gun away and he won t even touch you She laughed Don t bother shooting in my direction either I m not in the room any more Trigger stopped Not because of what that hateful laughing voice had said But because in the dark about her a fresh pungent smell was growing The smell of ripe apples She moistened her lips She whispered Pilli keep away Eyeless the dark would mean nothing to it Seconds later she heard the thing breathing She faced the sound It stopped for a moment then it came again A slow animal breathing It seemed to circle slowly to her left After a little it stopped Then it was coming toward her She said softly almost pleadingly Pilli stop Go back Pilli Silence Pilli s odor lay heavily all around Trigger heard her blood drumming in her ears and for a second then she imagined she could feel like a tangible fog the body warmth of the monster standing in the dark before her It wasn t imagination Something like a smooth heavy pad of rubber closed around her right wrist and tightened terribly The Denton went off two three four times before she was jerked violently sideways flung away sent stumbling backward against some low piece of furniture and sprawling over it The gun was lost As she scrambled dizzily to her feet Pilli screamed It was a thin high breathless sound like the screaming of a terrified human child It stopped abruptly And as if that had been a signal the room came full of light again Trigger blinked dazedly against the light Virod stood before her looking at her a pair of opaque yellow goggles shoved up on his forehead Black light glasses The golden haired thing lay in a great shapeless huddle on the floor twenty feet to one side She couldn t see her gun But Virod held one pointing at her Virod s other hand moved suddenly Its palm caught the side of her face in a hefty slap Trigger staggered dumbly sideways got her balance and stood facing him again She didn t even feel anger Her cheek began to burn Stop amusing yourself Virod It was Lyad s voice Trigger saw her then standing in a small half opened door across the room where a wall hanging had been folded away She appeared to be in shock First Lady Virod explained blandly Is Pilli dead Yes I have her gun He got it from her Virod slapped a pocket of his jacket and some part of Trigger s mind noted the gesture and suddenly came awake So I saw Well too bad about Pilli But it was necessary Bring her here then And be reasonably gentle Lyad still sounded unruffled And put that gun in a different pocket fool or she ll take it away from you She looked at Trigger impersonally as Virod brought her to the little door his left hand clamped on her arm just above the elbow She said Too bad you killed my expert Trigger We ll have to use a chemical approach now Flam and Virod are quite good at that but there will be some pain Not too much because I ll be watching them But it will be rather undignified I m afraid And it will take a great deal longer Tanned tall sinuous Flam stood in the small room beyond the door Trigger saw a long low plastic covered table clamps and glittering gadgetry That would have been where cold fish Balmordan hadn t been able to make it against his mind blocks finally There was still one thing she could do The yacht was orbiting That sort of thing won t be at all necessary she said shakily Her voice shook with great ease as if it had been practicing it all along No Lyad said You ve won Trigger said resignedly I ll play along now I ll show you how to open that handbag to start with Lyad nodded How do you open it You have to press it in the right places Have them bring it here I ll show you Lyad laughed You re a little too eager And much too docile Trigger Considering what s in that handbag it s not at all likely it will detonate if we brightly hand it to you and let you start pressing But something or other of a very undesirable nature would certainly happen Flam The tall redhead nodded and smiled She went over to a wall cabinet unlocked it and took out Repulsive s container Lyad said Put it on that shelf for the moment Then bring me Virod s gun and hers I m afraid you ll have to go up on that table now Trigger she said If you ve really decided to cooperate it won t be too bad And by and by you ll start telling us very exactly what should be done with that handbag And a few other things She might have caught Trigger s expression then She added drily I was informed a few nights ago that you re quite an artist in rough and tumble tactics So are Virod and Flam So if you want to give Virod an opportunity to amuse himself a little go right ahead At that point the graceful thing undoubtedly would have been to just smile and get up on the table Trigger discovered she couldn t do it She gave them a fast silent vicious tussle mouth clenched breathing hard through her nose It was quite insanely useless They weren t letting her get anywhere near Lyad After Virod had amused himself a little he picked her up and plunked her down on the table A minute later she was stretched out on it face down wrists and ankles secured with padded clamps to its surface Flam took a small knife and neatly slit the back of the Precol uniform open along the line of her spine She folded the cloth away Then Trigger felt the thin icy touches of some vanilla smelling spray walk up her ending at the base of her skull It wasn t so very painful Lyad had told the truth about that But presently it became extremely undignified Then her thoughts were speeding up and slowing down and swirling around in an odd confusing fashion And at last her voice began to say things she didn t want it to say After this there might have been a pause She seemed to be floating up out of a small pool of sleep when Lyad s voice said somewhere with cold fury in it There s nothing inside A whole little series of memory pictures popped up suddenly then like a chain of firecrackers somebody had set off They formed themselves into a pattern and there the pattern was in Trigger s mind She looked at it Her eyes flew open in surprise She began to laugh weakly Light footsteps came quickly over to her Where is that plasmoid Trigger The Ermetyne was in a fine towering rage She d better say something Ask the Commissioner she said mumbling a little It s wearing off First Lady said Flam Shall I Trigger s thoughts went eddying away for a moment and she didn t hear Lyad s reply But then the vanilla smell was there again and the thin icy touches This time they stopped abruptly halfway And then there was a very odd stillness all around Trigger As if everybody and everything had stopped moving together A deep savage voice said I hope there ll be no trouble folks I just want her a lot worse than you do Trigger frowned in puzzlement Next came an angry roar some thumping sounds a sudden crack Oops the deep voice said happily A little too hard I m afraid Why of course Trigger thought She opened her eyes and twisted her head around Still awake Trigger Quillan asked from the door of the room He looked pleasantly surprised There was a very large bellmouthed gun in his hand That was an odd looking little group in the doorway Trigger felt On his knees before Quillan was a fat elderly man blinking dazedly at her He wore a brilliantly purple bath towel knotted about his loins and nothing else It was a moment before she recognized Belchik Pluly Old Belchy And on the floor before Belchy motionless as if in devout prostration Virod lay on his face Dead no doubt He shouldn t have got gay with Quillan Yes Trigger said then remembering Quillan s question I ve got a very fast snap back but they fed me a fresh load of dope just a moment ago So I saw said Quillan His glance shifted beyond Trigger Lyad he said almost gently Yes Quillan Lyad s voice came from the other side of Trigger Trigger turned her head toward it Lyad and Flam both stood at the far side of the room Their expressions were unhappy I don t like at all Quillan said what s been going on here Not one bit Which is why Big Boy got the neck broken finally Can the rest of us take a hint Certainly the Ermetyne said So the Flam girl quits ogling those guns on the shelf and stays put or they ll amputate a leg First Lady you come up to the table and get Trigger unclamped Trigger realized her eyes had fallen shut again She left them that way for a moment There was motion near her and the wrist clamps came off in turn Lyad moved down to her feet The fancy looking gun is Trigger s Quillan inquired Yes said Lyad Is that what happened to Pilli and the other gent out there Yes Imagine said Quillan thoughtfully Uh got something to seal up the clothes Yes Lyad said Bring it here Flam Toss it Flam cautioned Quillan Remember the leg Lyad s hands did things to the clothes at her back Then they went away You can sit up now Trigger Quillan s voice informed her loudly Sort of slide down easy off the table and see if you can stand Trigger opened her eyes twisted about slid her legs over the edge of the table came down on her feet stood I want my gun and the handbag she announced She saw them again then on the shelf walked over and picked up the plasmoid container She looked inside snapped it shut and slung the strap over her shoulder She picked up the Denton looked at its setting spun it and turned First Lady she said Lyad went white around the lips Quillan made some kind of startled sound Trigger shot Flam ran at her then screaming arms waving eyes wild and green like an animal s Trigger half turned and shot again She looked at Quillan Just stunned she explained She waited Quillan let his breath out slowly Glad to hear it He glanced down at Pluly Purse was open he remarked significantly Uh huh Trigger agreed How s the doohinkus She laughed Safe and sound Believe me Good he said He still looked somewhat puzzled Put the eye on Belchy for a few seconds then We re taking Lyad along I ll have to carry her now Right Trigger said She felt rather jaunty at the moment She put the eye on Belchik Belchik moaned They started out of the little room Pluly in the van clutching his towel The Ermetyne dangling loosely over Quillan s left shoulder looked fairly gruesomely dead You walk this side of me Trigger Quillan said Still all right She nodded Yes Actually she wasn t quite It was mainly a problem with her thoughts which showed a tendency to move along in odd little leaps and bounds with short stops in between as if something were trying to freeze them up But if it was going to be like the first time she should last till they got to wherever they were going Halfway across the room she saw the golden thing like a huge furry sack on the carpet and shivered Poor Pilli she said Alas Quillan said politely I gather you didn t just stun Pilli She shook her head Couldn t she said Too big Too fast How about the other one Oh him Stunned He s an investigator They thought he was dead though That s what scared Lyad and Flam Yeah Quillan said thoughtfully It would Another section of wall hanging had folded aside and a wide door stood open behind it They went through the door and turned into a mirrored passageway Pluly still tottering rapidly ahead Might keep that gun ready Trigger Quillan warned We just could get jumped here Don t think so though They d have to get past the Commissioner Oh he s here too She didn t hear what Quillan answered because things faded out around then When they faded in again the passageway with the mirrors had disappeared and they were coming to the top of a short flight of low wide stairs and into a very beautiful room This room was high and long not very wide In the center was a small square swimming pool and against the walls on either side was a long row of tall square crystal pillars through which strange lights undulated slowly Trigger glanced curiously at the nearest pillar She stopped short Galaxy she said startled Quillan reached back and grabbed her arm with his gun hand Keep moving girl That s just how Belchik keeps his harem grouped around him when he s working Not too bad an idea it does cut down the chatter This is his office Office Then she saw the large business desk with prosaic standard equipment which stood on the carpet on the other side of the pool They moved rapidly past the pool Quillan still hauling at her arm Trigger kept staring at the pillars they passed Long limbed supple and languid they floated in their crystal cages in tinted shifting lights eyes closed hair drifting about their faces Awesome isn t it Quillan s voice said Yes said Trigger Awesome One in each he is a pig They look drowned He is and they aren t said Quillan Very lively girls when he lets them out Now around this turn and oops Pluly had reached the turn at the end of the row of pillars moaned again and fallen forwards Fainted Quillan said Well we don t need him any more Watch your step Trigger dead one just behind Pluly Trigger stretched her stride and cleared the dead one behind Pluly neatly There were three more dead ones lying inside the entrance to the next big room She went past them feeling rather dreamy The sight of a squat black subtub parked squarely on the thick purple carpeting ahead of her with its canopy up didn t strike her as unusual Then she saw that the man leaning against the canopy a gun in one hand was Commissioner Tate She smiled She waved her hand at him as they came up Hi Holati Hi yourself said the Commissioner He asked Quillan How s she doing Not bad Quillan said A bit ta ta at the moment Double dose of ceridim by the smell of it Had a little trouble here I see A little the Commissioner acknowledged They went for their guns Very uninformed gentlemen said Quillan He let Lyad s limp form slide off his shoulder and bent forward to lower her into the subtub s back seat Trigger had been waiting for a chance to get into the conversation Just who she demanded now frowning is a bit ta ta at the moment You said Quillan You re doped remember You ll ride up front with the Commissioner Here He picked her up plasmoid purse and all and set her down on the front seat Holati Tate she discovered then was already inside Quillan swung down into the seat behind her The canopy snapped shut above The Commissioner shifted the tub s controls In the screens the room outside vanished A darkness went rushing downwards past them A thought suddenly popped to mind again and Trigger burst into tears The Commissioner glanced over at her What s the matter Trigger girl I m so s sorry I killed Pilli He s screamed Then her mind froze up with a jolt and thinking stopped completely Quillan reached over the back of the seat and eased her over on her side Got to her finally he said He sat down again He brooded a moment She shouldn t get so disturbed about that Pilli thing he remarked then It couldn t have lived anyway Eh the Commissioner said absently watching the screens Why not Its brains Quillan explained were too far apart The Commissioner blinked It s getting to you too son he said twenty three Trigger came out of the ceridim trance hours before Lyad awoke from the stunner blast she d absorbed The Commissioner was sitting in a chair beside her bunk napping She looked around a moment feeling very comfortable and secure This was her personal cabin on Commissioner Tate s ship the one he referred to as the Big Job modeled after the long range patrol ships of the Space Scouts It wasn t actually very big but six or seven people could go traveling around in it very comfortably At the moment it appeared to be howling through subspace at its hellish rate again going somewhere Well that could keep Trigger reached out and poked the Commissioner s knee Hey Holati she whispered Wake up His eyes opened He looked at her and smiled Back again eh he said Trigger motioned at the door Close it she whispered Got something to tell you Talk away he said Quillan s piloting the First Lady s out cold and Mantelish got dive sick and I doped him Nobody else on board Trigger lay back and looked at him This is going to sound pretty odd she warned him Then she told him what Repulsive had done and what he was trying to do The Commissioner looked badly shaken You sure of that Trigger Sure I m sure Trying to talk to you That s it He blinked at her I looked in the bag and the thing was gone Lyad knows it was gone Trigger said So in case she gets a chance to blab to someone we ll say you had it He nodded and stood up You stay here he said Prescription for the kind of treatment you ve had is a day of bed rest Where are you going I m going to go talk to that Psychology ship he said And just let em try to stall me this time He went off up the passage toward the transmitter cabinet in the forward part of the ship Some minutes passed Then Trigger suddenly heard Commissioner Tate s voice raised in great wrath She listened It appeared the Psychology Service had got off on the wrong foot by advising him once more to stay calm He came back presently and sat down beside the bunk still a little red in the face They re going to follow us he said If they hadn t I would have turned back and gunned our way on board that lopsided disgrace of theirs Follow us Where He grunted A place called Luscious We ll be there in under a week It ll take them about three But they re starting immediately Trigger blinked Looks like the plasmoids have made it to the head of the problem list I wouldn t be surprised said the Commissioner I was put through to that Pilch after a while She said to remind you to listen to your thinking whenever you can get around to it Know what she meant I m not sure I do Trigger said hesitantly But she s mentioned it I ll give it a whirl Why are we going to Luscious Selan s Fleet found plasmoids on it It s in the Vishni area What kind of plasmoids He shrugged They don t amount to much from what I heard Small stuff But definitely plasmoid It looks like somebody might have done some experimenting there for a while And not long ago Did they find the big one Not yet No trace of any people on Luscious either He chewed his lip thoughtfully for a moment About an hour after we picked you and Lyad up he said we had a Council Order transmitted to the ship Told us to swing off course a bit and rendezvous with a fast courier boat of theirs What for The order said the courier was to take Lyad on board and head for the Hub with her Some diplomatic business He scratched his chin It also instructed us to treat the First Lady of Tranest with the courtesy due to her station meanwhile Brother Trigger said outraged Just too bad I couldn t read that message said Holati Tate Some gravitic disturbance Rendezvous point s hours behind us They ll never catch up Ho ho said Trigger But that s being pretty insubordinate Holati It was till just now he said I mentioned that we had Lyad on board to that Pilch person She said she d speak to the Council We re to hang on to Lyad and when Pilch gets to Luscious she ll interview her Trigger grinned Now that she remarked gives me a feeling of great satisfaction somehow When Pilch gets her little mitts on someone there isn t much left out I had that impression Meanwhile we ll put the Ermetyne through a routine questioning ourselves when she gets over being groggy Courtesy will be on the moderate side She ll probably spill part of what she knows especially if you sit there and hand her the beady stare from time to time That Trigger assured him will be hardly an effort at all I can imagine You re pretty sure that thing will show up again Trigger nodded Just leave the handbag with me All right He stood up I ve got a hot lunch prepared for you I ll bring the bag along Then you can tell me what happened after they grabbed you How did you find out I was gone Trigger asked Your fac he said The girl was darn good actually I talked to you her on office transmitter once and didn t spot a sour note Mostly she just kept out of everybody s way Very slick at it We would have got her fairly fast because we were preparing for take off to Luscious by then But she spilled it herself How I located her finally again on transmitter screen There was no one on her side to impress She took a sniff of porgee Trigger laughed delightedly Good old porgee pouch It beat them twice But how did you know where I was No problem there We knew Lyad had strings on Pluly Quillan knew about that sealed level on Pluly s yacht and got Pluly to invite him over to admire the harem right after the Dawn City arrived While he was admiring he was also recording floor patterns for a subtub jump That gimmick s pretty much of a spilled secret now but on a swap for you and Lyad it was worth it We came aboard five minutes after we d nabbed your fac The Ermetyne figured you d go chasing after the Aurora Trigger said Well the Commissioner said tolerantly the Ermetyne s pretty young The Aurora was a bit obvious How come Quillan didn t start wondering when I didn t show up in Mantelish s lab with Repulsive So that s what he was for Holati said He rubbed the side of his jaw I was curious about that angle That wasn t Quillan That was Quillan s fac In Mantelish s lab Trigger said startled Sure That s how they all got in In those specimen crates Mantelish has been lugging into the dome the past couple of days It looks like the prof s been hypnotized up to his ears for months The last five hours of her day of recuperative rest Trigger spent asleep her cabin door locked and the plasmoid purse open on the bunk beside her Holati had come by just before to report that the Ermetyne was now awake but very groggy apparently more than a little shocked and not yet quite able to believe she was still alive He d dose her with this and that and interrogations would be postponed until everybody was on their feet When Trigger woke up from her five hour nap the purse was shut She opened it and looked inside Repulsive was down there quietly curled up Smart little bugger aren t you she said not entirely with approval Then she reached in and gave him a pat She locked the purse got dressed and went up to the front of the ship carrying Repulsive along All four of the others were up in the lounge area which included the partitioned control section The partition had been slid into the wall and the Commissioner who was at the controls at the moment had swung his seat half around toward the lounge He glanced at the plasmoid purse as Trigger came in grinned and gave her a small wink Come in and sit down he said We ve been waiting for you Trigger sat down and looked at them Something apparently had been going on Quillan s tanned face was thoughtful perhaps a trifle amused Mantelish looked very red and angry His shock of white hair was wildly rumpled The Ermetyne appeared a bit wilted What s been going on Trigger asked It was the wrong question Mantelish took a deep breath and began bellowing like a wounded thunder ork Trigger listened with some admiration It was one of the best jobs of well verbalized huffing she d heard even from the professor He ran down in less than five minutes though apparently he d already let off considerable steam Lyad had dehypnotized him at the Commissioner s suggestion It had been a lengthy job requiring a couple of hours but it was a complete one Which was understandable since it was the First Lady herself Trigger gathered gradually from the noise who had put Mantelish under the influence back in his own garden on Maccadon and within two weeks after his first return from Harvest Moon It was again Lyad who had given Mantelish his call to bemused duty via a transmitted verbal cue on her arrival in Manon and instructed him to get lost from his League guards for a few hours in Manon s swamps There she had met and conferred with him and pumped him of all he could tell her As the final outrage she had instructed him to lug her crated cohorts preserved like Pluly s harem ladies into the Precol dome to care for them tenderly there and at the proper cued moment to release them for action all under the illusion that they were priceless biological specimens Mantelish wasn t in the least appeased by the fact that again at the Commissioner s suggestion Lyad had installed one minor new hypno command which she said would clear up permanently his tendency toward attacks of dive sickness But he just ran down finally and sat there glowering at the Ermetyne now and then Well the Commissioner remarked this might be as good a time as any to ask a few questions Got your little quizzer with you Quillan Quillan nodded Lyad looked at both of them in turn and then briefly and for the first time glanced in Trigger s direction It wasn t exactly an appealing glance It might have been a questioning one And Trigger discovered suddenly that she felt just a little sympathy for Lyad Lyad had lost out on a very big gamble And each in his own way there were three very formidable males among whom she was sitting None of them was friendly two were oversized and the undersized one had a fairly bloodchilling record for anyone on the wrong side of law and order Trigger decided to forget about beady stares for the moment Cheer up Lyad she said Nobody s going to hurt you Just give em the answers She got another glance Not a grateful one exactly Not an ungrateful one either Temporary support had been acknowledged Commissioner Tate has informed me the Ermetyne said that this group does not recognize the principle of diplomatic immunity in my case Under the circumstances I must accept that And so I shall answer any questions I can She looked at the pocket quizzer Quillan was checking over unhurriedly But such verification instruments are of no use in questioning me Why not Quillan asked idly I ve been conditioned against them of course Lyad said I m an Ermetyne of Tranest By the time I was twelve years old that toy of yours couldn t have registered a reaction from me that I didn t want it to show Quillan slipped the toy back in his pocket True enough First Lady he said And that s one small strike in your favor We thought you might try to gimmick the gadget Now we ll just pitch you some questions A recorder s on Don t stall on the answers And he and the Commissioner started flipping out questions The Ermetyne flipped back the answers So far as Trigger could tell there wasn t any stalling Or any time for it Azol Doctor Azol had been her boy from the start He was now on Tranest The main item in his report to her had been the significance of the one hundred twelve one hundred thirteen plasmoid unit He d also reported that Trigger Argee had become unconscious on Harvest Moon They d considered the possibility that somebody was controlling Trigger Argee or attempting to control her because of her connections with the plasmoid operations Gess Fayle Lyad had been looking for Doctor Fayle as earnestly as everyone else after his disappearance She had not been able to buy him So far as she knew nobody had been able to buy him Doctor Fayle had appeared to intend to work for himself He was at present well outside the Hub s area of space He still had one hundred twelve one hundred thirteen with him Yes she could become more specific about the location with the help of star maps Let s get them out said Commissioner Tate They got them out The Ermetyne presently circled a largish section of the Vishni Fleet s area The questions began again one hundred thirteen A Professor Mantelish had told her of his experiments with this plasmoid There was an interruption here while Mantelish huffed reflexively But it was very brief The professor wanted to learn more about the First Lady s depravities himself and its various possible associations with the main unit But by the time this information became available to her one hundred thirteen A had been placed under heavy guard Professor Mantelish had made one attempt to smuggle it out to her Huff huff but had been unable to walk past the guards with it Tranest agents had made several unsuccessful attempts to pick up the plasmoid She knew that another group had made similarly unsuccessful attempts The Devagas She did not yet know the specific nature of one hundred thirteen A s importance But it was important Trigger Trigger Argee might be able to tell them why Trigger was important Doctor Fayle certainly could So could the top ranks of the Devagas hierarchy Lyad at the moment could not She did know that Trigger Argee s importance was associated directly with that of plasmoid one hundred thirteen A This information had been obtained from a Devagas operator now dead Not Balmordan The operator had been in charge of the attempted pickup on Evalee The much more elaborate affair at the Colonial School had been a Tranest job A Devagas group had made attempts to interfere with it but had been disposed of Pluly Lyad had strings on Belchik He was afraid of the Devagas but somewhat more terrified of her His fear of the Devagas was due to the fact that he and an associate had provided the hierarchy with a very large quantity of contraband materials The nature of the materials indicated the Devagas were constructing a major fortified outpost on a world either airless or with poisonous atmosphere Pluly s associate had since been murdered Pluly believed he was next in line to be silenced Balmordan Balmordan had been a rather high ranking Devagas Intelligence agent Lyad had heard of him only recently He had been in charge of the attempts to obtain one hundred thirteen A Lyad had convinced him that she would make a very dangerous competitor in the Manon area She also had made information regarding her activities there available to him So Balmordan and a select group of his gunmen had attended Pluly s party on Pluly s yacht They had been allowed to force their way into the sealed level and were there caught in a black light trap The gunmen had been killed Balmordan had been questioned The questioning revealed that the Devagas had found Doctor Fayle and the one hundred twelve one hundred thirteen unit almost immediately after Fayle s disappearance They had succeeded in creating some working plasmoids To go into satisfactory operation they still needed one hundred thirteen A Balmordan had not known why But they no longer needed Trigger Argee Trigger Argee was now to be destroyed at the earliest opportunity Again Balmordan had not known why Fayle and his unit were in the fortress dome the Devagas had been building It was in the area Lyad had indicated It was supposed to be very thoroughly concealed Balmordan might or might not have known its exact coordinates His investigators made the inevitable slip finally and triggered a violent mind block reaction Balmordan had died Dead braining him had produced no further relevant information The little drumfire of questions ended abruptly Trigger glanced at her watch It had been going on for only fifteen minutes but she felt somewhat dizzy by now The Ermetyne just looked a little more wilted After a minute Commissioner Tate inquired politely whether there was any further information the First Lady could think of to give them at this time She shook her head No Only Professor Mantelish believed her But the interrogation was over apparently twenty four Quillan took over the ship controls and the Commissioner and Trigger went with the recorder into the little office back of the transmitter cabinet to slam out some fast reports to the Hub and other points Lyad was apologizing profoundly to Mantelish as they left the lounge The professor was huffing back at her rather mildly A little while later Lyad showing indications of restrained surprise was helping Trigger prepare dinner They took it into the lounge Quillan remained at the controls while the others started eating Trigger fixed up a tray and brought it to him Thanks for the rescue Major she said He grinned up at her It was a pleasure Trigger glanced back at the little group in the lounge Think she was fibbing a bit Sure Mainly she d decided in advance how much to tell and how much not She thinks fast in action though No slips What she told of what she knows makes a solid story and with angles we can check on fast So it s bound to have plenty of information in it It ll do for the moment She s already started buttering up Mantelish said Trigger She ll do that Quillan said By the time we reach Luscious the prof probably might as well be back in the trances The Commissioner intends to give her a little rope I think How close is Luscious to that area she showed Quillan flicked on their course screen and superimposed the map Lyad had marked Red dot s well inside he pointed out That bit was probably quite solid info He looked up at her Did it bother you much to hear the Devagas have dropped the grab idea and are out to do you in Trigger shook her head Not really she said Wouldn t make much difference one way or the other would it Very little He patted her hand Well they re not going to get you doll one way or the other Trigger smiled I believe you she said Thanks She looked back into the lounge again Just at present she did have a feeling of relaxed unconcerned security It probably wasn t going to last though She glanced at Quillan Those computers of yours she said What did they have to say about that not catassin you squashed The crazy things claim now it was a plasmoid Quillan said Revolting notion But it makes some sense for once Checks with some of the things Lyad just told us too Do you remember that Vethi sponge Balmordan was carrying Yes It didn t come off the ship with him He checked it out as having died en route That is a revolting notion Trigger said after a moment Well at least we ve got detectors now But the feeling of security had faded somewhat again Before dinner was half over the long range transmitters abruptly came to life For the next thirty minutes or so messages rattled in incessantly as assorted Headquarters here and there reacted to the Ermetyne s report The Commissioner sat in the little office and sorted over the incoming information Trigger stayed at the transmitters feeding it to him as it arrived None of it affected them directly they were already headed for the point in space a great many other people would now start heading for very soon Then business dropped off again almost as suddenly as it had picked up A half dozen low priority items straggled in in as many minutes The transmitters purred idly Then the person to person buzzer sounded Trigger punched the screen button A voice pronounced the ship s dial number Acknowledging Trigger said Who is it Orado ComWeb Center said the voice Stand by for contact with Federation Councilman Roadgear Trigger whacked the panic button Roadgear was a NAME Standing by she said Commissioner Tate came in through the door and slipped into the chair she d already vacated Trigger took another seat a few feet away She felt a little nervous but she d always wanted to see a high powered diplomat in action The screen lit up She recognized Roadgear from his pics Tall fine looking man of the silvered sideburns type He was in an armchair in a very plush office Congratulations Commissioner he said smiling I believe you re aware by now that your latest report has set many wheels spinning rapidly I rather expected it would the Commissioner admitted He also smiled They pitched it back and forth a few times very chummy Roadgear didn t appear to be involved in any specific way with the operations which soon would center about Luscious Trigger began to wonder what he was after A few of us are rather curious to know Roadgear said why you didn t acknowledge the last Council Order sent you Trigger didn t quite start nervously When was this asked the Commissioner Roadgear smiled softly and told him Got a record here of some scrambled item that arrived about then the Commissioner said Very good of you to call me about it Councilman What was the order content It s dated now as it happens Roadgear said Actually I m calling about another matter The First Lady of Tranest appears to have been very obliging about informing you of some of her recent activities The Commissioner nodded Yes very obliging And in so short a time after her ah detainment You must have been very persuasive Well Holati Tate said no more than usually Yes said Councilman Roadgear Now there s been some slight concern expressed by some members of the Council well let s say they d just like to be reassured that the amenities one observes in dealing with a head of state actually are being observed in this case I m sure they are of course The Commissioner was silent a moment I was informed a while ago he said that full responsibility for this Head of State has been assigned to my group Is that correct The Councilman reddened very slightly Quite he said The official Council Order should reach you in a day or so Well then said the Commissioner I ll assure you and you can assure the Councilmen who were feeling concerned that the amenities are being observed Then everybody can relax again Is that all right No not quite Roadgear said annoyedly In fact the Councilmen would very much prefer it Commissioner if I were given an opportunity to speak to the First Lady directly to reassure myself on the point Well Commissioner Tate said she can t come to the transmitters right now She s washing the dishes The Councilman reddened very considerably this time He stared at the Commissioner a moment longer Then he said in a very soft voice Oh the hell with it He added Good luck Commissioner you re going to need it some time The screen went blank The scouts of Selan s Independent Fleet who had first looked this planet over and decided to call it Luscious had selected a name Trigger thought which probably would stick Because that was what it was at least in the area where they were camping She rolled over from her side to her face and gave herself a push away from the rock she d been regarding contemplatively for the past few minutes Feet first she went drifting out into a somewhat deeper section of Plasmoid Creek None of it was very deep There were pools here and there in the stretch of the creek she usually came to where she could stand on her toes in the warm clear water and arms stretched straight up barely tickle the surface with her finger tips But along most of the stretch the bigger rocks weren t even submerged She came sliding over the sand to another rock turned on her back and leaned up against the rock blinking at sun reflections along the water Camp was a couple of hundred yards down the valley its sounds cut off by a rise of the ground The Commissioner s ship was there plus a half dozen tents plus a sizable I Fleet unit with lab facilities which Selan s outfit had loaned Mantelish for the duration There were some fifteen twenty people in all about the camp at the moment They knew she was loafing around in the water up here and wouldn t disturb her Strictly speaking of course she wasn t loafing She was learning how to listen to herself think She didn t feel she was getting the knack of it too quickly but it was coming The best way seemed to be to let go mentally as much as possible to wait without impatience really to more or less listen quietly within yourself as if you were looking around in some strange forest letting whatever wanted to come to view come and fade again as something else rose to view instead The main difficulty was with the business of relaxing mentally which wasn t at all her natural method of approaching a problem But when she could do it information of a kind that was beginning to look very interesting was likely to come filtering into her awareness Whatever was at work deep in her mind and she could give a pretty fair guess at what it was now seemed as weak and slow as the Psychology Service people had indicated The traces of its work were usually faint and vague But gradually the traces were forming into some very definite pictures Lazing around in the waters of Plasmoid Creek for an hour or so every morning had turned out to be a helpful part of the process On the flashing all out run to Luscious subspace all the way with the Commissioner and Quillan spelling each other around the clock at the controls the transmitters clattering for attention every half hour the ship s housekeeping had to be handled and somebody besides Mantelish needed to keep a moderately beady eye on the Ermetyne she hadn t even thought of acting on Pilch s suggestion But once they d landed there suddenly wasn t much to keep her busy and she could shift priority to listening to herself think It was one of those interim periods where everything was being prepared and nothing had got started As a plasmoid planet Luscious was pretty much of a bust It was true that plasmoids were here It was also true that until fairly recently plasmoids were being produced here By the simple method of looking where they were thickest Selan s people even had located the plasmoid which had been producing the others several days before Mantelish arrived to confirm their find This one by the plasmoid standards of Luscious was a regular monster some twenty five inches high a gray mummylike thing dead and half rotted inside It was the first plasmoid with the possible exception of whatever had flattened itself out on Quillan s gravity mine known to have died There had been very considerable excitement when it was first discovered because the description made it sound very much as if they d finally located one hundred twelve one hundred thirteen They hadn t This one if Trigger had followed Mantelish correctly could be regarded as a cheap imitation of one hundred twelve And its productions compared with the working plastic life of Harvest Moon appeared to be strictly on a kindergarten level nuts and bolts and less than that To Trigger most of the ones that had been collected looked like assorted bugs and worms though one at least was the size of a small pig No form no pattern Mantelish rumbled Was the thing practicing Did it attempt to construct an assistant and set it down here to test it Well now He went off again to incomprehensibilities apparently no longer entirely dissatisfied Get me one hundred twelve he bellowed Then this business will be solved Meanwhile we now at least have plasmoid material to waste We can experiment boldly Come Lyad my dear And Lyad followed him into the lab unit where they went to work again dissecting burning stimulating inoculating and so forth great numbers of more or less pancake sized subplasmoids This morning Trigger wasn t getting down to the best semidrowsy level at all readily And it might very well be that Lyad my dear business You know she had told the Commissioner thoughtfully the day before by the time we re done Lyad will know more about plasmoids than anyone in the Hub except Mantelish He didn t look concerned Won t matter much By the time we re done she and the rest of the Ermetynes will have had to cough up control of Tranest They ve broken treaty with this business Oh Trigger said Does Lyad know that Sure She also knows she s getting off easy If she were a Federation citizen she d be up for compulsory rehabilitation right now She ll try something if she gets half a chance Trigger warned She sure will the Commissioner said absently He went on with his work It didn t seem to be Lyad that was bothering Trigger lay flat on her back in the shallow sand bar arms behind her head feeling the sun s warmth on her closed eyelids She watched her thoughts drifting by slowly It just might be Quillan Ole Major Quillan The rescuer in time of need The not catassin smasher Quite a guy The water murmured past her On the ride out here they d run by one another now and then going from job to job After they d arrived Quillan was gone three quarters of the time helping out in the hunt for the concealed Devagas fortress It was still concealed they hadn t yet picked up a trace But every so often he made it back to camp And every so often when he was back in camp and didn t think she was looking he d be sitting there looking at her Trigger grinned happily Ole Major Quillan being bashful Well now And that did it She could feel herself relaxing slipping down and away drifting down through her mind farther deeper toward the tiny voice that spoke in such a strange language and still was becoming daily more comprehensible Uh say Trigger twenty five Trigger gasped Her eyes flew open She made a convulsive effort to vanish beneath the surface of the creek Being flat on the sand as it was that didn t work So she stopped splashing about and made rapid covering up motions here and there instead You ve got a nerve she snapped as her breath came back Beat it Fast Ole bashful Quillan standing on the bank fifteen feet above her looked hurt He also looked Look he said plaintively I just came over to make sure you were all right wild animals around I wasn t studying the color scheme Beat it At once Quillan inhaled with apparent difficulty Though now it s been mentioned he went on speaking rapidly and unevenly there is all that brown and that sort of pink and that lovely white He was getting more enthusiastic by the moment Trigger became afraid he would fall off the bank and land in the creek beside her And the ooh ummh wet red hair and the freckles he rattled along his eyes starting out of his head And the lovely Quillan she yelled Please Quillan checked himself Uh he said He drew a deep breath The wild look faded Sanity appeared to return Well it s the truth about those wild animals Some sort of large uncouth critter was observed just now ducking into the forest at the upper end of the valley Trigger darted a glance along the bank Her clothes were forty feet away just beside the water I m observing some sort of large uncouth critter right here she said coldly What s worse it s observing me Turn around Quillan sighed You re a hard woman Argee he said But he turned He was carrying a holstered gun as a matter of fact but he usually did that nowadays anyway This thing he went on is supposed to have a head like a bat three feet across It flies Very interesting Trigger told him She decided he wasn t going to turn around again So now I ll just get into my clothes and then It came quietly out of the trees around the upper bend of the creek sixty feet away It had a head like a bat and was blue on top and yellow below Its flopping wing tips barely cleared the bank on either side The three foot mouth was wide open showing very long thin white teeth It came skimming swiftly over the surface of the water toward her Quiiii LLAN They walked back along the trail to camp Trigger walked a few steps ahead her back very straight The worst of it had been the smug look on his face Heel she observed Heel Heel Heel Now Trigger Quillan said calmly behind her After all it was you who came flying up the bank and wrapped yourself around my neck All wet too I was scared Trigger snarled Who wouldn t be You certainly didn t hesitate an instant to take full advantage of the situation True Quillan admitted I d dropped the bat There you were Who d hesitate I m not out of my mind She did two dance steps of pure rage and spun to face him She put her hands on her hips Quillan stopped warily Your mind she said I d hate to have one like it What do you think I am One of Belchik s houris For a man his size he was really extremely quick Before she could move he was there one big arm wrapped about her shoulders pinning her arms to her sides Easy Trigger he said softly Well others had tried to hold her like that when she didn t want to be held A twist a jerk a heave and over and down they went Trigger braced herself quietly If she was quick enough now She twisted jerked heaved She stopped discouraged The situation hadn t altered appreciably She had been afraid it wasn t going to work with Quillan Let go she said furiously aiming a fast heel at his instep But the instep flicked aside Her shoe dug into the turf of the path The ape might even have an extra pair of eyes on his feet Then his free palm was cupped under her chin tilting it carefully His other eyes appeared above hers Very close Very dark I ll bite Trigger whispered fiercely I ll bi mmph Mmmph grrmm Grr mm mhm Hm m m mhm They walked on along the trail hand in hand They came up over the last little rise Trigger looked down on the camp She frowned Pretty dull she observed Eh Quillan asked startled Not that ape she said She squeezed his hand Your morals aren t good but dull it wasn t I meant generally We re just sitting here now waiting Nothing seems to be happening It was true at least on the surface There were a great number of ships and men around and near Luscious but they weren t in view They were ready to jump in any direction at any moment but they had nothing to jump at yet The Commissioner s transmitters hadn t signaled more than two or three times in the last two days Even the short communicators remained mostly silent Cheer up Doll Quillan said Something s bound to break pretty soon That evening a Devagas ship came zooming in on Luscious They were prepared for it of course That somebody came round from time to time to look over the local plasmoid crop was only to be expected As the ship surfaced in atmosphere on the other side of the planet four one man Scout fighters flashed in on it from four points of the horizon radiation screens up They tacked holding beams on it and braced themselves A Federation destroyer appeared in the air above it The Devagas ship couldn t escape So it blew itself up They were prepared for that too The Devagas pilot was being dead brained three minutes later He didn t know a significant thing except the exact coordinates of an armed subterranean Devagas dome three days run away The Scout ships that had been hunting for the dome went howling in toward it from every direction The more massive naval vessels of the Federation followed behind There was no hurry for the heavies The captured Devagas ship s attempt to beam a warning to its base had been smothered without effort The Scouts were getting in fast enough to block escape attempts And now we split forces the Commissioner said He was the only one Trigger thought who didn t seem too enormously excited by it all Quillan you and your group get going They can use you there a whole lot better than we can here For just a second Quillan looked like a man being dragged violently in two directions He didn t look at Trigger He asked Think it s wise to leave you people unguarded Quillan said Commissioner Tate that s the first time in my life anybody has suggested I need guarding Sorry sir said Quillan You mean Trigger said we re not going We re just staying here You ve got an appointment remember the Commissioner said Quillan and company were gone within the hour Mantelish Holati Tate Lyad and Trigger stayed at camp Luscious looked very lonely It isn t just the king plasmoid they re hoping to catch there the Commissioner told Trigger And I wouldn t care frankly if the thing stayed lost the next few thousand years But we had a very odd report last week The Federation s undercover boys have been scanning the Devagas worlds and Tranest very closely of late naturally The report is that there isn t the slightest evidence that a single one of the top members of the Devagas hierarchy has been on any of their worlds in the past two months Oh she said They think they re out here In that dome That s what s suspected But why He scratched his chin If anyone knows they haven t told me It s probably nothing nice Trigger pondered You d think they d use facsimiles she said Like Lyad Oh they did he said They did That s one of the reasons for being pretty sure they re gone They re nowhere near as expert at that facsimile business as the Tranest characters A little study of the recordings showed the facs were just that Trigger pondered again Did they find anything on Tranest Yes One combat strength squadron of those souped up frigates of the Aurora class they re allowed by treaty can t be accounted for Trigger cupped her chin in her hands and looked at him Is that why we ve stayed on Luscious Holati the four of us It s one reason That Repulsive thing of yours is another What about him I have a pretty strong feeling he said that while they ll probably find the hierarchy in that Devagas dome they won t find the one hundred twelve one hundred thirteen item there So Lyad still is gambling Trigger said And we re gambling we ll get more out of her next play than she does She hesitated Holati Yes When did you decide it would be better if nobody ever got to see that king plasmoid again Holati Tate said About the time I saw the reconstruct of that yellow monster of Balmordan s Frankly Trigger there was a good deal of discussion of possibilities along that line before we decided to announce the discovery of Harvest Moon If we could have just kept it hidden away for a couple of centuries until there was considerably more good sense around the Hub we probably would have done it But somebody was bound to run across it sometime And the stuff did look as if it might be extremely valuable So we took the chance And now you d like to untake it If it s still possible Half the Fed Council probably would like to see it happen But they don t even dare think along those lines There could be a blowup that would throw Hub politics back into the kind of snarl they haven t been in for a hundred years If anything is done it will have to look as if it had been something nobody could have helped And that still might be bad enough I suppose so Holati Yes She shook her head Nothing Or if it is I ll ask you later She stood up I think I ll go have my swim She still went loafing in Plasmoid Creek in the mornings The bat had been identified as an innocent victim of appearances a very mild mannered beast dedicated to the pursuit and engulfment of huge mothlike bugs which hung around watercourses Luscious still looked like the safest of all possible worlds for any creature as vigorous as a human being But she kept the Denton near now just in case She stretched out again in the sun warmed water selected a smooth rock to rest her head on wriggled into the sand a little so the current wouldn t shift her and closed her eyes She lay still breathing slowly Contact was coming more easily and quickly every morning But the information which had begun to filter through in the last few days wasn t at all calculated to make one happy She was afraid now she was going to die in this thing She had almost let it slip out to Holati which wouldn t have helped in the least She d have to watch that in future Repulsive hadn t exactly said she would die He d said Maybe Repulsive was scared too Scared badly Trigger lay quiet her thoughts her attention drifting softly inward and down Creek water rippled against her cheek It was all because that one clock moved so slowly That was the thing that couldn t be changed Ever twenty six Three mornings later the emergency signal called her back to camp on the double Trigger ran over the developments of the past days in her mind as she trotted along the path getting dressed more or less on the way The Devagas dome was solidly invested by now its transmitters blanked out It hadn t tried to communicate with its attackers On their part the Fed ships weren t pushing the attack They were holding the point waiting for the big slow wrecking boats to arrive which would very gently and delicately start uncovering and opening the dome taking it apart piece by piece The hierarchy could surrender themselves and whatever they were hiding in there at any point in the process They didn t have a chance Nobody and nothing had escaped The Scouts had swatted down a few Devagas vessels on the way in but those had been headed toward the dome not away from it Perhaps the Psychology Service ship had arrived several days ahead of time The other three weren t in camp but the lock to the Commissioner s ship stood open Trigger went in and found them gathered up front The Commissioner had swung the transmitter cabinet aside and was back there prowling among the power leads What s wrong Trigger asked Transmitters went out he said Don t know why yet Grab some tools and help me check She slipped on her work gloves grabbed some tools and joined him Lyad and Mantelish watched them silently They found the first spots of the fungus a few minutes later Fungus Mantelish said startled He began to rumble in his pockets My microscope I have it Lyad handed it to him She looked at him with concern You don t think It seems possible We did come in here last night remember And we came straight from the lab But we had been decontaminated Lyad said puzzledly Don t try to walk in here Professor Trigger warned as he lumbered forward We might have to de electrocute you The Commissioner will scrape off a sample and hand it out This stuff if it s what you think it might be is poisonous Quite harmless to life my dear said the professor bending over the patch of greenish gray scum the Commissioner had reached out to him But ruinous in delicate instruments That s why we re so careful Holati Tate glanced at Trigger Better look in the black box Trig he said She nodded and wormed herself farther into the innards of the transmitters A minute later she announced Full of it And that s the one part we can t repair or replace of course Is it your beast Professor It seems to be Mantelish said unhappily But we have at least a solvent which will remove it from the equipment Trigger came sliding out from under the transmitters the detached black box under one arm Better use it then before the stuff gets to the rest of the ship It won t help the black box She shook it It tinkled Shot she said There went another quarter million of your credits Commissioner Mantelish and Lyad headed for the lock to get the solvent Trigger slipped off her work gloves and turned to follow them Might be a while before I m back she said The Commissioner started to say something then nodded and climbed back into the transmitters After a few minutes Mantelish came puffing in with sprayers and cans of solvent It s at least fortunate you tried to put out a call just now he said It might have done incalculable damage Doubt it said Holati A few more instruments might have gone Like the communicators The main equipment is fungus proof How do you attach this thing Mantelish showed him The Commissioner thanked him He directed a fine spray of the solvent into the black box and watched the fungus melt Happen to notice where Trigger and Lyad went he asked Eh said Mantelish He reflected I saw them walking down toward camp talking together as I came in he called Should I go get them Don t bother Holati said They ll be back They came walking back into the ship around half an hour later Both faces looked rather white and strained Lyad has something she wants to tell you Holati Trigger said Where s Mantelish In his lab Taking a nap I believe That s good We don t want him here for this Go ahead Lyad Just the important stuff You can give us the details after we ve left Three hours later the ship was well away from Luscious traveling subspace traveling fast Trigger walked up into the control section Mantelish is still asleep she said They d fed the professor a doped drink to get him aboard without detailed explanation and argument about how much of the lab should be loaded on the ship first Shall I get Lyad out of her cabin for the rest of the story or wait till he wakes up Better wait said the Commissioner He ll come out of it in about an hour and he might as well hear it with us Looks like navigating s going to be a little rough for a spell anyway Trigger nodded and sat down in the control next to his After a while he glanced over at her How did you get her to talk he asked We went back into the woods a bit I tied her over a stump and broke two sticks across the first seat of Tranest Got the idea from Mihul sort of Trigger added vaguely When I picked up a third stick Lyad got awfully anxious to keep things at just a fast conversational level We kept it there Hm said the Commissioner You don t feel she did any lying this time I doubt it I tapped her one now and then just to make sure she didn t slow down enough to do much thinking Besides I d got the whole business down on a pocket recorder and Lyad knew it If she makes one more goof till this deal is over the recording gets released to the Hub s news viewer outfits yowls and all She d sooner lose Tranest than risk having that happen She ll be good Yeah probably he said thoughtfully About that substation would you feel more comfortable if we went after the bunch round the Devagas dome first and got us an escort for the trip Sure Trigger said But that would just about kill any chances of doing anything personally wouldn t it I m afraid so Scout Intelligence will go along pretty far with me But they couldn t go that far We might be able to contact Quillan individually though He s a topnotch man in a fighter It doesn t seem to me Trigger said that we ought to run any risk of being spotted till we know exactly what this thing is like Well said the Commissioner I m with you there We shouldn t What about Mantelish and Lyad You can t let them know either The Commissioner motioned with his head The rest cubicle back of the cabins If we see a chance to do anything we ll pop them both into Rest I can dream up something to make that look plausible afterwards I think Trigger was silent a moment Lyad had told them she d dispatched the Aurora to stand guard over a subspace station where the missing king plasmoid presently was housed until both she and the combat squadron from Tranest could arrive there The exact location of that station had been the most valuable of the bits of information she had extracted so painstakingly from Balmordan The coordinates were centered on the Commissioner s course screen at the moment How about that Tranest squadron Trigger asked Think Lyad might have risked a lie and they could get out here in time to interfere No said the Commissioner She had to have some idea of where to send them before starting them out of the Hub They ll be doing fine if they make it to the substation in another two weeks Now the Aurora if they started for Luscious right after Lyad called them last night at best they can t get there any sooner than we can get to the substation I figure that at four days If they turn right around then and start back Trigger laughed You can bet on that she said The Commissioner had used his ship s guns to brand the substation s coordinates in twenty mile figures into a mountain plateau above Plasmoid Creek They d left much more detailed information in camp but there was a chance it would be overlooked in too hurried a search Then they ll show up at the substation again four or five days behind us the Commissioner said So they re no problem But our own outfit s fastest ships can cut across from the Devagas dome in less than three days after their search party messages from Luscious to tell them why we ve stopped transmitting and where we ve gone Or the Psychology ship might get to Luscious before the search party does and start transmitting about the coordinates In any case said Trigger it s our own boys who are likely to be the problem Yes I d say we should have two days give or take a few hours after we get to the station to see if we can do anything useful and get it done Of course somebody might come wandering into Luscious right now and start wondering about those coordinate figures or drop in at our camp and discover we re gone But that s not very likely after all Couldn t be helped anyway Trigger said No If we knock ourselves out on this job somebody besides Lyad s Tranest squadron and the Devagas has to know just where the station is He shook his head That Lyad I figured she d know how to run the transmitters so I gave her the chance But I never imagined she d be a good enough engineer to get inside them and mess them up without killing herself Lyad has her points Trigger said Too bad she grew up a rat You had a playback attachment stuck in there then Naturally Full of the fungus I suppose Full of it said the Commissioner Well Lyad still lost on that maneuver Much less comfortably than she might have too I think she d agree with you there Trigger said Lyad s first assignment after Professor Mantelish came out of the dope was to snap him back into trance and explain to him how he had once more been put under hypno control and used for her felonious ends by the First Lady of Tranest They let him work off his rage while he was still under partial control Then the Ermetyne woke him up He stared at her coldly You are a deceitful woman Lyad Ermetyne he declared I don t wish to see you about my labs again At any time Under any pretext Is that understood Yes Professor Lyad said And I m sorry that I believed it necessary to Mantelish snorted Sorry Necessary Just to be certain it doesn t happen again I shall make up a batch of antihypno pills If I can remember the prescription I happen the Ermetyne ventured to know a very good prescription for the purpose Professor If you will permit me Mantelish stood up I ll accept no prescriptions from you he said icily He looked at Trigger as he turned to walk out of the cabin Or drinks from you either Trigger Argee he growled Who in the great spiraling galaxy is there left to trust Sorry Professor Trigger said meekly In half an hour or so he calmed down enough to join the others in the lounge to get the final story on Gess Fayle and the missing king plasmoid from the Ermetyne Doctor Gess Fayle Lyad reported had died very shortly after leaving the Manon System And with him had died every man on board the U League s transport ship It might be simplest she went on to relate the first series of events from the plasmoid s point of view Point of view Professor Mantelish interrupted The plasmoid has awareness then Oh yes That one does Self awareness Definitely Oho But then Professor Trigger interrupted politely in turn may I get you a drink He glared at her growled then grinned I ll shut up he said Lyad went on Doctor Fayle had resumed experimentation with the one hundred twelve one hundred thirteen unit almost as soon as he was alone with it and one of the first things he did was to detach the small one hundred thirteen section from the main one The point Doctor Fayle hadn t adequately considered when he took this step was that one hundred thirteen s function appeared to be that of a restraining limiting or counteracting device on its vastly larger partner The Old Galactics obviously had been aware of dangerous potentialities in their more advanced creations and had used this means of regulating them That the method was reliable was indicated by the fact that in the thirty thousand years since the Old Galactics had vanished plasmoid one hundred twelve had remained restricted to the operations required for the maintenance of Harvest Moon But it hadn t liked being restricted And it had been very much aware of the possibilities offered by the new life forms which lately had intruded on Harvest Moon The instant it found itself free it attempted to take control of the human minds in its environment Mind level control Mantelish exclaimed looking startled Not unheard of of course And we d been considering But of human minds Lyad nodded It can contact human minds she said though perhaps rather fortunately it can project that particular field effect only within a quite limited radius A little less the Devagas found later than five miles Mantelish shook his head frowning He turned toward the Commissioner Holati he said emphatically I believe that thing could be dangerous For a moment they all looked at him Then the Commissioner cleared his throat It s a possibility Mantelish he admitted We will give it thought later What Trigger asked Lyad killed the people on the ship The attempt to control them Lyad said Doctor Fayle apparently had died as he was leaving the laboratory with the one hundred thirteen unit The other men died wherever they were The ship running subspace and pilotless plowed headlong into the next gravitic twister and broke up A Devagas ship s detectors picked up the wreckage three days later Balmordan was on board the Devagas ship and in charge The Devagas at that time were at least as plasmoid hungry as anybody else and knew they were not likely to see their hunger gratified for several decades The wreck of a U League ship in the Manon area decidedly was worth investigating If the big plasmoid hadn t been capable of learning from its mistakes the Devagas investigating party also would have died Since it could and did learn they lived The searchers discovered human remains and the crushed remnants of the one hundred thirteen unit in a collapsed section of the ship Then they discovered the big plasmoid alive in subspace undamaged and very conscious of the difficulties it now faced It had already initiated its first attempt to solve the difficulties It was incapable of outward motion and could not change its own structure but it was no longer alone It had constructed a small work plasmoid with visual and manipulating organs as indifferent to exposure to subspace as its designer When the boarding party encountered the twain the working plasmoid apparently was attempting to perform some operation on the frozen and shriveled brain of one of the human cadavers Balmordan was a scientist of no mean stature among the Devagas He did not understand immediately what he saw but he realized the probable importance of understanding it He had the plasmoids and their lifeless human research object transferred to the Devagas ship and settled down to observe what they did Released the working plasmoid went back immediately to its task It completed it Then Balmordan and presumably the plasmoids waited Nothing happened Finally Balmordan investigated the dead brain Installed in it he found what appeared to be near microscopic energy receivers of plasmoid material There was nothing to indicate what type of energy they were to or could receive Devagas scientists when they happened to be of the hierarchy always had enjoyed one great advantage over most of their colleagues in the Federation They had no difficulty in obtaining human volunteers to act as subjects for experimental work Balmordan appointed three of his least valuable crew members as volunteers for the plasmoid s experiments The first of the three died almost immediately The plasmoid it turned out lacked understanding of among other things the use and need of anesthetics Balmordan accordingly assisted obligingly in the second operation He was delighted when it became apparent that his assistance was being willingly and comprehendingly accepted This subject did not die immediately But he did not regain consciousness after the plasmoid devices had been installed and some hours later he did die in convulsions Number Three was more fortunate He regained consciousness He complained of headaches and after he had slept of nightmares The next day he went into shock for a period of several hours When he came out of it he reported tremblingly that the big plasmoid was talking to him though he could not understand what it said There were two more test operations both successful In all three cases the headaches and nightmares stopped in about a week The first subject in the series was beginning to understand the plasmoid Balmordan listened to his reports He had his three surviving volunteers given very extensive physical and psychological tests They seemed to be in fine condition Balmordan now had the operation performed on himself When he woke up he disposed of his three predecessors Then he devoted his full attention to learning what the plasmoid was trying to say In about three weeks it became clear The plasmoid had established contact with human beings because it needed their help It needed a base like Harvest Moon from which to operate and on which to provide for its requirements It did not have the understanding to permit it to construct such a base So it made the Devagas a proposition It would work for them somewhat as it had worked for the Old Galactics if unlike the Old Galactics they would work for it Balmordan newly become a person of foremost importance transmitted the offer to the hierarchy in the Hub With no hesitation it was accepted but Balmordan was warned not to bring his monster into the Hub area If it was discovered on a Devagas world the hierarchy would be faced with the choice between another war with the Federation and submission to more severely restrictive Federation controls It didn t care for either alternative it had lost three wars with the Federated worlds in the past and each time had been reduced in strength They contacted Vishni s Independent Fleet Vishni s area was not too far from Balmordan s ship position and the Devagas had had previous dealings with him and his men This time they hired the I Fleet to become the plasmoid s temporary caretaker Within a few weeks it was parked on Luscious where it devoted itself to the minor creative experimentation which presently was to puzzle Professor Mantelish The Devagas meanwhile toiled prodigiously to complete the constructions which were to be a central feature in the new alliance On a base very far removed from the Hub on a base securely anchored and concealed among the gravitic swirlings and shiftings of a subspace turbulence area virtually indetectable the monster could make a very valuable partner If it was discovered the partnership could be disowned So could the fact that they had constructed the substation for it in itself a grave breach of Federation treaties They built the substation They built the armed subterranean observer s dome three days travel away from it The plasmoid was installed in its new quarters It then requested the use of the Vishni Fleet people for further experimentation The hierarchy was glad to grant the request It would have had to get rid of those too well informed hirelings in any case Having received its experimental material the plasmoid requested the Devagas to stay away from the substation for a while twenty seven The Devagas said Lyad while not too happy with their ally s increasingly independent attitude were more anxious than ever to see the alliance progress to the working stage As an indication of its potential usefulness the monster had provided them with a variety of working plasmoid robots built to their own specifications What kind of specifications Trigger inquired Lyad hadn t learned in detail but some of the robots appeared to have demonstrated rather alarming possibilities Those possibilities however were precisely what intrigued the hierarchy most Mantelish smacked his lips thoughtfully and shook his head Not good he said Not at all good I m beginning to think He paused a moment Go on Lyad The hierarchy was now giving renewed consideration to a curious request the plasmoid had made almost as soon as Balmordan became capable of understanding it The request had been to find and destroy plasmoid one hundred thirteen A The Ermetyne s amber eyes switched to Trigger Shall I she asked Trigger nodded And a specific human being The Devagas already had established that this human being must be Trigger Argee What Mantelish s thick white eyebrows shot up one hundred thirteen A we can understand it is afraid of being in some way brought back under control But why Trigger Because Lyad said carefully one hundred twelve was aware that one hundred thirteen A intended to condition Trigger into being its interpreter Professor Mantelish s jaw dropped He swung his head toward Trigger Is that true She nodded It s true all right We ve been working on it but we haven t got too far along Tell you later Go ahead Lyad The Devagas naturally hadn t acted on the king plasmoid s naive suggestion Whatever it feared was more than likely to be very useful to them Instead they made preparations to bring both one hundred thirteen A and Trigger Argee into their possession They would then have a new strong bargaining point in their dealings with their dubious partner But they discovered promptly that neither Trigger nor one hundred thirteen A were at all easy to come by Balmordan now suggested a modification of tactics The hierarchy had seen to it that a number of interpreters were available for one hundred twelve Balmordan in consequence had lost much of his early importance and was anxious to regain it His proposal was that all efforts should be directed at obtaining one hundred thirteen A Once it was obtained he himself would volunteer to become its first interpreter Trigger Argee because of the information she might reveal to others should be destroyed a far simpler operation than attempting to take her alive This was agreed to and Balmordan was authorized to carry out both operations Mantelish had begun shaking his head again No he said suddenly and loudly He looked at Lyad then at Trigger Trigger he said Yes said Trigger Take that deceitful woman to her cabin Mantelish ordered Lock her up I have something to say to the Commissioner Trigger arose All right she said Come on Lyad The two of them left the lounge Mantelish stood up and went over to the Commissioner He grasped the Commissioner s jacket lapels Holati old friend he began emotionally What is it old friend the Commissioner inquired What I have to say Mantelish rumbled will shock you Profoundly No exclaimed the Commissioner Yes said Mantelish That plasmoid one hundred twelve it has of course an almost inestimable potential value to civilization Of course the Commissioner agreed But it also said Mantelish represents a quite intolerable threat to civilization Mantelish cried the Commissioner It does You don t comprehend these matters as I do Holati that plasmoid must be destroyed Secretly if possible And by us Mantelish gasped the Commissioner You can t be serious I am Well said Commissioner Tate sit down I m open to suggestions Space armor drill hadn t been featured much in the Colonial School s crowded curriculum But the Commissioner broke out one of the ship s two heavy duty suits and when Trigger wasn t at the controls eating sleeping or taking care of the ship s housekeeping with Lyad and Mantelish she drilled She wasn t at the controls too often When she was they had to surface and proceed in normal space But Lyad not too surprisingly turned out to be a qualified subspace pilot Even less surprisingly she already had made a careful study of the ship s controls After a few hours of instruction she went on shift with the Commissioner along the less rugged stretches In this area none of the stretches were smooth When not on duty Lyad lay on her bunk and brooded Mantelish tried to be useful Repulsive might have been brooding too He didn t make himself noticeable Time passed The stretches got rougher The last ten hours the Commissioner didn t stir out of the control seat Lyad had been locked in her cabin again as the critical period approached In normal space the substation should have been in clear detector range by now Here the detectors gave occasional blurry uncertain indications that somewhere in the swirling energies about them might be something more solidly material It was like creeping through jungle thickets towards the point where a dangerous quarry lurked They eased down on the coordinate points They came sliding out between two monstrous twisters The detectors leaped to life Ship said the Commissioner He swore Frigate class he said an instant later He turned his head toward Trigger Get Lyad They re in communication range We ll let her communicate Trigger heart hammering ran to get Lyad The Commissioner had the short range communicator on when they came hurrying back to the control room together That the Aurora he asked Lyad glanced at the outline in the detectors It is Her face went white Talk to em he ordered Know their call number Of course Lyad sat down at the communicator Her hands shook for a moment then steadied What am I to say Just find out what s happened to start with Why they re still here Then we ll improvise Get them to come to the screen if you can Lyad s fingers flew over the tabs The communicator signaled contact Lyad said evenly Come in Aurora This is the Ermetyne There was a pause a rather unaccountably long pause Trigger thought Then a voice said Yes First Lady Lyad s eyes widened for an instant Come in on visual Captain There was the snap of command in the words Again a pause Then suddenly the communicator was looking into the Aurora s control room A brown bearded rather lumpy faced man in uniform sat before the other screen There were other uniformed men behind him Trigger heard the Ermetyne s breath suck in and turned to watch Lyad s face Why haven t you carried out your instructions Captain The voice was still even There was a difficulty with the engines First Lady Lyad nodded Very well Stand by for new instructions She switched off the communicator She twisted around toward the Commissioner Get us out of here she said chalk faced Fast Those aren t my men Flame bellowed about them in subspace The Commissioner s hand slapped a button The flame vanished and stars shone all around The engines hurled them forward Twelve seconds later they angled and dived again Subspace reappeared Guess you were right the Commissioner said He idled the engines and scratched his chin But what were they Everything about it was wrong Lyad was saying presently her face still white Their faces in particular were deformed She looked at Trigger You saw it Trigger nodded She suspected she was on the white faced side herself The captain she said I didn t look at the others It looked as if his cheeks and forehead were pushed out of shape There was a short silence Well said the Commissioner seems like that plasmoid has been doing some more experimenting Question is how did it get to them They didn t find any answers to that Lyad insisted the Aurora had been given specific orders to avoid the immediate vicinity of the substation Its only purpose there was to observe and report on anything that seemed to be going on in the area She couldn t imagine her crew disobeying the orders That mind level control business Trigger said finally Maybe it found a way of going out to them She could see by their faces that the idea had occurred and that they didn t like it Well neither did she They pitched a few more ideas around None of them seemed helpful Unless we just want to hightail it the Commissioner said finally about the only thing we can do is go back and slug it out with the frigate first We can t risk snooping around the station while she s there and likely to start pounding on our backs any second Mantelish looked startled Holati he cautioned That s a warship Mantelish the Commissioner said a trifle coldly what you ve been riding in isn t a canoe He glanced at Lyad I suppose you d feel happier if you weren t locked up in your cabin during the ruckus Lyad gave him a strained smile Commissioner she said You re so right Then keep your seat he said We ll start prowling They prowled It took an hour to recontact the Aurora presumably because the Aurora was also prowling for them Suddenly the detectors came alive The ship s guns went off at once Then subspace went careening crazily past in the screens Trigger looked at the screens for a few seconds gulped and started studying the floor Whatever the plasmoid had done to the frigate s crew they appeared to have lost none of their ability to give battle It was a very brisk affair But neither had the onetime Squadron Commander Tate lost much of his talent along those lines The frigate had many more guns but no better range And he had the faster ship Four minutes after the first shots were exchanged the Aurora blew up The ripped hunk of the Aurora s hull which the Commissioner presently brought into the lock appeared to have had three approximately quarter inch holes driven at a slant through it which subsequently had been plugged again The plugging material was plasmoid in character There were two holes in another piece the Commissioner said very thoughtfully If that s the average she was punched in a few thousand spots Let s go have a better look He and Mantelish maneuvered the gravity crane carrying the holed slab of steel alloy into the ship s workshop Lyad was locked back into her cabin and Trigger went on guard in the control room and looked out wistfully at the stars of normal space Half an hour later the two men came up the passage and joined her They appeared preoccupied It s an unpleasant picture Trigger girl the Commissioner said Those holes look sort of chewed through Whatever did the chewing was also apparently capable of sealing up the portion behind it as it went along What it did to the men when it got inside we don t know Mantelish feels we might compare it roughly to the effects of ordinary germ invasion It doesn t really matter It fixed them Mighty large germs Trigger said Why didn t their meteor reflectors stop them If the ship was hove to and these things just drifted in gradually Oh I see That wouldn t activate the reflectors Then if we keep moving ourselves That said the Commissioner was what I had in mind twenty eight Trigger couldn t keep from staring at the subspace station It was unbelievable One could still tell that the human construction gangs had put up a standard type of armored station down there A very big very massive one but normally shaped nearly spherical One could tell it only by the fact that at the gun pits the original material still showed through Everywhere else it had vanished under great black masses of material which the plasmoids had added to the station s structure All over that black lumpy lavalike surface the plasmoids crawled walked soared and wriggled There were thousands of them perhaps hundreds of different types It looked like a wet black rotten stump swarming with life inside and out Neither she nor the two men had made much mention of its appearance All you could say was that it was horrible The plasmoids they could see ignored the ship They also gave no noticeable attention to the eight space flares the Commissioner had set in a rough cube about the station But for the first two hours after their arrival the ship s meteor reflectors remained active An occasional tap at first then an almost continuous pecking finally a twenty minute drumfire that filled the reflector screens with madly dancing clouds of tiny sparks Suddenly it ended Either the king plasmoid had exhausted its supply of that particular weapon or it preferred to conserve what it had left Might test their guns the Commissioner muttered He looked very unhappy Trigger thought He circled off put on speed came back and flicked the ship past the station s flank He drew bursts from two pits with a promptness which confirmed what already had been almost a certainty that the gun installations operated automatically They seemed remarkably feeble weapons for a station of that size The Devagas apparently had had sense enough not to give the plasmoid every advantage The Commissioner plunked a test shot next into one of the black protuberances A small fiery crater appeared It darkened quickly again Out of the biggest opening down near what would have been the foot of the stump if it had been a stump something long red and wormlike wriggled rapidly It flowed up over the structure s surface to the damaged point and thrust the tip of its front end into the crater Black material began to flow from the tip The plasmoid moved its front end back and forth across the damaged area Others of the same kind came out and joined it The crater began to fill out They hauled away a little and surfaced Normal space looked clean beautiful homelike calmly shining None of them except Lyad had slept for over twenty hours What do you think the Commissioner asked They discussed what they had seen in subdued voices Nobody had a plan They agreed that one thing they could be sure of was that the Vishni Fleet people and any other human beings who might have been on the station when it was turned over to the king plasmoid were no longer alive Unless of course something had been done to them much more drastic than had happened to the Aurora s crew The ship had passed by the biggest opening like a low wide black mouth close enough to make out that it extended far back into the original station s interior The station was open and airless as Harvest Moon had been before the humans got there Some of those things down there the Commissioner said had attachments that would crack any suit wide open A lot of them are big and a lot of them are fast Once we were inside we d have no maneuverability to speak of If the termites didn t get to us before we got inside Suits won t do it here He was a gambler and a gambler doesn t buck impossible odds What could you do with the guns Trigger asked Not too much They re not meant to take down a fortress Scratching around on the surface with them would just mark the thing up We can widen that opening by quite a bit and once it s widened I can flip in the bomb But it would be just blind luck if we nailed the one we re after that way With a dozen bombs we could break up the station But we don t have them They nodded thoughtfully The worst part of that he went on is that it would be completely obvious The Council s right when it worries about fumbles here Tranest and the Devagas know the thing is in there If the Federation can t produce it both those outfits have the Council over a barrel Or we could be setting the Hub up for fifty years of fighting among the member worlds sometime in the next few hours Mantelish and Trigger nodded again More thoughtfully Nevertheless Mantelish began suddenly He checked himself Well you re right the Commissioner said That stuff down there just can t be turned loose that s all The thing s still only experimenting We don t know what it s going to wind up with So I guess we ll be trying the guns and the bomb finally and then see what else we can do Now look we ve got what is it nine or ten hours left The first of the boys are pretty sure to come helling in around then Or maybe something s happened we don t know about and they ll be here in thirty minutes We can t tell But I m in favor of knocking off now and just grabbing a couple of hours sleep Then we ll get our brains together again Maybe by then somebody has come up with something like an idea What do you say Where Mantelish said is the ship going to be while we re sleeping Subspace said the Commissioner He saw their expressions Don t worry I ll put her on a wide orbit and I ll stick out every alarm on board I ll also sleep in the control chair But in case somebody gets here early we ve got to be around to tell them about that space termite trick Trigger hadn t expected she would be able to sleep not where they were But afterwards she couldn t even remember getting stretched out all the way on the bunk She woke up less than an hour later feeling very uncomfortable Repulsive had been talking to her She sat up and looked around the dark cabin with frightened eyes After a moment she got out of the bunk and went up the passage toward the lounge and the control section Holati Tate was lying slumped back in his chair eyes closed breathing slowly and evenly Trigger put out a hand to touch his shoulder and then drew it back She glanced up for a moment at the plasmoid station in the screen seeming to turn slowly as they went orbiting by it She noticed that one of the space flares they d planted there had gone out or else it had been plucked away by a passing twister s touch She looked away quickly again turned and went restlessly back through the lounge and up the passage toward the cabins She went by the two suits of space armor at the lock without looking at them She opened the door to Mantelish s cabin and looked inside The professor lay sprawled across the bunk in his clothes breathing slowly and regularly Trigger closed his door again Lyad might be wakeful she thought She crossed the passage and unlocked the door to the Ermetyne s cabin The lights in the cabin were on but Lyad also lay there placidly asleep her face relaxed and young looking Trigger put her fist to her mouth and bit down hard on her knuckles for a moment She frowned intensely at nothing Then she closed and locked the cabin door went back up the passage and into the control room She sat down before the communicator glanced up once more at the plasmoid station in the screen got up restlessly and went over to the Commissioner s chair She stood there looking down at him The Commissioner slept on Then Repulsive said it again No Trigger whispered fiercely I won t I can t You can t make me do it There was a stillness then In the stillness it was made very clear that nobody intended to make her do anything And then the stillness just waited She cried a little So this was it All right she said The armor suit s triple light beam blazed into the wide low black wet looking mouth rushing toward her It was much bigger than she had thought when looking at it from the ship Far behind her the fire needles of the single gun pit which her passage to the station had aroused still slashed mindlessly about They weren t geared to stop suits and they hadn t come anywhere near her But the plasmoids looked geared to stop suits They were swarming in clusters in the black mouth like maggots in a rotting skull Part of the swarms had spilled out over the lips of the mouth clinging crawling rippling swiftly about Trigger shifted the flight controls with the fingers of one hand dropping a little then straightening again She might be coming in too fast But she had to get past that mass at the opening Then the black mouth suddenly yawned wide before her Her left hand pressed the gun handle Twin blasts stabbed ahead blinding white struck the churning masses blazed over them They burned scattered exploded and rolled back burning and exploding in a double wave to meet her Too fast Repulsive said anxiously Much too fast She knew it But she couldn t have forced herself to do it slowly The armor suit slammed at a slant into a piled writhing burning hardness of plasmoid bodies bounced upward She went over and over yanking down all the way on the flight controls She closed her eyes for a moment When she opened them again the suit hung poised a little above black uneven flooring turned back half toward the entrance mouth A black ceiling was less than twenty feet above her head The plasmoids were there The suit s light beams played over the massed moving ranks squat bodies and sinuous ones immensities that scraped the ceiling stalked limbs and gaping nutcracker jaws blurs of motion her eyes couldn t step down to define into shapes Some still blazed with her guns white fire The closest were thirty feet away They stayed there They didn t come any closer She swung the suit slowly away from the entrance The ring was closed all about her But it wasn t tightening Repulsive had thought he could do it She asked in her mind Which way She got a feeling of direction turned the suit a little more and started it gliding forward The ranks ahead didn t give way but they went down Those that could go down Some weren t built for it The suit bumped up gently against one huge bulk and a six inch pale blue eye looked at her for a moment as she went circling around it Eyes for what somebody in the back of her mind wondered briefly She glanced into the suit s rear view screen and saw that the ones who had gone down were getting up again mixed with the ones who came crowding after her Thirty feet away Repulsive was doing it So far there weren t any guns If they hit guns that would be her job and the suit s The king plasmoid should be regretting by now that it had wasted its experimental human material Though it mightn t have been really wasted it might be incorporated in the stuff that came crowding after her and kept going down ahead Black ceiling black floor seemed to stretch on endlessly She kept the suit moving slowly along At last the beams picked up low walls ahead converging at the point toward which the suit was gliding At the point of convergence there seemed to be a narrow passage Plasmoid bodies were wedged into it The suit pulled them out one by one its steel grippers clamping down upon things no softer than itself But it had power to work with and they didn t at the moment Behind the ones it pulled out there were presently glimpses of the swiftly weaving motion of giant red worm shapes sealing up the passage After a while they stopped weaving each time the suit returned and started again as it withdrew dragging out another plasmoid body Then the suit went gliding over a stilled tangle of red worm bodies And there was the sealed end of the passage The stuff was still soft The guns blazed bit into it ate it away their brilliance washing back over the suit The sealing gave way before the suit did They went through and came out into She didn t know what they had come out into It was like a fog of darkness growing thicker as they went sliding forward The light beams seemed to be dimming Then they quietly went out as if they d switched themselves off In blackness she fingered the light controls and knew they weren t switched off Repulsive she cried in her mind Repulsive couldn t help with the blackness She got the feeling of direction The blackness seemed to be soaking behind her eyes She held the speed throttle steady in fingers slippery with sweat and that was the only way she could tell they were still moving forward After a while they bumped gently against something that had to be a wall it was so big though at first she wasn t sure it was a wall They moved along it for a time then came to the end of it and were moving in the right direction again They seemed to be in a passage now a rather narrow one They touched walls and ceiling from time to time She thought they were moving downward There was a picture in front of her She realized suddenly that she had been watching it for some time But it wasn t until this moment that she became really aware of it The beast was big strong and angry It bellowed and screamed shaking and covered with foam She couldn t see it too clearly but she had the impression of mad staring eyes and a terrible lust to crush and destroy But something was holding it Something held it quietly and firmly for all its plunging It reared once more now a gross lumbering hugeness and came crashing down to its knees Then it went over on its side The suit s beams flashed on Trigger squeezed her eyes tight shut blinded by the light that flashed back from black walls all around Then her fingers remembered the right drill and dimmed the lights She opened her eyes again and stared for a long moment at the great gray mummy shape before one of the black walls Repulsive she asked in her mind Repulsive didn t answer The suit hung quietly in the huge black chamber She didn t remember having stopped it She turned it now slowly There were eight or nine passages leading out of here through walls ceiling floor Repulsive she cried plaintively Silence She glanced once more at the king plasmoid against the wall It stayed silent too And it was as if the two silences cancelled each other out She remembered the last feeling of moving downward and lifted the suit toward a passage that came in through the ceiling She hung before it considering Far up and back in its darkness a bright light suddenly blazed vanished and blazed again Something was coming down the passage fast Her hand started for the gun handle Then it remembered another drill and flashed to the suit s communicator A voice crashed in around her Trigger Trigger Trigger it sobbed Ape she screamed You aren t hurt twenty nine Mantelish s garden in the highland south of Ceyce had a certain renown all over the Hub It had been donated to the professor twenty five years ago by the populace of another Federation world That populace had negligently permitted a hideous pestilence of some kind to be imported and had been saved in the nick of time by the appropriate pestilence killer hastily developed and forwarded to it by Mantelish In return a lifetime ambition had been fulfilled for him his own private botanical garden plus an unlimited fund for stocking and upkeep To one side of the big garden house where Mantelish stayed whenever he found the time to go puttering around among his specimens stood a giant sequoia generally reputed to be the oldest living thing in the Hub outside of the Life Banks It was certainly extremely old even for a sequoia For the last decade there had been considerable talk about the advisability of removing it before it collapsed and crushed the house and everyone in it But it was one of the professor s great favorites and so far he had vetoed the suggestion Elbows propped on the broad white balustrade of the porch before her third story bedroom Trigger was studying the sequoia s crown with a pair of field glasses when Pilch arrived She laid the glasses down and invited her guest to pull up a chair and help her admire the view They admired the view for a little in silence It certainly is a beautiful place Pilch said then She glanced down at Professor Mantelish a couple of hundred yards from the house dressed in a pair of tanned shorts and busily grubbing away with a spade around some new sort of shrub he d just planted and smiled I took the first opportunity I ve had to come see you she said Trigger looked at her and laughed I thought you might You weren t satisfied with the reports then Pilch said Of course not But it was obvious the emergency was over so I was whisked away to something else She frowned slightly Sometimes she admitted the Service keeps me the least bit busier than I d prefer to be So now it s been six months I would have come in for another interview if you d called me Trigger said I know said Pilch But that would have made it official I can keep this visit off the record Her eyes met Trigger s for a moment And I have a feeling I will Also of course I m not pushing for any answers you mightn t care to give Just push away Trigger said agreeably Well we got the Commissioner s call from his ship A worried man he was So it seems now that we ve had one of the Old Galactics around for a while When did you first find out about it On the morning after our interview Right after I got up How Trigger laughed I watch my weight When I noticed I d turned three and a half pounds heavier overnight than I d averaged the past four years I knew all right Pilch smiled faintly You weren t alarmed at all No I guess I d been prepared just enough by that time But then you know I forgot all about it again until Lyad and Flam opened that purse and he wasn t inside Then I remembered and after that I didn t forget again No Of course Pilch s slim fingers tapped the surface of the table between them She said then paying Repulsive the highest compliment Pilch could give It he was a good therapist After a moment she added I had a talk with Commissioner Tate an hour or so ago He s preparing to leave Maccadon again I understand That s right He s been organizing that big exploration trip of Mantelish s the past couple of months He ll be in charge of it when they take off You re not going along Pilch asked Trigger shook her head Not this time Ape and I Captain Quillan and I that is I heard Pilch said She smiled You picked a good one on the second try Quillan s all right Trigger agreed If you watch him a little Anyway said Pilch Commissioner Tate seems to be just the least bit worried about you still Trigger put a finger to her temple and made a small circling motion A bit ta ta Not exactly that perhaps But it seems said Pilch that you ve told him a good deal about the history of the Old Galactics including what ended them as a race thirty two thousand years ago Trigger s face clouded a little Yes she said She sat silent for a moment Well I got that from Repulsive somewhere along the line she said then It didn t really come clear until some time after we d got back But it was there in those pictures in the interview The giants stamping on the farm Trigger nodded And the fast clock and the slow one He was trying to tell it then The Jesters that s the giants they re fast and tough like us Apparently Trigger said thoughtfully they re a good deal like us in a lot of ways But worse Much worse And the Old Galactics were just slow They thought slow they moved slow they did almost everything slow At full gallop old Repulsive couldn t have kept up with a healthy snail Besides they just liked to grow things and tinker with things and so on They didn t go in for fighting and they never got to be at all good at it So they just got wiped out practically The Jesters were good at fighting eh Trigger nodded Very good Like us again Where did they come from Repulsive thought they were outsiders He wasn t sure He and that other O G were on the sidelines running their protein collecting station when the Jesters arrived and it was all over and they were gone before he had learned much about it From outside the galaxy Pilch said thoughtfully She cleared her throat What s this business about they might be back again Well Trigger said he thought they might be Just might Actually he believed the Jesters got wiped out too Eh Pilch said How s that Quite a lot of the Old Galactics went along with them like Repulsive went along with me And one of the things they did know Trigger said was how to spread diseases like nobody s business About like we use weed killers Wholesale They could clean out the average planet of any particular thing they didn t want there in about a week So it s not really too likely the Jesters will be back Oh said Pilch But if they are coming Repulsive thought they d be due in this area in about another eight centuries That looked like a very short time to him of course He thought it would be best to pass on a warning You know Pilch said after a brief pause I find myself agreeing with him there Trigger I might turn in a short report on this after all I think you should really Trigger said She smiled suddenly Of course it might wind up with people thinking both of us are ta ta I ll risk that said Pilch It s been thought of me before If they did come Trigger said I guess we d take them anyway We ve taken everything else like that that came long And besides Her voice trailed off thoughtfully She studied the table top for a moment Then she looked up at Pilch Well she said smiling any other questions A few said Pilch passing up the and besides She considered Did you ever actually see him make contact with you No Trigger said I was always asleep and I suppose he made sure I d stay asleep They re built sort of like a leech you know I guess he knew I wouldn t feel comfortable about having something like that go oozing into the side of my neck or start oozing out again Anyway he never did let me see it Considerate little fellow said Pilch She sighed Well everything came out very satisfactorily much more so than anyone could have dared hope at one time All that s left is a very intriguing mystery which the Hub will be chatting about for years What happened aboard Doctor Fayle s vanished ship that caused the king plasmoid to awaken to awful life she cried What equally mysterious event brought about its death on that strangely hideous structure it had built in subspace What was it planning to do there Etcetera She smiled at Trigger Yes very good I saw they camouflaged out what was still visible of the original substation before they let in the news viewers Trigger remarked Bright idea somebody had there Yes It was I And the Devagas hierarchy is broken and the Ermetynes run out of Tranest Two very bad spots those were I don t recall having heard what they did to your friend Pluly I heard Trigger said He just got black listed by Grand Commerce finally and lost all his shipping concessions However his daughter is married to an up and coming young businessman who happened to be on hand and have the money and other qualifications to pick up those concessions She laughed It s the Inger Lines now They re smart characters in a way Yes said Pilch In a way Did you know Lyad Ermetyne put in for voluntary rehabilitation with us and then changed her mind and joined the Service I d heard of it Trigger hesitated Did you know Lyad paid me a short visit about an hour before you got here this morning I thought she would Pilch said We came in to Maccadon together Trigger had been a little startled when she answered the doorchime and saw Lyad standing there She invited the Ermetyne in I thought I d thank you personally Lyad said casually for a recording which was delivered to me some months ago That s quite all right Trigger said also casually I was sure I wasn t going to have any use for it Lyad studied her face for a moment To be honest about it Trigger Argee she said I still don t feel entirely cordial toward you However I did appreciate the gesture of letting me have the recording So I decided to drop by to tell you there isn t really too much left in the way of hard feelings on my part They shook hands restrainedly and the Ermetyne sauntered out again The other reason she came here Pilch said is to take care of the financing of Mantelish s expedition I didn t know that Trigger said surprised It s her way of making amends Her legitimate Hub holdings are still enormous of course She can afford it Well Trigger said that s one thing about Lyad she s wholehearted She s that said Pilch Rarely have I seen anyone rip into total therapy with the verve displayed by the Ermetyne She mentioned on one occasion that there simply had to be some way of getting ahead of you again Oh said Trigger Yes said Pilch By the way what are your own plans nowadays Aside from getting married Trigger stretched slim tanned arms over her head and grinned No immediate plans she said I ve resigned from Precol Got a couple of checks from the Federation One to cover my expenses on that plasmoid business that was the Dawn City fare mainly and the other for the five weeks special duty they figured I was on for them So I m up to five thousand crowns again and I thought I d just loaf around and sort of think things over till Quillan gets back from his current assignment I see When is Major Quillan returning In about a month It s Captain Quillan at present by the way Oh said Pilch What happened That unwarranted interference with a political situation business They d broadcast a warning against taking individual action of any kind against the plasmoid station But when he got there and heard the Commissioner was in a kind of coma and I wasn t even on board he lost his head and came charging into the station after me flinging grenades and so on around The plasmoids would have finished him off pretty quick except most of them had started slowing down as soon as Repulsive turned off the main one The lunatic was lucky the termites didn t get to him before he even reached the station Pilch said Termites Trigger told her about the termites Ugh said Pilch I hadn t heard about those So they broke him for that It hardly seems right Well you have to have discipline Trigger said tolerantly Ape s a bit short on that end anyway They ll be upgrading him again fairly soon I imagine I might just be going into Space Scout Intelligence myself by the way They said they d be glad to have me Not at all incidentally remarked Pilch my Service also would be glad to have you Would they Trigger looked at her thoughtfully That includes that total therapy process doesn t it Usually said Pilch Well I might some day But not just yet She smiled Let s let Lyad get a head start Actually it s just I ve found out there are so many interesting things going on all around that I d like to look them over a bit before I go charging seriously into a career again She reached across the table and tapped Pilch s wrist And I ll show you one interesting thing that s going on right here Take Mantelish s big tree out there The sequoia Yes Now just last year it was looking so bad they almost talked the professor into having it taken away Hardly a green branch left on it Pilch shaded her eyes and looked at the sequoia s crown far above them It looks she observed reflectively in fairly good shape at the moment I d say Yes and it s getting greener every week Mantelish brags about a new solvent he s been dosing its roots with You see that great big branch like an L turned upward just a little above the center Pilch looked again Yes she said after a moment I think so Just before the L turns upward there s a little cluster of green branches Trigger said I see those yes Trigger picked up the field glasses and handed them to her Get those little branches in the glasses she said Pilch said presently Got them Trigger stood up and faced up to the sequoia She cupped her hands to her mouth took a deep breath and yelled Yoo hoo Reee pul sive Down in the garden Mantelish straightened and looked about angrily Then he saw Trigger and smiled Yoo hoo yourself Trigger he shouted and turned back to his spading Trigger watched Pilch s face from the side She saw her give a sudden start Great Galaxies Pilch breathed She kept on looking That s one for the book isn t it Finally she put the glasses down She appeared somewhat stunned He really is a little green man Only when he s trying to be It s a sort of sign of friendliness What s he doing up there He moved over into the sequoia right after we got back Trigger said And that s where he ll probably stay indefinitely now It s just the right kind of place for Repulsive Have you been doing any more well talking No Too strenuous both ways Until a few days before we got back here there wasn t even a sign from him He just about knocked himself out on that big plasmoid Who else knows about this asked Pilch Nobody I would have told Holati except he s still mad enough about having been put into a coma he might go out and chop the sequoia down Well it won t go into the report then Pilch said They d just want to bother Repulsive I knew it would be all right to tell you And here s something else very interesting that s going on at present What s that The real hush hush reason for Mantelish s expedition Trigger explained is of course to scout around this whole area of space with planetary plasmoid detectors They don t want anybody stumbling on another setup like Harvest Moon and accidentally activating another king plasmoid Yes Pilch said I d heard that It was Mantelish s idea said Trigger Now Mantelish is very fond of that sequoia tree He s got a big comfortable bench right among its roots where he likes to sit down around noon and have a little nap when he s out here Oh said Pilch Repulsive s been up to his old tricks eh Sure He s given Mantelish very exact instructions So they re going to find one of those setups all right And they won t come back with any plasmoids But they will come back with something they don t know about Pilch looked at her for a moment You say it Trigger s grin widened A little green woman she said CONSIDER THE PLASMOIDS Ancient living machines that after millennia of stillness suddenly begin to move under their own power for reasons that remain a mystery to men Holati Tate discovered them then disappeared Trigger Argee was his closest associate she means to find him She s brilliant beautiful and skilled in every known martial art She s worth plenty dead or alive to more than one faction in this obscure battle And she s beginning to have a chilling notion that the long vanished Masters of the Old Galaxy were wise when they exiled the plasmoids to the most distant and isolated world they knew Printed in U S A Transcriber s Note The following typographical errors in
