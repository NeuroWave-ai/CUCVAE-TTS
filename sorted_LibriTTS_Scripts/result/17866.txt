PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MURDER IN THE GUNROOM Produced by Greg Weeks Mary Meehan and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at http www pgdp net MURDER IN THE GUNROOM By H BEAM PIPER NEW YORK Alfred A Knopf nineteen fifty three FIRST EDITION TO Colonel Henry W Shoemaker an old and valued friend who was promised this dedication with an entirely different novel in mind twenty two years ago PREFACE The Lane Fleming collection of early pistols and revolvers was one of the best in the country When Fleming was found dead on the floor of his locked gunroom a Confederate made Colt type percussion thirty six revolver in his hand the coroner s verdict was death by accident But Gladys Fleming had her doubts Enough at any rate to engage Colonel Jefferson Davis Rand better known just as Jeff private detective and a pistol collector himself to catalogue appraise and negotiate the sale of her late husband s collection There were a number of people who had wanted the collection The question was had anyone wanted it badly enough to kill Fleming And if so how had he done it Here is a mystery told against the fascinating background of old guns and gun collecting which is rapid fire without being hysterical exciting without losing its contact with reason and which introduces a personable and intelligent new private detective It is a story that will keep your nerves on a hair trigger even if you don t know the difference between a cased pair of Paterson thirty four s and a Texas forty with a ramming lever CHAPTER one It was hard to judge Jeff Rand s age from his appearance he was certainly over thirty and considerably under fifty He looked hard and fit like a man who could be a serviceable friend or a particularly unpleasant enemy Women instinctively suspected that he would make a most satisfying lover One might have taken him for a successful lawyer he had studied law years ago or a military officer in mufti he still had a Reserve colonelcy and used the title occasionally to impress people who he thought needed impressing or a prosperous businessman as he usually thought of himself Most of all he looked like King Charles II of England anachronistically clad in a Brooks Brothers suit At the moment he was looking rather like King Charles II being bothered by one of his mistresses who wanted a peerage for her husband But missus Fleming he was expostulating There surely must be somebody else After all you ll have to admit that this isn t the sort of work this agency handles The would be client released a series of smoke rings and watched them float up toward the air outlet at the office ceiling It spoke well for Rand s ability to subordinate esthetic to business considerations that he was trying to give her a courteous and humane brush off She made even the Petty and Varga girls seem credible Her color scheme was blue and gold blue eyes and a blue tailored outfit that would have looked severe on a less curvate figure and a charmingly absurd little blue hat perched on a mass of golden hair If Rand had been Charles II she could have walked out of there with a duchess s coronet and Nell Gwyn would have been back selling oranges Why isn t it she countered Your door s marked Tri State Detective Agency Jefferson Davis Rand Investigation and Protection Well I want to know how much the collection s worth and who ll pay the closest to it That s investigation isn t it And I want protection from being swindled And don t tell me you can t do it You re a pistol collector yourself you have one of the best small collections in the state And you re a recognized authority on early pistols I ve read some of your articles in the Rifleman If you can t handle this I don t know who can Rand s frown deepened He wondered how much Gladys Fleming knew about the principles of General Semantics Even if she didn t know anything she was still edging him into an untenable position He hastily shifted from the attempt to identify his business with the label private detective agency Well here missus Fleming he explained My business including armed guard and protected delivery service and general investigation and protection work requires some personal supervision but none of it demands my exclusive attention Now if you wanted some routine investigation made I could turn it over to my staff maybe put two or three men to work on it But there s nothing about this business of yours that I could delegate to anybody I d have to do it all myself at the expense of neglecting the rest of my business Now I could do what you want done but it would cost you three or four times what you d gain by retaining me Well let me decide that Colonel she replied How much would you have to have Well this collection of your late husband s consists of some twenty five hundred pistols and revolvers all types and periods Rand said You want me to catalogue it appraise each item issue lists and negotiate with prospective buyers The cataloguing and appraisal alone would take from a week to ten days and it would be a couple more weeks until a satisfactory sale could be arranged Why say five thousand dollars a thousand as a retainer and the rest on completion That he thought would settle that He was expecting an indignant outcry and hardened his heart like Pharaoh Instead Gladys Fleming nodded equably That seems reasonable enough Colonel Rand considering that you d have to be staying with us at Rosemont away from your office she agreed I ll give you a check for the thousand now with a letter of authorization

none	none	in return Being thoroughly conscious of the fact that he could only know a thin film of the events on the surface of any situation he was not easily surprised Very well he said You ve hired an arms expert I ll be in Rosemont some time tomorrow afternoon Now who are these prospective purchasers you mentioned and just how prospective in terms of United States currency are they Well for one there s Arnold Rivers he s offering ten thousand for the collection I suppose you know of him he has an antique arms business at Rosemont I ve done some business with him Rand admitted Who else There s a commission dealer named Carl Gwinnett who wants to handle the collection for us for twenty per cent I m told that that isn t an unusually exorbitant commission but I m not exactly crazy about the idea You shouldn t be if you want your money in a hurry Rand told her He d take at least five years to get everything sold He wouldn t dump the whole collection on the market at once upset prices and spoil his future business You know two thousand five hundred pistols of the sort mister Fleming had coming on the market in a lot could do just that The old arms market isn t so large that it couldn t be easily saturated That s what I d been thinking And then there are some private collectors mostly friends of Lane s mister Fleming s who are talking about forming a pool to buy the collection for distribution among themselves she continued That s more like it Rand approved If they can raise enough money among them that is They won t want the stuff for resale and they may pay something resembling a decent price Who are they Well Stephen Gresham appears to be the leading spirit she said The corporation lawyer you know Then there is a mister Trehearne and a mister MacBride and Philip Cabot and one or two others I know Gresham and Cabot Rand said They re both friends of mine and I have an account with Cabot Joyner Teale Cabot s brokerage firm I ve corresponded with MacBride he specializes in Colts You re the sole owner I take it Well no She paused picking her words carefully We may just run into a little trouble there You see the collection is part of the residue of the estate left equally to myself and my two stepdaughters Nelda Dunmore and Geraldine Varcek You understand mister Fleming and I were married in nineteen forty one his first wife died fifteen years before Well your stepdaughters now would they also be my clients Good Lord no That amused her considerably more than it did Rand Of course she continued they re just as interested in selling the collection for the best possible price but beyond that there may be a slight divergence of opinion For instance Nelda s husband Fred Dunmore has been insisting that we let him handle the sale of the pistols on the grounds that he is something he calls a businessman Nelda supports him in this It was Fred who got this ten thousand dollar offer from Rivers Personally I think Rivers is playing him for a sucker Outside his own line Fred is an awful innocent and I ve never trusted this man Rivers Lane had some trouble with him just before Arnold Rivers Rand said when it was evident that she was not going to continue has the reputation among collectors of being the biggest crook in the old gun racket a reputation he seems determined to live up or down to But here if your stepdaughters are company owners what s my status What authority if any have I to do any negotiating Gladys Fleming laughed musically That my dear Colonel is where you earn your fee she told him Actually it won t be as hard as it looks If Nelda gives you any argument you can count on Geraldine to take your side as a matter of principle if Geraldine objects first Nelda will help you steam roll her into line Fred Dunmore is accustomed to dealing with a lot of yes men at the plant you shouldn t have any trouble shouting him down Anton Varcek won t be interested one way or another he has what amounts to a pathological phobia about firearms of any sort And Humphrey Goode our attorney who s executor of the estate will welcome you with open arms once he finds out what you want to do That collection has him talking to himself already Look if you come out to our happy home in the early afternoon before Fred and Anton get back from the plant we ought to ram through some sort of agreement with Geraldine and Nelda You and whoever else sides with me will be a majority Rand considered Of course the other one may pull a Gromyko on us but I think I ll talk to Goode first Yes That would be smart Gladys Fleming agreed After all he s responsible for selling the collection She crossed to the desk and sat down in Rand s chair while she wrote out the check and a short letter of authorization then she returned to her own seat There s another thing she continued lighting a fresh cigarette Because of the manner of mister Fleming s death the girls have a horror of the collection almost but not quite as strong as their desire to get the best possible price for it Yes I d heard that mister Fleming had been killed in a firearms accident last November Rand mentioned It was with one of his collection pieces the widow replied One he d bought just that day a Confederate made Colt type percussion thirty six revolver He d brought it home with him simply delighted with it and started cleaning it at once He could hardly wait until dinner was over to get back to work on it We d finished dinner about seven or a little after At about half past Nelda went out somewhere in the coupe Anton had gone up to his laboratory in the attic he s one of these fortunates whose work is also his hobby he s a biochemist and dietitian and Lane was in the gunroom on the second floor working on his new revolver Fred Dunmore was having a bath and Geraldine and I had taken our coffee into the east parlor Geraldine put on the radio and we were listening to it It must have been about seven forty seven or seven forty eight because the program had changed and the first commercial was just over when we heard a loud noise from somewhere upstairs Neither of us thought of a shot my own first idea was of a door slamming Then about five minutes later we heard Anton in the upstairs hall pounding on a door and shouting Lane Lane Are you all right We ran up the front stairway and found Anton in his rubber lab apron and Fred in a bathrobe and barefooted standing outside the gunroom door The door was locked and that in itself was unusual there s a Yale lock on it but nobody ever used it For a minute or so we just stood there Anton was explaining that he had heard a shot and that nobody in the gunroom answered Geraldine told him rather impatiently to go down to the library and up the spiral You see she explained the library is directly under the gunroom and there s a spiral stairway connecting the two rooms So Anton went downstairs and we stood waiting in the hall Fred was shivering in his bathrobe he said he d just jumped out of the bathtub and he had nothing on under it After a while Anton opened the gunroom door from the inside and stood in the doorway blocking it He said You d better not come in There s been an accident but it s too late to do anything Lane s shot himself with one of those damned pistols I always knew something like this would happen Well I simply elbowed him out of the way and went in and the others followed me By this time the uproar had penetrated to the rear of the house and the servants Walters the butler and missus Horder the cook had joined us We found Lane inside lying on the floor shot through the forehead Of course he was dead He d been sitting on one of these old cobblers benches of the sort that used to be all the thing for cocktail tables he had his tools and polish and oil and rags on it He d fallen off it to one side and was lying beside it He had a revolver in his right hand and an oily rag in his left Was it the revolver he d brought home with him Rand asked I don t know she replied He showed me this Confederate revolver when he came home but it was dirty and dusty and I didn t touch it And I didn t look closely at the one he had in his hand when he was on the floor It was about the same size and design that s all I could swear to She continued We had something of an argument about what to do Walters the butler offered to call the police He s English and his mind seems to run naturally to due process of law Fred and Anton both howled that proposal down they wanted no part of the police At the same time Geraldine was going into hysterics and I was trying to get her quieted down I took her to her room and gave her a couple of sleeping pills and then went back to the gunroom While I was gone it seems that Anton had called our family doctor doctor Yardman and then Fred called Humphrey Goode our lawyer Goode lives next door to us about two hundred yards away so he arrived almost at once When the doctor came he called the coroner and when he arrived about an hour later they all went into a huddle and decided that it was an obvious accident and that no inquest would be necessary Then somebody I m not sure who called an undertaker It was past eleven when he arrived and for once Nelda got home early She was just coming in while they were carrying Lane out in a basket You can imagine how horrible that was for her it was days before she was over the shock So she ll be just as glad as anybody to see the last of the pistol collection Through the recital Rand had sat silently toying with the ivory handled Italian Fascist dagger of honor that was doing duty as a letter opener on his desk Gladys Fleming wasn t he was sure indulging in any masochistic self harrowing neither he thought was she talking to relieve her mind Once or twice there had been a small catch in her voice but otherwise the narration had been a piece of straight reporting neither callous nor emotional Good reporting too carefully detailed There had been one or two inclusions of inferential matter in the guise of description but that was to be looked for and discounted And she had remembered at the end to include her ostensible reason for telling the story Yes it must have been dreadful he sympathized Odd though that an old hand with guns like mister Fleming would have an accident like that I met him once or twice and was at your home to see his collection a couple of years ago He impressed me as knowing firearms pretty thoroughly Well you can look for me tomorrow say around two In the meantime I ll see Goode and also Gresham and Arnold Rivers CHAPTER two After ushering his client out the hall door and closing it behind her Rand turned and said All right Kathie or Dave whoever s out there Come on in Then he went to his desk and reached under it snapping off a switch As he straightened the door from the reception office opened and his secretary Kathie O Grady entered loading a cigarette into an eight inch amber holder She was a handsome woman built on the generous lines of a Renaissance goddess none of the Renaissance masters however had ever employed a model so strikingly Hibernian She had blue eyes and a fair highly colored complexion she wore green which went well with her flaming red hair and a good deal of gold costume jewelry Behind her came Dave Ritter He was Rand s assistant and also Kathie s lover He was five or six years older than his employer and slightly built His hair fighting a stubborn rearguard action against baldness was an indeterminate mousy gray brown It was one of his professional assets that nobody ever noticed him not even in a crowd of one when he wanted it to his thin face could assume the weary baffled expression of a middle aged book keeper with a wife and four children on fifty dollars a week Actually he drew three times that much had no wife admitted to no children During the war he and Kathie had kept the Tri State Agency in something better than a state of suspended animation while Rand had been in the Army Ritter fumbled a Camel out of his shirt pocket and made a beeline for the desk appropriating Rand s lighter and sharing the flame with Kathie You know Jeff he said one of the reasons why this agency never made any money while you were away was that I never had the unadulterated insolence to ask the kind of fees you do I was listening in on the extension in the file room I could hear Kathie damn near faint when you said five grand Yes five thousand dollars for appraising a collection they ve been offered ten for and she only has a third interest Kathie said retracting herself into the chair lately vacated by Gladys Fleming If that makes sense now Ah don t you get it Kathleen Mavourneen Ritter asked She doesn t care about the pistols she wants Jeff to find out who fixed up that accident for Fleming You heard that big long shaggy dog story about exactly what happened and where everybody was supposed to have been at the time I hope you got all that recorded it was all told for a purpose Rand had picked up the outside phone and was dialing In a moment a girl s voice answered Carter Tipton s law office good afternoon Hello Rheba is Tip available Oh hello Jeff Just a sec I ll see She buzzed another phone Jeff Rand on the line she announced A clear slightly Harvard accented male voice took over Hello Jeff Now what sort of malfeasance have you committed Nothing so far cross my fingers Rand replied I just want a little information Are you busy Okay I ll be up directly He replaced the phone and turned to his disciples Our client he said wants two jobs done on one fee Getting the pistol collection sold is one job Exploring the whys and wherefores of that quote accident unquote is the other She has a hunch and probably nothing much better that there s something sour about the accident She expects me to find evidence to that effect while I m at Rosemont going over the collection I m not excluding other possibilities but I ll work on that line until and unless I find out differently Five thousand should cover both jobs You think that s how it is Kathie asked Look Kathie I got just as far in Arithmetic at school as you did and I suspect that missus Fleming got at least as far as long division herself For reasons I stated I simply couldn t have handled that collection business for anything like a reasonable fee so I told her five thousand thinking that would stop her When it didn t I knew she had something else in mind and when she went into all that detail about the death of her husband she as good as told me that was what it was Now I m sorry I didn t say ten thousand I think she d have bought it at that price just as cheerfully She thinks Lane Fleming was murdered Well on the face of what she told me so do I All right Professor expound Ritter said You heard what he was supposed to have shot himself with Rand began A Colt type percussion revolver You know what they re like And I know enough about Lane Fleming to know how much experience he had with old arms I can t believe that he d buy a pistol without carefully examining it and I can t believe that he d bring that thing home and start working on it without seeing the caps on the nipples and the charges in the chambers if it had been loaded And if it had been he would have first taken off the caps and then taken it apart and drawn the charges And she says he started working on it as soon as he got home presumably around five and then took time out for dinner and then went back to work on it and more than half an hour later there was a shot and he was killed Rand blew a Bronx cheer If that accident had been the McCoy it would have happened in the first five minutes after he started working on that pistol No in the first thirty seconds And then when they found him he had the revolver in his right hand and an oily rag in his left I hope both of you noticed that little touch Yeah When I clean a gat I generally have it in my left hand and clean with my right Ritter said Exactly And why do you use an oily rag Rand inquired Ritter looked at him blankly for a half second then grinned ruefully Damn I never thought of that he admitted Okay he was bumped off all right But you use oily rags on guns Kathie objected I ve seen both of you often enough When we re all through honey Ritter told her Yes When he brought home that revolver it was in neglected condition Rand said Either surface rusted or filthy with gummed oil and dirt Even if missus Fleming hadn t mentioned that point the length of time he spent cleaning it would justify such an inference He would have taken it apart down to the smallest screw and cleaned everything carefully and then put it together again and then when he had finished he would have gone over the surface with an oiled rag before hanging it on the wall He would certainly not have surface oiled it before removing the charges if there ever were any I assume the revolver he was found holding presumably the one with which he was killed was another one And I would further assume that the killer wasn t particularly familiar with the subject of firearms antique care and maintenance of And with all the hollering and whooping and hysterics throwing nobody noticed the switch Ritter finished Wonder what happened to the one he was really cleaning That I may possibly find out Rand said The general incompetence with which this murder was committed gives me plenty of room to hope that it may still be lying around somewhere Well have you thought that it might just be suicide Kathie asked I have very briefly I dismissed the thought almost at once Rand told her For two reasons One that if it had been suicide missus Fleming wouldn t want it poked into she d be more than willing to let it ride as an accident And two I doubt if a man who prided himself on his gun knowledge as Fleming did would want his self shooting to be taken for an accident I m damn sure I wouldn t want my friends to go around saying What a dope didn t know it was loaded I doubt if he d even expect people to believe that it had been an accident He shook his head No the only inference I can draw is that somebody murdered Fleming and then faked evidence intended to indicate an accident He rose I ll be back in a little think it over while I m gone Carter Tipton had his law office on the floor above the Tri State Detective Agency He handled all Rand s not infrequent legal involvements and Rand did all his investigating and witness chasing annually they compared books to see who owed whom how much Tipton was about five years Rand s junior and had been in the Navy during the war He was frequently described as New Belfast s leading younger attorney and most eligible bachelor His dark conservatively cut clothes fitted him as though they had been sprayed on he wore gold rimmed glasses and he was so freshly barbered manicured valeted and scrubbed as to give the impression that he had been born in cellophane and just unwrapped He leaned back in his chair and waved his visitor to a seat Tip do you know anything about this Fleming family out at Rosemont Rand began getting out his pipe and tobacco The Premix Foods Flemings Tipton asked Yes a little Which one of them wants you to frame what on which other one That ll do for a good simplified description to start with Rand commented Why my client is missus Gladys Fleming As to what she wants He told the young lawyer about his recent interview and subsequent conclusions So you see he finished she won t commit herself even with me Maybe she thinks I have more official status and more obligations to the police than I have Maybe she isn t sure in her own mind and wants me to see independently if there s any smell of something dead in the woodpile Or she may think that having a private detective called in may throw a scare into somebody Or maybe she thinks somebody may be fixing up an accident for her next and she wants a pistol totin gent in the house for a while Or any combination thereof Personally I deplore these clients who hire you to do one thing and expect you to do another but with five grand for sweetening I can take them Yes You know I ve heard rumors of suicide but this is the first whiff of murder I ve caught He hesitated slightly I must say I m not greatly surprised Lane Fleming s death was very convenient to a number of people You know about this Premix Company don t you Vaguely They manufacture ready mixed pancake flour and ready mixed ice cream and pudding powders and this dehydrated vegetable soup pour on hot water stir and serve don t they My colored boy Buck got some of the soup once for an experiment We unanimously voted not to try it again They put out quite a line of such godsends to the neophyte in the kitchen the popularity of which is reflected in a steadily rising divorce rate Tipton said They advertise very extensively including half an hour of tear jerking drama on a national hookup during soap opera time Your client the former Gladys Farrand was on the air for Premix for a couple of years that s how Lane Fleming first met her So you think some irate and dyspeptic husband went to the source of his woes Rand inquired Well not exactly You see Premix is only Little Business as the foods industry goes but they have something very sweet So sweet in fact that one of the really big fellows National Milling Packaging has been going to rather extreme lengths to effect a merger Mill Pack par one hundred is quoted at around one hundred forty five and Premix par fifty is at seventy five now and Mill Pack is offering a two for one share exchange which would be a little less than four for one in value I might add for what it s worth that this Stephen Gresham you mentioned is Mill Pack s attorney negotiator and general mister Fixit he has been trying to put over this merger for Mill Pack I ll bear that in mind too Rand said Naturally all this is not being shouted from the housetops Tipton continued Fact is it s a minor infraction of ethics for me to mention it to you I ll file it in the burn box Rand promised What was the matter didn t Premix want to merge Lane Fleming didn t And since he held fifty two per cent of the common stock himself try and do anything about it Anything short of retiring Fleming to the graveyard that is Rand amended That would do for a murder motive very nicely What were Fleming s objections to the merger Mainly sentimental Premix was his baby or at least his kid brother His father started mixing pancake flour back before the First World War and Lane Fleming peddled it off a spring wagon They worked up a nice little local trade and finally a state wide wholesale business They incorporated in the early twenties and then after the old man died Lane Fleming hired an advertising agency to promote his products and built up a national distribution and took on some sidelines Then during the late mister Chamberlain s Peace in our time he picked up a refugee Czech chemist and foods expert named Anton Varcek who whipped up a lot of new products So business got better and better and they made more money to spend on advertising to get more money to buy more advertising to make more money like Bill Nye s Puritans digging clams in the winter to get strength to hoe corn in the summer to get strength to dig clams in the winter So Premix became a sort of symbol of achievement to Fleming Then he was one of these old model paternalistic employers and he was afraid that if he relinquished control a lot of his old retainers would be turned out to grass And finally he was opposed in principle to concentration of business ownership He claimed it made business more vulnerable to government control and eventual socialization I m not sure he didn t have something there Rand considered We get all our corporate eggs in a few baskets and they re that much easier for the planned economy boys to grab Just who on the Premix side was in favor of this merger Just about everybody but Fleming Tipton replied His two sons in law Fred Dunmore and Varcek who are first and second vice presidents Humphrey Goode the company attorney who doubles as board chairman All the directors All the New York banking crowd who are interested in Premix And all the two share tinymites I don t know who inherits Fleming s voting interest but I can find out for you by this time tomorrow Do that Tip and bill me for what you think finding out is worth Rand said It ll be a novel reversal of order for you to be billing me for an investigation Now how about the family as distinct from the company Well there s your client Gladys Fleming She married Lane Fleming about ten years ago when she was twenty five and he was fifty five In spite of the age difference I understand it was a fairly happy marriage Then there are two daughters by a previous marriage Nelda Dunmore and Geraldine Varcek and their respective husbands They all live together in a big house at Rosemont In the company Dunmore is Sales and Varcek is Production They each have a corner of the mantle of Lane Fleming in one hand and a dirk in the other Nelda and Geraldine hate each other like Greeks and Trojans Nelda is the nymphomaniac sister and Geraldine is the dipsomaniac From time to time temporary alliances get formed mainly against Gladys all of them resent the way she married herself into a third interest in the estate You re going to have yourself a nice pleasant little stay in the country I m looking forward to it Rand grimaced You mentioned suicide rumors Such as and who s been spreading them Oh they are the usual bodyless voices that float about Tipton told him Emanating I suspect from sources interested in shaking out the less sophisticated small shareholders before the merger The story is always approximately the same That Lane Fleming saw his company drifting reefward was unwilling to survive the shipwreck and performed seppuku The family are supposed to have faked up the accident afterward I dismiss the whole thing as a rather less than subtle bit of market manipulation chicanery Or a smoke screen to cover the defects in camouflaging a murder as an accident Rand added Tipton nodded That could be so too he agreed Say somebody dislikes the looks of that accident and starts investigating Then he runs into all this miasma of suicide rumors and promptly shrugs the whole thing off Fleming killed himself and the family made a few alterations and are passing it off as an accident The families of suicides have been known to do that Yes Regular defense in depth system if the accident line is penetrated the suicide line is back of it Rand said Well in the last few years we ve seen defenses in depth penetrated with monotonous regularity I ve jeeped through a couple myself to interrogate the surviving ex defenders It s all in having the guns and armor to smash through with CHAPTER three Humphrey Goode was sixty ish short and chunky with a fringe of white hair around a bald crown His brow was corrugated with wrinkles and he peered suspiciously at Rand through a pair of thick lensed black ribboned glasses His wide mouth curved downward at the corners in an expression that was probably intended to be stern and succeeded only in being pompous His office was dark and smelled of dusty books mister Rand he began accusingly when your secretary called to make this appointment she informed me that you had been retained by missus Gladys Fleming That s correct Rand slowly packed tobacco into his pipe and lit it missus Fleming wants me to look after some interests of hers and as you re executor of her late husband s estate I thought I ought to talk to you first of all Goode s eyes narrowed behind the thick glasses mister Rand if you re investigating the death of Lane Fleming you re wasting your time and missus Fleming s money he lectured There is nothing whatever for you to find out that is not already public knowledge mister Fleming was accidentally killed by the discharge of an old revolver he was cleaning I don t know what foolish feminine impulse led missus Fleming to employ you but you ll do nobody any good in this matter and you may do a great deal of harm Did my secretary tell you I was making an investigation Rand demanded incredulously She doesn t usually make mistakes of that sort The wrinkles moved up Goode s brow like a battalion advancing in platoon front He looked even more narrowly at Rand his suspicion compounded with bewilderment Why should I investigate the death of Lane Fleming Rand continued As far as I know missus Fleming is satisfied that it was an accident She never expressed any other belief to me Do you think it was anything else Why of course not Goode exclaimed That s just what I was telling you I He took a fresh start There have been rumors utterly without foundation of course that mister Fleming committed suicide They are I may say nothing but malicious fabrications circulated for the purpose of undermining public confidence in Premix Foods Incorporated I had thought that perhaps missus Fleming might have heard them and decided on her own responsibility to bring you in to scotch them I was afraid that such a step might by giving these rumors fresh currency defeat its intended purpose Oh nothing of the sort Rand told him I m not in the least interested in how mister Fleming was killed and the question is simply not involved in what missus Fleming wants me to do He stopped there Goode was looking at him sideways sucking in one corner of his mouth and pushing out the other It was not a facial contortion that impressed Rand favorably it was too reminiscent of a high school principal under whom he had suffered years ago in Vicksburg Mississippi Rand began to suspect that Goode might be just another such self righteous opinionated egotistical windbag Such men could be dangerous were usually quite unscrupulous and were almost always unpleasant to deal with Then why the lawyer demanded did missus Fleming employ you Well as you know Rand began the Fleming pistol collection now the joint property of missus Fleming and her two stepdaughters is an extremely valuable asset mister Fleming spent the better part of his life gathering it At one time or another he must have owned between four and five thousand different pistols and revolvers The twenty five hundred left to his heirs represent the result of a systematic policy of discriminating purchase replacement of inferior items and general improvement It s one of the largest and most famous collections of its kind in the country Well Goode was completely out of his depth by now Surely missus Fleming doesn t think missus Fleming thinks that expert advice is urgently needed in disposing of that collection Rand replied carefully picking his words to fit what he estimated to be Goode s probable semantic reactions She has the utmost confidence in your ability and integrity as an attorney however she realized that you could hardly describe yourself as an antique arms expert It happens that I am an expert in antique firearms particularly pistols I have a collection of my own I am the author of a number of articles on the subject and I am recognized as something of an authority I know arms values and understand market conditions Furthermore not being a dealer or connected with any museum I have no mercenary motive for undervaluing the collection That s all there is to it missus Fleming has retained me as a firearms expert in connection with the collection Goode was looking at Rand as though the latter had just torn off a mask revealing another and entirely different set of features underneath The change seemed to be a welcome one but he was evidently having trouble adjusting to it Rand grinned inwardly now he was going to have to find himself a new set of verbal labels and identifications Well mister Rand that alters the situation considerably he said with noticeably less hostility He was still a bit resentful people had no right to confuse him by jumping about from one category to another like that Now understand I m not trying to be offensive but it seems a little unusual for a private detective also to be an authority on antique firearms mister Fleming was an authority on antique firearms and he was a manufacturer of foodstuffs Rand parried carefully staying inside Goode s Aristotelian system of categories and verbal identifications My own business does not occupy all my time any more than his did and I doubt if an interest in the history and development of deadly weapons is any more incongruous in a criminologist than in an industrialist But if there s any doubt in your mind as to my qualifications you can check with Colonel Taylor at the State Museum or with the editor of the American Rifleman I see Goode nodded And as you point out being a sort of non professional expert you should be free from mercenary bias He nodded again taking off his glasses and polishing them on an outsize white handkerchief Frankly now that I understand your purpose mister Rand I must say that I am quite glad that missus Fleming took this step I was perplexed about how to deal with that collection I realized that it was worth a great deal of money but I haven t the vaguest idea how much or how it could be sold to the best advantage At a rough guess mister Rand how much do you think it ought to bring 
2769_169619_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Rand shook his head 
none	none	I only saw it twice the last time two years ago Ask me that after I ve spent a day or so going over it and I ll be able to give you an estimate I will say this though It s probably worth a lot more than the ten thousand dollars Arnold Rivers has offered for it That produced an unexpected effect Goode straightened in his chair gobbling in surprised indignation Arnold Rivers Has he had the impudence to try to buy the collection he demanded Where did you hear that From missus Fleming I understand he made the offer to Fred Dunmore That s his business isn t it I believe the colloquial term is racket Goode said Why that man is a notorious swindler mister Rand do you know that only a week before his death mister Fleming instructed me to bring suit against him and also to secure his indictment on criminal charges of fraud I didn t know that but I m not surprised Rand answered What did he burn Fleming with Here I ll show you Goode rose from his seat and went to a rank of steel filing cabinets behind the desk In a moment he was back with a large manila envelope under his arm and a huge pistol in either hand Here mister Rand he chuckled We ll just test your firearms knowledge What do you make of these Rand took the pistols and looked at them They were wheel locks apparently sixteenth century South German they were a good two feet in over all length with ball pommels the size of oranges and long steel belt hooks The stocks were so covered with ivory inlay that the wood showed only in tiny interstices the metal work was lavishly engraved and gold inlaid To the trigger guards were attached tags marked Fleming vs Rivers Rand examined each pistol separately then compared them Finally he took a six inch rule from his pocket and made measurements first with one edge and then with the other Well I m damned he said laying them on the desk These things are the most complete fakes I ever saw locks stocks barrels and mountings They re supposed to be late sixteenth century I doubt if they were made before nineteen twenty As far as I can see or measure there isn t the slightest difference between them except on some of the decorative inlay The whole job must have been miked in ten thousandths and what s more whoever made them used metric measurements You ll find pairs of English dueling pistols as early as seventeen seventy five that are almost indistinguishable but in fifteen seventy five when these things were supposed to have been made a gunsmith was working fine when he was working in sixteenth inches They just didn t have the measuring instruments at that time to do closer work I won t bother taking these things apart but if I did I d bet all Wall Street to Junior s piggy bank that I d find that the screws were machine threaded and the working parts interchanged I ve heard about fakes like these he named a famous recently liquidated West Coast collection but I d never hoped to see an example like this Goode gave a hacking chuckle You ll do as an arms expert mister Rand he said And you d win the piggy bank It seems that after mister Fleming bought them he took them apart and found just as you say that the screw threads had been machine cut and that the working parts were interchangeable from one pistol to the other There were a lot of papers accompanying them I have them here purporting to show that they had been sold by some Austrian nobleman an anti Nazi refugee in whose family they had been since the reign of Maximilian II They are of course fabrications I looked up the family in the Almanach de Gotha it simply never existed At first mister Fleming had been inclined to take the view that Rivers had been equally victimized with himself However when Rivers refused to take back the pistols and refund the purchase price he altered his opinion He placed them in my hands instructing me to bring suit and also start criminal action he was in a fearful rage about it and swore that he d drive Rivers out of business However before I could start action mister Fleming was killed in that accident and as he was the sole witness to the fact of the sale and as none of the heirs was interested I did nothing about it In fact I advised them that action against Rivers would cost the estate more than they could hope to recover in damages He picked up one of the pistols and examined it Now I don t know what to do about these Take them home and hang them over the mantel Rand advised If I m going to have anything to do with selling the collection I don t want anything to do with them Goode was peering at the ivory inlay on the underbelly of the stock They are beautiful and I don t care when they were made he said I think if nobody else wants them I ll do just that Now mister Rand what had you intended doing about the collection Well that s what I came to see you about mister Goode As I understand it it is you who are officially responsible for selling the collection and the proceeds would be turned over to you for distribution to missus Fleming missus Dunmore and missus Varcek Is that correct Yes The collection although in the physical possession of missus Fleming is still an undistributed asset I thought so Rand got out Gladys Fleming s letter of authorization and handed it to Goode As you ll see by that I was retained by and only by missus Fleming he said I am assuming that her interests are identical with those of the other heirs but I realize that this is true only to a very limited extent It s my understanding that relations between the three ladies are not the most pleasant Goode produced a short croaking laugh Now there s a cautious understatement he commented mister Rand I feel that you should know that all three hate each other poisonously That was rather my impression Now I expect some trouble from missus Dunmore and or missus Varcek either or both of whom are sure to accuse me of having been brought into this by missus Fleming to help her defraud the others That of course is not the case they will all profit equally by my participation in this But I m going to have trouble convincing them of that Yes You will Goode agreed Would you rather carry my authorization than missus Fleming s Yes indeed mister Goode To tell the truth that was why I came here for one reason You will not be obligated in any way by authorizing me to act as your agent I m getting my fee from missus Fleming but I would be obligated to represent her only as far as her interests did not improperly conflict with those of the other heirs and that s what I want made clear Goode favored the detective with a saurian smile You re not a lawyer too mister Rand he asked Well I am a member of the Bar in the State of Mississippi though I never practiced Rand admitted Instead of opening a law office I went into the F B I in nineteen thirty five and then opened a private agency a couple of years later But if I had to which God forbid I could go home tomorrow and hang out my shingle You seem to have had quite an eventful career Goode remarked with a queer combination of envy and disapproval I understand that until recently you were an officer in the Army Intelligence too I ll have your authorization to act for me made out immediately to list and appraise the collection and to negotiate with prospective purchasers And by the way he continued did I understand you to say that you had heard some of these silly rumors to the effect that Lane Fleming had committed suicide Oh that s what s always heard under the circumstances Rand shrugged A certain type of sensation loving mind mister Rand there is not one scintilla of truth in any of these scurrilous stories Goode declared pumping up a fine show of indignation The Premix Company is in the best possible financial condition a glance at its books or at its last financial statement would show that I ought to know I m chairman of the board of directors Just because there was some talk of retrenchment shortly before mister Fleming s death Oh no responsible person pays any attention to that sort of talk Rand comforted him My armed guard and armored car service brings me into contact with a lot of the local financial crowd None of them is taking these rumors seriously Well of course nobody wants the responsibility of starting a panic even a minor one but people are talking and it s hurting Premix on the market Goode gloomed And now people will hear of missus Fleming s having retained you and will assume just as I did at first that you are making some kind of an investigation I hope you will make a prompt denial if you hear any talk like that He pressed a button on his desk And now I ll get a letter of authorization made out for you mister Rand

2769_169619_000001_000000	train-clean-360	Stephen Gresham was in his early sixties but he could have still worn his World War I uniform without anything giving at the seams and buckled the old Sam Browne at the same hole 
none	none	As Rand entered he rose from behind his desk and advanced smiling cordially
2769_169619_000002_000000	train-clean-360	 Why hello Jeff he greeted the detective grasping his hand heartily You haven t been around for months 
2769_169619_000002_000001	train-clean-360	What have you been doing and why don t you come out to Rosemont to see us 
2769_169619_000002_000002	train-clean-360	Dot and Irene were wondering what had become of you 
2769_169619_000003_000000	train-clean-360	 I m afraid I ve been neglecting too many of my old friends lately Rand admitted sitting down and getting his pipe out 
2769_169619_000003_000001	train-clean-360	 Been busy as the devil 
2769_169619_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Fact is it was business that finally brought me around here 
2769_169619_000003_000003	train-clean-360	I understand that you and some others are forming a pool to buy the Lane Fleming collection 
2769_169619_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes Gresham became enthusiastic 
2769_169619_000004_000001	train-clean-360	 Want in on it 
none	none	I m sure the others would be glad to have you in with us 
2769_169619_000004_000003	train-clean-360	We re going to need all the money we can scrape together with this damned Rivers bidding against us 
2769_169619_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 I m afraid you will at that Stephen Rand told him 
2769_169619_000005_000001	train-clean-360	 And not necessarily on account of Rivers 
2769_169619_000005_000002	train-clean-360	You see the Fleming estate has just employed me to expertize the collection and handle the sale for them Rand got his pipe lit and drawing properly 
none	none	I hate doing this to you but you know how it is Oh of course I should have known they d get somebody like you in to sell the collection for them 
2769_169619_000006_000002	train-clean-360	Humphrey Goode isn t competent to handle that 
2769_169619_000006_000003	train-clean-360	What we were all afraid of was a public auction at some sales gallery 
none	none	Rand shook his head
2769_169619_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 Worst thing they could do a collection like that would go for peanuts at auction 
none	none	Remember the big sales in the twenties 
2769_169619_000007_000003	train-clean-360	Why here I m going to be in Rosemont staying at the Fleming place working on the collection for the next week or so 
2769_169619_000007_000004	train-clean-360	I suppose your crowd wouldn t want to make an offer until I have everything listed but I d like to talk to your associates in a group as soon as possible 
2769_169619_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Well we all know pretty much what s in the collection Gresham said We were neighbors of his and collectors are a gregarious lot 
2769_169619_000008_000001	train-clean-360	But we aren t anxious to make any premature offers 
none	none	We don t want to offer more than we have to and at the same time we don t want to underbid and see the collection sold elsewhere No of course not Rand thought for a moment Tell you what I ll give you and your friends the best break I can in fairness to my clients 
2769_169619_000009_000002	train-clean-360	I m not obliged to call for sealed bids or anything like that so when I ve heard from everybody I ll give you a chance to bid against the highest offer in hand 
none	none	If you want to top it you can have the collection for any kind of an overbid that doesn t look too suspiciously nominal
2769_169619_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Why Jeff I appreciate that Gresham said 
2769_169619_000010_000001	train-clean-360	 I think you re entirely within your rights but naturally we won t mention this outside 
2769_169619_000010_000002	train-clean-360	I can imagine Arnold Rivers for instance taking a very righteous view of such an arrangement 
2769_169619_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes so can I Of course if he d call me a crook I d take that as a compliment Rand said 
2769_169619_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 I wonder if I could meet your group say tomorrow evening 
2769_169619_000011_000002	train-clean-360	I want to be in a position to assure the Fleming family and Humphrey Goode that you re all serious and responsible 
none	none	Well we re very serious about it Gresham replied and I think we re all responsible 
2769_169619_000012_000001	train-clean-360	You can look us up if you wish 
none	none	Besides myself there is Philip Cabot of Cabot Joyner Teale whom you know and Adam Trehearne who s worth about a half million in industrial shares and Colin MacBride who s vice president in charge of construction and maintenance for Edison Public Power Light at about twenty thousand a year and Pierre Jarrett and his fiancee Karen Lawrence 
2769_169619_000012_000003	train-clean-360	Pierre was a Marine captain invalided home after being wounded on Peleliu he writes science fiction for the pulps 
2769_169619_000012_000004	train-clean-360	Karen has a little general antique business in Rosemont 
2769_169619_000012_000005	train-clean-360	They intend using their share of the collection plus such culls and duplicates as the rest of us can consign to them to go into the arms business with a general antique sideline which Karen can manage while Pierre s writing 
2769_169619_000012_000006	train-clean-360	Tell you what I ll call a meeting at my place tomorrow evening say at eight thirty 
2769_169619_000012_000007	train-clean-360	That suit you 
2769_169619_000013_000000	train-clean-360	That Rand agreed would be all right 
none	none	Gresham asked him how recently he had seen the Fleming collection
2769_169619_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 About two years ago right after I got back from Germany 
2769_169619_000014_000001	train-clean-360	You remember we went there together one evening in March 
2769_169619_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes that s right 
2769_169619_000015_000001	train-clean-360	We didn t have time to see everything Gresham said My God Jeff 
2769_169619_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Twenty five wheel locks 
2769_169619_000015_000003	train-clean-360	Ten snaphaunces 
none	none	And every imaginable kind of flintlock over a hundred U S Martials including the eighteen eighteen Springfield all the S North types a couple of Virginia Manufactory models and he got this since the last time you saw the collection a real Rappahannock Forge flintlock 
2769_169619_000015_000005	train-clean-360	And about a hundred and fifty Colts all models and most variants 
none	none	Remember that big Whitneyville Walker in original condition 
2769_169619_000015_000007	train-clean-360	He got that one in nineteen twenty four at the Fred Hines sale at the old Walpole Galleries 
2769_169619_000015_000008	train-clean-360	And seven Paterson Colts including a couple of cased sets 
none	none	And anything else you can think of 
2769_169619_000015_000010	train-clean-360	A Hall flintlock breech loader an Elisha Collier flintlock revolver a pair of Forsythe detonator lock pistols 
2769_169619_000015_000011	train-clean-360	Oh that s a collection to end collections 
2769_169619_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 By the way Humphrey Goode showed me a pair of big ball butt wheel locks all covered with ivory inlay Rand mentioned 
2769_169619_000017_000000	train-clean-360	Gresham laughed heartily 
2769_169619_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 Aren t they the damnedest ever seen though he asked 
2769_169619_000017_000002	train-clean-360	 Made in Germany about eighteen seventy or eighty about the time arms collecting was just getting out of the family heirloom stage wouldn t you say 
2769_169619_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 I d say made in Japan about nineteen twenty Rand replied 
2769_169619_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 Remember there were a couple of small human figures on each pistol a knight and a huntsman Did you notice that they had slant eyes He stopped laughing and looked at Gresham seriously 
none	none	Just how much more of that sort of thing do you think I m going to have to weed out of the collection before I can offer it for sale he asked 
2769_169619_000019_000000	train-clean-360	Gresham shook his head 
2769_169619_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 They re all 
2769_169619_000019_000002	train-clean-360	They were Lane Fleming s one false step 
2769_169619_000019_000003	train-clean-360	Ordinarily Lane was a careful buyer he must have let himself get hypnotized by all that ivory and gold and all that documentation on crested notepaper 
2769_169619_000019_000004	train-clean-360	You know Fleming s death was an undeserved stroke of luck for Arnold Rivers 
2769_169619_000019_000005	train-clean-360	If he hadn t been killed just when he was he d have run Rivers out of the old arms business 
none	none	I notice that Rivers isn t advertising in the American Rifleman any more Rand observed
2769_169619_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 No the National Rifle Association stopped his ad and lifted his membership card for good measure Gresham said 
2769_169619_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 Rivers sold a rifle to a collector down in Virginia about three years ago while you were still occupying Germany 
2769_169619_000021_000002	train-clean-360	A fine early flintlock Kentuck that had been made out of a fine late percussion Kentuck by sawing off the breech end of the barrel rethreading it for the breech plug drilling a new vent and fitting the lock with a flint hammer and a pan and frizzen assembly and shortening the fore end to fit 
none	none	Rivers has a gunsmith over at Kingsville one Elmer Umholtz who does all his fraudulent conversions for him 
2769_169619_000021_000004	train-clean-360	I have an example of Umholtz s craftsmanship myself 
2769_169619_000021_000005	train-clean-360	The collector who bought this spurious flintlock spotted what had been done and squawked to the Rifle Association and to the postal authorities 
2769_169619_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Rivers claimed I suppose that he had gotten it from a family that had owned it ever since it was made and showed letters signed D 
2769_169619_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Boone and Davy Crockett to prove it 
2769_169619_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 No he claimed to have gotten it in trade from some wayfaring collector Gresham replied 
none	none	He convinced Uncle Whiskers but the N R A took a slightly dimmer view of the transaction so Rivers doesn t advertise in the Rifleman any more
2769_169619_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Wasn t there some talk about Whitneyville Walker Colts that had been made out of eighteen forty eight Model Colt Dragoons Rand asked 
2769_169619_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Lord yes 
2769_169619_000025_000001	train-clean-360	This fellow Umholtz was practically turning them out on an assembly line for a while 
none	none	Rivers must have sold about ten of them You know Umholtz is a really fine gunsmith I had him build a deer rifle for Dot a couple of years ago Mexican Mauser action Johnson barrel chambered for three hundred Savage Umholtz made the stock and fitted a scope sight it s a beautiful little rifle 
2769_169619_000025_000003	train-clean-360	I hate to see him prostitute his talents the way he does by making these fake antiques for Rivers 
none	none	You know he made one of these mythical heavy forty four six shooters of the sort Colt was supposed to have turned out at Paterson in eighteen thirty nine for Colonel Walker s Texas Rangers you know the model he couldn t find any of in eighteen forty seven when he made the real Walker Colt 
2769_169619_000025_000005	train-clean-360	That story you find in Sawyer s book 
2769_169619_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Why that story s been absolutely disproved Rand said 
none	none	There never was any such revolver
2769_169619_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Not till Umholtz made one Gresham replied 
none	none	Rivers sold it to he named a moving picture bigshot for twenty five hundred dollars His story was that he picked it up in Mexico in nineteen thirty eight traded a thirty eight special to some halfbreed goat herder for it
2769_169619_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 This fellow who bought it now did he see Belden and Haven s Colt book when it came out in nineteen forty 
2769_169619_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes and he was plenty burned up but what could he do 
2769_169619_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Rivers was dug in behind this innocent purchase and sale in good faith Maginot Line of his 
2769_169619_000029_000002	train-clean-360	You know that bastard took me once just one tenth as badly with a fake U S North Cheney Navy flintlock seventeen ninety nine Model that had been made out of a French seventeen seventy seven Model The lawyer muttered obscenely 
none	none	Why didn t you sue hell out of him Rand asked
2769_169619_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 You might not have gotten anything but you d have given him a lot of dirty publicity That s all Fleming was expecting to do about those wheel locks 
2769_169619_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 I m not Fleming 
2769_169619_000031_000001	train-clean-360	He could afford litigation like that I can t 
2769_169619_000031_000002	train-clean-360	I want my money and if I don t get it in cash I m going to beat it out of that dirty little swindler s hide Gresham replied an ugly look appearing on his face 
2769_169619_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 I wouldn t blame you 
none	none	You could find plenty of other collectors who d hold your coat while you were doing it Rand told him Then he inquired idly What sort of a pistol was it that Lane Fleming is supposed to have shot himself with 
2769_169619_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Gresham frowned 
2769_169619_000033_000001	train-clean-360	 I really don t know I didn t see it 
none	none	It s supposed to have been a Confederate Leech Rigdon thirty six you know one of those imitation Colt Navy Models that were made in the South during the Civil War Rand nodded 
2769_169619_000034_000001	train-clean-360	He was familiar with the type 
2769_169619_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 The story is that Fleming found it hanging back of the counter at some roadside lunch stand along with a lot of other old pistols and talked the proprietor into letting it go for a few dollars Gresham continued It was supposed to have been loaded at the time and went off while Fleming was working on it at home He shook his head 
2769_169619_000035_000001	train-clean-360	 I can t believe that Jeff 
2769_169619_000035_000002	train-clean-360	Lane Fleming would know a loaded revolver when he saw one 
2769_169619_000035_000003	train-clean-360	I believe he deliberately shot himself and the family faked the accident and fixed the authorities 
2769_169619_000035_000004	train-clean-360	The police never made any investigation it was handled by the coroner alone 
2769_169619_000035_000005	train-clean-360	And our coroner out in Scott County is eminently fixable if you go about it right a pitiful little nonentity with a tremendous inferiority complex 
2769_169619_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 But good Lord why Rand demanded 
2769_169619_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 I never heard of Fleming having any troubles worth killing himself over 
none	none	Gresham lowered his voice
2769_169619_000037_000001	train-clean-360	 Jeff I m not supposed to talk about this but the fact is that I believe Fleming was about to lose control of the Premix Company he said 
none	none	I have well sources of inside information This is in confidence so don t quote me but certain influences were at work inside the company toward that end He inspected the tip of his cigar and knocked off the ash into the tray at his elbow
2769_169619_000037_000003	train-clean-360	 Lane Fleming s death is on record as accidental Jeff 
2769_169619_000037_000004	train-clean-360	It s been written off as such 
none	none	It would be a great deal better for all concerned if it were left at that CHAPTER five Rand drove slowly through Rosemont the next day refreshing his memory of the place It was one of the many commuters villages strung out for fifty miles along the railroad lines radiating from New Belfast and depended for its support upon a population scattered over a five mile radius at estates and country homes Obviously a planned community it was dominated by a gray walled green roofed railroad station which stood on its passenger platform like a captain in front of four platoons of gray walled green roofed houses and stores aligned along as many converging roads There was a post office uniform with the rest of the buildings an excessive quantity of aluminum trimming dated it somewhere in the middle Andrew W Mellon period There were four gas stations a movie theater and a Woolworth store with a red front that made it look like some painted hussy who had wandered into a Quaker Meeting Over the door of one of the smaller stores Rand saw a black lettered white sign Antiques There was a smoke gray Plymouth coupe parked in front of it Instead of turning onto the road to the Fleming estate he continued along Route nineteen for a mile or so beyond the village until he came to a red brick pseudo Colonial house on the right He pulled to the side of the road and got out turning up the collar of his trench coat The air was raw and damp doubly unpleasant after the recent unseasonable warmth An apathetically persistent rain sogged the seedling dotted old fields on either side and the pine woods beyond and a high ceiling of unbroken dirty gray gave no promise of clearing The mournful hoot of a distant locomotive whistle was the only sound to pierce the silence For a moment Rand stood with his back to the car looking at the gallows like sign that proclaimed this to be the business place of Arnold Rivers Fine Antique and Modern Firearms for the Discriminating Collector The house faced the road with a long side at the left a porch formed a continuation under a deck roof and on the right an ell had been built at right angles extending thirty feet toward the road Although connected to the house by a shed roof which acquired a double pitch and became a gable roof where the ell projected forward it was in effect a separate building with its own front door and its own door path Its floor level was about four feet lower than that of the parent structure A Fibber McGee door chime clanged as Rand entered Closing the door behind him he looked around The room some twenty feet wide and fifty long was lighted by an almost continuous row of casement windows on the right and another on the left for as far as the ell extended beyond the house They were set high a good five feet from lower sill to floor and there was no ceiling the sloping roof was supported by bare timber rafters Racks lined the walls under the windows holding long guns and swords the pistols and daggers and other small items were displayed on a number of long tables In the middle of the room glaring at the front door was a brass four pounder on a ship s carriage a Philippine latanka muzzle tilted upward stood beside it Where the ell joined the house under the shed roof there was a fireplace and a short flight of steps to a landing and a door out of the dwelling and some furniture a davenport three or four deep chairs facing the fire a low cocktail table a cellarette and in the far corner a big desk As Rand went toward the rear a young man rose from one of the chairs laid aside a magazine and advanced to meet him He didn t exactly harmonize with all the lethal array around him he would have looked more at home presiding over an establishment devoted to ladies items His costume ran to pastel shades he had large and soulful blue eyes and prettily dimpled cheeks and his longish blond hair was carefully disordered into a windblown effect Oh good afternoon he greeted Is there anything in particular you re interested in or would you like to just look about Mostly look about Rand said Is mister Rivers in mister Rivers is having luncheon He ll be finished before long if you care to wait Have you ever been here before Not for some time Rand said When I was here last there was a young fellow named Jordan or Gordon or something like that Oh He was before my time The present functionary introduced himself as Cecil Gillis Rand gave his name and shook hands with him Young Gillis wanted to know if Rand was a collector In a small way General pistol collector Rand told him Have you many Colts now There was a whole table devoted to Colts No spurious Whitneyville Walkers after all a dealer can sell just so many of such top drawer rarities before the finger of suspicion begins leveling itself in his direction and Arnold Rivers had long ago passed that point There were several of the commoner percussion models however with lovely perfect bluing that was considerably darker than that applied at the Colt factory during the fifties and sixties of the last century The silver plating on backstraps and trigger guards was perfect too but the naval battle and stagecoach holdup engravings on the cylinders were far from clear in one case completely obliterated The cylinder of one eighteen fifty one Navy bore serial numbers that looked as though they had been altered to conform to the numbers on other parts of the weapon Many of the Colts however were entirely correct and all were in reasonably good condition Rand saw something that interested him and picked it up That isn t a real Colt the exquisite mister Gillis told him It s a Confederate copy a Leech Rigdon So I see I have a Griswold Grier but no Leech Rigdon The Griswold Grier that s the one with the brass frame Cecil Gillis said Surprising how many collectors think all Confederate revolvers had brass frames because of the Griswold Grier and the Spiller Burr That s an unusually fine specimen mister Rand mister Rivers got it sometime in late December or early January from a gentleman in Charleston I understand I believe it had been carried during the Civil War by a member of the former owner s family Rand looked at the tag tied to the trigger guard it was marked in letter code with three different prices That was characteristic of Arnold Rivers s business methods How much does mister Rivers want for this he asked handing the revolver to young Gillis The clerk mentally decoded the three prices and vacillated for a moment over them He had already appraised Rand from his twenty dollar Stetson past his Burberry trench coat to his English hand sewn shoes and placed him in the pay dirt bracket however from some remarks Rand had let drop he decided that this customer knew pistols and probably knew values Why that is sixty dollars mister Rand he said with the air of one conferring a benefaction Maybe he was at that Rand decided prices had jumped like the very devil since the war I ll take it He dug out his billfold and extracted three twenties Nice clean condition clean it up yourself Why no mister Rivers got it like this As I said it s supposed to have been a family heirloom but from the way it s been cared for I would have thought it had been in a collection the clerk replied Shall I wrap it for you Yes if you please Rand followed him to the rear laying aside his coat and hat Gillis got some heavy paper out of a closet and packaged it then hunted through a card file in the top drawer of the desk until he found the card he wanted He made a few notes on it and was still holding it and the sixty dollars when he rejoined Rand by the fire In spite of his effeminate appearance and over refined manner the young fellow really knew arms The conversation passed from Confederate revolvers to the arms of the Civil War in general and they were discussing the changes in tactics occasioned by the introduction of the revolver and the repeating carbine when the door from the house opened and Arnold Rivers appeared on the landing He looked older than when Rand had last seen him His hair was thinner on top and grayer at the temples Never particularly robust he had lost weight and his face was thinner and more hollow cheeked His mouth still had the old curve of supercilious insolence and he was still smoking with the six inch carved ivory cigarette holder which Rand remembered He looked his visitor over carefully from the doorway decided that he was not soliciting magazine subscriptions or selling Fuller brushes and came down the steps As he did he must have recognized Rand he shifted the cigarette holder to his left hand and extended his right mister Rand isn t it he asked I thought I knew you It s been some years since you ve been around here I ve been a lot of places in the meantime Rand said You were here last in October forty one weren t you Rivers thought for a moment You bought a Highlander then By Alexander Murdoch of Doune wasn t it No Andrew Strahan of Edzel Rand replied Rivers snapped his fingers That s right I sold both of those pistols at about the same time a gentleman in Chicago got the Murdoch The Strahan had a star pierced lobe on the hammer Did you ever get anybody to translate the Gaelic inscription on the barrel You ve a memory like Jim Farley Rand flattered The inscription was the clan slogan of the Camerons something like Sons of the hound come and get flesh I won t attempt the original mister Rand just bought six thousand five hundred twenty four the Leech Rigdon thirty six Gillis interjected handing Rivers the card and the money Rivers looked at both saw how much Rand had been taken for and nodded A nice item he faintly praised as though anything selling for less than a hundred dollars was so much garbage Considering the condition in which Confederate arms are usually found it s really first rate I think you ll like it mister Rand The telephone rang Cecil Gillis answered it listened for a moment and then said For you mister Rivers long distance from Milwaukee Rivers s face lit with the beatific smile of a cat at a promising mouse hole Ah excuse me mister Rand He crossed to the desk picked up the phone and spoke into it This is Arnold Rivers he said much as Edward Murrow used to say This is London The telephone sputtered for a moment Ah yes indeed mister Verral Quite well I thank you And you No it hasn t been sold yet Do you wish me to ship it to you On approval certainly Of course it s an original flintlock I didn t list it as re altered did I No not at all the only replacement is the small spring inside the patchbox Yes the rifling is excellent Of course I ll ship it at once Good by mister Verral He hung up and turned to his hireling fairly licking his chops Cecil mister Verral in Milwaukee whose address we have has just ordered six thousand two hundred eighty eight the F Zorger flintlock Kentuck Will you please attend to it Right away mister Rivers Gillis went to one of the racks under the windows and selected a long flintlock rifle carrying it out the door at the rear I issued a list a few days ago Rivers told Rand When Cecil comes back I ll have him get you a copy I ve been receiving calls ever since this is the twelfth long distance call since Tuesday Business must be good Rand commented I understand you ve offered to buy the Lane Fleming collection For ten thousand dollars Where did you hear that Rivers demanded looking up from the drawer in which he was filing the card on the Leech Rigdon From missus Fleming Rand released a puff of pipe smoke and watched it draw downward into the fireplace I ve been retained to handle the sale of that collection naturally I d know who was offering how much Rivers s eyes narrowed He came around the desk loading another cigarette into his holder And just why might I ask did missus Fleming think it in order to employ a detective in a matter like that he wanted to know Rand let out more smoke She didn t She employed an arms expert a Colonel Jefferson Davis Rand U S A O R C who is a well known contributor to the American Rifleman and the Infantry Journal and Antiques and the old Gun Report You ve read some of his articles I believe Then you re not making an investigation What in the world is there to investigate Rand asked I m just selling a lot of old pistols for the Fleming estate I thought Fred Dunmore was doing that So did Fred You re both wrong though I am He got out Goode s letter of authorization and handed it to Rivers who read it through twice before handing it back You see anything in that about Fred Dunmore or any of the other relatives in law he asked Well I didn t understand I m glad to know what the situation really is Rivers frowned I thought you were making some kind of an investigation and as I m the only party making any serious offer to buy those pistols I wanted to know what there was to investigate Do you consider ten thousand dollars to be a serious offer Rand asked And aren t you forgetting Stephen Gresham and his friends Oh those people Rivers scoffed mister Rand you certainly don t expect them to be able to handle anything like this do you Well the banks speak well of them Rand replied Some of them have good listings in Dun Bradstreet s too Well so do I Rivers reported I can top any offer that crowd makes What do you expect to get out of them anyhow I haven t talked price with them yet A lot more than ten thousand dollars anyhow Rivers forced a laugh Now mister Rand That was just an opening offer I thought Fred Dunmore was handling the collection He grimaced What do you think it s really worth Rand shrugged It probably has a dealer s piece by piece list value of around seventy thousand I m not nuts enough to expect anything like that in a lump sum but please let s not mention ten thousand dollars in this connection any more That s on the order of Lawyer Marks bidding seventy five cents for Uncle Tom it s only good for laughs Well how much more than that do you think Gresham and his crowd will offer I haven t talked price with them yet Rand repeated I mean to as soon as I can Well you get their offer and I ll top it Rivers declared I m willing to go as high as twenty five thousand for that collection they won t go that high Although he just managed not to show it Rand was really surprised Even a consciousness of abstracting had not prepared him for the shock of hearing Arnold Rivers raise his own offer to something resembling an acceptable figure A good case he reflected could be made of that for the actuality of miracles He rose picking up his trench coat Well That s something like it now he said I ll see you later I don t know how long it s going to take me to get a list prepared and circularize the old arms trade I should hear from everybody who s interested in a few weeks You can be sure I ll keep your offer in mind He slipped into the coat and put on his hat and then picked up the package containing the Confederate revolver Rivers had risen too he was watching Rand nervously When Rand tucked the package under his arm and began drawing on his gloves Rivers cleared his throat mister Rand I m dreadfully sorry he began but I ll have to return your money and take back that revolver It should not have been sold He got Rand s sixty dollars out of his pocket as though he expected it to catch fire and held it out Rand favored him with a display of pained surprise Why I can t do that he replied I bought this revolver in good faith and you accepted payment and were satisfied with the transaction The sale s been made now Rivers seemed distressed It was probably the first time he had ever been on the receiving end of that routine and he didn t like it Now you re being unreasonable mister Rand he protested Look here I ll give you seventy five dollars credit on anything else in the shop You certainly can t find fault with an offer like that I don t want anything else in the shop I want this revolver you sold me Rand gave him a look of supercilious insolence that was at least a two hundred per cent improvement on Rivers at his most insolent You know I ll begin to acquire a poor idea of your business methods before long he added Rivers laughed ruefully Well to tell the truth I just remembered a customer of mine who specializes in Confederate arms who would pay me at least eighty for that item he admitted I thought Rand shook his head I have a special fondness for Confederate arms myself One of my grandfathers was in Mosby s Rangers and the other was with Barksdale to say nothing of about a dozen great uncles and so on Well you re entirely within your rights mister Rand Rivers conceded I should apologize for trying to renege on a sale but Well I hope to see you again soon He followed Rand to the door shaking hands with him Don t forget I m willing to pay anything up to twenty five thousand for the Fleming collection CHAPTER six The Fleming butler Walters Rand remembered Gladys Fleming having called him became apologetic upon learning who the visitor was Forgive me Colonel Rand but I m afraid I must put you to some inconvenience sir he said You see we have no chauffeur at present and I don t drive very well myself Would you object to putting up your own car sir The garage is under the house at the rear just follow the driveway around I ll go through the house and meet you there for the luggage I m dreadfully sorry to put you to the trouble but Oh that s all right Rand comforted him Just as soon do it myself now anyhow I expect to be in and out with the car while I m here and I d better learn the layout of the garage now You may back in sir or drive straight in and back out the butler told him One way s about as easy as the other Rand returned to his car driving around the house A row of doors opened out of the basement garage Walters who must have gone through the house on the double was waiting for him Having what amounted to a conditioned reflex to park his car so that he could get it out as fast as possible he cut over to the right jockeyed a little and backed in There were already two cars in the garage a big maroon Packard sedan and a sand colored Packard station wagon standing side by side Rand put his Lincoln in on the left of the sedan Bags in the luggage compartment it isn t locked he told the butler making sure that the glove compartment where he had placed the Leech Rigdon revolver was locked As he got out the servant went to the rear of the car and took out the Gladstone and the B four bag Rand had brought with him If you don t mind entering the house from the rear sir we can go up those steps there and through the rear hall the butler suggested almost as though he were making some indecent and criminal proposal Rand told him to forget the protocol and lead the way The butler picked up the bags and conducted him up a short flight of concrete steps to a landing and a door opening into a short hall above An open door from this gave access to a longer hall stretching to the front of the house and there was a third door closed which probably led to the servants domain Rand followed his guide through the open door and into the long hall which passed under an arch to extend to the front door There was a door on either side about midway to the arch under the front stairway the one on the right was the dining room Walters explained and the one on the left was the library He seemed to be still suffering from the ignominy of admitting a house guest through any but the main portal Emerging into the front hallway he put down the bags took Rand s hat and coat and laid them on top of the luggage and then went to an open doorway on the right standing in it and coughing delicately before announcing that Colonel Rand was here Gladys Fleming wearing a pale blue frock came forward as Rand entered the parlor her hand extended The two other women in the big parlor remained motionless They would be the sisters Geraldine Varcek and Nelda Dunmore Rand didn t wonder that they resented Gladys so bitterly economic considerations aside girls seldom enthuse over a stepmother so near their own age who is so much more beautiful Good afternoon Colonel Rand Gladys said This is missus Varcek She indicated a very pale blonde who sat slumped in a deep chair beside a low cocktail table a highball in her hand And missus Dunmore She was the brunette with the full bust and hips in the short black skirt and the tight white sweater who was standing by the fireplace H lo The blonde Geraldine smiled shyly at him She had big blue eyes and delicately tinted rose petal lips that seemed to be trying not to laugh at some private joke She wasn t exactly blotto but she had evidently laid a good foundation for a first class jag After all it was only two thirty in the afternoon The other sister Nelda didn t say anything She merely stood and stared at Rand distrustfully Rand doubted that she ordinarily gave men the hostile eye The full dark red lips the lush figure the way she draped it against the side of the fireplace to catch the ruddy light on her more interesting curves and bulges there was a bimbo just made to be leered at and she probably resented it like hell if she weren t Rand gave them a general good afternoon then turned to Gladys I had a talk with Goode yesterday afternoon he said I have his authorization to handle all the details As soon as I get an itemized list I ll circularize dealers and other possible buyers and ask for offers Is that all Nelda demanded angrily of Gladys Why Fred s done all that already Is that correct missus Fleming Rand asked for the record I told you yesterday what s been done Gladys replied Fred has talked to one dealer Arnold Rivers There has been no inventory of any sort made mister Rivers is offering us ten thousand dollars Nelda retorted I don t see why you had to bring this Colonel What s his name into it at all You think he can get us a better offer If you do you re crazy Ten thousand dollars for a collection that ought to sell for five times that in Macy s basement Geraldine hooted How much is Rivers slipping Fred on the side Oh go back to your bottle Nelda cried You re too drunk to know what you re talking about They tell me Colonel Rand is a detective too Geraldine continued Maybe he can find out why Fred never talked to Stephen Gresham or Carl Gwinnett or anybody else except this Rivers How much is Fred getting out of Rivers anyhow My God Geraldine shut up Nelda howled Then she decided to take direct notice of Rand s presence Colonel Rand I m sorry to say that in her present condition my sister doesn t know what she s saying It s bad enough for my stepmother to bring an outsider into what s obviously a family matter but when my sister begins making these ridiculous accusations What s ridiculous about them Geraldine demanded dumping another two ounces of whiskey into her glass and freshening it with the siphon I think Rivers s offering ten thousand dollars for the collection and Fred s thinking we d accept it are the only ridiculous things about it That s rather what I told Rivers this afternoon Rand put in He seemed a bit upset about my being brought into this too but he finally admitted that he was willing to pay up to twenty five thousand dollars for the collection and if he buys it that s exactly what it s going to cost him What Nelda fairly screamed Her hands opened and closed spasmodically she was using a dark red nail tint that made Rand think of blood dripping talons mister Arnold Rivers told me this afternoon and I quote I m willing to pay up to twenty five thousand dollars for that collection unquote Rand said And I can tell you now that twenty five thousand dollars is just what he will pay for it unless I can find somebody who s willing to pay more which is not at all improbable H ray Geraldine waved her glass and toasted Rand with it And twenty five G ain t hay brother Gladys smiled quickly at Rand then turned to Nelda Now I hope you see why I thought it wise to bring in somebody who knows something about old arms she said Nelda evidently saw there was apparently nothing stupid about her And Fred was going to take a miserable ten thousand dollars The way she said it ten thousand sounded like a fairly generous headwaiter s tip Did Rivers actually tell you he d pay twenty five Rand gave as nearly verbatim as possible his conversation with the dealer And he can afford it too he finished He can make a nice profit on the collection at that figure My God do you mean the pistols are worth more than that even she wanted to know aghast Certainly if you re a dealer with an established business and customers all over the country and want to take five or six years to make your profit Rand replied If you aren t and want your money in a hurry no That s why I was against turning the collection over to Gwinnett on a commission basis Gladys said It would take him five years to get everything sold Nelda left the fireplace and advanced toward Rand Colonel I owe you an apology she said I had no idea Father s pistols were worth anywhere near that much I don t suppose Fred did either She frowned Wait till she gets Fred alone Rand thought I d hate to be in his spot You say you re acting on Humphrey Goode s authority That s right I ll negotiate the sale but the money will be paid directly to him for distribution according to the terms of your father s will Rand got out Goode s letter and handed it to Nelda She read it carefully I see She seemed greatly relieved she was looking at Rand now as she was accustomed to look at men particularly handsome six footers who were broad across the shoulders and narrow at the hips and resembled King Charles II She was probably wondering if Rand was equal to Old Rowley in another important respect I didn t understand I thought A dirty look aimed at Gladys explained what she had thought Then her glance fell on the bottle and siphon on the table beside Geraldine s chair and she changed the subject by inquiring if Colonel Rand mightn t like a drink Well let s go up to the gunroom Gladys suggested We can have our drink up there while Colonel Rand s looking at the pistols Coming with us Geraldine Geraldine rose not too steadily her glass still in her hand and took Rand s left arm Gladys seeing Nelda moving in on the detective s right took his other arm Nelda was barely successful in suppressing a look of murderous anger The double doorway into the hall was just wide enough for Rand and his two flankers to pass through Nelda had to fall in a couple of paces rear of center and wasn t able to come up into line until they were in the hall upstairs There s the gunroom Gladys pointed And that s your room over there As she spoke Walters came out of the doorway she had indicated Your bags are unpacked sir he reported Then he told Rand where he would find his things and where the bath was There was a brief discussion of drinks The butler received his instructions and went down the stairway Rand broke up the feminine formation around him and ushered the ladies ahead of him into the gunroom It was much as he remembered it from his visit of two years before There was a desk in one corner and back of it a short workbench and tool cabinet There was a long table in the middle of the room its top covered with green baize upon which many flat rectangular boxes of hardwood rested some walnut some rosewood some quartered oak Each would contain a pistol or pair of pistols with cleaning and loading tools In the corner farthest from the desk he saw the head of the spiral stairway from the library below mentioned by Gladys Fleming There were ashstands and a couple of cocktail tables and a number of chairs and the old maple cobbler s bench on which Lane Fleming had died The only books in the room were in a small case over the workbench they were all arms books Then he looked at the walls On both ends and on the long inside wall the pistols hung hundreds and hundreds of them the cream of a lifetime s collecting Horizontal white painted boards had been fixed to the walls about four feet from the floor and similar boards had been placed five feet above them Between narrow vertical strips as wide as a lath but twice as thick were set Rows of pistols were hung the barrels horizontal on pairs of these strips with screwhooks at grip and muzzle There were about a hundred such vertical rows of pistols Rand was still looking at them when the butler brought in the drinks when Gladys told the servant that that would be all he went out rather reluctantly by the spiral stairs to the library Well what do you think of them Colonel Rand Gladys asked Rand tasted his whiskey and looked around It s one of the finest collections in the country he said I may even be able to find somebody who ll top Rivers s offer but don t be disappointed if I don t By the way did anybody help mister Fleming keep this stuff clean The room seems dry but even so they d need an occasional wiping off Oh Walters was always in here going over the pistols Nelda said He s been in here every day lately I wonder if you could spare him to help me a little I ll need somebody who knows his way around here at first Why of course Gladys agreed He isn t very busy in the mornings or in the afternoons till close to dinner time Are you going to start work today I ll have to I m going to see Stephen Gresham and his associates this evening and I ll want to know what I m talking about They spent about fifteen minutes over their drinks talking about the collection Rand and Gladys did most of the talking in spite of Nelda s best efforts to monopolize the conversation Geraldine after a few minutes retired into her private world and only roused herself when her sister and stepmother were about to leave When they went out Gladys promised to send Walters up directly Rand heard her speaking to him at the foot of the main stairway CHAPTER seven When Walters entered Rand had his pipe lit and was walking slowly around the room laying out the work ahead of him Roughly the earliest pieces were on the extreme left on the short north wall of the room and the most recent ones on the right at the south end This was of course only relatively true the pistols seemed to have been classified by type in vertical rows and chronologically from top to bottom in each row The collection seemed to consist of a number of intensely specialized small groups with a large number of pistols of general types added For instance about midway on the long east wall there were some thirty odd all metal pistols from wheel lock to percussion There was a collection of U S Martials with two rows of the regulation pistols flintlock and percussion of foreign governments placed on the left and the collection of Colts on the right After them came the other types of percussion revolvers and the later metallic cartridge types It was an arrangement which made sense from the arms student s point of view and Rand decided that it would make sense to the dealers and museums to whom he intended sending lists He would save time by listing them as they were hung on the walls Then there were the cases between the windows on the west wall containing the ammunition collection examples of every type of fixed pistol ammunition and the collection of bullet molds and powder flasks and wheel lock spanners and assorted cleaning and loading accessories All that stuff would have to be listed too I beg your pardon sir Walters broke in behind him missus Fleming said that you wanted me Oh yes Rand turned Is this the whole thing What s on the walls here Yes sir There is also a wall case containing a number of modern pistols and revolvers and several rifles and shotguns in the room formerly occupied by mister Fleming but they are not part of the collection and they are now the personal property of missus Fleming I understand that she intends selling at least some of them on her own account Then there is a quantity of ammunition and ammunition components in that closet under the workbench cartridges primed cartridge shells black and smokeless powder cartridge primers percussion caps but they are not part of the collection either I believe missus Fleming wants to sell most of that too Well I ll talk to her about it I may want to buy some of the ammunition for myself Rand said So I only need to bother with what s on the walls in this room By the way did mister Fleming keep any sort of record of his collection A book or a card index or anything like that Why no sir Walters was positive Then he hedged If he did I never saw or heard of anything of the sort mister Fleming knew everything in this room I ve seen him downstairs when somebody would ask him about something close his eyes as though trying to visualize and then give a perfect description of any pistol in the collection Or else he could enumerate all the pistols of a certain type say all the Philadelphia Deringers or all the Allen pepperboxes or all the rim fire Smith Wesson tip back types He had a remarkable memory for his pistols although it was not out of the ordinary otherwise sir Rand nodded Any collector at least any collector who was a serious arms student could do that particularly if he were a good visualizer and kept his stuff in some systematic order At the moment he could have named and described any or all of his own modest collection of two hundred odd pistols and revolvers I was hoping he d kept a record he said A great many collectors do and it would have helped me quite a bit He made up his mind to compile such a record himself when he got back to New Belfast It would be a big help to Carter Tipton when it came time to settle his own estate and a man on whom the Reaper has scored as many near misses as on Jeff Rand should begin to think of such things And how about writing materials And is there a typewriter available There was a cased portable was on the floor beside the workbench Walters showed him which desk drawers contained paper and other things There was Rand noticed a loaded thirty eight Colt Detective Special in the upper right hand desk drawer And these phones the butler continued indicating them This one is a private outside phone it doesn t connect with any other in the house The other is an extension It has a buzzer the outside phone has a regular bell Rand thanked him for the information Then picking up a note pad and pencil he started on the left of the collection meaning to make a general list and rough approximation of value for use in talking to Gresham s friends that evening Tomorrow he would begin on the detailed list for use in soliciting outside offers Twenty five wheel locks four heavy South German dags two singles and a pair three Saxon pistols with sharply dropped grips a pair and one single five French and Italian sixteenth century pistols a pair of small pocket or sash pistols a pair of French petronels and an extremely long seventeenth century Dutch pistol with an ivory covered stock and a carved ivory Venus head for a pommel eight seventeenth century French Italian and Flemish pistols Rand noted them down and was about to pass on then he looked sharply at one of them It was nothing out of the ordinary as wheel locks go a long Flemish weapon of about sixteen forty the type used by the Royalist cavalry in the English Civil War There were two others almost like it but this one was in simply appalling condition The metal was rough with rust and apparently no attempt had been made to clean it in a couple of centuries There was a piece cracked out of the fore end the ramrod was missing as was the front ramrod thimble both the trigger guard and the butt cap were loose and when Rand touched the wheel it revolved freely if sluggishly betraying a broken spring or chain The vertical row next to it seemed to be all snaphaunces but among them Rand saw a pair of Turkish flintlocks Not even good Turkish flintlocks a pair of the sort of weapons hastily thrown together by native craftsmen or imported ready made from Belgium for bazaar sale to gullible tourists Among the fine examples of seventeenth century Brescian gunmaking above and below it these things looked like a pair of Dogpatchers in the Waldorf s Starlight Room Rand contemplated them with distaste then shrugged After all they might have had some sentimental significance say souvenirs of a pleasantly remembered trip to the Levant A few rows farther on among some exceptionally fine flintlocks all of which pre dated seventeen hundred he saw one of those big Belgian navy pistols circa eighteen hundred of the sort once advertised far and wide by a certain old army goods dealer for six dollars ninety five cents This was a particularly repulsive specimen of its breed grimy with hardened dust and gummed oil maculated with yellow surface rust the brasswork green with corrosion It was impossible to shrug off a thing like that From then on Rand kept his eyes open for similar incongruities They weren t hard to find There was a big army pistol of Central European origin and in abominable condition among a row of fine multi shot flintlocks Multi shot Stephen Gresham had mentioned an Elisha Collier flintlock revolver It wasn t there It should be hanging about where this post Napoleonic German thing was There was no Hall breech loader either but there was a dilapidated old Ketland There were many such interlopers among the U S Martials an English ounce ball cavalry pistol a French seventeen seventy seven and a French seventeen seventy three a couple more six dollars ninety five cents bargain counter specials a miserable altered S North eighteen sixteen Among the Colts there was some awful junk including a big Spanish hinge frame forty four and a Belgian imitation of a Webley R I C Model There weren t as many Paterson Colts as Gresham had spoken of and the Whitneyville Walker was absent It went on like that about a dozen of the best pistols which Rand remembered having seen from two years ago were gone and he spotted at least twenty items which the late Lane Fleming wouldn t have hung in his backyard privy if he d had one Well that was to be expected The way these pistols were arranged the absence of one from its hooks would have been instantly obvious So as the good stuff had moved out these disreputable changelings had moved in You had rather a shocking experience here in mister Fleming s death Rand said over his shoulder to the butler Oh yes indeed sir Walters seemed relieved that Rand had broken the silence A great loss to all of us sir And so unexpected He didn t seem averse to talking about it and went on at some length His story closely paralleled that of Gladys Fleming mister Varcek called the doctor immediately he said Then mister Dunmore pointed out that the doctor would be obliged to notify either the coroner or the police so he called mister Goode the family solicitor That was about twenty minutes after the shot mister Goode arrived directly he was here in about ten minutes I must say sir I was glad to see him to tell the truth I had been afraid that the authorities might claim that mister Fleming had shot himself deliberately Somebody else doesn t like the smell of that accident Rand thought Aloud he said mister Goode lives nearby then I take it Oh yes sir You can see his house from these windows Over here sir Rand looked out the window The rain soaked lawn of the Fleming residence ended about a hundred yards to the west beyond it an orchard was beginning to break into leaf and beyond the orchard and another lawn stood a half timbered Tudor style house somewhat smaller than the Fleming place A path led down from it to the orchard and another led from the orchard to the rear of the house from which Rand looked Must be comforting to know your lawyer s so handy he commented And what do you think Walters Are you satisfied in your own mind that mister Fleming was killed accidentally The servant looked at him seriously No sir I m not he replied I ve thought about it a great deal since it happened sir and I just can t believe that mister Fleming would have that revolver and start working on it without knowing that it was loaded That just isn t possible if you ll pardon me sir And I can t understand how he would have shot himself while removing the charges The fact is when I came up here at quarter of seven to call him for cocktails he had the whole thing apart and spread out in front of him The butler thought for a moment I believe mister Dunmore had something like that in mind when he called mister Goode Well what happened Rand asked Did the coroner or the doctor choke on calling it an accident Oh no sir there was no trouble of any sort about that You see doctor Yardman called the coroner as soon as he arrived but mister Goode was here already He d come over by that path you saw to the rear of the house and in through the garage which was open since missus Dunmore was out with the coupe They all talked it over for a while and the coroner decided that there would be no need for any inquest and the doctor wrote out the certificate That was all there was to it Rand looked at the section of pistol rack devoted to Colts Which one was it he asked Oh it s not here sir Walters replied The coroner took it away with him And hasn t returned it yet Well he has no business keeping it It s part of the collection and belongs to the estate Yes sir If I may say so I thought it was a bit high handed of him taking it away myself but it wasn t my place to say anything about it Well I ll make it mine If that revolver s what I m told it is it s too valuable to let some damned county seat politician walk off with A thought occurred to him And if I find that he s disposed of it this county s going to need a new coroner at least till the present incumbent gets out of jail The buzzer of the extension phone went off like an annoyed rattlesnake Walters scooped it up spoke into it listened for a moment and handed it to Rand For you sir missus Fleming Colonel Rand Carl Gwinnett the commission dealer I told you about is here Gladys told him Do you want to talk to him Why yes Do I understand now that you and the other ladies want cash and don t want the collection peddled off piecemeal All right send him up I ll talk to him A few minutes later a short compact looking man of forty odd entered the gunroom shifting a brief case to his left hand and extending his right Rand advanced to meet him and shook hands with him You re Colonel Rand Enjoyed your articles in the Rifleman he said missus Fleming tells me you re handling the sale of the collection for the estate That s right mister Gwinnett missus Fleming tells me you re interested Yes Originally I offered to sell the collection for her on a commission basis but she didn t seem to care for the idea and neither do the other ladies They all want spot cash in a lump sum Yes missus Fleming herself might have been interested in your proposition if she d been sole owner You could probably get more for the collection even after deducting your commission than I ll be able to but the collection belongs to the estate and has to be sold before any division can be made Yes I see that Well how much would the estate or you consider a reasonable offer Sit down mister Gwinnett Rand invited What would you consider a reasonable offer yourself We re not asking any specific price we re just taking bids as it were Well how much have you been offered to date Well we haven t heard from everybody In fact we haven t put out a list or solicited offers except locally as yet But one gentleman has expressed a willingness to pay up to twenty five thousand dollars Gwinnett s face expressed polite skepticism Colonel Rand he protested You certainly don t take an offer like that seriously I think it was made seriously Rand replied A respectable profit could be made on the collection even at that price Gwinnett s eyes shifted over the rows of horizontal barrels on the walls He was almost visibly wrestling with mental arithmetic and at the same time trying to keep any hint of his notion of the collection s real value out of his face Well I doubt if I could raise that much he said Might I ask who s making this offer You might I m afraid I couldn t tell you You wouldn t want me to publish your own offer broadcast would you I think I can guess If I m right don t hold your head in a tub of water till you get it Gwinnett advised Making a big offer to scare away competition is one thing and paying off on it is another I ve seen that happen before you know Fact is there s one dealer not far from here who makes a regular habit of it He ll make some fantastic offer and then when everybody s been bluffed out he ll start making objections and finding faults and before long he ll be down to about a quarter of his original price The practice isn t unknown Rand admitted I ll bet you don t have this twenty five thousand dollar offer on paper over a signature Gwinnett pursued Well here He opened his brief case and extracted a sheet of paper handing it to Rand You can file this I ll stand back of it Rand looked at the typed and signed statement to the effect that Carl Gwinnett agreed to pay the sum of fifteen thousand dollars for the Lane Fleming pistol collection in its entirety within thirty days of date That was an average of six dollars a pistol There had been a time not too long ago when a pistol collection with an average value of six dollars particularly one as large as the Fleming collection had been something unusual For one thing arms values had increased sharply in the meantime For another Lane Fleming had kept his collection clean of the two dollar items which dragged down so many collectors average values Except for the two dozen odd mysterious interlopers there wasn t a pistol in the Fleming collection that wasn t worth at least twenty dollars and quite a few had values expressible in three figures Well your offer is duly received and filed mister Gwinnett Rand told him folding the sheet and putting it in his pocket This is better than an unwitnessed verbal statement that somebody is willing to pay twenty five thousand I ll certainly bear you in mind You can show that to Arnold Rivers if you want to Gwinnett said See how much he s willing to commit himself to over his signature CHAPTER eight Pre dinner cocktails in the library seemed to be a sort of household rite a self imposed Truce of Bacchus before the resumption of hostilities in the dining room It lasted from six forty five to seven everybody sipped Manhattans and kept quiet and listened to the radio newscast The only new face to Rand was Fred Dunmore s It was a smooth pinkly shaven face decorated with octagonal rimless glasses an entirely unremarkable face the face of the type that used to be labeled Babbitt The corner of Rand s mind that handled such data subconsciously filed his description forty five to fifty one eighty five feet eight hair brown and thinning eyes blue To this he added the Rotarian button on the lapel and the small gold globule on the watch chain that testified that when his age and weight had been considerably less Dunmore had played on somebody s basketball team At that time he had probably belonged to the Y M C A and had thought that Mussolini was doing a splendid job in Italy that H L Mencken ought to be deported to Russia and that Prohibition was here to stay At company sales meetings he probably radiated an aura of synthetic good fellowship As Rand followed Walters down the spiral from the gunroom the radio commercial was just starting and Geraldine was asking Dunmore where Anton was Oh you know Dunmore told her impatiently He had to go to Louisburg to that Medical Association meeting he s reading a paper about the new diabetic ration He broke off as Rand approached and was introduced by Gladys who handed both men their cocktails Then the news commentator greeted them out of the radio and everybody absorbed the day s news along with their Manhattans After the broadcast they all crossed the hall to the dining room where hostilities began almost before the soup was cool enough to taste I don t see why you women had to do this Dunmore huffed Rivers has made us a fair offer Bringing in an outsider will only give him the impression that we lack confidence in him Well won t that be just too too bad Geraldine slashed at him We mustn t ever hurt dear mister Rivers s feelings like that Let him have the collection for half what it s worth but never never let him think we know what a God damned crook he is Dunmore evidently didn t think that worth dignifying with an answer Doubtless he expected Nelda to launch a counter offensive as a matter of principle If he did he was disappointed Well Nelda demanded What did you want us to do give the collection away You don t understand Dunmore told her You ve probably heard somebody say what the collection s worth and you never stopped to realize that it s only worth that to a dealer who can sell it item by item You can t expect We can expect a lot more than ten thousand dollars Nelda retorted In fact we can expect more than that from Rivers Colonel Rand was talking to Rivers this afternoon Colonel Rand doesn t have any confidence in Rivers at all and he doesn t care who knows it You were talking to Arnold Rivers this afternoon about the collection Dunmore demanded of Rand That s right Rand confirmed I told him his ten thousand dollar offer was a joke Stephen Gresham and his friends can top that out of one pocket Finally he got around to admitting that he s willing to pay up to twenty five thousand I don t believe it Dunmore exclaimed angrily Rivers told me personally that neither he nor any other dealer could hope to handle that collection profitably at more than ten thousand And you believed that Nelda demanded And you re a business man My God He s probably a good one as long as he sticks to pancake flour Geraldine was generous enough to concede But about guns he barely knows which end the bullet comes out at Ten thousand was probably his idea of what we d think the pistols were worth Dunmore ignored that and turned to Rand Did Arnold Rivers actually tell you he d pay twenty five thousand dollars for the collection he asked I can t believe that he d raise his own offer like that He didn t raise his offer I threw it out and told him to make one that could be taken seriously Rand repeated as closely as he could his conversation with the arms dealer When he had finished Dunmore was frowning in puzzled displeasure And you think he s actually willing to pay that much Yes I do If he handles them right he can double his money on the pistols inside of five years I doubt if you realize how valuable those pistols are You probably defined mister Fleming s collection as a hobby and therefore something not to be taken seriously And aside from the actual profit the prestige of handling this collection would be worth a good deal to Rivers as advertising I haven t the least doubt that he can raise the money or that he s willing to pay it Dunmore was still frowning Maybe he hated being proved wrong in front of the women of the family And you think Gresham and his friends will offer enough to force him to pay the full amount Rand laughed and told him to stop being naive He s done that himself and what s more he knows it When he told me he was willing to go as high as twenty five thousand he fixed the price Unless somebody offers more which isn t impossible But maybe he s just bluffing Dunmore seemed to be following Gwinnett s line of thought After he s bluffed Gresham s crowd out maybe he ll go back to his original ten thousand offer Fred please stop talking about that ten thousand dollars Geraldine interrupted How much did Rivers actually tell you he d pay Twenty five thousand like he did Colonel Rand Dunmore turned in his chair angrily Now look here he shouted There s a limit to what I ve got to take from you He stopped short as Nelda beside him moved slightly and his words ended in something that sounded like a smothered moan Rand suspected that she had kicked her husband painfully under the table Then Walters came in with the meat course and firing ceased until the butler had retired By the way Rand tossed into the conversational vacuum that followed his exit does anybody know anything about a record mister Fleming kept of his collection Why no can t say I do Dunmore replied promptly evidently grateful for the change of subject You mean like an inventory Oh Fred you do Nelda told him impatiently You know that big gray book Father kept all his pistols entered in It was a gray ledger with a black leather back Gladys said He kept it in the little bookcase over the workbench in the gunroom I ll look for it Rand said Sure it s still there It would be a big help to me The rest of the dinner passed in relative tranquillity The conversation proceeded in fairly safe channels Dunmore was anxious to avoid any further reference to the sum of ten thousand dollars when Gladys induced Rand to talk about his military experiences he lapsed into preoccupied silence Several times Geraldine and Nelda aimed halfhearted feline swipes at one another more out of custom than present and active rancor The women seemed to have erected a temporary tri partite Entente more or less Cordiale Finally the meal ended and the diners drifted away from the table Rand went to his room for a few moments then went to the gunroom to get the notes he had made Fred Dunmore was using the private phone as he entered Well never mind about that now he was saying We ll talk about it when I see you Yes of course so am I Well say about eleven Be seeing you He hung up and turned to Rand More God damned union trouble he said It s enough to make a saint lose his religion Our factory hands are organized in the C I O and our warehouse sales and shipping personnel are in the A F of L and if they aren t fighting the company they re fighting each other Now they have some damn kind of a jurisdictional dispute I don t know what this country s coming to He glared angrily through his octagonal glasses for a moment Then his voice took on an ingratiating note Look here Colonel I just didn t understand the situation until you explained it I hope you aren t taking anything that sister in law of mine said seriously She just blurts out the first thing that comes into her so called mind why only yesterday she was accusing Gladys of bringing you into this to help her gyp the rest of us And before that Oh forget it Rand dismissed Geraldine with a shrug I know she was talking through a highball glass As far as selling the collection is concerned you just let Rivers sell you a bill of something you hadn t gotten a good look at He s a smart operator and he s crooked as a wagon load of blacksnakes Maybe you never realized just how much money Fleming put into this collection naturally you wouldn t realize how much could be gotten out of it again A lot of this stuff has been here for quite a while and antiques of any kind tend to increase in value Well I want you to know that I m just as glad as anybody if you can get a better price out of him than I could Dunmore smiled ruefully I guess he s just a better poker player than I am Not necessarily He could see your hand and you couldn t see his Rand told him You going to see Gresham and his friends this evening Dunmore asked Well when you get back if you find four cars in the garage counting the station wagon lock up after you ve put your own car away If you find only three then you ll know that Anton Varcek s still out so leave it open for him That s the way we do here last one in locks up CHAPTER nine Rand found another car a smoke gray Plymouth coupe standing on the left of his Lincoln when he went down to the garage Running his car outside and down to the highway he settled down to his regular style of driving a barely legal fifty m p h punctuated by bursts of absolutely felonious speed whenever he found an unobstructed straightaway Entering Rosemont he slowed and went through the underpass at the railroad tracks speeding again when he was clear of the village A few minutes later he was turning into the crushed limestone drive that led up to the buff brick Gresham house A girl met him at the door a cute little redhead in a red striped dress who gave him a smile that seemed to start on the bridge of her nose and lift her whole face up after it She held out her hand to him Colonel Rand she exclaimed I ll bet you don t remember me Sure I do You re Dot Rand said At least I think you are the last time I saw you you were in pigtails And you were only about so high He measured with his hand The last time I was here you were away at school You must be old enough to vote by now I will this fall she replied Come on in you re the first one here Daddy hasn t gotten back from town yet He called and said he d be delayed till about nine In the hall she took his hat and coat and guided him toward the parlor on the right Oh Mother she called Here s Colonel Rand Rand remembered Irene Gresham too an over age dizzy blonde who was still living in the Flaming Youth era of the twenties She was an extremely good egg he liked her very much After all insisting upon remaining an F Scott Fitzgerald character was a harmless and amusing foible and it was no more than right that somebody should try to keep the bright banner of Jazz Age innocence flying in a grim and sullen world He accepted a cigarette shared the flame of his lighter with mother and daughter and submitted to being gushed over and honestly Jeff you get handsomer every year Irene Gresham rattled on Dot doesn t he look just like Clark Gable in Gone with the Wind But then of course Jeff really is a Southerner so The doorbell interrupted this slight non sequitur She broke off rising Sit still Jeff I m just going to see who it is You know we re down to only one servant now and it seems as if it s always her night off or something I don t know honestly what I m going to do She hurried out of the room Voices sounded in the hall a man s and a girl s That s Pierre and Karen Dot said Let s all go up in the gunroom and wait for the others there They went out to meet the newcomers The man was a few inches shorter than Rand with gray eyes that looked startlingly light against the dark brown of his face He wasn t using a cane but he walked with a slight limp Beside him was a slender girl almost as tall as he was with dark brown hair and brown eyes She wore a rust brown sweater and a brown skirt and low heeled walking shoes Irene Gresham went into the introductions the newcomers shook hands with Rand and were advised that the style of address was Jeff rather than Colonel Rand and then Dot suggested going up to the gunroom Irene Gresham said she d stay downstairs she d have to let the others in Have you seen this collection before Pierre Jarrett inquired as he and Rand went upstairs together About two years ago Rand said Stephen had just gotten a cased dueling set by Wilkinson then From the Far West Hobby Shop I think Oh he s gotten a lot of new stuff since then and sold off about a dozen culls and duplicates the former Marine said I ll show you what s new till the others come They reached the head of the stairs and started down the hall to the gunroom in the wing that projected out over the garage Along the way the girls detached themselves for nose powdering Unlike the room at the Fleming home Stephen Gresham s gunroom had originally been something else a nursery or play room or party room There were windows on both long sides which considerably reduced the available wall space and the situation wasn t helped any by the fact that the collection was about thirty per cent long arms Things were pretty badly crowded most of the rifles and muskets were in circular barracks racks away from the walls Here this one s new since you were here Pierre said picking a long musket from one of the racks and handing it to Rand How do you like this one Rand took it and whistled appreciatively Real European matchlock no I never saw that Looks like North Italian say fifteen seventy five to about sixteen hundred That musket Pierre informed him came over on the Mayflower Really or just a gag Rand asked It easily could have The Mayflower Company bought their muskets in Holland from some seventeenth century forerunner of Bannerman s and Europe was full of muskets like this then left over from the wars of the Holy Roman Empire and the French religious wars Yes I suppose all their muskets were obsolete types for the period Pierre agreed Well that s a real Mayflower arm Stephen has the documentation for it It came from the Charles Winthrop Sawyer collection and there were only three ownership changes between the last owner and the Mayflower Company Stephen only paid a hundred dollars for it too That was practically stealing Rand said He carried the musket to the light and examined it closely Nice condition too I wouldn t be afraid to fire this with a full charge right now He handed the weapon back He didn t lose a thing on that deal I should say not I d give him two hundred for it any time Even without the history it s worth that Who buys history anyhow Rand wanted to know The fact that it came from the Sawyer collection adds more value to it than this Mayflower business Past ownership by a recognized authority like Sawyer is a real guarantee of quality and authenticity But history documented or otherwise hell only yesterday I saw a pair of pistols with a wonderful three hundred and fifty year documented history Only not a word of it was true the pistols were made about twenty years ago Those wheel locks Fleming bought from Arnold Rivers Pierre asked God wasn t that a crime I ll bet Rivers bought himself a big drink when Lane Fleming was killed Fleming was all set to hang Rivers s scalp in his wigwam But with Stephen the history does count for something As you probably know he collects arms types that figured in American history Well he can prove that this individual musket was brought over by the Pilgrims so he can be sure it s an example of the type they used But he d sooner have a typical Pilgrim musket that never was within five thousand miles of Plymouth Rock than a non typical arm brought over as a personal weapon by one of the Mayflower Company Oh none of us are really interested in the individual history of collection weapons Rand said You show me a collection that s full of known history arms and I ll show you a collection that s either full of junk or else cost three times what it s worth And you show me a collector who blows money on history and nine times out of ten I ll show you a collector who doesn t know guns I saw one such collection once every item had its history neatly written out on a tag and hung onto the trigger guard The owner thought that the patent dates on Colts were model dates and the model dates on French military arms were dates of fabrication Pierre wrinkled his nose disgustedly God I hate to see a collection all fouled up with tags hung on things he said Or stuck over with gummed labels that s even worse Once in a while I get something with a label pasted on it usually on the stock and after I get it off there s a job getting the wood under it rubbed up to the same color as the rest of the stock Yes I picked up a lovely little rifled flintlock pistol once Rand said American full length curly maple stock really a Kentucky rifle in pistol form Whoever had owned it before me had pasted a slip of paper on the underside of the stock between the trigger guard and the lower ramrod thimble with a lot of crap mostly erroneous typed on it It took me six months to remove the last traces of where that thing had been stuck on What do you collect or don t you specialize Pistols I try to get the best possible specimens of the most important types special emphasis on British arms after seventeen hundred and American arms after eighteen hundred What I m interested in is the evolution of the pistol I have a couple of wheel locks to start with and three miguelet locks and an Italian snaphaunce Then I have a few early flintlocks and a number of mid eighteenth century types and some late flintlocks and percussion types And about twenty Colts and so on through percussion revolvers and early cartridge types to some modern arms including a few World War II arms I see about the same idea Lane Fleming had Pierre said I collect personal combat arms firearms and edge weapons Arms that either influenced fighting techniques or were developed to meet special combat conditions From what you say you re mainly interested in the way firearms were designed and made I m interested in the conditions under which they were used And Adam Trehearne who ll be here shortly collects pistols and a few long arms in wheel lock proto flintlock and early flintlock to seventeen hundred And Philip Cabot collects U S Martials flintlock to automatic and also enemy and Allied Army weapons from all our wars And Colin MacBride collects nothing but Colts Odd how a Scot who s only been in this country twenty years should become interested in so distinctively American a type And I collect anything I can sell at a profit from Chinese matchlocks to tommy guns Karen Lawrence interjected coming into the room with Dot Gresham Pierre grinned Karen is practically a unique specimen herself the only general antique dealer I ve ever seen who doesn t hate the sight of a gun collector That s only because I m crazy enough to want to marry one the girl dealer replied Of all the miserly unscrupulous grasping characters She expressed a doubt that the average gun collector would pay more than ten cents to see his Lord and Savior riding to hounds on a Bren carrier They don t give a hoot whose grandfather owned what and if anything s battered up a little they don t think it looks quaint they think it looks lousy And they ve never heard of inflation they think arms ought still to sell for the sort of prices they brought at the old Mark Field sale back in nineteen eleven What were you looking at Dot asked Rand then glanced at the musket in Pierre s hands Oh Priscilla Karen laughed Dot not only knows everything in the collection she knows it by name Dot show Colonel Rand Hester Prynne Hester coming up Gresham s daughter said catching another musket out of the same rack from which Pierre had gotten the matchlock and passing it over to Rand He grasped the heavy piece approving of the easy instinctive way in which the girl had handled it Look on the barrel she told him On top right at the breech The gun was a flintlock or rather a dog lock sure enough stamped on the breech was the big A of the Company of Workmen Armorers of London the seventeenth century gunmakers guild That s right he nodded That s Hester Prynne all right the first American girl to make her letter There were footsteps in the hall outside and male voices Adam and Colin Pierre recognized them before they entered Both men were past fifty Colin MacBride was a six foot black Highlander black eyes black hair and a black weeping willow mustache from under which a stubby pipe jutted Except when he emptied it of ashes and refilled it it was a permanent fixture of his weather beaten face Trehearne was somewhat shorter and fair his sandy mustache beginning to turn gray at the edges was clipped to micrometric exactness They shook hands with Rand who set Hester back in her place Trehearne took the matchlock out of Pierre s hands and looked at it wistfully Some chaps have all the luck he commented What do you think of it mister Rand Pierre who had made the introductions had respected the detective s present civilian status Or don t you collect long arms I don t collect them but I m interested in anything that ll shoot That s a good one Those things are scarce too Yes You ll find a hundred wheel locks for every matchlock and yet there must have been a hundred matchlocks made for every wheel lock Matchlocks were cheap and wheel locks were expensive MacBride suggested He spoke with the faintest trace of Highland accent Naturally they got better care It would take a Scot to think of that Karen said Now you take a Scot who collects guns and you have something That s only part of it Rand said I believe that by the last quarter of the seventeenth century most of the matchlocks that were lying around had been scrapped and the barrels used in making flintlocks Hester Prynne over there could easily have started her career as a matchlock And then a great many matchlocks went into the West African slave and ivory trade and were promptly ruined by the natives Yes and I seem to recall having seen Spanish and French miguelet muskets that looked as though they had been altered directly from matchlock retaining the original stock and even the original lock plate Trehearne added So have I come to think of it Rand stole a glance at his wrist watch It was nine five he was wishing Stephen Gresham would put in an appearance MacBride and Trehearne joined Pierre and the girls in showing him Gresham s collection evidently they all knew it almost as well as their own After a while Irene Gresham ushered in Philip Cabot He too was past middle age with prematurely white hair and a thin scholarly face According to Hollywood type casting he might have been a professor or a judge or a Boston Brahmin but never a stockbroker Irene Gresham wanted to know what everybody wanted to drink Rand wanted Bourbon and plain water MacBride voted for Jamaica rum Trehearne and Cabot favored brandy and soda and Pierre and the girls wanted Bacardi and Coca Cola And Stephen ll want rye and soda when he gets here Irene said Come on girls let s rustle up the drinks Before they returned Stephen Gresham came in lighting a cigar It was just nine twenty two Well I see everybody s here he said No where s Karen Pierre told him A few minutes later the women returned carrying bottles and glasses when the flurry of drink mixing had subsided they all sat down Let s get the business over first Gresham suggested I suppose you ve gone over the collection already Jeff Yes and first of all I want to know something When was the last that any of you saw it Gresham and Pierre had been in Fleming s gunroom just two days before the fatal accident And can you tell me if the big Whitneyville Colt was still there then Rand asked Or the Rappahannock Forge or the Collier flintlock or the Hall Why of course My God aren t they there now Gresham demanded Rand shook his head And if Fleming still had them two days before he was killed then somebody s been weeding out the collection since Doing it very cleverly too he added You know how that stuff s arranged and how conspicuous a missing pistol would be Well when I was going over the collection I found about two dozen pieces of the most utter trash things Lane Fleming wouldn t have allowed in the house all hanging where some really good item ought to have been He took a paper from his pocket and read off a list of the dubious items interpolating comments on the condition and a list of the real rarities which Gresham had mentioned the day before which were now missing All that good stuff was there the last time I saw the collection Gresham said What do you say Pierre I had the Hall pistol in my hands Pierre said And I remember looking at the Rappahannock Forge Trehearne broke in to ask how many English dog locks there were and if the snaphaunce Highlander and the big all steel wheel lock were still there At the same time Cabot was inquiring about the Springfield eighteen eighteen and the Virginia Manufactory pistols I ll have a complete itemized list in a few days Rand said In the meantime I d like a couple of you to look at the collection and help me decide what s missing I m going to try to catch the thief and then get at the fence through him Think Rivers might have gotten the pistols Gresham asked He s the crookedest dealer I know of He s the crookedest dealer anybody knows of Rand amended The only thing he s a little too anxious to buy the collection for somebody who s just skimmed off the cream Ten thousand dollars isn t much in the way of anxiety Cabot said I d call that a nominal bid to avoid suspicion The dope s changed a little on that Rand brought him up to date Rivers s offer is now twenty five thousand There was a stunned hush followed by a gust of exclamations Guid Lorrd The Scots accent fairly curdled on Colin MacBride s tongue We canna go over that I m afraid not twenty would be about our limit Gresham agreed And with the best items gone He shrugged Pierre and Karen were looking at each other in blank misery their dream of establishing themselves in the arms business had blown up in their faces Oh he s talking through his hat Cabot declared He just hopes we ll lose interest and then he ll buy what s left of the collection for a song Maybe he knows the collection s been robbed Trehearne suggested That would let him out later He d accuse you or the Fleming estate of holding out the best pieces and then offer to take what s left for about five thousand Well that would be presuming that he knows the collection has been robbed Cabot pointed out And the only way he d know that would be if he himself had bought the stolen pistols Well does anybody need a chaser to swallow that Trehearne countered I m bloody sure I don t Karen Lawrence shook her head No he d pay twenty five thousand for the collection just as it stands to keep Pierre and me out of the arms business This end of the state couldn t support another arms dealer and with the reputation he s made for himself he d be the one to go under She stubbed out her cigarette and finished her drink If you don t mind Pierre I think I ll go home I m not feeling very festive myself right now The ex Marine rose and held out his hand to Rand Don t get the idea Jeff that anybody here holds this against you You have your clients interests to look out for Well if this be treason make the most of it Rand said but I hope Rivers doesn t go through with it I d like to see you people get the collection and I d hate to see a lot of nice pistols like that get into the hands of a damned swindler like Rivers Maybe I can catch him with the hot goods on him and send him up for about three to five Oh he s too smart for that Karen despaired He can get away with faking but the dumbest jury in the world would know what receiving stolen goods was and he knows it Dorothy and Irene Gresham accompanied Pierre and Karen downstairs After they had gone Gresham tried not very successfully to inject more life into the party with another round of drinks For a while they discussed the personal and commercial iniquities of Arnold Rivers Trehearne and MacBride who had come together in the latter s car left shortly and half an hour later Philip Cabot rose and announced that he too was leaving You haven t seen my collection since before the war Jeff he said If you re not sleepy why don t you stop at my place and see what s new You re staying at the Flemings my house is along your way about a mile on the other side of the railroad They went out and got into their cars Rand kept Cabot s taillight in sight until the broker swung into his drive and put his car in the garage Rand parked beside the road took the Leech Rigdon out of the glove box and got out slipping the Confederate revolver under his trouser band He was pulling down his vest to cover the butt as he went up the walk and joined his friend at the front door Cabot s combination library and gunroom was on the first floor Like Rand s own his collection was hung on racks over low bookcases on either side of the room It was strictly a collector s collection intensely specialized There were all but a few of the U S regulation single shot pistols a fair representation of secondary types most of the revolvers of the Civil War and all the later revolvers and automatics In addition there were British pistols of the Revolution and eighteen twelve Confederate revolvers a couple of Spanish revolvers of eighteen ninety eight the Lugers and Mausers and Steyers of the first World War and the pistols of all our allies beginning with the French weapons of the Revolution I m having the devil s own time filling in for this last war Cabot said I have a want ad running in the Rifleman and I ve gotten a few that Nambu and that Japanese Model fourteen and the Polish Radom and the Italian Glisenti and that Tokarev and of course the P thirty eight and the Canadian Browning but it s going to take the devil s own time I hope nobody starts another war for a few years till I can get caught up on the last one Rand was looking at the Confederate revolvers Griswold Grier Haiman Brothers Tucker Sherrod Dance Brothers Park Spiller Burr there it was Leech Rigdon He tapped it on the cylinder with a finger Wasn t it one of those things that killed Lane Fleming he asked Leech Rigdon So I m told Cabot hesitated Jeff I saw that revolver not four hours before Fleming was shot Had it in my hands looked it over carefully He shook his head It absolutely was not loaded It was empty and there was rust in the chambers Then how the hell did he get shot Rand wanted to know That I couldn t say I m only telling you how he didn t get shot Here this is how it was It was a Thursday and I d come halfway out from town before I remembered that I hadn t bought a copy of Time so I stopped at Biddle s drugstore in the village for one Just as I was getting into my car outside Lane Fleming drove up and saw me He blew his horn at me and then waved to me with this revolver in his hand I went over and looked at it and he told me he d found it hanging back of the counter at a barbecue stand where the road from Rosemont joins Route twenty two There had been some other pistols with it and I went to see them later but they were all trash The Leech Rigdon had been the only decent thing there and Fleming had talked it out of this fellow for ten dollars He was disgustingly gleeful about it particularly as it was a better specimen than mine Would you know it if you saw it again Rand asked Yes I remember the serials I always look at serials on Confederate arms The highest known serial number for a Leech Rigdon is thirteen ninety three this one was twelve thirty four Rand pulled the thirty six revolver from his pants leg and gave it a quick glance the number was twelve thirty four He handed it to Cabot Is this it he asked Cabot checked the number Yes And I remember this bruise on the left grip Fleming was saying that he was glad it would be on the inside so it wouldn t show when he hung it on the wall He carried the revolver to the desk and held it under the light Why this thing wasn t fired at all he exclaimed I thought that Fleming might have loaded it meaning to target it he had a pistol range back of his house but the chambers are clean He sniffed at it Hoppe s Number Nine he said And I can see traces of partly dissolved rust and no traces of fouling What the devil Jeff It probably hasn t been fired since Appomattox Rand agreed Philip do you think all this didn t know it was loaded routine might be an elaborate suicide build up either before or after the fact Absolutely not There was a trace of impatience in Cabot s voice Lane Fleming wasn t the man to commit suicide I knew him too well ever to believe that I heard a rumor that he was about to lose control of his company Rand mentioned You know how much Premix meant to him That s idiotic Cabot s voice was openly scornful now and he seemed a little angry that Rand should believe such a story as though his confidence in his friend s intelligence had been betrayed Good Lord Jeff where did you ever hear a yarn like that Quote usually well informed sources unquote Well they were unusually ill informed that time Cabot replied Take my word for it there s absolutely nothing in it So it wasn t an accident and it wasn t suicide Rand considered Philip what is the prognosis on this merger of Premix and National Milling Packaging now that Lane Fleming s opposition has been shall we say liquidated Cabot s head jerked up he looked at Rand in shocked surprise My God you don t think he began Jeff are you investigating Lane Fleming s death I was retained to sell the collection Rand stated Now I suppose I ll have to find out who s been stealing those pistols and recover them and jail the thief and the fence But I was not retained to investigate the death of Lane Fleming And I do not do work for which I am not paid he added with mendacious literalness I see Well the merger s going through It won t be official until the sixteenth of May when the Premix stockholders meet but that s just a formality It s all cut and dried and in the bag now Better let me pick you up a little Premix there s still some lying around You ll make a little less than four for one on it I d had that in mind when I asked you about the merger Rand said I have about two thousand with you haven t I He did a moment s mental arithmetic then got out his checkbook Pick me up about a hundred shares he told the broker I ve been meaning to get in on this ever since I heard about it I don t see how you did hear about it Cabot said For obvious reasons it s being kept pretty well under the hat Rand grinned Quote usually well informed sources unquote Not the sources mentioned above Jeff you know this damned thing s worrying me Cabot told him writing a receipt and exchanging it for Rand s check I ve been trying to ignore it but I simply can t Do you really think Lane Fleming was murdered by somebody who wanted to see this merger consummated and who knew that that was an impossibility as long as Fleming was alive Philip I don t know And furthermore I don t give a damn Rand lied If somebody wants me to look into it and pays me my possibly exaggerated idea of what constitutes fair compensation I will And I ll probably come up with Fleming s murderer dead or alive But until then it is simply no epidermis off my scrotum And I advise you to adopt a similar attitude They changed the subject then to the variety of pistols developed and used by the opposing nations in World War II and the difficulties ahead of Cabot in assembling even a fairly representative group of them Rand promised to mail Cabot a duplicate copy of his list of the letter code symbols used by the Nazis to indicate the factories manufacturing arms for them as well as copies of some old wartime Intelligence dope on enemy small arms At a little past one he left Cabot s home and returned to the Fleming residence There were four cars in the garage The Packard sedan had not been moved but the station wagon was facing in the opposite direction The gray Plymouth was in the space from which Rand had driven earlier in the evening and a black Chrysler Imperial had been run in on the left of the Plymouth He put his own car in on the right of the station wagon made sure that the Leech Rigdon was locked in his glove box and closed and locked the garage doors Then he went up into the house through the library and by the spiral stairway to the gunroom The garage had been open he recalled at the time of Lane Fleming s death The availability of such an easy means of undetected ingress and egress threw the suspect field wide open Anybody who knew the habits of the Fleming household could have slipped up to the gunroom while Varcek was in his lab Dunmore was in the bathroom and Gladys and Geraldine were in the parlor As he crossed the hall to his own room Rand was thinking of how narrowly Arnold Rivers had escaped a disastrous lawsuit and criminal action by the death of Lane Fleming CHAPTER ten When Rand came down to breakfast the next morning he found Gladys Nelda and a man whom he decided by elimination must be Anton Varcek already at the table The latter rose as Rand entered and bowed jerkily as Gladys verified the guess with an introduction He was about Rand s own age and height he had a smooth shaven tight mouthed face adorned with bushy eyebrows each of which was almost as heavy as Rand s mustache It was a face that seemed tantalizingly familiar and Rand puzzled for a moment then nodded mentally Of course he had seen a face like that hundreds of times in newsreels and news photos and once in pre war Berlin its living double Rudolf Hess He wondered how much deeper the resemblance went and tried not to let it prejudice him Nelda greeted him with a trowelful of sweetness and a dash of bedroom bait Gladys waved him to a vacant seat at her right and summoned the maid who had been serving breakfast After Rand had indicated his preference of fruit and found out what else there was to eat he inquired where the others were Oh Fred s still dressing he ll be down in a minute Nelda told him And Geraldine won t she never eats with her breakfast Varcek winced slightly at this and shifted the subject by inquiring if Rand were a professional antiques expert No I m a lily pure amateur Rand told him Or was until I took this job I have a collection of my own and I m supposed to be something of an authority My business is operating a private detective agency But you are here only as an arms expert Varcek inquired You are not making any sort of detective investigation That s right Rand assured him This is practically a paid vacation for me First time I ever handled anything like this it s a real pleasure to be working at something I really enjoy for a change Varcek nodded Yes I can understand that My own work for instance I would continue with my research even if I were independently wealthy and any sort of work were unnecessary Tell Colonel Rand what you re working on now Nelda urged Varcek gave a small mirthless laugh Oh Colonel Rand would be no more interested than I would be in his pistols he objected then turned to Rand It is a series of experiments having to do with the chemical nature of life he said Another perfunctory chuckle No I am not trying to re create Frankenstein s monster The fact is I am working with fruit flies Something about heredity Rand wanted to know Varcek laughed again with more amusement So One says Fruit flies and immediately another thinks Heredity It is practically a standard response Only in this case I am investigating the effect of diet changes I use fruit flies because of their extreme adaptability If I find that I am on the right track I shall work with mice next Fred Dunmore mentioned a packaged diabetic ration you d developed Rand mentioned Oh yes Varcek shrugged Yes Something like an Army field ration for diabetics to carry when traveling or wherever proper food may be unobtainable That is for the company soon we put it on the market and make lots of money But this other that is my own private work Dunmore had come in while Varcek was speaking and had seated himself beside his wife Don t let him kid you Colonel he said Anton s just as keen about that dollar as the rest of us I don t know what he s cooking up up there in the attic but I ll give ten to one we ll be selling it in twenty five cent packages inside a year and selling plenty of them Oh and speaking about that dollar how did you make out with Gresham and his friends I didn t They d expected to pay about twenty thousand for the collection Rivers s offer has them stopped And even if they could go over twenty five I think Rivers would raise them He s afraid to let them get the collection Pierre Jarrett and Karen Lawrence intended using their share of it to go into the old arms business in competition with him Uh huh that s smart Dunmore approved It s always better to take a small loss stopping competition than to let it get too big for you You save a damn sight bigger loss later How soon do you think the pistols will be sold Gladys asked Oh in about a month at the outside Rand said continuing to explain what had to be done first Well I m glad of that Varcek commented I never liked those things and after what happened The sooner they can be sold the better Breakfast finally ended and Varcek and Dunmore left for the Premix plant Rand debated for a moment the wisdom of speaking to Gladys about the missing pistols then decided to wait until his suspicions were better verified After a few minutes in the gunroom going over Lane Fleming s arms books on the shelf over the workbench without finding any trace of the book in which he had catalogued his collection he got his hat and coat went down to the garage and took out his car It had stopped raining for the time being the dingy sky showed broken spots like bits of bluing on a badly rusted piece of steel As he got out of his car in front of Arnold Rivers s red brick house he was wondering just how he was going to go about what he wanted to do After all The door of the shop was unlocked and opened with a slow clanging of the door chime but the interior was dark All the shades had been pulled and the lights were out For a moment Rand stood in the doorway adjusting his eyes to the darkness within and wondering where everybody was Then in the path of light that fell inward from the open door he saw two feet in tan shoes toes up at the end of tweed trousered legs on the floor An instant later he stepped inside pulled the door shut after him and was using his pen light to find the electric switch For a second or so after he snapped it nothing happened and then the darkness was broken by the flickering of fluorescent tubes When they finally lit he saw the shape on the floor arms outflung the inverted rifle above it For a seemingly long time he stood and stared at the grotesquely transfixed body of Arnold Rivers The dead man lay on his back not three feet beyond the radius of the door in a pool of blood that was almost dried and gave the room a sickly sweet butchershop odor Under the back of Rand s hand Rivers s cheek was cold his muscles had already begun to stiffen in rigor mortis Rand examined the dead man s wounds His coat was stained with blood and gashed in several places driven into his chest by a downward blow the bayonet of a short German service Mauser pinned him to the floor like a specimen on a naturalist s card Beside the one in which the weapon remained there were three stab wounds in the chest and the lower part of the face was disfigured by what looked like a butt blow Bending over Rand could see the imprint of the Mauser butt plate on Rivers s jaw on the butt plate itself were traces of blood The rifle a regulation German infantry weapon the long familiar Gewehr ninety eight in its most recent modification was a Nazi product bearing the eagle and encircled swastika of the Third Reich and the code letters lza the symbol of the Mauserwerke A G plant at Karlsruhe It had doubtless been sold to Rivers by some returned soldier In a rack beside the door were a number of other bolt action military rifles a Krag a couple of Arisakas a long German infantry rifle of the first World War a Greek Mannlicher a Mexican Mauser a British short model Lee Enfield All had fixed bayonets between the Lee Enfield and one of the Arisakas there was a vacancy Rivers s carved ivory cigarette holder was lying beside the body crushed at the end as though it had been stepped on A half smoked cigarette had been in it it too was crushed There was no evidence of any great struggle however the attack which had ended the arms dealer s life must have come as a complete surprise He had probably been holding the cigarette holder in his hand when the butt blow had been delivered and had dropped it and flung up his arms instinctively Thereupon his assailant had reversed his weapon and driven the bayonet into his chest The first blow no doubt had been fatal it could have been any of the three stabs in the chest but the killer had given him two more probably while he was on the floor Then grasping the rifle in both hands he had stood over his victim and pinned the body to the floor That last blow could have only been inspired by pure anger and hatred Yet apparently Rivers had been unaware of his visitor s murderous intentions even while the rifle was being taken from the rack Rand strolled back through the shop looking about Someone had been here with Rivers for some time the dealer and another man had sat by the fire drinking and smoking On the low table was a fifth of Haig Haig a siphon two glasses a glass bowl containing water that had evidently melted from ice cubes and an ashtray In the ashtray were a number of River s cigarette butts all holder crimped and a quantity of ash some of it cigar ash There was no cigar butt and no band or cellophane wrapper The fire on the hearth had burned out and the ashes were cold They were not all wood ashes a considerable amount of paper no cardboard had been burned there also Poking gently with the point of a sword he took from a rack Rand discovered that what had been burned had been a number of cards about six inches by four one of which had somehow managed to escape the flames with nothing more than a charred edge Improvising tweezers from a pipe cleaner he picked this up and looked at it It had been typewritten four thousand eight hundred fifty English Screw Barrel F L Pocket Pistol Queen Anne type side hammer with pan attached to barrel steel barrel and frame Marked Wilson Minories London Silver masque butt cap hallmarked for seventeen twenty three four one two barrel nine one four O A cal abt forty four Taken in trade three twenty one thirty eight from V Sparling for Kentuck twenty five thirty eight along with four thousand eight hundred fifty one four thousand eight hundred fifty two four thousand eight hundred fifty three App cost RLss Replacement do NLss OSss LSss To this had been added in pen Sold R Kingsley saint Louis Mo Mail order twelve twenty forty two OSss Rand laid the card on the cocktail table along with the drinking equipment At least he knew what had gone into the fire Arnold Rivers s card index purchase and sales record He doubted very strongly if that would have been burned while its owner was still alive Going over to the desk he checked the drawer from which he had seen Cecil Gillis get the card for the Leech Rigdon had been cleaned out Picking up the phone in an awkward unnatural manner he used a pencil from his pocket to dial a number with which he was familiar a number that meant the same thing on any telephone exchange in the state State Police Corporal Kavaalen a voice singsonged out of the receiver My name is Rand he identified himself I am calling from Arnold Rivers s antique arms shop on Route nineteen about a mile and a half east of Rosemont I am reporting a homicide Yeah go ahead Hey Did you say homicide the other voice asked sharply Who Rivers himself I called at his shop a few minutes ago found the front door open and walked in I found Rivers lying dead on the floor just inside the door He had been killed with a Mauser rifle not shot clubbed with the butt and bayoneted The body is cold beginning to stiffen a pool of blood on the floor is almost completely dried That s a good report mister the corporal approved You stick around we ll be right along You haven t touched anything have you Not around the body How long will it take you to get here About ten minutes I ll tell Sergeant McKenna right away Rand hung up and glanced at his watch Ten twenty two he gave himself seven minutes and went around the room rapidly looking only at pistols He saw nothing that might have come from the Fleming collection Finally he opened the front door just as a white State Police car was pulling up at the end of the walk Sergeant Ignatius Loyola McKenna customarily known and addressed as Mick piled out almost before it had stopped The driver a stocky blue eyed Finn with a corporal s chevrons followed him and two privates got out from behind dragging after them a box about the size and shape of an Army footlocker McKenna was halfway up the drive before he recognized Rand Then he stopped short Well Jaysus me beads He turned suddenly to the corporal My God Aarvo you said his name was Grant That s what I thought he said Rand recognized the singsong accent he had heard on the phone You know him Know him McKenna stepped aside quickly to avoid being overrun by the two privates with the equipment box He sighed resignedly Aarvo this is the notorious Jefferson Davis Rand Tri State Agency in New Belfast He gestured toward the Finn Corporal Aarvo Kavaalen he introduced And Privates Skinner and Jameson Well where is it Right inside Rand stepped backward gesturing them in Careful it s just inside the doorway McKenna and the corporal entered the two privates set down their box outside and followed They all drew up in a semicircle around the late Arnold Rivers and looked at him critically Jesus Kavaalen pronounced the J sound as though it were Zh he gave all his syllables an equally accented intonation Say somebody gave him a good job Somebody s been seeing too many war movies McKenna got a cigarette out of his tunic pocket and lit it in Rand s pipe bowl Want to confess now or do you insist on a third degree with all the trimmings Kavaalen looked wide eyed at Rand then at McKenna and then back at Rand Rand laughed Now Mick he reproved You know I never kill anybody unless I have a clear case of self defense and a flock of witnesses to back it up McKenna nodded and reassured his corporal That s right Aarvo when Jeff Rand kills anybody it s always self defense And he doesn t generally make messes like this He gave the body a brief scrutiny then turned to Rand You looked around of course what do you make of it Last night sometime Rand reconstructed Rivers had a visitor A man who smoked cigars He and Rivers were on friendly or at least sociable terms They sat back there by the fire for some time smoking and drinking The shades were all drawn I don t know whether that was standard procedure or because this conference was something clandestine Finally Rivers s visitor got up to leave Now of course he could have left and somebody else could have come here later been admitted and killed Rivers That s a possibility Rand said but it s also an assumption without anything to support it I rather like the idea that the man who sat back there drinking and smoking with Rivers was the killer If so Rivers must have gone with him to the door and was about to open it when this fellow picked up that rifle probably from that rack over there and clipped him on the jaw with the butt Then he gave him the point three times the second and third probably while Rivers was down Then he swung it up and slammed down with it and left it sticking through Rivers and in the floor McKenna nodded Lights on when you got here he asked No I put them on when I came in The killer must have turned them off when he left but the deadlatch on the door wasn t set and he doesn t seem to have bothered checking on that Think he left right after he killed Rivers Rand shook his head No that was just the first part of it After he d finished Rivers he went back to that desk and got all the cards Rivers used to record his transactions on an individual card for every item He destroyed the lot of them or at least most of them in the fireplace Now I m only guessing here but I think he took out a card or cards in which he had some interest and then dumped the rest in the fire to prevent anybody from being able to determine which ones he was interested in I am further guessing that the cards which the killer wanted to suppress were in the sold file But I am not guessing about the destruction of the record file I found the fireplace full of ashes found one card that had escaped unburned you can be sure that one wasn t important and found the drawer where the record system was kept empty Think he might have stolen something and covered up by burning the cards McKenna asked Rand shook his head again I was here yesterday bought a pistol from Rivers That s how I noticed this card index system Of course I didn t look at everything while I was here but I can t see where any quantity of arms have been removed and Rivers didn t have any single item that was worth a murder Fact is no old firearm is There are only a very few old arms that are worth over a thousand dollars and most of them are well known unique specimens that would be unsaleable because every collector would know where it came from We can check possible thefts with Rivers s clerk when he gets here McKenna said Now suppose you show me these things you found back at the rear Aarvo you and the boys start taking pictures he told the corporal then he followed Rand back through the shop He tested the temperature of the water in the ice bowl with his finger He looked at the ashtray and bent over and sniffed at each of the two glasses I see one of them s been emptied out he commented Want to bet it hasn t been wiped clean too Huh unh Rand smiled slightly Even the tiny tots wipe off the cookie jar after they ve raided it he said A flash bulb lit the front of the shop briefly Corporal Kavaalen said something to the others McKenna picked up the card Rand had found by the edges and looked at it What in hell s this all about Jeff he asked Rivers made it out for one of his pistols An English flintlock pocket pistol I can show you one almost like it up front He d gotten it and three others back in nineteen thirty eight in trade for a Kentucky rifle The numbers are reference numbers the letters are Rivers s private price code Those three at the end are respectively what he absolutely had to get for it what he thought was a reasonable price and the most he thought the traffic would stand He sold it in nineteen forty two for his middle price There was another flash by the door then Kavaalen called out Hey Mick we got two of the stiffs now All right if we pull out the bayonet for a close up of his chest Sure Better chalkline it first you ll move things jerking that bayonet out He turned back to Rand You think then that maybe some card in that file would have gotten somebody in trouble and he had to croak Rivers to get it and then burned the rest of the cards for a cover up That s the way it looks to me Rand agreed Just because I can t think of any other possibility though doesn t mean that there aren t any others Hey You think he might have been selling modern arms to criminals without reporting the sale McKenna asked I wouldn t put it past him Rand considered There was very little that I would put past that fellow But I wouldn t think he d be stupid enough to carry a record of such sales in his own file though McKenna rubbed the butt of his thirty eight reflectively that seemed to be his substitute for head scratching as an aid to cerebration You said you were here yesterday and bought a pistol he began All right I know about that collection of yours But why were you back here bright and early this morning You working on Rivers for somebody If so give Rand told him what he was working on Rivers wants to buy the Fleming collection That was the reason I saw him yesterday But the reason I came here this morning is that I find that somebody has stolen about two dozen of the best pistols out of the collection since Fleming s death and tried to cover up by replacing them with some junk that Lane Fleming wouldn t have allowed inside his house For my money it s the butler Now that Fleming s dead he s the only one in the house who knows enough about arms to know what was worth stealing He has constant access to the gunroom I caught him in a lie about a book Fleming kept a record of his collection in and now the book has vanished And furthermore and most important if he d been on the level he would have spotted what was going on long ago and squawked about it That s a damn good circumstantial case Jeff McKenna nodded Nothing you could take to a jury of course but mighty good grounds for suspicion You think Rivers could have been the fence He could have been Whoever was higrading the collection had to have an outlet for his stuff and he had to have a source of supply for the junk he was infiltrating into the collection as replacements A crooked dealer is the answer to both and Arnold Rivers was definitely crooked You know that McKenna inquired For sure Another flash lit the front of the shop Rand nodded For damn good and sure I can show you half a dozen firearms in this shop that have been altered to increase their value I don t mean legitimate restorations I mean fraudulent alterations He went on to tell McKenna about Rivers s expulsion from membership in the National Rifle Association And I know that he sold a pair of pistols to Lane Fleming about a week before Fleming was killed that were outright fakes Fleming was going to sue the ears off Rivers about that the fact is until this morning I d been wondering if that mightn t have been why Fleming had that sour looking accident If he d lived he d have run Rivers out of business Hell I didn t know that McKenna seemed worried Fleming used to target shoot with our gang and he knew too much about gats to pull a Russ Columbo on himself I didn t like that accident at the time but I figured he d pulled the Dutch and the family were making out it was an accident We never were called in the whole thing was handled through the coroner s office You really think Fleming could have been bumped Yes I think he could have been bumped Rand understated I haven t found any positive proof but He told McKenna about his purchase from Rivers of the revolver that had been later identified as the one brought home by Fleming on the day of his death I still don t know how Rivers got hold of it he continued Until I walked in here not half an hour ago and found Rivers dead on the floor I d had a suspicion that Rivers might have sneaked into the Fleming house shot Fleming with another revolver left it in Fleming s hand and carried away the one Fleming had been working on The motive of course would have been to stop a lawsuit that would have put Rivers out of business and not inconceivably in jail But now He looked toward the front of the shop where another photo flash glared for an instant And don t suggest that Rivers got conscience stricken and killed himself Aside from the technical difficulties of pinning himself to the floor after he was dead that explanation s out Rivers had no conscience to be stricken with Well let s skip Fleming for a minute McKenna suggested You think this butler at the Fleming place was robbing the collection And you say he could ve sold the stuff he stole to Rivers Well when the family gets you in to work on the collection Jeeves or whatever his name is realizes that you re going to spot what s been going on and will probably suspect him He knows you re no ordinary arms expert you re an agency dick So he gets scared If you catch up with Rivers Rivers ll talk So he comes over here last night and kills Rivers off before you can get to him And while Rivers may not keep a record of the stuff he got from Jeeves or whatever his name is Walters Rand supplied Walters then While he may not keep a record of what he bought from Walters the chances are he does keep a record of the stuff Walters got from him to use for replacements so the card file goes into the fire How s that The flare of another flash bulb made distorted shadows dance over the walls That would hang together now Rand agreed Of course I haven t found anything here except the revolver I bought yesterday that came from the Fleming place but I ll add this As soon as Rivers found out I was working for the Fleming family he tried to get that revolver back from me Offered me seventy five dollars worth of credit on anything else in the shop if I d give it back to him not twenty minutes after I d paid him sixty for it See McKenna pounced Look suppose you had a lot of hot stuff in a place like this You might take a chance on selling something that had gotten mixed in with your legitimate stuff but would you want to sell it right back to where it had been stolen from No I wouldn t And if I were a butler who d been robbing a valuable collection and an agency man moved in and started poking around I might get in a panic and do something extreme That all hangs together too While Rand was talking to McKenna Private Jameson wandered back through the shop Hey Sarge is there any way into the house from here he asked The outside doors are all locked and I can t raise anybody Rand pointed out the flight of steps beside the fireplace I saw Rivers come out of the house that way yesterday he said The State Policeman went up the steps and tried the door it opened and he went through Chances are missus Rivers is away McKenna said She s away a lot They have a colored girl who comes in by the day but she doesn t generally get here before noon And the clerk doesn t get here till about the same time You seem to know a lot about this household Rand said Yeah We have this place marked up as a bad burglary and stick up hazard we keep an eye on it Rivers has all these guns he does a big cash business he always has a couple of hundred to a thousand on him it s a wonder somebody hasn t made a try at this place long ago Tell you what Jeff say you check up on this butler at the Fleming place for us and we ll check up here and see if we can find any of the stuff that was stolen We can get together and compare notes Maybe one or another of us may run across something about that accident of Fleming s too Suits me I ll be glad to help you and I ll be glad for any help you can give me on recovering those pistols I haven t made any formal report on that yet because I m not sure exactly what s missing and I don t want any of that kind of publicity while I m trying to sell the collection It may be that the two matters are related there are some points of similarity which may or may not mean anything And of course I just may find somebody who ll make it worth my time to get interested in this killing while I m at it McKenna chuckled That must hurt hell out of you Jeff he said A nice classy murder like this and nobody to pay you to work on it It does Rand admitted I feel like an undertaker watching a man being swallowed by a shark You want to stick around till this clerk of Rivers s gets here McKenna asked He should be here in about an hour and a half No I d just as soon not be seen taking too much of an interest in this right now Fact is I d just as soon not have my name mentioned at all in connection with this You can charge the discovery of the body up to our old friend Anonymous Tip can t you Sure McKenna accompanied Rand to the front door past the white chalked outline that marked the original position of the body The body itself with ink blackened fingertips lay to one side out of the way Corporal Kavaalen was going through the dead man s pockets and Skinner was working on the rifle with an insufflator Well we can t say it was robbery anyhow Kavaalen said He had eight C s in his billfold Migawd Sarge is this damn rifle ever lousy with prints Skinner complained A lot of Rivers s and everybody else s who s been fooling with it around here and half the Wehrmacht Swell swell McKenna enthused Maybe we can pass the case off on the War Crimes Commission CHAPTER eleven Mick McKenna had put his finger right on the sore spot It did hurt Rand like hell a nice sensational murder and no money in it for the Tri State Agency Obviously somebody would have to be persuaded to finance an investigation Preferably some innocent victim of unjust suspicion somebody who could best clear himself by unmasking the real villain For villain Rand mentally substituted public benefactor He was running over a list of possible suspects as he entered Rosemont Passing the little antique shop he slowed backed read the name Karen Lawrence on the window and then pulled over to the curb and got out Crossing the sidewalk he went up the steps to the door entering to the jangling of a spring mounted cowbell The girl dealer was inside with a visitor a sallow faced untidy looking man of indeterminate age who was opening newspaper wrapped packages on a table top Karen greeted Rand by name and military rank Rand told her he d just look around till she was through She tossed him a look of comic reproach as though she had counted on him to rid her of the man with the packages Now just you look at this here Miss Lawrence the man was enthusing undoing another package Here s something I know you ll want I think this here is real quaint Just look now He displayed some long narrow dark object holding it out to her Ain t this here an interestin item now Miss Lawrence Ooooooh What in heaven s name is that thing she demanded That there s a sword A real African native sword Look at that scabbard now made out of real crocodile skin A whole young crocodile head feet an all I tell you Miss Lawrence that there item is unique It s revolting It s the most repulsive object that s ever been brought into this shop which is saying quite a lot Colonel Rand If you don t have a hangover this morning will you please come here and look at this thing Rand laid down the Merril carbine he had been examining and walked over beside Karen The man whom Rand judged to be some rural free lance antique prospector extended the object of the girl s repugnance It was an African sword all right with a plain iron hilt and cross guard The design looked Berber but the workmanship was low grade and probably attributable to some even more barbarous people The scabbard was what was really surprising if you liked that kind of surprises It was an infant crocodile rather indifferently smoke cured the sword simply went in between the creature s jaws and extended the length of the body and into the tail Either end of a moldy green leather thong had been fastened to the two front paws for a shoulder baldric When new Rand thought it must have given its wearer a really distinctive aroma even for Africa He drew the blade gingerly looked at it and sheathed it with caution East African Danakil or Somali or something like that he commented Be damn good and careful not to scratch yourself on that if you do you ll need about a gallon of anti tetanus shots Y think it might be poisoned the man with the dirty neck and the month old haircut inquired eagerly See Miss Lawrence What I told you a real African native sword I got that there from Hen Sourbaw over at Feltonville his uncle the Reverend Sourbaw that used to preach at Hemlock Gap Church brung it from Africa himself about fifty years ago He used to be a missionary in his younger days I can make you an awful good price on that there item Miss Lawrence God forbid she exclaimed All my customers are heavy drinkers I wouldn t want to answer for what might happen if some of them saw that thing suddenly Oh well How about that there little amethyst bottle then Well I would give you seven dollars for that she grudged Y would Well it s yours then An how about them there salt cellars an that there knife box Rand wandered back to examining firearms Eventually after buying the knife box Karen got rid of the man with the antiques When he had gone she found a pack of cigarettes offered it to Rand and lit one for herself Well now you see why girls leave home and start antique shops she said Never a dull moment Wasn t that sword the awfullest thing you ever saw though Well one of the ten awfullest Rand conceded I just stopped in to give you some good news You won t need to consider that offer of Arnold Rivers s any more He is no longer interested in the Fleming collection He isn t An eager happy light danced up in her eyes You saw him again this morning What did he say He didn t say anything He isn t talking any more either Fact is he isn t even breathing any more He You mean he s dead She was surprised even shocked The shock was probably a concession to good taste but the surprise looked genuine When did he die It must have been very sudden I saw him a few days ago and he looked all right Of course he s been having trouble with his lungs but It was very sudden Some time last night some person or persons unknown gave him a butt and bayonet job with a German Mauser out of a rack in his shop A most unpleasantly thorough job I went to see him this morning hoping to badger something out of him about those pistols that are missing from the Fleming collection and found the body I notified the State Police and just came from there For God s sake The shock was genuine too now Have the police any idea Not the foggiest If some of the Fleming pistols turn up at his place I might think that had something to do with it So far though they haven t I gave the shop a once over lightly before the cops arrived and couldn t find anything She tried to take a puff from her cigarette and found that she had broken it in her fingers She lit a new one from the mangled butt When did it happen She tried to make the question sound casual That I couldn t say either Around midnight would be my guess They might be able to fix a no earlier time An idea occurred to him and he smiled But that s dreadful She really meant that It s a terrible thing to happen to anybody being killed like that She stopped just short of adding even Rivers Instead she continued But I can t say I m really very sorry he s dead Colonel Outside of maybe his wife and the gunsmith who made his fake Walker Colts and North Cheney flintlocks who is he countered Oh yes Cecil Gillis He s about due for induction into the Army of the Unemployed unless missus Rivers intends carrying on the business Karen s eyes widened Cecil Gillis she exclaimed softly I wonder now if he has an alibi for last night Think he might need one Rand asked Of course I only saw him once but he didn t strike me as a possible candidate I can t seem to see young Gillis doing a messy job like this was or going to all that manual labor when he could have used something neat like a pistol or a dagger Well Cecil isn t quite the languishing flower he looks Karen told him He does a lot of swimming and he s one of the few people around here who can beat me at tennis And he has a motive Maybe two motives Such as Rand prompted Maybe you think Cecil is a you know one of those boys she euphemized Well he isn t He takes a perfectly normal and even slightly wolfish interest in the female of his species And while Arnold Rivers may have been a good provider from a financial standpoint he wasn t quite up to his wife s requirements in another important respect And Rivers was away a lot on buying trips and so on and when he was nobody ever saw Cecil leave the Rivers place in the evenings At least that s the story personally I wouldn t know Of course where there s smoke there may be nothing more than somebody with a stogie but then there may be a regular conflagration That would be a perfectly satisfactory motive under some circumstances Rand admitted And the other Cecil might have been doing funny things with the books and Rivers might have caught him That would also be a good enough motive It would also Rand thought furnish an explanation for the burning of Rivers s record cards I ll mention it to Mick McKenna he s hard up for a good usable suspect And by the way the news of this killing will be out before evening but in the meantime I wish you wouldn t mention it to anybody or mention that I was in here to tell you about it I won t I m glad you told me though Do you think there may be a chance that we can get the collection now I wouldn t know why not Rivers s offer was pretty high there aren t many other dealers who would be able to duplicate it Well don t take any Czechoslovakian Stiegel He moved his car down the street to the Rosemont Inn where he went into the combination bar and grill and had a Bourbon and water at the bar Then he ordered lunch and while waiting for it went into a phone booth and dialed the number of Stephen Gresham s office in New Belfast I d hoped to catch you before you left for lunch he said when the lawyer answered There s been a new development in the Fleming business He had decided to follow the same line as with Karen Lawrence You needn t worry about Arnold Rivers s offer any more Ha So he backed out He was shoved out Rand corrected On the sharp end of a Mauser bayonet sometime last night I found the body this morning when I went to see him and notified the State Police They call it murder but of course they re just prejudiced I d call it a nuisance abatement project Look here are you kidding Gresham demanded I never kid about Those Who Have Passed On Rand denied piously Then he recited the already hackneyed description of what had happened to Rivers with careful attention to all the gruesome details So I called copper directly Sergeant McKenna s up a stump about it and looking in all directions for a suspect Gresham was silent for a moment then swore softly My God Jeff This is going to raise all kinds of hell He was silent for a moment Look here can you see me at my home about two thirty this afternoon I want to talk to you about this Rand smiled happily This looked like what he had been angling for Maybe Arnold Rivers hadn t died in vain after all Why yes I can make it he replied Good See you there then Rand assured him that he would be on hand When he returned to his table he found his lunch waiting for him He sat down and ate with a good appetite After finishing he had another drink and sat sipping it slowly and smoking his pipe going over the story Gladys Fleming had told him and the gossip he had gotten from Carter Tipton and the other statements which had been made to him by different people about the death of Lane Fleming and the conclusions he had reached about the theft of the pistols and the killing of Arnold Rivers sorting out the inferences from the descriptions and the descriptive statements of others from the things he himself had observed When his glass was empty and his pipe burned out he left a tip beside the ashtray paid his check and went out He had two hours until his meeting with Stephen Gresham he knew exactly where to spend them The county seat was a normal twenty minutes drive from Rosemont but with the road relatively free from traffic he was able to cut that to fifteen Parking his car in front of the courthouse he went inside The coroner one Jason Kirchner was an inoffensive looking little fellow with a Caspar Milquetoast mustache and an underslung jaw He wore an Elks watchcharm an Odd Fellows ring and a Knights of Pythias lapel pin He looked at Rand s credentials including the letter Humphrey Goode had given him with some bewilderment You re working for mister Goode he asked rather needlessly Yes I see handling the sale of mister Fleming s pistols for the estate Yes That must be interesting work mister Rand Now what can I do for you Why I understand you have an item from that collection here in your office Rand said The pistol with which mister Fleming shot himself Regardless of its unpleasant associations that pistol is a valuable collector s item and one of the assets of the estate If I m to get full value for the collection for the heirs I ll have to have that to sell with the rest of the weapons Well now look here mister Rand Kirchner started to argue that revolver s a dangerous weapon It s killed one man already I don t know as I ought to let it get out where it might kill somebody else Rand estimated that this situation called for a modified version of his hard boiled act You think you can show cause why that revolver shouldn t be turned over to the Fleming estate he demanded Well if I don t get it right away mister Goode will get a court order for it You had no right to impound that revolver in the first place you removed it from the Fleming home illegally in the second place since you had no intention of holding any formal inquest and you re holding it illegally now A court order might not be all we could get either he added menacingly Now if you have any reason to suspect that mister Fleming committed suicide or was murdered for instance Oh my heavens no Kirchner cried horrified It was an accident pure and simple I so certified it Death by accident due to inadvertence of the deceased Well then Rand said you have no right to hold that revolver and I want it right now As mister Goode s agent I m responsible for that collection of which the revolver you re holding is a part That revolver is too valuable an asset to ignore You certainly realize that Well I don t have any intention of exceeding my authority of course Kirchner disclaimed hastily And I certainly wouldn t want to go against mister Goode s wishes Humphrey Goode must pull considerable weight around the courthouse Rand surmised But you realize that revolver s still loaded Oh that s not your worry I ll draw the charges or better fire them out It stood one shot it can stand the other five Well would you mind if I called mister Goode on the phone Rand did decidedly However he shook his head negligently Certainly not go ahead and call him by all means The coroner went away In a few minutes he was back carrying a revolver in both hands Evidently Goode had given him the green light He approached handling the weapon with a caution that would have been excessive for a Mills grenade after warning Rand again that it was loaded he laid it gently on his desk It was a thirty six Colt one of the eighteen sixty series with the round barrel and the so called creeping ramming lever Somebody had wound a piece of wire around it back of the hammer and through the loading aperture in front of the cylinder as the hammer was down on a fired chamber there was no way in God s world short of throwing the thing into a furnace in which it could be discharged but Kirchner was shrinking away from it as though it might jump at his throat I put the wire on the coroner said I thought it might be safer that way It ll be a lot safer after I ve emptied it into the first claybank outside town Rand told him Sorry I had to be a little short with you mister Kirchner but you know how it is I m responsible to mister Goode for the collection and this gun s part of it Oh that s all right I really shouldn t have taken the attitude I did Kirchner met him halfway After I talked to mister Goode of course I knew it was all right but You see I ve been bothered a lot about that pistol lately Yes Rand succeeded in being negligent about it Oh my yes The newspaper people wanted to take pictures of me holding it and then there was an antique dealer who was here trying to buy it Who was that Arnold Rivers Why yes Do you know him He has an antique shop on the other side of Rosemont he doesn t sell anything but guns and swords and that sort of thing Kirchner said He was here making inquiries about it and my clerk showed it to him and then he started making offers for it first ten dollars and then fifteen and then twenty he got up as high as sixty dollars I suppose it s worth a couple of hundred It was probably worth about thirty five Rand was intrigued by this second instance of an un Rivers like willingness to spare no expense to get possession of a thirty six caliber percussion revolver Did he have it in his hands he asked Oh yes he looked it over carefully I suppose he thought he could get a lot of money for it because of the accident and mister Fleming being such a prominent man Kirchner suggested Rand allowed himself to be struck by an idea Say you know that would make it worth more at that he exclaimed What do you know I never thought of that Look mister Kirchner I m supposed to get as much money for these pistols for the heirs as I can How would you like to give me a letter vouching for this as the pistol mister Fleming killed himself with Put in how you found it in his hand and mention the serial numbers so that whoever buys it will know it s the same revolver He picked up the Colt and showed Kirchner the serials on the butt and in front of the trigger guard See here it is twenty four forty four Kirchner would be more than willing to oblige mister Goode s agent he typed out the letter himself looked twice at the revolver to make sure of the number took Rand s word for the make model and caliber signed it and even slammed his seal down on it Rand thanked him profusely put the letter in his pocket and stuck the Colt down his pants leg About two miles from the county seat Rand stopped his car on a deserted stretch of road and got out Unwinding the wire Kirchner had wrapped around the revolver he picked up an empty beer can from the ditch set it against an embankment stepped back about thirty feet and began firing The first shot kicked up dirt a little over the can Rand never could be sure just how high any percussion Colt was sighted and the other four hit the can He carried the revolver back to the car and put it into the glove box with the Leech Rigdon After starting the car he snapped on the radio in time for the two fifteen news broadcast from the New Belfast station As he had expected the murder was out the daily budget of strikes and Congressional investigations and international turmoil was enlivened by a more or less imaginative account of what had already been christened the Rosemont Bayonet Murder Rand resigned himself to the inevitable influx of reporters Then he swore as the newscaster continued District Attorney Charles P Farnsworth of Scott County who has taken charge of the investigation says and we quote There is strong evidence implicating certain prominent persons whom we are not as yet prepared to name and if the investigation now under way and making excellent progress justifies they will be apprehended and formally charged No effort will be spared and no consideration of personal prominence will be allowed to deter us from clearing up this dastardly crime Rand swore again with weary bitterness wondering how much trouble he was going to have with District Attorney Charles P Farnsworth as he pulled to a stop in Stephen Gresham s driveway CHAPTER twelve Gresham must have been waiting inside the door as soon as Rand came up onto the porch he opened it and motioned the detective inside Beyond a hasty greeting as Rand passed the threshold he did not speak until they were seated in the gunroom upstairs Then he came straight to the point Jeff can you spare the time from this work you re doing at the Flemings to investigate this Rivers business he asked And how much would an investigation cost me It s got to be a blitz job I m not interested in getting anybody convicted in court I just want the case cleared up in a hurry Well Rand puffed at the cigar Gresham had given him watching the ash form on the end I don t work by the day Stephen I take a lump sum fee and of course it s to my interest to get a case cleared up as soon as I can But I can t set any time limit on a job like this This Rivers killing has more angles than Nude Descending a Staircase I don t know how much work I ll have to do or even what kind Well it ll have to be fast Gresham told him urgently Look I didn t kill Arnold Rivers I hated his guts and I think whoever did it ought to get a medal and a testimonial dinner but I did not kill him You believe me I m inclined to Rand replied In your law practice you know what a lying client is letting himself in for As my client you wouldn t lie to me You seem to think you may be suspected of purging Rivers But why Is there any reason aside from that homemade North Cheney he sold you why anybody would think you d killed him Great God yes Gresham exclaimed Now look I m not worried about being railroaded for this I didn t do it and I can beat any case that half assed ex ambulance chaser Farnsworth could dream up against me But I can t afford even to be mentioned in connection with this You know what that would do to me in town I just can t get mixed up in this at all I want you to see to it that I don t That sounds like a large order The ash was growing on Rand s cigar he took another heavy drag at it But why necessarily you Rivers had plenty of other enemies Yes but dammit they weren t all in his shop last evening Just me And one other The one who killed him On your way out from town Rand inquired Yes I stopped at his place about a quarter to nine I was sore as hell about the hooking he gave me on that North Cheney falsely so called and I decided to stop and have it out with him We had words most of them unpleasant I told him for one thing that Lane Fleming s death hadn t pulled his bacon off the fire that I was going to start the same sort of action against him on my own account But that isn t the point The point is that when I was going in this la de da clerk of his Cecil Gillis was coming out He got into his car and drove away leaving me alone with Rivers He ll be the first one the police talk to and he ll tell them all about it That does put you back of the eight ball Rand dropped the ash into a tray and looked at it curiously It looked like the sort of ash he had seen at Rivers s shop but he couldn t be sure But if it can be proved that Rivers was alive after nine twenty when you got here you ll be in the clear I don t want to have to clear myself Gresham insisted I don t want anything to do with it at all Here I ll pay you a thousand down and two more when you have the case completed I want you to get the murder cleared up before I can be publicly involved in it I say publicly because this damned Gillis has probably involved me with the police already Well Gillis isn t exactly in a state of pure sanctity himself Rand commented As a suspect the smart handicappers are figuring him to run well inside the money For instance you know there have been stories about him and missus Rivers Gresham snapped his fingers Damned if there haven t now he said You talk to Adam Trehearne He did business with Rivers there wasn t much in his line Rivers and Umholtz were able to fake and different times he s gone to Rivers s shop and there d be nobody around and then Gillis would come in from the house smelling of Chanel Number Five missus Rivers uses Chanel Number Five Maybe you have something there If Cecil thought he could marry the business with Rivers out of the way You ll take the case won t you Jeff Oh certainly Rand assured him Now all they have on you is that there was ill feeling between you and Rivers about that fake North Cheney and that you were in Rivers s shop yesterday evening Rand s new client grimaced I wish that were all he said The worst part of it is the way Rivers was killed See back in Kaiser Willie s war before I was assigned a company of my own I was regimental bayonet instruction officer And after we got to France I always carried a rifle and bayonet at the front hell I must have killed close to a dozen Krauts just the way Rivers was killed And during Schicklgruber s war I volunteered as bayonet instructor for the local Home Guard My God Rand made a wry face There must be close to a hundred people around here who d know that and all of them are probably convinced that you killed Rivers and are expressing that opinion at the top of their voices to all comers You don t want a detective you want a magician He took another drag at the cigar and blew smoke through a circular gun rack beside him What sort of a character is this Farnsworth anyhow he asked Before the war I had all the D A s in the state typed and estimated but since I got back Gresham slandered the county prosecutor s legitimacy God damn headline hunting little egotist He s running for re election this year too One way that could be bad On the other hand it might be easy to throw a scare into him Stephen when you were at Rivers s were you smoking a cigar Gresham shook his head No I threw my cigar away when I got out of the car and I didn t light another one till I got home If you remember I was lighting it when I came in here Yes so you were Well I don t suppose in view of the state of relations between you and Rivers that you had a drink with him either I wouldn t drink that guy s liquor if I were dying of snakebite and he wouldn t offer me a drink if he knew I was Gresham declared Well did you notice back near the fireplace a low table with a fifth of Haig Haig Pinchbottle and a couple of glasses and a siphon and so on on it I saw the table There was an ashtray on it and a book I think it was Gluckman s United States Martial Pistols and Revolvers but no bottle or siphon or glasses All right then it was the killer Rand explained about the drinks and the cigar ashes He went on to tell about the destruction of Rivers s record cards I don t get that Gresham was puzzled Unless it was young Gillis after all He could have been knocking down on Rivers and Rivers caught him at it I d thought of that Rand admitted But I doubt if Rivers would sit down and drink with him while accusing him of theft And I can t seem to find anything around Rivers s place that looks as though it might have been stolen from the Fleming collection either Oh and that reminds me If you have time this afternoon I wonder if you d come along with me to the Flemings and see just what s missing I ll have to know that in any case and there s a good possibility that the thefts from the collection and the killing of Rivers are related Yes of course Gresham agreed And suppose we take Pierre Jarrett along with us He knows that collection as well as I do he ll spot anything I miss He works at home I ll call him now We can pick him up before we go to the Flemings They went into Gresham s bedroom where there was a phone and Gresham talked to Pierre Jarrett It was arranged that he should pick Jarrett up with his car and come to the Flemings while Rand went there directly Then Rand used the phone to call his office in New Belfast He talked to Dave Ritter explaining the situation to date I m going to need some help he continued I want you to come here and get a room at the Rosemont Inn under your own name I ll see you there about five thirty And bring with you a suit of butler s livery or reasonable facsimile I believe there will be a vacancy in the Fleming household tomorrow or the next day and I want you ready to take over And bring a small gun with you something you can wear under said livery That three hundred fifty seven Colt of yours is a little too conspicuous You ll find a three hundred eighty Beretta in the top right hand drawer of my office desk with a box of ammunition and a couple of spare clips Right I ll be at Rosemont Inn at five thirty Ritter promised And say Tip was in this morning with a lot of dope on the Fleming estate Want me to let you have it now or shall I give it to you when I see you You have notes Bring them along I ll be seeing you in a couple of hours He parted from Gresham going out and getting in his car As Gresham got his own car out of the garage and drove off toward Pierre Jarrett s house Rand started in the opposite direction toward Rosemont About a half mile from Gresham s he caught an advancing gleam of white on the highway ahead of him and pulled to the side of the road waiting until the State Police car drew up and stopped In it were Mick McKenna Aarvo Kavaalen and a third man a Nordic type in an untidy brown suit Hi Jeff McKenna greeted him as Rand got out of his car and came across the road This is Gus Olsen investigator for the D A s office Jeff Rand Tri State Agency he introduced Hey Olsen yelled We been lookin for you Where you been Rand raised an eyebrow at McKenna You just came from where we re going the State Police sergeant surmised Was Gresham at home He was he s gone now Rand said He and another man are going to help me check up on what s missing from the Fleming collection Hey Olsen exploded What I told you now he run ahead of us with a tip off Gresham s skipped out now What is all this Rand wanted to know What s he screaming about Mick Like he don t know Olsen vociferated He tipped off Gresham so s he could skip out I ll bet he s in it with Gresham Pay no attention McKenna advised He doesn t know what the score is hell he doesn t even know what teams are playing Now you look here Olsen bawled We ll see what mister Farnsworth has to say about this You re supposed to cooperate with us not go fraternizin with a lot of suspects Why it s plain as anything him and Gresham s in it together I bet that was why he come around the first thing in the morning to find the body Kavaalen behind the wheel turned around and began jabbering at Olsen in the back seat in something that sounded like Swedish Most Finns can speak Swedish and Rand was wishing he could understand it The corporal s remarks ran to about a paragraph and must have been downright incendiary At least Olsen seemed to catch fire from them He rose in his seat waving his arms and howling back in the same language Shut up goddammit shut up McKenna bellowed into his face Shut up before I sling your ass to hell out of this car I m talking and I don t want any goddam jaw from you Olsen You either he barked at Kavaalen winking at him at the same time Silence fell with a heavy thump in the car Well now that the international crisis seems to have been averted how s about letting me in on it too Rand asked For instance what about Gresham What s he supposed to be a suspect for Ah Olsen suspects him of chopping Rivers up McKenna replied wearily See we questioned this Cecil Gillis and he told us that last evening as he was leaving Rivers s he saw Stephen Gresham drive up and go into the shop I wanted to talk to him myself I thought he might account for the cigar ashes and the drink fixings on that table But when Farnsworth heard about the killing he sent Olsen around and when Olsen heard that Gresham had been there he tried him and convicted him on the spot Oh obscenity Is that what it s about Rand exclaimed in disgust Yes Gresham told me about that He didn t have the drink and he wasn t smoking a cigar in the shop and he left a little after nine He got home at nine twenty two I can testify to that myself I was there at the time and so were seven other people Rand named them They dribbled away at different times during the evening but Philip Cabot and I stayed till around eleven He mentioned the approximate time at which the others had left What time was Rivers killed or hasn t the time been fixed The M E says around ten to two McKenna said He could be wrong them guys only guess half the time Olsen argued And besides Gresham had it in for Rivers And that ain t all neither he knew how to use a bayonet too I seen him myself during the war showin the Home Guard how to do it just the way Rivers was killed he produced triumphantly McKenna used a dirty word So what Anybody who s ever had infantry training knows that butt stroke and lunge he retorted I learned it myself when I was a kid in twenty four and twenty five in C M T C Hell anybody who s ever seen a war movie If you hadn t lammed out of Sweden when you were sixteen to duck conscription you d of known it too Well maybe Olsen or his boss can explain why Gresham threw those record cards in the fire Rand contributed You know why Olsen says Gresham had it in for Rivers Rivers sold Gresham a fake antique a flint lock navy pistol that had been worked over into something else Gresham was going to subpoena those records when he brought suit against Rivers Rand lied But I can explain why Cecil Gillis might have destroyed them after killing Rivers if he d been cheating Rivers and Rivers caught him at it Yeah and that might explain why Gillis was in such a hurry to sic us onto Gresham too McKenna added I thought of something like that And this high brown girl that works for Rivers says that Gillis and missus Rivers played all kinds of games together when Rivers was away Well who s in charge of the investigation Rand wanted to know I heard on the radio You re liable to hear anything on the radio including slanders on Bing Crosby s horses But for the record I am in charge of this investigation And don t anybody forget it either he added in the direction of the rear seat That s what I thought Well Stephen Gresham has just retained me to make an independent investigation Rand said It is not that he lacks confidence in the State Police or in you he was afraid that other parties might get into the act and try to make political capital out of it Which appears to have happened Well if Gresham retained you I m satisfied McKenna said You can take care of that end of it Glad you re in with us Well I ain t satisfied Olsen began yelling again And mister Farnsworth won t be neither Why this here private dick is like as not workin for the very man that killed Rivers McKenna turned slowly in his seat to face Olsen One time ten years ago he began Jeff Rand had a client who was guilty of the crime he hired Jeff to investigate It was an arson case this guy set fire to his own factory and then got Jeff to run down a lot of fake clues he d planted I know about that I was on the case myself That s where I first met Jeff and he saved me from making a jackass out of myself And what happened to this guy who d hired Jeff was something that oughtn t to happen even to Molotov and it happened because Jeff fixed it to happen If anybody hires Jeff Rand he s one of two things He s either innocent or else he s out of luck I don t know why the hell I bother telling you this Ten to two you say Rand considered Look A couple of days ago Rivers put out a new price list to his regular customers A lot of them in different parts of the country order by telephone and some of them live in the West where there s a couple of hours time difference One of them calling at say eight o clock local time would get his call in at ten Eastern Standard If you checked the long distance calls to Rivers s number last night now you might get something Yeah And if he took a call after nine twenty two that would let Gresham out Even Farnsworth could figure that out Sure I ll check right away Who s at Rivers s now Skinner and Jameson of our gang And Farnsworth and some of his outfit And the hell s own slew of reporters of course McKenna said Aarvo s going back there in a little We re still trying to locate missus Rivers we haven t been able to yet The maid says she went to New York day before yesterday I ll probably be around at Rivers s later in the day I want to check on that Fleming angle Uh huh I ll be there in half an hour Corporal Kavaalen said Be seeing you They exchanged so longs and Kavaalen backed and made a U turn moving off in the direction of Rosemont Olsen s voluble protests drifted back as the car receded Rand returned to his own car and followed CHAPTER thirteen Rand found Gladys alone in the library As she rose to greet him he came close to her gesturing for silence with finger on lips There s a perfect hell of a mess he whispered Somebody murdered Arnold Rivers last night She looked at him in horror Murdered Who was it How did it I haven t time to talk about that right now he told her Stephen Gresham and Pierre Jarrett are on their way here and I d like you to keep the servants and particularly Walters out of earshot of the gunroom while they re here It seems that a number of the best pistols have been stolen from the collection sometime between the death of mister Fleming and the time I saw the collection yesterday Stephen and Pierre are going to help me find out just what s been taken I have an idea they might have been sold to Rivers That may have been why he was killed to prevent him from implicating the thief You think somebody here the servants she asked I can t see how it could have been an outsider The stuff wasn t all taken at once it must have been moved out a piece at a time and worthless pistols moved in and hung on the racks to replace valuable pistols taken He had left the library door purposely open when the doorbell rang he heard it I ll let them in he said You go and head Walters off Rand hurried to the front door and admitted Gresham and Pierre hustling them down the hall into the library and up the spiral to the gunroom while Gladys went to the foot of the front stairs Through the open gunroom door Rand could hear her speaking to Walters as though sending him on some errand to the rear of the house He closed the door and turned to the others We ll have to make it fast he said missus Fleming can t hold the butler off all day Let s start over here and go around the racks They began at the left with the wheel locks Pierre put his finger immediately on the shabby and disreputable specimen Rand had first noticed Phew Is that one a stinker he said What used to be there was a nice late sixteenth or early seventeenth century North Italian pistol all covered with steel filigree work A real beauty much better than average Those Turkish atrocities Gresham pointed out They re filling in for a pair of Lazarino Cominazo snaphaunces that Lane Fleming paid seven hundred for back in the mid thirties and didn t pay a cent too much for even then Worth an easy thousand now Remember the pair of Cominazo flintlocks illustrated in Pollard s Short History of Firearms These were even better and snaphaunces Well you go over the collection Rand told them Note down anything you find missing He handed them a pad of paper and a pencil from the desk I have something else to do for a few minutes With that he left them scrutinizing the pistols on the wall and went to the workbench in the corner drawing the thirty six Colt from under his waistband Working rapidly he dismounted it taking off the barrel and cylinder and cleaned it thoroughly before putting it together again Pierre and Gresham had just started on the Colts when he slipped the revolver out of sight and rejoined them It took over a half hour to finish when they had gotten completely around the collection Rand had a list of twenty six missing items including four cased sets At a conservative estimate the missing pistols were worth ten to twelve thousand dollars dealer s list value the stuff that had been moved in to replace them might have a value of two or three hundred but no serious collector would buy any of it at any price There had been no attempt to replace the cased items the cases had been merely rearranged on the table to avoid any conspicuous vacancies See that thing Pierre asked tapping a small twenty five Webley Scott automatic with his finger Rand looked at it it had been fitted with an English made silencer That thing Pierre said is the one illustrated in Pollard s book The identical pistol it used to be in the Pollard collection Lane had a lot of stuff from some famous collections Gresham said Pollard collection Sawyer collection Fred Hines collection Meeks collection even the old Mark Field collection that was sold at Libbie Galleries in nineteen eleven His own could rank with any of them Think you can get any of this stuff back I hope so By the way where does this fellow Umholtz the fabricator of spurious Whitneyville Walker Colts hang out I believe he ought to be looked into Say that s an idea Pierre ejaculated He might have bought the pistols instead of Rivers Why he has a gunshop at Kingsville on Route twenty two about fifteen miles west of here just this side of the village He had a big sign along the road and his shop s in the barn behind the house I ll have to check up on him But first I want to see if any of this stuff s at Rivers s shop I won t ask you to come along he told Gresham No use you sticking your head into the lion s mouth I ve talked the State Police temporarily off your trail but I still have Farnsworth to worry about He d like to prosecute a big corporation lawyer if he thought he had any chance of getting a conviction Pierre said Make a nice impression on the proletarian vote in the south end of the county You re a member of the Mohawk Club in New Belfast aren t you Rand asked Gresham Well go there and stay there for a couple of days till the heat s off Pierre you can come with me to Rivers s I ll run you home in my car when we re through Gresham let himself out the front door Pierre and Rand went out through the garage and got into Rand s car You have any idea so far about who could have killed Rivers the ex Marine asked as they coasted down the drive to the highway I haven t even the start of an idea Rand said He ran briefly over what he knew or at least those items which were likely to become public knowledge soon From what I ve observed at the shop and from what I know of Rivers s character I d think that he d been in some kind of a crooked deal with somebody and got double crossed or else the other man caught Rivers double crossing him Or else Rivers and somebody else had some secret in common and the other man wanted a monopoly on it and killed Rivers as a security measure Think it might be the Fleming pistols That depends I ll have to see whether any of the Fleming pistols turn up anywhere in Rivers s former possession Personally I ve about decided that the man who was drinking with Rivers killed him There aren t any indications that anybody else was in the shop afterward If that s the case I doubt if the killer was Walters You know what a snobbish guy Rivers was And from what I know of him he seems to have had a thoroughly Aristotelian outlook he identified individuals with class labels Walters of course would be identified with the label butler and I can t imagine Rivers sitting down and drinking with a butler He would only drink with people whom he thought of as his equals that is people whom he identified with class labels of equal social importance to his own labels of antiquarian and businessman That sounds like Korzybski Pierre said as they turned onto Route nineteen in the village and headed east You ve read Science and Sanity Rand nodded Yes I first read it in the nineteen thirty three edition back about nineteen thirty six I ve been rereading it every couple of years since The principles of General Semantics come in very handy in my business especially in criminal investigation work like this A consciousness of abstracting a realization that we can only know something about a thin film of events on the surface of any given situation and a habit of thinking structurally and of individual things instead of verbally and of categories saves a lot of blind alley chasing And they suggest a great many more avenues of investigation than would be evident to one whose thinking is limited by intensional verbal categories Yes I find General Semantics helpful in my work too Pierre said I can use it in plotting a story Oh oh The Gentlemen of the Press Rand said looking ahead as the car approached the Rivers house and shop There hasn t been a good sensational murder story for some time this is a gift from the gods A swarm of cars were parked in front and beside the red brick house Among them Rand spotted a gold lettered green sedan of the New Belfast Dispatch and Evening Express a black coupe bearing the blazonry of the New Belfast Mercury cars from a couple of papers at Louisburg the state capital and cars from papers as far distant as Pittsburgh Buffalo and Cincinnati In front of the shop a motley assemblage of journalists was interviewing and photographing an undersized runt in a tan Chesterfield topcoat and a gray Homburg hat whom they were addressing as mister Farnsworth The District Attorney of Scott County had a mustache which failed miserably to make him look like Tom Dewey he impressed Rand as the sort of offensive little squirt who compensates for his general insignificance by bad manners and loud mouthed self assertion Corporal Kavaalen standing in the doorway of the shop caught sight of Rand and his companion as they got out of the car and came to meet them hustling them around the crowd and into the shop before anybody could notice and recognize them That was a good tip about the telephone he said softly Mick checked at the Rosemont exchange Rivers got a long distance call from Topeka last night ten fifteen to ten seventeen We got the night long distance operator out of bed and she confirmed it Rivers took the call himself He gets a lot of long distance calls in the evenings she knew his voice He corrected himself shifting to the past tense and glancing as he did at the chalk outline on the floor now scuffed by many feet and the dried bloodstains You say this puts Gresham in the clear Absolutely Rand assured him He was at home from nine twenty two on He introduced Pierre Jarrett and explained their mission You find anything except what s here in the shop Only Rivers s own thirty eight Smith Wesson in his room and a lot of pistols out in the garage that look like junk to me Kavaalen said I ll show them to you Rand nodded Pierre you look around the shop I ll see what this other stuff is He followed Kavaalen through a door at the rear of the shop the same one through which Cecil Gillis had carried the Kentucky rifle the afternoon before Beside Rivers s car there was a long workbench in the garage and piles of wood and cardboard cartons and stacks of newspapers and a barrel full of excelsior all evidently used in preparing arms for shipment There was also a large pile of old pistols and a number of long arms Rand pawed among the pistols they were as the State Police corporal had said all junk The sort of things a dealer has to buy at times in order to get something really good Many of them had been partially dismantled for parts When he was certain that the heap of junk weapons didn t conceal anything of value he returned to the shop Pierre was waiting for him by Rivers s desk He shook his head Not a thing he reported I found a couple of out and out fakes and about ten or fifteen that had been altered in one way or another and a lot of reblued stuff but nothing from Fleming s collection What did you find Rand laughed I found Rivers s scrap heap and some pistols that probably contributed parts to some of the stuff you found he said Of course all we can say is that the stuff isn t here Rivers could have bought it and stored it outside somewhere But even so I m not taking the Fleming butler too seriously as a suspect for the murder What s this about Fleming s butler a voice broke in Have you been withholding information from me Rand turned to find that Farnsworth had left the press conference in front and crepe soled up on him from behind I withheld a theory which seems to have come to nothing he replied Kavaalen told the D A who Rand was He s cooperating with us he added Sergeant McKenna instructed us to give him every consideration It seems that a number of valuable pistols were stolen from the collection of the late Lane Fleming Rand said We suspected that the butler had stolen them and sold them to Rivers I thought it possible that he might also have killed Rivers to silence him about the transaction He shrugged None of the stolen items have turned up here so there s nothing to connect the thefts with the death of Rivers Good heavens you certainly didn t suspect a prominent and respected citizen like mister Rivers of receiving stolen goods Farnsworth demanded aghast Who respects him Rand hooted Rivers was a notorious swindler he had that reputation among arms collectors all over the country He was expelled from membership in the National Rifle Association for misrepresentation and fraud Why he even swindled Lane Fleming on a pair of fake pistols a week or so before Fleming s death And the very reason why your man Olsen was inclined to suspect Stephen Gresham was that he had had trouble with Rivers about a crooked deal Rivers had put over on him Fortunately mister Gresham has since been cleared of any suspicion but Who says he s been cleared Farnsworth snapped He s still a suspect Sergeant McKenna says so Corporal Kavaalen declared He has been cleared I guess we just didn t get around to telling you about that He went on to explain about the long distance call that had furnished Stephen Gresham s alibi And Gresham was at home from nine twenty two on Rand added There are eight witnesses to that His wife and daughter myself Captain Jarrett here and his fiancee Miss Lawrence Philip Cabot Adam Trehearne Colin MacBride Farnsworth looked bewildered Why wasn t I told about that he demanded sulkily Sergeant McKenna s been too busy and I didn t think of it Kavaalen said insolently I m not supposed to report to you anyhow Why didn t your man Olsen tell you he was with us when we checked with the telephone company Farnsworth tried to ignore that by questioning Pierre about the time of Gresham s arrival home then turned to Rand and wanted to know what the latter s interest in the case was Rand told him about his work in connection with the Fleming collection producing Humphrey Goode s letter of authorization Farnsworth seemed impressed in about the same way as the coroner Kirchner but he was still puzzled But I understood that you had been retained by Stephen Gresham to investigate this murder he said So you did talk to Olsen after I saw him Rand pounced Odd he didn t mention this telephone thing Why yes that s true My agency handles all sorts of business The two operations aren t mutually exclusive for a while I even thought they might be related but now He shrugged Well you believe now that Rivers had nothing to do with the pistols you say were stolen from the Fleming collection Farnsworth asked Rand shook his head ambiguously Farnsworth took that for a negative answer to his question as he was intended to And you say mister Gresham has been completely cleared of any suspicion of complicity in this murder mister Rand s helping us we want him to stick around till the case is closed Corporal Kavaalen threw in perceiving the drift of Farnsworth s questions He and Sergeant McKenna have worked together before he s given us a lot of good tips You understand Rand took over mister Gresham didn t retain me merely to help him clear himself I don t accept that kind of retainers I was retained to find the murderer of Arnold Rivers and I intend to continue working on this case until I do I hope that the same friendly spirit of mutual cooperation will exist between your office and my agency as exists between me and the State Police I certainly don t want to have to work at cross purposes with any of the regular law enforcement agencies Oh certainly of course Farnsworth didn t seem to like the idea but there was no apparent opening for objection He and Rand exchanged mendacious compliments pledged close cooperation and did practically everything but draw up and sign a treaty of alliance Then Farnsworth and Corporal Kavaalen accompanied Rand and Pierre Jarrett to the front door Some of the reporters who were ravening outside must have spotted Rand as he had entered they were all waiting for him to come out and set up a monstrous ululation when he appeared in the doorway With Farnsworth beaming approval Rand assured the Press that he was no more than a mere spectator that the State Police and the efficient District Attorney of Scott County had the situation well in hand and that an arrest was expected within a matter of hours Then he and Pierre hurried to his car and drove away CHAPTER fourteen Neither of them spoke for a moment or two Then after they had left the criminological journalistic uproar at the Rivers place behind and were approaching the village of Rosemont Pierre turned to Rand You know he said for a disciple of Korzybski you came pretty close to confusing orders of abstraction a couple of times back there You showed that Stephen was at home while Rivers was taking that phone call a little after ten But when you talk about clearing him completely aren t you overlooking the possibility that he came back to Rivers s after you and Philip Cabot left the Gresham place Rand eased the foot pressure on the gas and spared young Jarrett a side glance before returning his attention to the road ahead Understand Pierre hastened to add I don t believe that Stephen was fool enough to kill Rivers over that fake North Cheney but weren t you producing inferences that hadn t been abstracted from any descriptive data Pierre when I m working on a case like this any resemblance between my opinions and the statements I may make is purely due to conscious considerations of policy Rand told him I don t want Farnsworth or Mick McKenna going around bitching this operation up for me If they feel justified in eliminating Gresham on the strength of that phone call I m satisfied regardless of the semantics involved Right now the thing that s worrying me is the ease with which I seem to have talked Farnsworth into laying off Gresham He and Olsen both have single track minds They may just dismiss that telephone alibi such as it is as mere error of the mortal mind and go right ahead building some kind of a ramshackle case against Gresham Since they picked him for their entry they won t want to have to scratch him Damn I wish I could think of where Walters could have sold those pistols Well if Rivers wasn t involved somehow why was he killed Pierre wondered Hey Maybe Walters sold the pistols to Umholtz He s just as big a crook as Rivers was only not quite so smart Rand nodded thoughtfully Maybe so And suppose Rivers found out about it and tried to declare himself in on it That stuff would be worth at least ten thousand I doubt if whoever bought it paid Walters more than two In the Umholtz Rivers income bracket the difference might be worth killing for That s right And Umholtz was in the infantry in the other war he served in the Twenty eighth Division He was trained to use a bayonet And he d pick that short Mauser it has about the same weight and balance as a nineteen oh three Springfield Well you know the killer wouldn t need to have been trained to use a bayonet Rand pointed out Mick McKenna made that point this afternoon There have been a lot of war movies that showed bayonet fighting pretty nearly everybody knows about the technique that was used And against an unarmed and probably unsuspecting victim like Rivers a great deal of proficiency wouldn t be needed He slowed the car Up this road he asked Yes That s my place over there Pierre pointed to a white walled red roofed house that lay against a hillside about a mile ahead making a vivid spot in the dull grays and greens of the early April landscape It consisted of a square two story block with one story wings projecting to give it an L shaped floorplan It reminded Rand of farmhouses he had seen in Sicily during the War Come on in and see my stuff if you have time Pierre invited as Rand pulled to a stop in the driveway I think I told you what I collect personal combat arms both firearms and edge weapons They entered the front door which opened directly into a large parlor a brightly colored cheerful room A woman rose from a chair where she had been reading She was somewhere between forty five and fifty but her figure was still trim and she retained much of what in her youth must have been great beauty Mother this is Colonel Rand Pierre said Jeff my mother Rand shook hands with her and said something polite She gave him a smile of real pleasure Pierre has been telling me about you Colonel she said There was a faint trace of French accent in her voice I suppose he brought you here to show you his treasures Yes I collect arms too Pistols Rand said She laughed You gun collectors you re like women looking at somebody s new hat Will you stay for dinner with us Colonel Rand Why I m sorry I can t I have a great many things to do and I m expected for dinner at the Flemings I really wish I could missus Jarrett Maybe some other time They chatted for a few minutes then Pierre guided Rand into one of the wings of the house This is my workshop too he said Here s where I do my writing He opened a door and showed Rand into a large room On one side the wall was blank on the other it was pierced by two small casement windows The far end was of windows for its entire width from within three feet of the floor almost to the ceiling There were bookcases on either long side and on the rear end and over them hung Pierre s weapons Rand went slowly around the room taking everything in Very few of the arms were of issue military type and most of these showed alterations to suit individual requirements As Pierre had told him the evening before the emphasis was upon weapons which illustrated techniques of combat At the end of the room lighted by the wide windows was a long desk which was really a writer s assembly line with typewriter reference books stacks of notes and manuscripts and a big dictionary on a stand beside a comfortable swivel chair What are you writing Rand asked Science fiction I do a lot of stories for the pulps Pierre told him Space Trails and Other Worlds and Wonder Stories mags like that Most of it s standardized formula stuff what s known to the trade as space operas My best stuff goes to Astonishing Parenthetically you mustn t judge any of these magazines by their names It seems to be a convention to use hyperbolic names for science fiction magazines a heritage from what might be called an earlier and ruder day What I do for Astonishing is really hard work and I enjoy it I m working now on one for them based on J W Dunne s time theories if you know what they are I think so Rand said Polydimensional time isn t it Based on an effect Dunne observed and described dreams obviously related to some waking event but preceding rather than following the event to which they are related I read Dunne s Experiment with Time some years before the war and once when I had nothing better to do I recorded dreams for about a month I got a few doubtful to fair examples and two unmistakable Dunne Effect dreams I never got anything that would help me pick a race winner or spot a rise in the stock market though Well you know there s a case on record of a man who had a dream of hearing a radio narration of the English Derby of nineteen thirty three including the announcement that Hyperion had won which he did Pierre said The dream was six hours before the race and tallied very closely with the phraseology used by the radio narrator Here He picked up a copy of Tyrrell s Science and Psychical Phenomena and leafed through it Did this fellow cash in on it Rand asked No He was a Quaker and violently opposed to betting Here He handed the book to Rand Case Twelve Rand sat down on the edge of the desk and read the section indicated about three pages in length Well I ll be damned he said as he finished The idea of anybody passing up a chance like that to enrich himself literally smote him to the vitals I see the British Society for Psychical Research checked that case and got verification from a couple of independent witnesses If the S P R vouches for a story it must be the McCoy they re the toughest minded gang of confirmed skeptics anywhere in Christendom They take an attitude toward evidence that might be advantageously copied by most of the district attorneys I ve met the one in this county being no exception What s this story you re working on Oh it s based on Dunne s precognition theories plus a few ideas of my own plus a theory of alternate lines of time sequence for alternate probabilities Pierre said See here s the situation Half an hour later they were still arguing about a multidimensional universe when Rand remembered Dave Ritter who should be at the Rosemont Inn by now He looked at his watch saw that it was five forty five and inquired about a telephone Yes of course out here Pierre took him back to the parlor where he dialed the Inn and inquired if a mister Ritter from New Belfast were registered there yet He was A moment later he was speaking to Ritter Jeff for Gawdsake don t come here Ritter advised This place is six deep with reporters the bar sounds like the second act of The Front Page Tony Ashe and Steve Drake from the Dispatch and Express Harry Bentz from the Mercury Joe Rawlings the AP man from Louisburg Christ only knows who all This damn thing s going to turn into another Hall Mills case Look meet me at that beer joint about two miles on the New Belfast side of Rosemont on Route nineteen the white with red trimmings place with the big Pabst sign out in front I ll try to get there without letting a couple of reporters hide in the luggage trunk Okay see you directly Rand hung up spent the next few minutes breaking away from Pierre and his mother and went out to his car Trust Dave Ritter he thought to pick some place where malt beverages were sold for a rendezvous Dave s coupe was parked inconspicuously beside the red trimmed roadhouse Opening his glove box Rand took out the two percussion revolvers and shoved them under his trench coat one on either side pulling up the belt to hold them in place As he went into the roadhouse he felt like Damon Runyon s Twelve Gun Tweeney He found Ritter in the last booth engaged in finishing a bottle of beer Rand ordered Bourbon and plain water and Ritter ordered another beer I have the stuff Tip left with Kathie Ritter said taking out a couple of closely typed sheets and handing them across the table He said this was the whole business Rand glanced over them Tipton had neatly and concisely summarized the provisions of Lane Fleming s will and had also listed all Fleming s life insurance policies with beneficiaries including a partnership policy on the lives of Fleming Dunmore and Anton Varcek paying each of the survivors twenty five thousand dollars I see Gladys and Geraldine and Nelda each get a third of Fleming s Premix stock Rand commented But before they can have the certificates transferred to them they have to sign over their voting power to the board of directors Evidently Fleming didn t approve of the feminine touch in business Yeah isn t that a dandy Ritter asked The directors are elected by majority vote of the stockholders They now have the voting power of a majority of the stock that makes the present board self perpetuating and responsible only to each other So it does but that wasn t what I was thinking of According to Tip the board is one hundred per cent in favor of the merger with National Milling Packaging We ll have to suppose Fleming knew that there must have been considerable intramural acrimony on the subject while he was still alive Now since he opposed the merger if he had intended committing suicide he would have made some other arrangement wouldn t he At least one would suppose so Well then Rand asked why since he is so worried about these suicide rumors doesn t Goode use the one argument which would utterly disprove them Or is there some reason why he doesn t want to call attention to the fact that Fleming s death is what makes the merger possible Well that would be calling attention to the fact that the merger made Fleming s death necessary Ritter pointed out He poured more beer into his glass While we re on it what s the angle on this butler s livery I was supposed to bring I brought my tux and I borrowed a striped vest from the Theatrical Property Exchange and I brought that Dago three hundred eighty of yours But what makes you think the Flemings are going to be needing a new butler You going to poison the one they have The one they have has been exceeding his duties Rand said He was supposed to clean the pistol collection Not content with that he s been cleaning it out I know it was the butler He went at length into his reasons for thinking so and described the modus operandi of the thefts Now all this is just theory so far but when I m able to prove it I m going to put the arm on this Walters if it s right in the middle of dinner and he only has the roast half served And I want you ready to step into the vacancy thus created I m going to be busy as a pup in a fireplug factory with this Rivers thing and I ll need some checking upping done inside the Fleming household He went on in meticulous detail to explain about the Rivers murder I ll have some work for you before you re ready to start buttling too Disencumbering himself of the two percussion revolvers he laid them on the table I want you to take these and show them to this barbecue man Get from him a positive statement preferably in writing as to which if either he sold to Lane Fleming You might show your Agency card and claim to be checking up on some stolen pistols that have been recovered Then if he identifies the Leech Rigdon take the Colt and show it to Elmer Umholtz You want to be careful how you handle him we may want him for puncturing Rivers though I m inclined to doubt that as of now Get him to tell you yes or no whether he reblued it and replated the back strap and trigger guard and if he did it for Rivers and if so when I know that s been done the bluing is too dark for a Civil War period job the frame which ought to be case hardened in colors has been blued like the barrel and cylinder the cylinder engraving is almost obliterated and you can see a few rust pits that have been blued over But I want to know if this gun was ever in Rivers s shop that s the important thing Uh huh Got the addresses Rand furnished them and Ritter noted them down The waitress wandered back to see if they wanted anything else she gave a small squeak of surprise when she saw the two big six shooters on the table Rand and Ritter repeated their orders and when she brought back the drinks the Colt and the Leech Rigdon were out of sight The way I see it everybody who s within a light year of this Rivers killing is trying to pin the medal on somebody else Ritter was saying The Lawrence girl was afraid young Jarrett had done it right away she sicced you onto Gillis Gillis didn t lose any time putting McKenna and Farnsworth onto Gresham Gresham s the only one who didn t have a patsy ready you re supposed to dig one up for him And Jarrett the first chance he gets introduces Umholtz He stared into his beer as though he thought Ultimate Verity might be lurking somewhere under the suds Do you think it might be possible that Rivers bumped Fleming off in spite of his getting killed later he asked Anything s possible Rand replied except where some structural contradiction is involved like scoring thirteen with one throw of a pair of dice Yes he could have The way the Flemings leave their garage open as long as any of the cars are out anybody could have sneaked into the house from the garage and gone up from the library to the gunroom The only question in my mind is whether Rivers would have known about that That lawsuit and criminal action that Fleming was going to start and that s been verified from sources independent of Goode was a good sound motive And say he took the Leech Rigdon away after leaving the Colt in Fleming s hand selling it to some collector who d put it in with a hundred or so other pistols would be a good way of disposing of it And I can understand his trying to buy the Colt to get it out of circulation Rand sipped his Bourbon But that leaves us with the question of who killed Rivers and why Well because Fleming is dead and it doesn t matter whether he was murdered or died of old age Walters starts robbing the collection He sells the pistols to Rivers Ritter reconstructed And as Rivers doesn t want them around his shop till they ve had time to cool off he stores them with this Umholtz character who seems to have been in plenty of crooked deals with Rivers in the past The pistols are worth about ten grand and nobody knows where they are but Rivers and Umholtz and if Rivers drops dead all of a sudden nobody will know where they are except Umholtz and in a couple of years he can get them sold off and have the money all to himself Yes Dave that s good sound murder too And Rivers would sit down and drink with Umholtz and Umholtz could take that Mauser out of the rack right in front of Rivers and Rivers wouldn t suspect a thing till it was too late Of course it depends upon two unverified assumptions One that the pistols were sold to Rivers and two that Rivers stored them with Umholtz And three that Walters stole the pistols in the first place Ritter added You know it s possible that somebody else in that house might have stolen them Yes As I said anything s possible within structural limits but possibilities exist on different orders of probability We can t try to consider all the possibilities in any case because they are indefinitely numerous the best we can do is screen out all the low order probabilities list the high order probabilities and revise our list when and as new data comes to light Well I ve told you why I think Walters is a good suspect From what I ve seen of that household I think Walters was personally loyal to Lane Fleming and I don t believe he feels any loyalty to anybody else there with the exception of Gladys Fleming He might keep quiet about the missing pistols if she were the thief if Dunmore or Varcek or either of the girls had done the stealing he d tell Gladys and she d pass it on to me She would be glad of anything that could be used against any of the others And if on the other hand she had stolen the pistols herself she wouldn t have wanted me poking around and wouldn t have brought me in at least not to handle the collection Rand looked regretfully at his empty glass and decided against ordering another Dave I just thought of something he said How do you think this would work He told Ritter what he had thought of Ritter drank beer slowly and meditatively It just might work he considered I ve seen that gag work a hundred times hell I ve used something like that myself at least fifty times and so have you And I don t think Walters would be familiar enough with dick practice to see what you were doing But if it turns out that Walters didn t sell the pistols to Rivers at all what then Well if he sold them to Umholtz Pierre Jarrett s theory is still valid until disproved Rand said And if he didn t sell them either to Rivers or Umholtz we ll have to conclude that Rivers and Fleming were killed by the same person the Rivers killing being a security measure That is unless we find that Rivers was killed by Pierre Jarrett which is a sort of medium high order probability Jarrett and the girl left Gresham s early enough for him to have killed Rivers they were both pretty hard hit by that twenty five grand blockbuster Rivers had dropped on them Give me back that Colt Dave All you have to do is get an identification on the Leech Rigdon from the barbecue man I m going to let Mick McKenna handle Umholtz one way or another after we ve concluded the Walters experiment Until then we don t want to stir Umholtz up at all CHAPTER fifteen Parking in the drive Rand entered the Fleming house by the front door The butler must have been busy with his pre dinner tasks in the rear it was Gladys herself who admitted him Stay out of there she warned him taking his arm and guiding him away from the parlor doorway Nelda and Geraldine are in there ignoring each other If you go in they ll start talking to you and then they ll start talking at each other through you and the air will be full of tomahawks in a jiffy Let s go up in the gunroom that s out of the battle zone What started the hostilities this time Rand asked going up the stairway with her Oh Geraldine lost Nelda s place marker out of the Kinsey Report or something She shrugged Mainly reaction to Rivers s death That was a great blow to all of us twenty five thousand dollars worth of blow It was a blow to me too but I m not letting it throw me What were you doing all afternoon Trying to keep the rest of our prospects out of jail This sixteenth witted District Attorney you have in this county had the idea he could charge Stephen Gresham with the killing I had a time talking him out of it and I m still not sure how far I succeeded And I was trying to get a line on where those pistols got to Ssssh They reached the top of the stairs and Rand saw Walters approaching down the hall It was Colonel Rand Walters I let him in myself Are mister Varcek and mister Dunmore here yet mister Dunmore is in the library ma am and mister Varcek is upstairs in his laboratory Dinner will be ready in three quarters of an hour Have you mixed the cocktails You d better do that Serve them in about twenty minutes And you d better go up and warn mister Varcek not to become involved in anything messy before dinner Walters yes ma am d her and started toward the attic stairway Rand and Gladys went into the gunroom Rand turned to the left picked a pistol from the wall and carried it with him as he guided Gladys toward the desk in the corner You think Walters stole them she asked So far I m inclined to Have you told any of the others yet Oh Lord no They d all be sure that I stole them myself I m counting on you to get them back with as little fuss as possible Do you think that was why Rivers was killed After all when a lot of valuable pistols disappear and a crooked dealer is murdered I d expect there to be a connection There could be Did you ever hear any stories about missus Rivers and this young fellow Gillis who works in Rivers s shop Gladys laughed Is that rearing its ugly head in public now she asked Well there s nothing like a good murder to shake the skeletons out of the closets Not that this particular skeleton was ever exactly hidden The stories are numerous and somewhat repetitious Cecil and missus Rivers would be seen together at roadhouses and so on at what they imagined was a safe distance from Rosemont and it was said that when Rivers was away over night Cecil was never seen to leave the Rivers place in the evenings Might this be relevant to Rivers s sudden demise It could be Rand was keeping one eye on the hall door and the other on the head of the spiral stairway Don t mention outside what I told you about Farnsworth having this brainstorm about Stephen Gresham If it got out it might hurt Gresham professionally The fact is Gresham has just retained me to investigate the Rivers murder for him That won t interfere to any great extent with the work I m doing here if necessary I ll bring a couple of my men in from New Belfast to help me on the Rivers operation He broke off abruptly catching a movement at the head of the spiral and lifted the pistol in his hand as though showing it to Gladys See he went on it has two hammers and two nipples but only one barrel It was loaded with two charges one on top of the other the bullet of the rear charge acted as the breech plug for the front charge Oh Walters He affected to catch sight of the butler for the first time Bring me that thirty six Walch revolver will you Yes sir Walters crossing the room veered to the right and went to the middle wall bringing a revolver over to the desk It was a percussion weapon with an abnormally long cylinder The cocktails are served he announced We ll be down in a moment you can put these back where they belong when you find time Rand told him Now here he said to Gladys This is the same idea in a revolver Six chambers two charges in each In theory it was a good idea but in actual practice Walters went out the hall door presumably to call Varcek Rand continued talking about the superposed load principle as used in the Lindsay pistol and the Walch revolver until he was sure the butler was out of hearing Gladys was looking at him in appreciative if slightly punch drunk delight I wondered why you brought that thing over here with you she said Brother was that a quick shift You re really sure he s the one I m not really sure of anything except of my own existence and eventual extinction Rand told her It pretty nearly has to be somebody inside this house I don t think anybody else here yourself included would know enough about arms to rob this collection as selectively as it has been robbed Did you see what just happened here I asked him for one of the most uncommon arms here and he went straight and got it He knows this collection as well as your husband did and I assume he knows values almost as well And of course there was a musket too mister Fleming didn t collect long arms or he d have had one It embodied the same principle as the pistol The legend is that this man Lindsay s brother was a soldier he was supposed to have been killed by Indians who drew the fire of the detail he was with and then charged them when their muskets were empty Rand shrugged Actually the superposed load principle is ancient there s a sixteenth century wheel lock pistol in the Metropolitan Museum in New York firing two shots from the same barrel Varcek and the butler who had entered by the hall door went across the gunroom and down the spiral Rand laid down the pistol and escorted Gladys after them Dunmore and Geraldine were in the library when they went down Geraldine mildly potted was reclining in a chair sipping her drink Dunmore was still radiating his synthetic cheerfulness Get many of the pistols listed Colonel he hailed Rand with jovial condescension No Rand poured two cocktails handing one to Gladys I went to Arnold Rivers s place this morning on a little unfinished business and damn near tripped over Rivers s corpse I spent the rest of the day getting myself disinvolved from the ensuing uproar he told Dunmore You heard about it of course Yes of course Horrible business I hope you didn t get mixed up in it any more than you had to After all you re working for us and if the police knew that we d be bothered too Look here you don t think some of these other people who were after the collection might have killed Rivers to keep him from outbidding them Nelda entering from the hallway caught the last part of that Good God Fred she shrieked at him Don t say things like that Maybe they did but wait till they ve bought the collection and paid for it before you start accusing them I m not accusing anybody Dunmore growled back at her I don t know enough about it to make any accusations All I m saying is Well don t say it then if you don t know what you re talking about his wife retorted In spite of this start dinner passed in relative quiet For the most part they talked about the remaining chances of selling the collection about which nobody was optimistic Rand tried to build up morale with pictures of large museums and important dealers all fairly slavering to get their fangs into the Fleming collection but to little avail A pall of gloom had settled and he was forced to concede that he had at last found somebody who had a valid reason to mourn the sudden and violent end of Arnold Rivers Dinner finished he went up to the gunroom and began compiling his list He found a yardstick and thumbtacked it to the edge of the desk to get over all and barrel lengths and used a pair of inside calipers and a decimal inch rule from the workbench to get calibers Sticking a sheet of paper into the portable he began on the wheel locks leaving spaces to insert the description of the stolen pistols when recovered When he had finished the wheel locks he began on the snaphaunces then did the miguelet locks He had begun on the true flintlocks when Walters who had finished his own dinner came up to help him Rand put the butler to work fetching pistols from the racks and replacing those he had already listed After a while Dunmore strolled in You say you found Rivers s body yourself Colonel Rand he asked Rand nodded finished what he was typing and looked up Why yes There were a few details I wanted to clear up with him and I called at his shop this morning I found him lying dead inside He went on to describe the manner in which Rivers had met his death The radio and newspaper accounts were accurate enough in the main there were a few details omitted at the request of the police of course Well you didn t get involved in it though Dunmore inquired anxiously I mean you re not taking any part in the investigation After all we don t want to be mixed up in anything like this In that case mister Dunmore let me advise you not to discuss the matter of Rivers s offer to buy this collection with anybody outside Rand told him So far the police and the District Attorney s office both seem to think that Rivers was killed by somebody whom he d swindled in a business deal Of course they know about the collection being for sale and Rivers s offering to buy it They do Dunmore asked sharply Did you tell them that Naturally I had to account for my presence at Rivers s shop this morning Rand replied I don t know if the idea has occurred to them that somebody might have killed Rivers to eliminate a rival bidder for the collection or not I wouldn t say anything if I were you that might give them the idea The extension phone rang shrilly Walters picked it up spoke into it and listened for a moment Yes Miss Lawrence he s right here You wish to speak to him He handed the phone across the desk to Rand Miss Karen Lawrence for you Colonel Rand Rand took the phone Before he had time to say hello the antique shop girl demanded of him Colonel Rand you must tell me the truth Did you have anything to do with Pierre Jarrett s being arrested What Rand barked Then he softened his voice No on my honor Miss Lawrence I knew nothing about it until this moment Who did it Olsen I don t know what his name was He was a State Police sergeant she replied He and another State Policeman came to the Jarrett house about half an hour ago charged Pierre with the murder of Arnold Rivers and took him away His mother phoned me about it a few minutes ago That God damned two faced Jesuitical bastard Rand exploded Where are you now Here at my shop missus Jarrett is coming here She s afraid the reporters will be coming out to the house as soon as they hear about it and she doesn t want to talk to them All right I ll be there as soon as I can If there s anything I can do to help you you can count on me for it He hung up and turned to Walters Is my car still out front he asked It is Good I ll be gone for a while tell the others I have something to attend to What s happened now Dunmore asked sourly Just what I was speaking about The Gestapo gathered up Pierre Jarrett they seem to have gotten the idea now that the motive may have been competition for the collection Next thing Farnsworth will think he has a case against Carl Gwinnett and he ll land in the jug too I hope you realize that every time something like this happens it peels a thousand or so off the price I ll be able to get for you people for these pistols Dunmore didn t try to ask how that would happen for which Rand was duly thankful he accepted the statement uncritically Walters was staring at Rand in horror saying nothing Rand picked up the outside phone and dialed the same number he had called from the Rivers place that morning Is Sergeant McKenna about He is Fine I d like to speak to him Oh hello Mick Jeff Rand McKenna chuckled out of the receiver Sort of slipped one over on you didn t I he gloated Why I was checking up on those people who were at Gresham s last evening and they all agreed that young Jarrett and the Lawrence girl had left the party about ten So I had a talk with Miss Lawrence and she tried to tell me that Jarrett was with her at her apartment over the antique shop from about ten fifteen until about twelve when another girl she rooms with got home from a date I d of took that too only right across the street from the antique shop there is one of these old hens like you find in every neighborhood the kind that keeps their nose flattened on the window between the curtains checking up on the neighbors I spotted her when I came out of the antique shop so I slipped around to see her and she told me that young Jarrett went into the apartment with the girl at about quarter past ten stayed inside for about twenty minutes then came out and drove away She says Jarrett came back in about half an hour and stayed till this girl who shares the Lawrence girl s apartment a Miss Dupont who teaches sixth grade at Thaddeus Stevens School got home about twelve So there you are Uh huh Dave Ritter said this was going to turn into another Hall Mills case well now you have your Pig Woman Rand said Miss Lawrence shouldn t have lied to you Mick I suppose she got worried when you started asking questions and there s nothing like a good murder in the neighborhood to make liars out of people And damn well I know that McKenna agreed But that isn t all It seems our cruise car crew spotted Jarrett s car standing in Rivers s drive about eleven Just when he was away from the antique shop and about when the M E figures Rivers was getting the business Did they get the number Rand asked Or how did they identify the car Oh they knew it see our boys shoot a lot with the Scott County Rifle Pistol Club and they ve all seen Jarrett s car at the range different times McKenna said A gray nineteen forty seven Plymouth coupe Like I say they knew the car and they knew Jarrett collects guns and the lights were on inside the shop and the shades were drawn so they didn t think anything of it at the time See they went to bed about ten this morning and didn t get up till after five so I didn t find out about it till after supper Rand shrugged and managed to get some of the shrug into his voice Can be at that he said I hope you re not making a mistake Mick if you are his lawyer s going to crucify you What are you using for a motive Rivers was outbidding this crowd Jarrett and the girl were in with They all told me about that McKenna said And he and the girl were planning to use their end of the collection to go into the arms business after they got married Rivers got in the way McKenna at the other end of the line must have shrugged too After all for about four years they d been training Jarrett to overcome resistance with the bayonet so he did just that Maybe so You find out anything about that other matter I was interested in You mean the pistols Huh unh we went over Rivers s place with a fine tooth comb and questioned young Gillis about it and we didn t get a thing You sure those pistols went to Rivers I m not sure of anything at all Rand replied looking at his watch You going to be in say in a couple of hours I want to have a talk with you Sure I ll be around all evening McKenna assured him If we don t have another murder Rand hung up He pulled the sheet out of the typewriter laid it face down on the other sheets he had finished and laid a long seventeenth century Flemish flintlock on top for a paperweight memorizing the position of the pistol relative to the paper under it Put those pistols back on the wall he told Walters indicating several he had laid aside after listing Leave the others there I m not finished with them yet I ll be back before too long If I don t find any more bodies CHAPTER sixteen It was raining again as Rand parked his car about a hundred yards up the street from Karen Lawrence s antique shop The windows were dark but Karen was waiting inside the door for him He entered quickly mindful of the All Seeing Eye across the street and followed her to a back room where missus Jarrett and Dorothy Gresham were All three women regarded him intently as though trying to decide whether he was friend or enemy There was a long silence before missus Jarrett spoke and when she did her words were almost the same as Karen s when she had spoken over the phone Colonel Rand she began obviously struggling with herself you must tell me the truth Did you have anything to do with my son s being arrested Rand shook his head Absolutely nothing missus Jarrett he told her unbuckling the belt of his raincoat and taking it off I have never seriously suspected your son of the Rivers murder I had no idea that McKenna was contemplating arresting him and if I had I would have advised him against it Besides causing annoyance to innocent people McKenna s made a serious tactical error He was misled by appearances and he was afraid I d break this case before he did which I intend to do He turned to Karen Lawrence I talked to McKenna after you called me he as much as admitted making that arrest to get in ahead of me I told you Dorothy Gresham flashed at the others I knew Jeff wouldn t stoop to anything as contemptible as pretending to be Pierre s friend and then getting him arrested Rand permitted himself a wry inward smile He hoped she would not have an opportunity to observe his stooping capabilities before he had finished his various operations at Rosemont I certainly hoped not missus Jarrett relaxed smiling faintly at Rand Pierre likes you Colonel I hated the thought that you might have betrayed him Are you working on the Rivers case too Rand nodded again turning to Dot Gresham Your father retained me to make an investigation he said After that trouble he had with Rivers about that spurious North Cheney he wanted the murderer caught before somebody got around to accusing him You mean there s a chance Dad might be suspected Dot was scared Rand nodded The girl was beginning to look suspiciously at Karen and missus Jarrett Getting ready to toss Pierre to the wolves if her father were in danger Rand suspected He hastened to reassure her Rivers was still alive when your father reached home last evening he told her That s been established She breathed her obvious relief If Gresham had left home after Rand s departure with Philip Cabot she didn t know it Karen on the other hand was growing more and more worried Look Colonel she began They didn t just pull Pierre s name out of a hat They must have had something to suspect him about Yes You shouldn t have lied to McKenna He checked up on your story the woman across the street told him about seeing Pierre leave here a little before eleven and come back about half an hour later I was afraid of that Karen said I forgot all about that old hag There s nothing that can go on around here that she doesn t know about Pierre calls her missus Gtwo And then Rand continued McKenna claims that a car like Pierre s was seen parked in Rivers s drive about the time Pierre was away from here missus Jarrett moaned softly her face already haggard became positively ghastly Karen gasped in fright They only identified it as to model and make they didn t get the license number Where did Pierre go while he was away from here He went out for cigarettes Karen said When we came here from Greshams we made some coffee and then sat and talked for a while and then we found out that we were both out of cigarettes and there weren t any here So Pierre said he d go out and get some He was gone about half an hour when he came back he had a carton and some hot pork sandwiches He d gotten them at the same place as the cigarettes Art Igoe s lunch stand Could Igoe verify that It wouldn t help if he did Igoe s place isn t a five minute drive from Rivers s farther down the road Has Pierre a lawyer Rand asked No Not yet We were just talking about that Dad would defend him Dot suggested Of course he s not a criminal lawyer Carter Tipton in New Belfast Rand told them He s my lawyer he s gotten me out of more jams than you could shake a stick at Where s the telephone I ll call him now You think he d defend Pierre Unless I m badly mistaken Pierre isn t going to need any trial defense Rand told them He will need somebody to look after his interests and we ll try to get him out on a writ as soon as possible He looked at his watch It was ten minutes to nine It was hard to say where Carter Tipton would be at the moment his manservant would probably know Karen showed him the phone and he started to put through a person to person call It was eleven o clock before he backed his car into the Fleming garage and the rain had turned to a wet sticky snow All the Fleming cars were in but Rand left the garage doors open He also left his hat and coat in the car After locating and talking to Tipton and arranging for him to meet Dave Ritter at the Rosemont Inn he had gone to the State Police substation where he had talked at length with Mick McKenna He had been compelled to tell the State Police sergeant a number of things he had intended keeping to himself When he was through McKenna went so far as to admit that he had been a trifle hasty in arresting Pierre Jarrett Rand suspected that he was mentally kicking himself with hobnailed boots for his premature act He also submitted for McKenna s approval the scheme he had outlined to Dave Ritter and obtained a promise of cooperation When he entered the Fleming library en route to the gunroom he found the entire family assembled there with them was Humphrey Goode As he came in they broke off what had evidently been an acrimonious dispute and gave him their undivided attention Geraldine relaxed in a chair was smoking for once she didn t have a glass in her hand Gladys occupied another chair she was smoking too Nelda had been pacing back and forth like a caged tiger at Rand s entrance she turned to face him and Rand wondered whether she thought he was Clyde Beatty or a side of beef Goode and Dunmore sat together on the sofa forming what looked like a bilateral offensive and defensive alliance and Varcek looking more than ever like Rudolf Hess stood with folded arms in one corner Now see here Rand Dunmore began as soon as the detective was inside the room we want to know just exactly for whom you re working around here And I demand to know where you ve been since you left here this evening And I Goode piped up must protest most strongly against your involvement in this local murder case I am informed that while in the employ of this family you accepted a retainer from another party to investigate the death of Arnold Rivers That s correct Rand informed him Then he turned to Gladys Just for the record missus Fleming do you recall any stipulation to the effect that the business of handling this pistol collection should have the exclusive attention of my agency I certainly don t recall anything of the sort No of course not she replied As long as the collection is sold to the best advantage I haven t any interest in any other business of your agency and have no right to have She turned to the others I thought I made that clear to all of you You didn t answer my question Dunmore yelled at him I don t intend to You aren t my client and I m not answerable to you Well you carry my authorization Goode supported him I think I have a right to know what s being done As far as the collection s concerned yes As for the Rivers murder or my armored car service or any other business of the Tri State Agency no Well you made use of my authorization to get that revolver from Kirchner Goode began Aah Rand cried So that concerns the Rivers murder does it Well When did you find that out now When Kirchner called you you had no objection to his giving me that revolver What changed your mind for you Didn t you know that Rivers was dead then Rand watched Goode trying to assimilate that Or didn t you think I knew Goode cleared his throat noisily twisting his mouth The others were looking back and forth from him to Rand in obvious bewilderment they realized that Rand had pulled some kind of a rabbit out of a hat but they couldn t understand how he d done it What I mean is that since then you have allowed yourself to become involved in this murder case You have let it be publicly known that you are a private detective working for the Fleming family Goode orated How long then will it be before it will be said by all sorts of irresponsible persons that you are also investigating the death of Lane Fleming Well Rand asked patiently Are you afraid people will start calling that a murder too Gladys was looking at him apprehensively as though she were watching him juggle four live hand grenades Is anybody saying that now Varcek asked sharply Not that I know of Rand lied But if Goode keeps on denying it they will You know perfectly well Goode exploded that I am alluding to these unfounded and mischievous rumors of suicide which are doing the Premix Company so much harm My God mister Rand can t you realize Oh come off it Goode Varcek broke in amusedly We all Colonel Rand included know that you started those rumors yourself Very clever to start a rumor by denying it But scarcely original Doctor Goebbels was doing it almost twenty years ago My God is that true Nelda demanded You mean he s been going around starting all these stories about Father committing suicide She turned on Goode like an enraged panther Why you lying old son of a bitch she screamed at him Of course He wants to start a selling run on Premix Varcek explained to her He s buying every share he can get his hands on We all are He turned to Rand I d advise you to buy some if you can find any Colonel Rand In a month or so it s going to be a really good thing I know about the merger I am buying Rand told him But are you sure of what Goode s been doing Of course Gladys put in contemptuously I always wondered about this suicide talk I couldn t see why Humphrey was so perturbed about it Anything that lowered the market price of Premix at this time would be to his advantage She looked at Goode as though he had six legs and a hard shell You know Humphrey I can t say I exactly thank you for this Did you know about it Nelda demanded of her husband You did My God Fred you are a filthy specimen Oh you know anything to turn a dishonest dollar Geraldine piped up Like the late Arnold Rivers s ten thousand offer Say I wonder if that mightn t be what Rivers died of Raising the price and leaving Fred out in the cold Dunmore simply stared at her making a noise like a chicken choking on a piece of string Well all this isn t my pidgin Rand said to Gladys I only work here Deo gratias and I still have some work to do With that he walked past Goode and Dunmore and ascended the spiral stairway to the gunroom Even at the desk in the far corner of the room he could hear them going at it hammer and tongs in the library Sometimes it would be Nelda s strident shrieks that would dominate the bedlam below sometimes it would be Fred Dunmore roaring like a bull Now and then Humphrey Goode would rumble something and once in a while he could hear Gladys s trained and modulated voice Usually any remark she made would be followed by outraged shouts from Goode and Dunmore like the crash of falling masonry after the whip crack of a tank gun At first Rand eavesdropped shamelessly but there was nothing of more than comic interest it was just a routine parade and guard mount of the older and more dependable family skeletons with special emphasis on Humphrey Goode s business and professional ethics When he was satisfied that he would hear nothing having any bearing on the death of Lane Fleming Rand went back to his work After a while the tumult gradually died out Rand was still typing when Gladys came up the spiral and perched on the corner of the desk picking up a long brass barreled English flintlock and hefting it You know I sometimes wonder why we don t all come up here break out the ammunition pick our weapons and settle things she said It never was like this when Lane was around Oh Nelda and Geraldine would bare their teeth at each other once in a while but now this place has turned into a miniature Iwo Jima I don t know how much longer I m going to be able to take it I m developing combat fatigue It s snowing Rand mentioned Let s throw them out into the storm I can t I have to give Nelda and Geraldine a home as long as they live she replied Terms of the will Oh well Geraldine ll drink herself to death in a few years and Nelda will elope with a prize fighter sometime Why don t you have the house haunted The Tri State Agency has an excellent house haunting department Anything you want poltergeists apparitions cold clammy hands in the dark footsteps in the attic clanking chains and eldritch screams banshees Any three for the price of two It wouldn t work Geraldine is so used to polka dotted dinosaurs and Little Green Men from Mars that she wouldn t mind an ordinary ghost and Nelda d probably try to drag it into bed with her She laid down the pistol and slid off the desk Well pleasant dreams I ll see you in the morning After she had left the gunroom Rand looked at his watch It was a very precise instrument a Swiss military watch with a sweep second hand and two timing dials It had formerly been the property of an Obergruppenfuehrer of the S S and Rand had appropriated it to replace his own broken while choking the Obergruppenfuehrer to death in an alley in Palermo He zeroed the timing dials and pressed the start button Then he stood for a time over the old cobbler s bench mentally reconstructing what had been done after Lane Fleming had been shot after which he hurried down the spiral and along the rear hall to the garage where he snatched his hat and coat from the car He threw the coat over his shoulders like a cloak and went on outside He made his way across the lawn to the orchard through the orchard to the lawn of Humphrey Goode s house and across this to Goode s side door He stood there for a few seconds imagining himself opening the door and going inside Then he stopped the timing hands and returned to the Fleming house locking the garage doors behind him In the garage he looked at the watch It had taken exactly six minutes and twenty two seconds He knew that he could move more rapidly than the dumpy lawyer but to balance that he had been moving over more or less unfamiliar ground He left his hat and trench coat in the car and went upstairs Undressing he went into the bathroom in his dressing gown spent about twenty minutes shaving and taking a shower and then returned to his own room CHAPTER seventeen When he rose the next morning Rand noticed something which had escaped his eye when he had gone to bed the night before His thirty eight special in its shoulder holster was lying on the dresser he had not bothered putting it on when he had gone to see Rivers the morning before and it had lain there all the previous day He distinctly remembered having moved it shortly after dinner when he had gone to his room for some notes he had made on the collection However between that time and the present it had managed to flop itself over the holster was now lying back up Intrigued by such a remarkable accomplishment in an inanimate object Rand crossed the room in the dress of nature in which he slept and looked more closely at it receiving a second and considerably more severe surprise The revolver in the holster was not his own It was to be sure a thirty eight Colt Detective Special and it was in his holster but it was not the Detective Special he had brought with him from New Belfast His own gun was of the second type with the corners rounded off the grip this one was of the original issue with the square Police Positive grip His own gun had seen hard service this one was in practically new condition There was a discrepancy of about thirty thousand in the serial numbers His gun had been loaded in six chambers with the standard one hundred fifty eight grain loads this one was loaded in only five with one hundred forty eight grain mid range wad cutter loads Rand stood for some time looking at the revolver The worst of it was that he couldn t be exactly sure when the substitution had been made It might have happened at any time between eight o clock and twelve when he had gone to bed He rather suspected that it had been accomplished while he had been in the bathroom however Dumping out the five rounds in the cylinder he inspected the changeling carefully It was he thought the revolver Lane Fleming had kept in the drawer of the gunroom desk There was no obstruction in the two inch barrel the weapon had not been either fired or cleaned recently the firing pin had not been shortened the mainspring showed the proper amount of tension and the mechanism functioned as it should There was a chance that somebody had made up five special hand loads for him using nitroglycerin instead of powder but that didn t seem likely as it would not necessitate a switch of revolvers There were four or five other possibilities all of them disquieting he would have been a great deal less alarmed if somebody had taken a shot at him Getting a box of cartridges out of his Gladstone he filled the cylinder with one hundred fifty eight grain loads When he went to the bathroom he took the revolver in his dressing gown pocket when he dressed he put on the shoulder holster and pocketed a handful of spare rounds Anton Varcek was loitering in the hall when he came out he gave Rand good morning and fell into step with him as they went toward the stairway Colonel Rand I wish you wouldn t mention this to anybody but I would like a private talk with you the Czech said After Fred Dunmore has left for the plant Would that be possible Yes mister Varcek I ll be in the gunroom all morning working They reached the bottom of the stairway where Gladys was waiting Understand Rand continued I never really studied biology I was exposed to it in school but at that time I was preoccupied with the so called social sciences Varcek took the conversational shift in stride Of course he agreed But you are trained in the scientific method of thought That at least is something When I have opportunity to explain my ideas more fully I believe you will be interested in my conclusions They greeted Gladys and walked with her to the dining room As usual Geraldine was absent Dunmore and Nelda were already at the table eating in silence Both of them seemed self conscious after the pitched battle of the evening before Rand broke the tension by offering Humphrey Goode in the role of whipping boy he had no sooner made a remark in derogation of the lawyer than Nelda and her husband broke into a duet of vituperation In the end everybody affected to agree that the whole unpleasant scene had been entirely Goode s fault and a pleasant spirit of mutual cordiality prevailed Finally Dunmore got up wiping his mouth on a napkin Well it s about time to get to work he said We might as well save gas and both use my car Coming Anton I m sorry Fred I can t leave yet I have some notes upstairs I have to get in order I was working on this new egg powder last evening and I want to continue the experiments at the plant laboratory I think I know how we ll be able to cut production costs on it about five per cent And boy can we stand that Dunmore grunted Well be seeing you at the plant Rand waited until Dunmore had left then went across to the library and up to the gunroom As soon as he entered the room above he saw what was wrong The previous thefts had been masked by substitutions but whoever had helped himself to one of the more recent metallic cartridge specimens the night before hadn t bothered with any such precaution and a pair of vacant screwhooks disclosed the removal A second look told Rand what had been taken the little twenty five Webley Scott from the Pollard collection with the silencer The pistol trade which had been imposed on him had disquieted him now he had no hesitation in admitting to himself he was badly scared Whoever had taken that little automatic had had only one thought in mind noiseless and stealthy murder Very probably with one Colonel Jefferson Davis Rand in mind as the prospective corpse He sat down at the desk and started typing at the same time trying to keep the hall door and the head of the spiral stairway under observation It was an attempt which was responsible for quite a number of typographical errors Finally Anton Varcek came in from the hallway approached the desk and sat down in an armchair Colonel Rand he began in a low voice I have been thinking over a remark you made last evening Were you serious when you alluded to the possibility that Lane Fleming had been murdered Well the idea had occurred to me Rand understated keeping his right hand close to his left coat lapel I take it you have begun to doubt that it was an accident I would doubt a theory that a skilled chemist would accidentally poison himself in his own laboratory Varcek replied I would not for instance pour myself a drink from a bottle labeled HNO three in the belief that it contained vodka I believe that Lane Fleming should be credited with equal caution about firearms Yet you were the first to advance the theory that the shooting had been an accident Rand pointed out I have a strong dislike for firearms Varcek looked at the pistols on the desk as though they were so many rattlesnakes I have always feared an accident with so many in the house When I saw him lying dead with a revolver in his hand that was my first thought First thoughts are so often illogical emotional And you didn t consider the possibility of suicide No Absolutely not The Czech was emphatic The idea never occurred to me then or since Lane Fleming was not the man to do that He was deeply religious much interested in church work And aside from that he had no reason to wish to die His health was excellent much better than that of many men twenty years his junior He had no business worries The company is doing well we had large Government contracts during the war and no reconversion problems afterward we now have more orders than we have plant capacity to fill and mister Fleming was consulting with architects about plant expansion We have been spared any serious labor troubles And mister Fleming s wife was devoted to him and he to her He had no family troubles Rand raised an eyebrow over that last No he inquired Varcek flushed Please Colonel Rand you must not judge by what you have seen since you came here When Lane Fleming was alive such scenes as that in the library last evening would have been unthinkable Now this family is like a ship without a captain And since you do not think that he shot himself either deliberately or inadvertently there remains the alternative that he was shot by somebody else either deliberately or very improbably by inadvertence Rand said I think the latter can be safely disregarded Let s agree that it was murder and go on from there Varcek nodded You are investigating it as such he asked I am appraising and selling this pistol collection Rand told him wearily I am curious about who killed Fleming of course for my own protection I like to know the background of situations in which I am involved But do you think Humphrey Goode would bring me here to stir up a lot of sleeping dogs that might awake and grab him by the pants seat Or did you think that uproar in the library last evening was just a prearranged act I had not thought of Humphrey Goode It was my understanding that missus Fleming brought you here missus Fleming wants her money out of the collection as soon as possible Rand said To reopen the question of her husband s death and start a murder investigation wouldn t exactly expedite things I m just a more or less innocent bystander who wants to know whether there is going to be any trouble or not Now you came here to tell me what happened on the night of Lane Fleming s death didn t you Yes We had finished dinner at about seven Varcek said Lane had been up here for about an hour before dinner working on his new revolver he came back here immediately after he was through eating A little later when I had finished my coffee I came upstairs by the main stairway The door of this room was open and Lane was inside sitting on that old shoemaker s bench working on the revolver He had it apart and he was cleaning a part of it The round part where the loads go the drum is it Cylinder How was he cleaning it Rand asked He was using a small brush like a test tube brush he was scrubbing out the holes The chambers He was using a solvent that smelled something like banana oil Rand nodded He could visualize the progress Fleming had made If Varcek was telling the truth and he remembered what Walters had told him the last flicker of possibility that Lane Fleming s death had been accidental vanished I talked with him for some ten minutes or so Varcek continued about some technical problems at the plant All the while he kept on working on this revolver and finished cleaning out the cylinder and also the barrel He was beginning to put the revolver together when I left him and went up to my laboratory About fifteen minutes later I heard the shot For a moment I debated with myself as to what I had heard and then I decided to come down here But first I had to take a solution off a Bunsen burner where I had been heating it and take the temperature of it and then wash my hands because I had been working with poisonous materials I should say all this took me about five minutes When I got down here the door of this room was closed and locked That was most unusual and I became really worried I pounded on the door and called out but I got no answer Then Fred Dunmore came out of the bathroom attached to his room with nothing on but a bathrobe His hair was wet and he was in his bare feet and making wet tracks on the floor From there on Varcek s story tallied closely with what Rand had heard from Gladys and from Walters Everybody s story tallied where it could be checked up on You think the murderer locked the door behind him when he came out of here Varcek asked I think somebody locked the door sometime It might have been the murderer or it might have been Fleming at the murderer s suggestion But why couldn t the murderer have left the gunroom by that stairway Varcek looked around furtively and lowered his voice Now he looked like Rudolf Hess discussing what to do about Ernst Roehm Colonel Rand don t you think that Fred Dunmore could have shot Lane Fleming and then have gone to his room and waited until I came downstairs he asked Here we go again Rand thought Just like the Rivers case everybody putting the finger on everybody else And have undressed and taken a bath while he was waiting he inquired You came down here only five minutes after the shot In that time Dunmore would have had to wipe his fingerprints off the revolver leave it in Fleming s hand put that oily rag in his other hand set the deadlatch cross the hall undress get into the bathtub and start bathing That s pretty fast work But who else could have done it Well you for one You could have come down from your lab shot Fleming faked the suicide and then gone out locking the door behind you and made a demonstration in the hall until you were joined by Dunmore and the ladies Then with your innocence well established you could have waited until your wife prompted you as she or somebody else was sure to and then have gone down to the library and up the spiral Rand said That s about as convincing no more and no less as your theory about Dunmore Varcek agreed sadly And I cannot prove otherwise can I You can advance your Dunmore theory to establish reasonable doubt Rand told him And if Dunmore s accused he can do the same with the theory I ve just outlined And as long as reasonable doubt exists neither of you could be convicted This isn t the Third Reich or the Soviet Union they wouldn t execute both of you to make sure of getting the right one Both of you had a motive in this Mill Pack merger that couldn t have been negotiated while Fleming lived One or the other of you may be guilty on the other hand both of you may be innocent Then who Varcek had evidently bet his roll on Dunmore There is no one else who could have done it The garage doors were open if I recall Rand pointed out Anybody could have slipped in that way come through the rear hall to the library and up the spiral and have gone out the same way Some of the French Maquis I worked with during the war could have wiped out the whole family one after the other that way A look of intense concentration settled upon Varcek s face He nodded several times Yes Of course he said his thought chain complete And you spoke of motive From what you must have heard last evening Humphrey Goode was no less interested in the merger than Fred Dunmore or myself And then there is your friend Gresham he is quite familiar with the interior of this house and who knows what terms National Milling Packaging may have made with him contingent upon his success in negotiating the merger I m not forgetting either of them Rand said Or Fred Dunmore or you If you did it I d advise you to confess now it ll save everybody yourself included a lot of trouble Varcek looked at him fascinated Why I believe you regard all of us just as I do my fruit flies he said at length You know Colonel Rand you are not a comfortable sort of man to have around He rose slowly Naturally I ll not mention this interview I suppose you won t want to either I d advise you not to talk about it at that Rand said The situation here seems to be very delicate and rather explosive Oh as you go out I d be obliged to you for sending Walters up here I still have this work here and I ll need his help After Varcek had left him Rand looked in the desk drawer verifying his assumption that the thirty eight he had seen there was gone He wondered where his own was at the moment When the butler arrived he was put to work bringing pistols to the desk carrying them back to the racks taking measurements and the like All the while Rand kept his eye on the head of the spiral stairway Finally he caught a movement and saw what looked like the top of a peak crowned gray felt hat between the spindles of the railing He eased the Detective Special out of its holster and got to his feet All right he sang out Come on up Walters looked obviously startled at the revolver that had materialized in Rand s hand and at the two men who were emerging from the spiral He was even more startled it seemed when he realized that they wore the uniform of the State Police What What s the meaning of this sir he demanded of Rand You re being arrested Rand told him Just stand still now He stepped around the desk and frisked the butler quickly wondering if he were going to find a twenty five Webley Scott automatic or his own thirty eight Special When he found neither he holstered his temporary weapon If this is your idea of a joke sir permit me to say that it isn t It s no joke son Sergeant McKenna told him In this country a police officer doesn t have to recite any incantation before he makes an arrest any more than he needs to read any Riot Act before he can start shooting but it won t hurt to warn you that anything you say can be used against you At least I must insist upon knowing why I am being arrested Walters said icily Oh Don t you know McKenna asked Why you re being arrested for the murder of Arnold Rivers For a moment the butler retained his professional glacial disdain and then the bottom seemed to drop suddenly out of him Rand suppressed a smile at this minor verification of his theory Walters had been expecting to be accused of larceny and was prepared to treat the charge with contempt Then he had realized after a second or so what the State Police sergeant had really said Good God gentlemen He looked from Mick McKenna to Corporal Kavaalen to Rand and back again in bewilderment You surely can t mean that We can and we do Rand told him You stole about twenty five pistols from this collection after mister Fleming died and sold them to Arnold Rivers Then when I came here and started checking up on the collection you knew the game was up So last evening you took out the station wagon and went to see Rivers and you killed him to keep him from turning state s evidence and incriminating you Or maybe you killed him in a quarrel over the division of the loot I hope for your sake that it was the latter if it was you may get off with second degree murder But if you can t prove that there was no premeditation you re tagged for the electric chair But But I didn t kill mister Rivers Walters stammered I barely knew the gentleman I saw him once or twice when he was here to see mister Fleming but outside of that Outside of that you sold him about twenty five of these pistols and got a like number of junk pistols from him for replacements He took the list Pierre Jarrett and Stephen Gresham had compiled out of his pocket and began reading Italian wheel lock pistol late sixteenth or early seventeenth century pair Italian snaphaunce pistols by Lazarino Cominazo He finished the list and put it away I think we ve missed one or two but that ll do for the time But I didn t sell those pistols to mister Rivers Walters expostulated I sold them to mister Carl Gwinnett I can prove it That Rand had not expected Go on he jeered I suppose you have receipts for all of them Fences always do that of course But I did sell them to mister Gwinnett I can take you to his house if you get a search warrant and show you where he has them hidden in the garret He was afraid to offer them for sale until after this collection had been broken up and sold he still has every one of them McKenna spat out an obscenity Aren t we ever going to have any luck he demanded Jarrett out on a writ this morning and now this But he ain t in the clear Kavaalen argued Maybe he didn t sell Rivers the pistols but maybe he did kill him Dope McKenna abused his subordinate If he didn t sell Rivers the pistols why would he kill him He s only said he sold them to Gwinnett Rand pointed out Then he turned to Walters Look here if we find those pistols in Gwinnett s possession you re clear on this murder charge There s still a slight matter of larceny but that doesn t involve the electric chair You take my advice and make a confession now and then accompany these officers to Gwinnett s place and show them the pistols If you do that you may expect clemency on the theft charge too Oh I will sir I ll sign a full confession and take these police officers and show them every one of the pistols Rand put paper and carbon sheets in the typewriter As Walters dictated he typed the butler listed every pistol which Gresham and Pierre Jarrett had found missing and a cased presentation pair of forty four Colt eighteen sixty s that nobody had missed He signed the triplicate copies willingly he didn t seem to mind signing himself into jail as long as he thought he was signing himself out of the electric chair The book in which Fleming had recorded his pistols he still had he had removed it from the gunroom and was keeping it in his room He said he would get it along with the things he would need to take to jail with him When it was finished they all went down the spiral stairway into the library Nelda was standing at the foot of it Evidently she had been listening to what had been going on upstairs You dirty sneak she yelled catching sight of Walters After all we ve done for you you turn around and rob us I hope they give you twenty years Walters turned to McKenna Sergeant I am willing to accept the penalty of the law for what I have done but I don t believe sir that it includes being yapped at by this vulgar bitch Nelda let out an inarticulate howl of fury and sprang at him nails raking Corporal Kavaalen caught her wrist before she could claw the prisoner That s enough you he told her You stop that or you ll spend a night in jail yourself She jerked her arm loose from his grasp and flung out of the library As she went out Gladys entered Rand who had been bringing up in the rear stepped down from the stairway He confessed he said softly We had to bluff it out of him but he came across Sold the pistols to Carl Gwinnett We re going now to pick up Gwinnett and the pistols I m glad you found the pistols she told him But what re we going to do over the week end for a butler Rand snapped his fingers Dammit I never thought of that He allowed his brow to furrow with thought I won t promise anything but I may be able to dig up somebody for you for a day or so Some of my friends are visiting their son in a Naval hospital on the West Coast and their butler may be glad for a chance to pick up a little extra money Shall I call him and find out Oh Colonel Rand would you I d be eternally grateful It was just as easy as that CHAPTER eighteen Dave Ritter driving his small coupe kept his eye on the white State Police car ahead Rand who had come away from the Fleming home in the white car had called Ritter from the office of the Justice of the Peace while waiting for Walters to put up bail after his hearing Now en route to Gwinnett s he was briefing his assistant on what had happened So everything s set he concluded missus Fleming jumped at it she knows you re coming in your own car which you may keep in the garage there You ve left New Belfast about now if you show up around three you ll be safe on the driving time Your name is Davies I decided on that in case I suffer a lapsus linguae and call you Dave in front of somebody Yeah I ll have to watch and not call you Jeff Colonel Rand sir He nodded toward the glove box That Leech Rigdon s in there you d better get it out before I go to the Flemings The guy at the drive in made a positive identification it s the one he sold Fleming I saw the rest of the pistols he has there don t waste time looking him up about them They stink And I saw Tip this morning He got young Jarrett sprung on a writ He thought for a moment What does this do to the Rivers and Fleming murders We can look for one man for both jobs now Rand said Probably the motive for Fleming was that merger he was so violently opposed to and the Rivers killing must have been a security measure of some sort There that must be Gwinnett s now The State Police car had pulled up in front of a large three story frame house with faded and discolored paint and jigsaw scrollwork around the cornices standing among a clump of trees beside the road McKenna and Kavaalen got out with Walters between them and started up the path to the front steps Ritter stopped behind the white sedan and he and Rand got out By that time Walters and the two policemen were on the front porch Suddenly Ritter turned and sprinted around the right side of the house Rand stood looking after him for a moment then started to follow more slowly as he did a shot slammed in the rear Jerking out the changeling thirty eight special he whirled and ran around the left side of the house arriving at the rear in time to see Gwinnett standing on a boardwalk between the house and the stable garage behind with his hands raised There was a fresh bullet scar on the boardwalk at his feet Ritter was covering him from the corner of the house with the three hundred eighty Beretta Rand strolled over to Gwinnett frisked him and told him to put his hands down Nice Dave he complimented I thought of that too about a minute too late As soon as he saw Walters coming up the walk with the police he knew what had happened Come on Gwinnett we ll go through the house and let them in Gwinnett s eyes darted from side to side like the eyes of a trapped animal I don t know what you re talking about he said stiff lipped What is this a stick up Nobody bothered to tell him to stop kidding They marched him through the kitchen where a Negro girl her arms white with flour was dithering in fright and into the front hall A woman in a faded housedress had just admitted the two officers and the former Fleming butler You goddam rat Gwinnett yelled at Walters as soon as he saw him For God s sake Carl the woman begged Don t make things any worse than they are Keep quiet All right Gwinnett McKenna said We re arresting you receiving stolen goods and accessory to larceny We have a search warrant Want to see it So you have a search warrant Gwinnett said So go ahead and search if you don t find anything you ll plant something I want to call my lawyer That s your right McKenna told him Aarvo take him to a phone let him call the White House if he wants to He turned to Walters Now where would he have this stuff stashed In the garret sir I know the way As Kavaalen accompanied Gwinnett to the phone Walters started upstairs Rand and McKenna followed with missus Gwinnett bringing up the rear During the search of the attic she stood to one side watching the ex butler dig into a pile of pistols This is one gentlemen Walters said producing a Springfield eighteen eighteen Model flintlock And here is the Walker Colt and the forty caliber Colt Paterson and the Hall Eventually he had them all assembled including the five cased sets Rand found a couple of empty bushel baskets and laid the pistols in them between layers of old newspapers He picked up one and McKenna took the other while Walters piled the five flat hardwood cases into his arms like cordwood Still saying nothing her eyes stony with hatred the woman followed them downstairs The rest of the afternoon was consumed with formalities Gwinnett was given a hearing at which he was represented by a lawyer straight out of a B grade gangster picture Rand had a heated argument with an over zealous Justice of the Peace who wanted to impound the pistols and jackknife mark them for identification but after hurling bloodthirsty threats of a damage suit for an astronomical figure he managed to retain possession of the recovered weapons Ritter left at a little past three to report for duty in the Fleming household Rand rode with McKenna and Kavaalen to the State Police substation where the pistols were transferred to McKenna s personal car in which they and Rand were to be transported back to the Fleming place It was five o clock before Rand had finished telling the sergeant and the corporal everything he felt they ought to know When we get to the Flemings I ll give you that revolver I got from the coroner he finished One of your boys can take it to this fellow Umholtz and get him to identify it You might also show it to young Gillis and see what he knows about it Gillis might even give you a name for who got it from Rivers I m not building any hopes on that and the reason I m not is that Gillis is still alive If he knew I don t think he would be Yeah I can see that McKenna nodded Fact is I can see everything now except one thing This pistol switch somebody gave you what s the idea of that Why that s because I m on the spot Rand told him I m to be killed and somebody else is to be killed along with me The twenty five automatic will be used on me and the thirty eight will be used on the other fellow and we ll be found dead about five feet apart and I ll be holding my own gun and the other fellow will be holding the twenty five and it will look as though we shot it out and scored a double knockout That way my mouth will be shut about what I ve learned since I came here and the man who s supposed to have killed me will take the rap for Fleming and Rivers both Nothing to stop an investigation like a couple of corpses who can t tell their own story and can take the blame for everything Zhee zus Kavaalen s eyes widened That must be just it Well you got your nerve about you I ll say that McKenna commented You sit there and talk about it like it was something that was going to happen to Joe Doakes and Oscar Zilch He looked at Rand intently You want us to keep an eye on you Rand leaned over and spat into the brass cuspidor a gesture of braggadocio he had picked up among the French maquis Hell no That s the last thing I do want he said I want him to try it You realize don t you that all this is pure assumption and theory We don t have a single fact as it stands that proves anything We could go and pick this fellow up and he s one of three men so we could grab all three of them and even if we found the twenty five Webley Scott and my thirty eight in his pockets we couldn t charge him with anything Fact is right now we can t even prove that Lane Fleming s death was anything but the accident it s on the books as being But let him take a shot at me And then you ll have another nice clear case of self defense McKenna frowned Goddammit Jeff you ve had to defend yourself too many times already This ll be well how many will it be Counting Germans Rand grinned Hell I don t know I can t remember all of them One thing Kavaalen said solemnly you never hear of any lawyers springing people out of cemeteries on writs Look Jeff McKenna said at length If it s the way you think this guy won t dare kill you instantly will he Seems to me the way the script reads this other guy shoots you and you shoot back and kill him and then you die Isn t that it Rand nodded I m banking on that He ll try to give me a fatal but not instantly fatal wound and that means he ll have to take time to pick his spot The reason I ve managed to survive these people against whom I ve had to defend myself has been that I just don t give a damn where I shoot a man A lot of good police officers have gotten themselves killed because they tried to wing somebody and took a second or so longer about shooting than they should have Something in that too McKenna agreed But what I m getting at is this I think I know a way to give you a little more percentage He rose Wait a minute I ll be right back CHAPTER nineteen There was less feuding at dinner that evening than at any previous meal Rand had eaten in the Fleming home In the first place everybody seemed a little awed in the presence of the new butler who flitted in and out of the room like a ghost and when spoken to answered in a heavy B B C accent Then the women who carried on most of the hostilities had re erected their front populaire and were sharing a common pleasure in the recovery of the stolen pistols And finally there was a distinct possibility that the swift and dramatic justice that had overtaken Walters and Gwinnett at Rand s hands was having a sobering effect upon somebody at that table Dunmore Nelda Varcek Geraldine and Gladys had been intending to go to a party that evening but at the last minute Gladys had pleaded indisposition and telephoned regrets The meal over Rand had gone up to the gunroom Gladys drifted into the small drawing room off the dining room and the others had gone to their rooms to dress Rand was taking down the junk with which Walters had infiltrated the collection and was listing and hanging up the recovered items when Fred Dunmore wearing a dressing gown strolled in I can t get over the idea of Walters being a thief he sorrowed I wouldn t have believed it if I hadn t seen his signed confession Well it just goes to show you He took his medicine standing up Rand said And he helped us recover the pistols If I were you I d go easy with him Dunmore shook his head I m not a revengeful man Colonel Rand he said but if there s one thing I can t forgive it s a disloyal employee His mouth closed sternly around his cigar He ll have to take what s coming to him He stood by the desk for a moment looking down at the recovered items and the pile of junk on the floor When did you first suspect him Almost from the first moment I saw this collection Rand explained the reasoning which had led him to suspect Walters The real clincher to my mind was the fact that he knew this collection almost as well as Lane Fleming did and wouldn t be likely to be deceived by these substitutions any more than Fleming would Yet he said nothing to anybody neither to missus Fleming nor Goode nor myself If he weren t guilty himself I wanted to know his reason for keeping silent So I put the pressure on him and he cracked open Well I want you to know how grateful we all are Dunmore said feelingly I m kicking hell out of myself now about the way I objected when Gladys brought you in here My God suppose we d tried to sell the collection ourselves Anybody who d have been interested in buying would have seen what you saw and then they d have claimed that we were trying to hold out on them He hesitated You ve seen how things are here he continued ruefully And that s something else I have to thank you for I mean keeping your mouth shut till you got the pistols back There d have been a hell of a row everybody would have blamed everybody else How did you get him to confess though Rand told him about the subterfuge of the trumped up murder charge Dunmore had evidently never thought of that hoary device he chuckled appreciatively Say that was smart No wonder he was so willing to admit everything and help you get them back He looked at the pistols on the desk and moved one or two of them Did you get the one the coroner had Goode said something Oh yes I got that yesterday Rand turned and went to the workbench bringing back the Leech Rigdon which he handed to Dunmore That s it I fired out the other five charges and cleaned it at the State Police substation He watched Dunmore closely but there seemed to be no reaction So that s it Dunmore looked at it with a show of interest and honest sorrow and handed it back then shifted his cigar across his mouth Look here Colonel I ve been wanting to ask you something Did Gladys just get you to come here to appraise and sell the collection or are you investigating Lane s death too Well now you re asking me to be disloyal to my employer Rand objected Why don t you ask her that If she wants you to know she ll tell you Dammit I can t Suppose she s satisfied that it really was an accident would I want to start her worrying and imagining things No I suppose you wouldn t Rand conceded You re not at all satisfied on that point yourself are you Well are you Dunmore parried That sort of fencing could go on indefinitely Rand determined to stop it After all if Dunmore was the murderer of Lane Fleming he would already know how little Rand was deceived by the fake accident the Leech Rigdon had told him that already If he weren t telling him would do no harm at this point and might even do some good Why I think Fleming was murdered Rand told him as casually as though he were expressing an opinion on tomorrow s weather And I further believe that whoever killed Fleming also killed Arnold Rivers That by the way is where I come in Stephen Gresham has retained me to find the Rivers murderer to do that I must first learn who killed Lane Fleming However I was not retained to investigate the Fleming murder and as far as I know from anything she has told me Gladys Fleming is quite satisfied that her husband shot himself accidentally In a universe of ordered abstractions and multiordinal meanings the literal truth on one order of abstraction was often a black lie on another Does that answer your question he asked with open faced innocence Dunmore nodded Yes I get it now Look here do you think Anton Varcek could have done it I know it s a horrible idea and I want you to understand that I m not making any accusations but we always took it for granted that he d been up in his lab and had come downstairs when he heard the shot But suppose he came down and shot Fleming and then went out in the hall and made that rumpus outside after locking the door behind him That s possible Rand agreed You were taking a bath when you heard the shot weren t you Dunmore shook his head I suppose so I didn t hear any shot to tell the truth All I heard was Anton pounding on the door and yelling I suppose I had my head under the shower and the noise of the water kept me from hearing the shot He stopped short taking his cigar from his mouth and pointing it at Rand And by God that would have been about five minutes before he started hammering on the door he exclaimed Time enough for him to have fixed things to look like an accident set the deadlatch and have gone out in the hall and started making a noise And another thing You say that whoever killed Lane also killed this fellow Rivers Well on Thursday night when Rivers was killed Anton didn t get home till around twelve Yes I d thought of that You know though that the murderer doesn t have to be Varcek or anybody else who was in the house at the time The garage doors were open I m told that your wife was out at the time and anybody could have sneaked in the back way up through the library and out the same way There are one or two possibilities besides you and Anton Varcek Dunmore s eyes widened Yes and I can think of one without half trying too He nodded once or twice For instance the man who was afraid you were investigating Fleming s death the man who started that suicide story He looked at Rand interrogatively Well I got to go Nelda ll be out of the bathroom by now I want to talk to you about this some more Colonel After Dunmore had gone out Rand mopped his face The room seemed insufferably hot He found an electric fan over the workbench and plugged it in but it made enough noise to cover any sounds of stealthy approach and he shut it off He had finished revising his list to include the recovered pistols for as far as it was completed and was hanging them back on the wall when Ritter came in House is clear now his assistant said stepping out of his P G Wodehouse character Both pairs left in the Packard Dunmore driving Man what a cat and dog show this place is It s a wonder our client isn t nuts You haven t seen anything you ought to have been here last night Where is our client by the way Downstairs Ritter fished a cigarette out of his livery and appropriated Rand s lighter If we hear her coming you can grab this He brushed a couple of Paterson Colts to one side and sat down on the edge of the desk taking a deep drag on the cigarette What s the regular law doing now that young Jarrett is out I had a long talk with Mick McKenna Rand said Fortunately Mick and I have worked together before I was able to tell him the facts of life and he ll be a good boy now When last heard from Farnsworth was beginning to blow his hot breath on the back of Cecil Gillis s neck Ritter picked up the big forty four Colt Walker and tried the balance Man this even makes that Colt Magnum of mine feel light he said Say Jeff if Farnsworth s going after Gillis it s probably on account of those stories about him and missus Rivers At least all that stuff would come out if he arrested him Maybe we could get a fee out of missus Rivers I d thought of that Unfortunately missus Rivers had a very convenient breakdown when she heard the news she is now in a hospital in New York and won t be back until after the funeral Prostrated with grief Or something And this case is due to blow up like Hiroshima before then Well we can t get fees from everybody That of course was one of the sad things of life to which one must reconcile oneself I got a call from Pierre Jarrett Tip s staying at the Jarrett place tonight I thought it would be a good idea to have him within reach for a while The private outside phone rang shrilly Ritter let it go for several rings then picked it up This is the Fleming residence he stated putting on his character again Oh yes indeed sir Colonel Rand is right here sir I ll tell him you re calling He put a hand over the mouthpiece Humphrey Goode Rand took the phone and named himself into it I would like to talk to you privately Colonel Rand the lawyer said On a subject of considerable importance to our shall I say mutual clients Could you find time to drop over sometime this evening Well I m very busy at the moment mister Goode Rand regretted There have been some rather deplorable developments here lately The butler Walters has been arrested for larceny It seems that since mister Fleming s death he has been systematically looting the pistol collection I m trying to get things straightened out now Good heavens Goode was considerably shaken When did you discover this Colonel Rand And why wasn t I notified before And are there many valuable items missing I discovered it as soon as I saw the collection Rand began answering his questions in order Neither you nor anybody else was notified because I wanted to get evidence to justify an arrest first And nothing is missing everything has been recovered he finished That s what I m so busy about now getting my list revised and straightening out the collection Oh fine Goode was delighted I hope everything was handled quietly without any unnecessary publicity But this other matter I don t care to go into it over the phone and it s imperative that we discuss it privately at once Well suppose you come over here mister Goode Rand suggested That way I won t have to interrupt my work so much There s nobody at home now but missus Fleming and as she s indisposed we ll be quite alone Oh very well I think that s really a good idea much better than your coming over here I ll see you directly Ritter was grinning as Rand hung up That s the stuff he approved The old Hitler technique make them come to you and then you can pound the table and yell at them all you want to You go let him in Rand directed Show him up here and then take a plant on that spiral stairway out of the library just out of sight I don t think this it but there s no use taking chances He mopped his face again Damn it s hot in here Ten minutes later Ritter ushered in Humphrey Goode and inquired if there would be anything further sir When Rand said there wouldn t he went down the spiral Just as Rand had expected Goode began peddling the same line as Varcek and Dunmore before him They all came to see him in the gunroom with a common purpose After easing himself into a chair and going through some prefatory huffing and puffing Goode came out with it Did Rand believe that Lane Fleming had really been murdered and was he investigating Fleming s death after all I have always believed that Lane Fleming was murdered Rand replied I also believe that his murderer killed Arnold Rivers as well I am investigating the Rivers murder and the Fleming murder may be considered as a part thereof But what brings you around to discuss that now Did you learn something since last evening that leads you to suspect the same thing Well not exactly But this afternoon Fred Dunmore and Anton Varcek came to my office separately of course and each of them wanted to know if I had any reason to suspect that the uh tragedy was actually a case of murder Both had the impression that you were conducting an investigation under cover of your work on the pistol collection and wanted to know whether missus Fleming or I had employed you to do so And you denied it giving them the impression that missus Fleming had Rand asked I hope you haven t put her in any more danger than she is now by doing so Goode looked startled Colonel Rand Do you actually mean that he began You were Lane Fleming s attorney and board chairman of his company Rand said You can probably imagine why he was killed You can ask yourself just how safe his principal heir is now Without giving Goode a chance to gather his wits he pressed on Well what s your opinion about Fleming s death After all you did go out of your way to create a false impression that he had committed suicide Goode still bewildered by Rand s deliberately cryptic hints and a little frightened had the grace to blush at that I admit it it was entirely unethical and I ll admit that too he said But Well I m buying all the Premix stock that s out in small blocks and so are mister Dunmore and mister Varcek We all felt that such rumors would reduce the market quotation to our advantage Rand nodded I picked up a hundred shares the other day myself Your shenanigans probably chipped a little off the price I had to pay so I ought to be grateful to you But we re talking about murder not market manipulation Did either Varcek or Dunmore express any opinion as to who might have killed Fleming The outside telephone rang before Goode could answer Rand scooped it up at the end of the first ring and named himself into it It was Mick McKenna calling Well we checked up on that cap and ball six shooter you left with me he said This gunsmith Umholtz refinished it for Rivers last summer He showed the man who was to see him the entry in his job book make model serials and all Oh fine And did you get anything out of young Gillis Rand asked The gun was in Rivers s shop from the time Umholtz rejuvenated it till around the first of November Then it was sold but he doesn t know who to He didn t sell it himself Rivers must have I assumed that that s why he s still alive Well thanks Mick The case is getting tighter every minute You haven t had any trouble yet McKenna asked anxiously How s the whoozis doing About as you might expect Rand told him mopping his face again Thanks for that too He hung up and turned back to Goode Pardon the interruption he said Sergeant McKenna of the State Police The officer who made the arrest on Walters and Gwinnett Well I suppose Dunmore and Varcek are each trying to blame the other he said Well yes I rather got that impression Goode admitted And which one do you like for the murderer Or haven t you picked yours yet You mean Yes of course Goode said slowly It must have been one or the other But I can t think It s horrible to have to suspect either of them For a moment he stared unseeingly at the litter of high priced pistols on the desk Then Colonel Rand Lane Fleming is dead and nothing either of us can do will bring him back To expose his murderer certainly won t But it would cause a scandal that would rock the Premix Company to its very foundations It might even disastrously affect the market as a whole Oh come Rand reproved That s like talking about starting a hurricane with a palm leaf fan But you will admit that it would have a dreadful effect on Premix Foods Goode argued It would probably prevent this merger from being consummated Look here he said urgently I don t know how much Gladys Fleming is paying you to rake all this up but I ll gladly double her fee if you drop it and confine yourself to the matter of the collection Even in his colossal avarice that was one kind of money Jeff Rand had never been tempted to take An offer of that sort invariably made him furious At the moment he managed to choke down his anger but he rejected Goode s offer in a manner which left no room for further discussion Goode rose shaking his head sadly I suppose you realize he said sorrowfully that you re wrecking a ten million dollar corporation One in which you yourself are a stockholder Rand brightened And the biggest wrecking jobs I ever did before were a couple of petrol dumps and a railroad bridge He got to his feet along with the lawyer No need to call the butler I ll let you out myself He accompanied Goode down the front stairway to the door Goode was still gloomy I made a mistake in trying to bribe you he said But can t I appeal to your sense of fairness Do you want to inflict serious losses on innocent investors merely to avenge one crime I don t approve of murder Rand told him Least of all to paraphrase Clausewitz as an extension of business by other means You know if we let Lane Fleming s killer get away with it somebody might take that as a precedent and bump you off to win a lawsuit sometime Ever think of that When he returned to the gunroom he found Gladys Fleming occupying the chair lately vacated by the family attorney She blew a smoke ring at him in greeting as he entered Now what was Hump Goode up to she wanted to know I m taking too much on myself Rand evaded Maybe I should have turned Walters over for trial by family court martial How do you like Davies by the way Oh he s cute Gladys told him One of your operatives isn t he Now what in the world gave you an idea like that he asked as though humoring the vagaries of a child Well I suspected something of the sort from the alacrity with which you produced him before Walters was out of the house she said And nobody could be as perfect a stage butler as he is But what really convinced me was coming into the library a little while ago and finding him squatting on the top of the spiral covering Humphrey Goode with a small but particularly evil looking automatic Rand chuckled What did you do Oh I climbed up and squatted beside him she replied I got there just as you were telling Goode what he could do with his bribe You know with one thing and another Goode s beginning to become unamusing She smoked in silence for a moment I ought to be indignant with you filling my house with spies she said But under the circumstances I m afraid I m thankful instead Your op s a good egg by the way he s on his way to bring us some drinks I ought to be sore at you retaining me into a mess like this and telling me nothing Rand told her What was the idea anyhow You wanted me to investigate your husband s murder all along didn t you I I hadn t a thing to go on she replied I was afraid if I came out and told you what I suspected that you d think it was just another case of feminine dam foolishness and dismiss it as such I knew it wasn t an accident Lane didn t have accidents with guns And if he d wanted to kill himself he d have done it and left a note explaining why he had to But I didn t have a single fact to give you I thought that if you came here and started working on the collection you d find something You should have taken a chance and told me what you suspected Rand said I ve taken a lot of cases on flimsier grounds than this The fact is you practically told me it was murder when you were talking to me in my office Jeff I never was what the soap operas call being in love with Lane she continued But he was wonderful to me He gave me everything a girl who grew up in a sixteen dollar apartment over a fruit store could want And then somebody killed him just as you d step on a cockroach because he got in the way of a business deal I m glad to be able to spend money to help catch whoever did it It won t help him but it ll make me feel a lot better You will catch him won t you Rand nodded I don t know whether he ll ever go to trial and be convicted he said I don t think he will But you can take my word for it he won t get away with it Tomorrow I think the lid s going to blow off Maybe you d better be away from home when it does Take Nelda and Geraldine with you and go somewhere There s likely to be some uproar Well Nelda and Geraldine and I are going to church in the morning Gladys said It s a question of face We have a rented pew Lane was quite active in church work and none of us are willing to let ourselves get squeezed out of it We all go even Geraldine manages to drag herself to the Lord s House through an alcoholic fog And we ll have to be back in time for dinner It would look funny if we weren t Well if nothing s happened by the time you get back I want you to talk the girls into going somewhere with you in the afternoon and stay away till evening And don t get the idea that you could help me here he added stopping an objection I know what I m talking about The presence of any of you here would only delay matters and make it harder for me Then Ritter came in a cigarette in one corner of his mouth carrying a tray on which were a bottle of Bourbon a bottle of Scotch a siphon and a couple of bottles of beer CHAPTER twenty The dining room was empty when Rand came down to breakfast the next morning Taking the seat he had occupied the evening before he waited until Ritter came out of the kitchen through the pantry Good morning Colonel Rand the Perfect Butler greeted him unctuously If I may say so sir you re a bit of an early riser None of the family is up yet sir Rand jerked a thumb toward the kitchen Who s out there he hissed Just the cook frying sausage and flipping pancakes Premix pancakes of course The maid sleeps out she hasn t gotten here yet How d it go last night You put a dummy under the covers and sleep on the floor No last night I was safe The blow off isn t due till this morning when the women are at church and he ll have to catch me and the fall guy together What do you want me to do Ritter asked giving an un butler like hitch at his shoulder holster I can stand on my official dignity and get out of any cleaning up work till after dinner and I won t have any buttling to do till the women get home from church Case Varcek and Dunmore when they come in see if either of them is rod heavy Find anything last night Ritter shook his head I searched Varcek s lab after everybody was in bed and I searched the cars in the garage and a lot of other places I didn t find them Whoever he is the chances are he has them in his room Did you look back of the books in the library Rand asked When Ritter shook his head he continued That s probably where they are Not that it makes a whole lot of difference If I d found them it d of given me something to watch then I d know when the fun was going to start Ritter broke off suddenly Yes sir Will you have your coffee now or later sir Gladys entered wearing the blue tailored outfit she had worn to Rand s office on Wednesday At ease at ease she laughed dropping into her chair Anything new Rand shook his head We ll have to wait I m expecting some action this morning I hope it ll be over before you re home from church She looked at him seriously Jeff you re using yourself as murder bait she said Aren t you More or less He knows I m onto him He s pretty sure I haven t any real proof yet but he doesn t know how soon I will have He realizes that I m cat and mousing him the way I did Walters So he ll try to kill me before I pounce and when he does he ll convict himself What he doesn t realize is that as long as he sits tight he s perfectly safe Neither of them mentioned the obvious corollary that conviction and execution would be almost simultaneous It must have been uppermost in Gladys s mind she leaned over and put her hand on Rand s arm Jeff would it help any if I stayed home instead of going to church she asked I m a pretty fair pistol shot Lane taught me I can stay over ninety at slow fire and in the eighties at timed and rapid If I hid somewhere with a target pistol Absolutely not Rand vetoed emphatically I m not saying that because I m afraid you might stop a slug yourself You re a big girl now you can take your own chances But if you stayed home he wouldn t make a move You and Geraldine and Nelda have to be out of the house before he ll feel safe coming out of the grass Watch it Ritter warned Yes ma am at once ma am Nelda came in and sat down Ritter held her chair and fussed over her finding out what she wanted to eat He was bringing in her fruit when Varcek and Geraldine entered Nelda was inquiring if Rand wanted to come to church with them No I m one of the boys the chaplain couldn t find in the foxholes Rand said I m going to put in a quiet morning on the collection If nobody gets murdered or arrested in the meantime that is Geraldine looked woebegone her hands were trembling My God do I have a hangover she moaned Walters for heaven s sake fix me up something quick Then she saw Ritter Who the devil are you she demanded Where s Walters Out on bail Rand told her Don t you remember Oh you did this to me she accused Walters could always fix me up in the morning Now what am I going to do You might stop drinking her husband suggested mildly Oh just stop breathing that would be better all around Nelda interposed Ritter coughed delicately Begging your pardon ma am but I ve always rawther fawncied myself for an expert on morning awfter tonics If you ll wait a moment He departed on his errand of mercy returning shortly with a highball glass filled with some dark evil looking potion He set it on the table in front of the sufferer and poured her a cup of coffee Now ma am just try this Take it gradually if I may suggest Don t attempt to gulp it it s quite strong ma am Geraldine tasted it and pulled a Gorgon face Encouraged by Ritter she managed to down about half of the mixture Splendid ma am splendid he cheered her on Now drink your coffee ma am and then finish it That s right ma am And now more coffee Geraldine struggled through with the black draft and drank the second cup of coffee As she set down the empty cup she even managed to smile Why that s wonderful She lit a cigarette What is it I feel as though I might live after all A recipe of my own a variant on the old Prairie Oyster but without the raw egg which I consider a needless embellishment ma am I learned it in the household of a former employer a New York stockbroker Poor man he did himself in in the autumn of nineteen twenty nine Well it s too bad you won t be with us permanently Davies Nelda said Your recipe seems to be just what Geraldine needs With a dash of prussic acid added of course That got the bush fighting off to a good start When Dunmore came in a few minutes later the two sisters were stalking one another through the jungle blow gunning poison darts back and forth The newcomer sat down without a word throughout the meal he and Varcek treated one another with silent and hostile suspicion Finally Gladys looked at her watch and called a truce to the skirmishing by announcing that it was time to start for church Rand left the room with the ladies in the hall Gladys brushed against him quickly and gripped his left arm Do be careful Jeff she whispered Don t worry I will Rand assured her Then he turned into the library and went up the spiral to the gunroom while the three women went down to the garage He was standing at the window as the big Packard moved out onto the drive Nelda was at the wheel and Gladys beside her on the front seat raised a white gloved hand in the thumbs up salute Rand gave it back and watched the car swing around the house Then he mopped his face with a wad of Kleenex and went over to the room temperature thermostat turning it down to sixty Sitting down at the desk he dialed Humphrey Goode s number on the private outside line A maid answered a moment later he was talking to the Fleming lawyer Rand here he identified himself mister Goode I ve been thinking over our conversation of last evening There is a great deal to be said for the position you re taking in the matter As you reminded me I m a small if purely speculative stockholder in Premix myself and even if I weren t I should hate to be responsible for undeserved losses by innocent investors Yes Goode s voice fairly shook Then you re going to drop the investigation No mister Goode I can t do that But I believe a formula could be evolved which would keep the Premix Company and its affairs out of it In fact I think that the whole question of the death of Lane Fleming might possibly be kept in the background Would that satisfy you It would require some very careful manipulation on my part and your cooperation But See here if you re investigating the death of mister Fleming how can that be kept in the background Goode wanted to know The murderer of Lane Fleming is also guilty of the murder of Arnold Rivers Rand stated I know that positively now Murder is punished capitally and one of the peculiarities of capital punishment is that it can be inflicted only once on no matter how many counts If our man goes to the chair for the death of Rivers the death of Fleming might even remain an accident I can hardly guarantee that I have my agency license to think of among other things But I feel reasonably safe in saying that I could keep the Premix Company from figuring in the case Would that satisfy you It most certainly would Colonel Rand Goode s voice shook even more Are you sure I m not sure of anything It ll cost the Premix Company some money to get this done I ll have certain expenses for one thing which could not very gracefully be itemized and I will have to have your cooperation Now I want you to remain at home where I can reach you at any moment for the rest of the day I ll call you later He listened to Goode babble his gratitude for a while then terminated the call and hung up Then he transferred the Colt thirty eight to the side pocket of his coat picked up one of the sheets on which he had been listing the collection and sat for almost fifteen minutes pretending to study it keeping his eyes shifting from the hall door to the spiral stairway and back again Finally the hall door opened and Anton Varcek came in Rand half rose covering the Czech from his side pocket Varcek came over and sat down in an armchair near the desk He was looking more than ever like Rudolf Hess Rudolf Hess on the morning of the Beer Hall Putsch Colonel Rand he began There has within the last half hour been a most important development I am at a loss to define its significance but its importance is inescapable Rand nodded He had been expecting somebody to give birth to an important development the steps toward gunfire were progressing in logical series Well He smiled encouragingly What happened After you and the ladies left the dining room Varcek said Fred Dunmore turned to me and apologized for harboring unjust suspicions of me in the matter of Lane Fleming s death He said that he had been unable to understand who else could have murdered Lane until you had pointed out to him that the house could have been entered from the garage and the gunroom from the library Then he said he had had a conversation with some unnamed gentleman at the party last evening and had learned that Lane had discovered that Humphrey Goode was deceiving him and had been about to have him dismissed from his position with the company and to sever his personal connections with him The devil now Rand gave a good imitation of surprise What sort of jiggery pokery was Goode up to Fred said that his informant told him that Lane had proof that Goode had accepted a bribe from Arnold Rivers to misconduct the suit which Lane was bringing against Rivers about a pair of pistols he had bought from Rivers It seems that Goode was Rivers s attorney also and had been involved with him in a number of dishonest transactions although the connection had been kept secret That s a new angle now Rand said I suppose that he killed Rivers in order to prevent the latter from incriminating him Why didn t Fred come to me with this he asked Eh Evidently Varcek hadn t thought of that Why I suppose he was concerned about the possibility of repercussions in the business world After all Goode is our board chairman and maybe he thought that people might begin thinking that the murder had some connection with the affairs of the company That s possible of course Rand agreed And what s your own attitude Colonel Rand I cannot allow these facts to be suppressed the Czech said My own position is too vulnerable you ve showed me that Except for the fact that somebody could have entered the house through the garage the burden of suspicion would lie on me and Fred Dunmore Well do you want me to help you with it Rand asked Yes if you will It would be helping yourself also I believe Varcek replied Fred is downstairs now in the library I suggest that you and I go down and have a talk with him Maybe you could show him the folly of trying to suppress any facts concerning Lane s death Yes that would be both foolish and dangerous Rand got to his feet keeping his hand on the thirty eight Colt Let s go down and talk to him now They walked side by side toward the spiral Rand keeping on the right and lagging behind a little lifting the stubby revolver clear of his pocket Yet in spite of his vigilance it happened before he could prevent it A lance of yellow fire jumped out of the shadows of the stairway and there was a soft cough of a silenced pistol almost lost in the click click of the breech action Rand felt something sledge hammer him in the chest almost knocking him down He staggered then swung up the Colt he had drawn from his pocket and blazed two shots into the stairway There was a clatter and the sound of feet descending into the library He rushed forward revolver poised and then a shot boomed from below followed by three more in quick succession Okay Jeff Ritter s voice called out War s over He managed somehow to get down the steep spiral The little twenty five Webley Scott was lying on the bottom step he pushed it aside with his foot and cautioned Varcek who was following to avoid it Ritter still looking like the Perfect Butler in spite of the three hundred eighty Beretta in his hand was standing in the hall doorway On the floor midway between the stairway and the door lay Fred Dunmore His tan coat and vest were turning dark in several places and Rand s own Detective Special was lying a few inches from his left hand He came in here and shut the door Ritter reported I couldn t follow him in so I took a plant in the hall When I heard you blasting upstairs I came in just in time to see him coming down You winged him in the right shoulder he d dropped the twenty five and he had your gat in his left hand When he saw mine he threw one at me and missed I gave him three back for it See result on floor Uh uh he d have gotten away if you hadn t been on the job he told Ritter Then he picked up his own revolver and holstered it After a glance which assured him that Fred Dunmore was beyond any further action of any sort he laid the square butt Detective Special on the floor beside him You did all right Dave he said Now nobody s going to have a chance to bamboozle a jury into acquitting him He thought of his recent conversation with Humphrey Goode You did just all right he repeated So it was Fred then he heard Varcek behind him say Then he was lying about this evidence against Goode The Czech came over and stood beside Rand looking down at the body of his late brother in law But why did he tell me that story and why did he shoot at us when we were together Both for the same general reason Rand explained about the two pistols and the planned double killing With both of us dead you d be the murderer and I d be a martyr to law and order and he d be in the clear Varcek regarded the dead man with more distaste than surprise Evidently his experiences in Hitler s Europe had left him with few illusions about the sanctity of human life or the extent of human perfidy Ritter holstered the Beretta and got out a cigarette I hope you didn t leave your lighter upstairs he told Rand Rand produced and snapped it holding the flame out to his assistant Dave he lectured the Perfect Butler always has a lighter in good working order lighting up the mawster is part of his duties Remember that the next time you have a buttling job Ritter leaned forward for the light Dunmore was a better shot with his right hand than he was with his left he commented He didn t come within a yard of me and he scored a twelve o clock center on you Right through the necktie Rand glanced down Then he burst into a roar of obscene blasphemy Seven dollars and fifty cents I paid for that tie not three weeks ago he concluded Does your grandmother make patchwork quilts If she does she can have it My God Varcek stared at Rand unbelievingly Why he hit you You re wounded Only in the necktie Rand reassured him I have a hole in my shirt too He reached under the latter garment and rummaged as though to evict a small trespasser When he brought out his hand he was holding a battered twenty five caliber bullet He held it out to show to Varcek and Ritter Sure Ritter grinned at Varcek Didn t you know Superman I m wearing a bulletproof vest Mick McKenna loaned it to me yesterday Rand enlightened Varcek I never wore one of the damn things before and if I can help it I ll never wear one again I m damn near stewed alive in it Think how hot you d be right now if you hadn t been wearing it Ritter reminded him Then you knew since yesterday that he would do this Varcek asked I knew one or the other of you would Rand replied I had quite a few reasons for thinking it might be Dunmore and one good one for not suspecting you You mean my dislike for firearms That could have been feigned or it could have been overcome Rand replied I mean your knowledge of biology and biochemistry If you d killed Lane Fleming there d have been no clumsy business of fake accidents not as long as both of you ate at the same table He d have just died an unimpeachably natural death He turned to Ritter Dave I m going upstairs I want to get out of this damned coat of mail I m wearing While I m doing it I want you to call Carter Tipton at the Jarrett place and Humphrey Goode and Mick McKenna in that order Tell Goode to get over here as fast as he can and come up to my room tell him we have to consider ways and means of implementing my suggestion to him CHAPTER twenty one In the month which followed events transpired through a thickening miasma of rumors official communiques journalistic conjectures and outright fabrications fitfully lit by the glare of newsmen s photo bulbs bulking with strange shapes and emitting stranger noises There were the portentous rumblings of prepared statements and the hollow thumps of denials There were soft murmurs of Now this is strictly off the record followed by sibilant whispers The unseen screws of political pressure creaked and whitewash brushes slurped suavely And there was an insistent yammering of bewildered and unanswered questions Fred Dunmore really had killed Arnold Rivers hadn t he Or had he Arnold Rivers had been double crossing Dunmore or had Dunmore been double crossing Rivers Somebody had stolen ten or was it twenty five thousand dollars worth of old pistols Or was it just twenty five thousand dollars Or what if anything had been stolen Was somebody being framed for something or was somebody covering up for somebody or what And wasn t there something funny about the way Lane Fleming got killed last December The surviving members of the Fleming family issued a few noncommittal statements through their attorney Humphrey Goode and then the Iron Curtain slammed down Mick McKenna gave an outraged squawk or so then subsided There was a series of pronunciamentos from the office of District Attorney Charles P Farnsworth all full of high order abstractions and empty of meaning The reporters converging on the Fleming house found it occupied by the State Police who kept them at bay Harry Bentz of the New Belfast Evening Mercury using a thirty power spotting scope from the road observed Dave Ritter whom he recognized wearing a suit of butler s livery and standing in the doorway of the garage talking to Sergeant McKenna Carter Tipton and Farnsworth the Mercury exploited this scoop for all it was worth On the whole the Rosemont Bayonet Murder was from a journalistic standpoint an almost complete bust There had been no arrest no hearing no protracted trial no sensational revelations Only one monolithic fact officially attested and indisputable loomed out of the murk and the said Frederick Parker Dunmore deceased did receive the aforesaid gunshot wounds hereinbefore enumerated at the hands of the said Jefferson Davis Rand and at the hands of the said David Abercrombie Ritter and the said Jefferson Davis Rand and the said David Abercrombie Ritter being in mortal fear for their several lives did so act in defense of their several persons and finally the said Frederick Parker Dunmore did die The Evening Mercury which sheet the said Jefferson Davis Rand had once cost the loss of an expensive libel suit and exposed in certain journalistic malpractices verging upon blackmail promptly burst into print with an indignant editorial entitled Trial by Pistol The terms legalized slaughter and flagrant whitewash were used and mention was made of the well known preference of a certain notorious private detective for the procedure of habeas cadaver The principal result of this outcry was to persuade an important New Belfast manufacturer who had hitherto resisted Rand s sales pressure to contract with the Tri State Agency for the protection of his payroll deliveries Then at the other end of the state the professor of Moral Science at a small theological seminary caught his wife in flagrante delicto with one of the fourth year students and opened fire upon them at a range of ten feet with a twelve gauge pump gun The Rosemont Bayonet Murder already pretty well withered on the vine passed quietly into limbo Summer almost a month before its official opening was already a fait accompli The trees were in full leaf and invaded by nesting birds the air was fragrant with flower scents and the mercury column of the thermometer was stretching itself up toward the ninety mark They were all outside where the long shadow of the Fleming house fell across the lawn and driveway gathered about the five parked cars The new Fleming butler a short and somewhat globular Negro with a gingerbread crust complexion and an air of affable dignity was helping Pierre Jarrett and Karen Lawrence put a couple of cartons and a tall peach basket into Pierre s Plymouth Colin MacBride a streamer of pipe smoke floating back over his shoulder was peering into his luggage compartment to check the stowage of his own cargo while his twelve year old son Malcolm another black Highlander like his father was helping Philip Cabot carry a big laundry hamper full of newspaper wrapped pistols to his Cadillac Pierre s mother and the stylish stout missus Trehearne and Gladys Fleming obviously detached from the bustle of pre departure preparations were standing to one side talking And Rand had finished helping Adam Trehearne pack the last container of his share of the Fleming collection into his car I see Colin s about ready to leave and I m in his way Trehearne said He extended his hand to Rand No need hashing over how we all feel about this If it hadn t been for you that offer of Kendall s would have had us stopped as dead as Rivers s had Five hundred dollars deader in fact Stephen Gresham carrying a package filled orange crate joined him setting down his burden His wife and daughter with another crate between them halted beside him Haven t you got your stuff packed yet Jeff Gresham asked Jeff s been helping everybody else Irene Gresham burst out Come on everybody let s go help Jeff pack You re going to have dinner with us aren t you Jeff Oh sorry I have some more details to clear up I m having dinner here with missus Fleming Rand regretted I ll pack my stuff later missus Jarrett missus Trehearne and Gladys came over one by one the rest of the group converged upon them Then when the good by s had been said and the promises to meet again had been given they parted One by one the cars moved slowly down the driveway to the road Only Gladys and Rand standing at the foot of the front steps and the gingerbread brown butler were left My my that was some party the Negro chuckled gathering up three empty pasteboard cartons and telescoping them together Dinner ll be ready in about half an hour missus Fleming Shall I go mix the cocktails now Yes do that Reuben In the drawing room She watched the servant carry the discarded containers around the house then turned to Rand You know not the least of your capabilities is your knack of finding servant replacements on short notice she told him My general factotum Buck Pendexter is a prominent personage in New Belfast colored lodge circles Rand said When your cook and maid quit on you the day of the blow up all I had to do was phone him and he did the rest He got out his cigarettes offered them and snapped his lighter I notice you re having cocktails in the drawing room now Yes I suppose in time I ll stop imagining I see Fred Dunmore s blood on the library floor I got used to what had happened in the gunroom last December Shall we go in she asked taking Rand s arm The cocktails were waiting when they entered the drawing room off the dining room The butler poured for them and put the glasses and the shaker on a low table by a lounge I m afraid dinner s going to be a little later than I said missus Fleming he apologized Things were kind of stirred up today with all those people here That s all right we can wait she replied We won t need anything more Reuben Motioning Rand down on the lounge beside her she handed him a glass and lifted her own Now she began Just what sort of skulduggery has been going on As of Friday the top offer for the collection was twenty five thousand five hundred from some dealer up in Massachusetts And then on Saturday you came bounding in with Stephen Gresham s certified check for twenty six thousand And I seem to recall that the late unlamented Rivers s offer of twenty five thousand straight had them stopped Not that I m inclined to look askance at an extra five hundred I can buy a new hat with my share of that even after taxes but I would like to know what happened And I might add that s only one of many things I d like to know The client is entitled to a full report Rand said tasting his cocktail It was a vodka Martini and very good You know none of that crowd are millionaires Adam Trehearne who s the plutocrat of the bunch isn t so filthy rich he doesn t know what to do with all his money what the tax collectors leave of it and the rest of them have to figure pretty closely The most they could possibly scratch together was twenty two thousand So I put four thousand into the pot myself bringing the total to five hundred over the Kendall offer and hastily declared the collection sold Of course my getting into it meant that much less for everybody else but five sixths of a collection is better than no pistols at all I imagine Colin MacBride is honing up his sgian dhu for me because I got that big Whitneyville Walker Colt but what the hell he got the cased pair of Paterson thirty four s and the Texas forty with the ramming lever Why I think the division was fair enough Gladys said They d agreed to take your valuation hadn t they And all that slide rule and comptometer business But Jeff four thousand dollars she queried You only got five from me and you can t run a detective agency on old pistols Rand grinned as he set down his empty glass Gladys refilled it from the shaker My dear lady that five thousand I unblushingly accepted from you was only part of it he confessed There was also a fee of three thousand from Stephen Gresham for pulling the bloodhounds of the D A s office off his back in the matter of Arnold Rivers and there was five thousand from Humphrey Goode which I suppose he ll get the Premix Company to repay him for engineering the suppression of a lot of facts he wanted suppressed And finally my connection with this business brought that merger to my attention and I picked up a hundred shares of Premix at seventy three one four and now I have two hundred shares of Mill Pack worth about twenty nine thousand which I can report for my income tax as capital gains I d say I could afford to treat myself to a few old pistols for my collection Well She raised both eyebrows over that Don t anybody tell me crime doesn t pay Yes In my ghoulish way I generally manage to bear myself in mind on an operation like this I make no secret of my affection for money He lifted his glass and sipped slowly Look here Gladys are you satisfied with the way this was handled She shrugged I should be When I started out as Lane s blood avenger I suppose I expected things to end somewhere out of sight in a nice antiseptic death chamber at the state penitentiary You must admit that that business in the library was really bringing it home There s no question that you got the man who killed Lane and if you hadn t I d never have been at peace with myself And I suppose all that chicanery afterward was necessary too It was if you wanted that merger to go through and unless you wanted to see the bottom drop out of your Premix stock Rand assured her If the true facts of mister Fleming s death had gotten out there d have been a simply hideous stink The Mill Pack people would have backed out of that merger like a bear out of an active bee tree You know what the situation really was don t you She shook her head I know Mill Pack wanted to get control of the Premix Company and Lane refused to go in with them I don t fully understand his reasons though They weren t important they were mainly verbal and unrelated to actuality Rand said The important thing is that he did refuse and Mill Pack wanted that merger so badly that it could be tasted in every ounce of food they sold They got Stephen Gresham to negotiate it for them and he was just on the point of reporting it to be an impossibility when Fred Dunmore came to him with a proposition Dunmore said he thought he could persuade or force mister Fleming to consent and he wanted a contract guaranteeing him a vice presidency with Mill Pack at forty thousand a year if and when the merger was accomplished The contract was duly signed about the first of last November Well good Lord Gladys Fleming s eyes widened When did you hear about that I got that out of Gresham a couple of days after the blow up when it was too late to be of any use to me Rand said If I d known it from the beginning it might have saved me some work Not much though Gresham was just as badly scared about the facts coming out as Goode was I can t prove collusion between him and Goode but Gresham was helping spread the suicide story too Nice friends Lane had But didn t anybody think there was something odd about that accident immediately after that contract was signed Of course they did but try and get them to admit it even to themselves Nobody likes to think that the new vice president of the company murdered his way into the position So everybody assumed the attitudes of the three Japanese monkeys and made respectable noises about what a great loss mister Fleming was to the business world and how lucky Dunmore was that he had that contract She looked at him inquiringly for a moment Jeff I want you to tell me exactly how everything happened she said I think I have a right to know Yes you have he agreed I ll tell you the whole thing what I actually know and what I was forced to guess at When this merger idea first took shape last summer Dunmore saw how unalterably opposed to it mister Fleming was and he began wishing him out of the way Some time later he decided to do something about it I suppose Anton Varcek gave him the idea in the first place with his jabber about the danger of a firearms accident Dunmore decided he d fix one up for mister Fleming First of all he d need a firearm collector s type and in good working order It couldn t be one of the guns in the collection He d have to keep it loaded all the time waiting for an opportunity to use it he couldn t take a weapon out of the collection because it would be missed and he couldn t load one and hang it up again because that would be discovered So he had to get one of his own and he got it from Arnold Rivers You know that I mean that s not just a guess I know it The gun he got from Rivers was a thirty six Colt eighteen sixty Navy model serial number twenty four forty four Rand told her Rivers had that gun last summer He had it refinished by a gunsmith named Umholtz After Umholtz refinished it the gun was in Rivers s shop until November of last year when it was sold by Rivers personally And that was the revolver that was found in Lane Fleming s hand and the one I got from the coroner with a letter vouching for the fact that it had been so found He finished his cocktail Gladys picked up the shaker mechanically and refilled his glass Now we have Dunmore with this thirty six Colt loaded with powder caps and bullets from the ammunition supply in the gunroom waiting for a chance to use it And also he has this Mill Pack contract in his safe deposit box at the bank That takes care of the weapon and the motive only the opportunity is needed and that came on the twenty second of December when mister Fleming brought home that Confederate Leech Rigdon thirty six he had just bought It was just a piece of luck that both revolvers were alike in caliber and general type but it wouldn t have made a lot of difference Nobody was paying much attention to details and Dunmore was on the scene to misdirect any attention anybody would pay to anything Now we come to the mechanics of the thing the modus operandi or as it is professionally known the M O You remember what happened that evening Nelda had gone out You and Geraldine were listening to the radio in the parlor over there Varcek had gone up to his lab mister Fleming was alone in the gunroom working on his new revolver And Fred Dunmore said he was going to take a bath What he did of course was to draw a tub full of water undress put on his bathrobe and slippers hide the thirty six Colt under the bathrobe and then go across the hall to the gunroom where he found mister Fleming sitting on that cobbler s bench putting the finishing touches on the Leech Rigdon So he fired at close range wiped the prints off the Colt with an oily rag put it in Lane Fleming s right hand put the rag in his left grabbed up the Leech Rigdon and scuttled back to his bathroom deadlatching and shutting the gunroom door as he went out This last of course was a delaying tactic to give him time to establish his bathtub alibi He lifted the cocktail glass to his lips These vodka Martinis were strong and three of them before dinner was leaning way over backward maintaining the tradition of the hard drinking private eye but Gladys was working on her third and no client was going to drink him under So in the privacy of his bathroom he kicked out of his slippers threw off his robe hid the Leech Rigdon probably in a space between the tub and the wall that I found while we were searching the house the night before the shooting of Dunmore and jumped into the tub there to await developments As soon as he heard Varcek s uproar in the hall he could emerge dripping bathwater and innocence to find out what the fuss was all about Do you know anything about something called General Semantics he asked suddenly Yes Before I married Lane I went around with a radio ad writer she told him He was a nice boy but he d get drunker than a boiled owl about once a month and weep about his crimes against sanity and meaning He d recite long excerpts from his professional creations and show how he had been deliberately objectifying words and identifying them with the things for which they stood and confusing orders of abstraction and juggling multiordinal meanings He was going to lend me his Koran a book called Science and Sanity and then he took a job with an ad agency in Chicago and I got married and Rand nodded Then you realize that the word is not the thing spoken of and that the inference is not the description and that we cannot know all about anything Etcetera he added hastily like a Papist signing himself with the Cross Well some considerable disregard of these principles seems to have existed in this case Dunmore is seen in a bathrobe his feet bare and making wet tracks on the floor his hair wet etcetera Straightaway one and all appear to have assumed that he was in the tub splashing soapsuds around while Lane Fleming was being shot And Anton Varcek who can be taken as an example of what S I Hayakawa was talking about when he spoke of people behaving like scientists inside but not outside their laboratories saw Lane Fleming dead with an object labeled revolver in his hand and because of his verbal identifications and semantic reactions immediately included the inference of an accident in his description of what he had seen That was just an extra dividend of luck for Dunmore it got the whole crowd of you thinking in terms of accidental shooting Well from there out everything would have been a wonderful success for Dunmore except for one thing Arnold Rivers must have heard somehow that Lane Fleming had been shot with a Confederate thirty six that he d bought somewhere that day and that the revolver was in the hands of this coroner of yours So Arnold with his big chisel well ground went to see if he could manage to get it out of the coroner for a few dollars And when he saw it lo it was the thirty six Colt that he d sold to Dunmore about a month before Gladys set down her glass So she said Things begin to explain themselves You may say so indeed Rand told her And what do you suppose Rivers did with this little item of information Why as nearly as I can reconstruct it he did a very foolish thing He tried to blackmail a man who had committed a murder He told Fred Dunmore he d keep his mouth shut about the thirty six Colt if Dunmore would get him the Fleming collection He wanted that instead of cash because he could get more out of it in a few years than Dunmore could ever scrape and in the meantime the prestige of handling that collection would go a long way toward repairing his rather dilapidated reputation Fred should have bumped him off right then it would have been the cheapest and easiest way out and he d probably be alive and uncaught today if he had But he was willing to pay ten thousand dollars to save himself the trouble and that s what he told you Rivers had offered for the collection The ten thousand Dunmore told you Rivers was willing to pay was really the ten thousand he was willing to pay himself to keep Rivers quiet Then I was introduced into the picture and as you know one of my first acts was to go to Rivers s shop and sneer scornfully at Rivers s supposed offer of ten thousand And right away Rivers upped it to twenty five thousand You ll recall no doubt that mister Fleming had a life insurance policy one of these partnership mutual policies which gave both Dunmore and Varcek exactly twenty five thousand apiece I assume that Rivers had found out about that I thought at the time that it was peculiar that Rivers would jump his own offer up without knowing what anybody else was offering for the collection I see now that it wasn t his own money he was being so generous with And there was another incident while I was at Rivers s shop that piqued my curiosity Rivers had in his shop a thirty six Leech Rigdon revolver and I had been informed that it was a revolver of that type that mister Fleming had brought home the evening he was killed I thought at the time that it was curious that two Confederate arms of the same type and make should show up this far north but my main idea in buying it was the possibility that I might use it in some way as circumstances would permit to throw a scare into somebody Rivers was quite willing to let me have it until he found out that I would be staying at this house and then he tried to back out of the sale and offered me seventy five dollars credit on anything else in the shop if I d return it to him Well I d known that mister Fleming had been about to start suit against Rivers over a crooked deal Rivers had put over on him and I knew that if mister Fleming s death had been murder there had been a substitution of revolvers So I showed the gun I d bought from Rivers to Philip Cabot who had seen the revolver mister Fleming had bought and he recognized it It hasn t been established just how Rivers got the Leech Rigdon and never will be the only people who knew were Rivers and Dunmore and both are in the proverbial class of non talebearers I assume that Dunmore gave it to Rivers as a sort of down payment on Rivers s silence and to get rid of it Well you remember Dunmore s angry incredulity when I told him that Rivers was offering twenty five thousand instead of ten thousand One would have thought on the face of it that he would have been glad as Nelda s husband he would share in the higher price being paid for the collection But when you realize that Rivers was buying the collection out of Dunmore s pocket his reaction becomes quite understandable I daresay I signed Arnold Rivers s death warrant right there I ll bet your conscience bothers you about that Gladys remarked Oh sure it s been gnawing hell out of me ever since Rand told her cheerfully But right away Dunmore decided to kill Rivers He called him on the phone as soon as he left the table here I m speaking by the book I walked in on him in the gunroom as he was completing the call though I didn t know it at the time and arranged to see him that evening Probably to devise ways and means of dealing with the Jeff Rand menace for an ostensible reason So that night Dunmore killed Rivers with a bayonet And here we have some more Aristotelian confusion of orders of abstraction The bayonet is defined verbally as a soldier s weapon so Farnsworth and Mick McKenna and the rest of them bemused themselves with suspects like Stephen Gresham and Pierre Jarrett and ignored Dunmore who d never had an hour s military training in his life I d like to check up on what picture shows Dunmore had been seeing in the week or so before the killing I ll bet anything he d been to one of these South Pacific banzai operas And speaking of confusing orders of abstraction Mick McKenna and his merry men pulled a classic in that line They saw Dunmore s automobile verbally defined as a gray Plymouth coupe in Rivers s drive at the estimated time of the murder Pierre Jarrett has a car of that sort so they included the inferential idea of Pierre Jarrett s ownership of the car so described Well that s about all there is to it Of course I showed Fred Dunmore the Leech Rigdon and told him it was the gun I d gotten from the coroner That was all he needed to tell him that I was onto the murder and probably onto him as the murderer But he had evidently assumed that already that was after he d assembled my thirty eight and that twenty five automatic and was planning to double kill me and Anton Varcek At that he d have probably killed me if I hadn t been wearing that bulletproof vest of McKenna s I owe Mick for my life I ll have to buy him a drink sometime to square that Well how about Walters and the pistols he stole Gladys asked Didn t that have anything to do with it No It was a result of mister Fleming s death of course I understand that the situation here had deteriorated rather abruptly after mister Fleming s death Walters was about fed up on the way things were here and he was going to hand in his notice Then he decided that he ought to have a stake to tide him over till he could get another buttling job so he started higrading the collection Gladys nodded I suppose he decided after Lane s death that he didn t owe anybody here anything Too bad he didn t wait though The situation has remedied itself and that s something else I owe you Yes I noticed that there was nobody here but you Rand mentioned Oh Anton s gone to New York The Rockefeller Foundation is financing the major part of his research work and he s well enough off to finance the rest himself Geraldine went with him Nelda is still recuperating from the shock of her sudden bereavement at a high priced sanatorium I understand there s a very good looking young doctor there And she s been talking about going to New York herself in order as she puts it to lead her own life I don t know
