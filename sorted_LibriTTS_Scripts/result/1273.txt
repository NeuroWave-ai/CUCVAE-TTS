came up and so With that our tongues began to go Now in that house you re sure of knowing The smallest scrap of news that s going We find it there the wisest way To take some care of what we say Recreation JANE TAYLOR I was born on the second September eighteen eighty six in a small dull country town When I say the town was dull I mean of course that the inhabitants were unenterprising for in itself Muddleton was a picturesque place and though it laboured under the usual disadvantage of a dearth of bachelors and a superfluity of spinsters it might have been pleasant enough had it not been a favourite resort for my kith and kin My father has long enjoyed a world wide notoriety he is not however as a rule named in good society though he habitually frequents it and as I am led to believe that my autobiography will possibly be circulated by mister Mudie and will lie about on drawing room tables I will merely mention that a most representation of my progenitor under his nom de theatre Mephistopheles may be seen now in London and I should recommend all who wish to understand his character to go to the Lyceum though between ourselves he strongly disapproves of the whole performance I was introduced into the world by an old lady named missus O Reilly She was a very pleasant old lady the wife of a General and one of those sociable friendly talkative people who do much to cheer their neighbours particularly in a deadly lively provincial place like Muddleton where the standard of social intercourse is not very high missus O Reilly had been in her day a celebrated beauty she was now grey haired and stout but still there was something impressive about her and few could resist the charm of her manner and the pleasant easy flow of her small talk Her love of gossip amounted almost to a passion and nothing came amiss to her she liked to know everything about everybody and in the main I think her interest was a kindly one though she found that a little bit of scandal every now and then added a piquant flavour to the homely fare provided by the commonplace life of the Muddletonians I will now without further preamble begin the history of my life I assure you my dear Lena mister Zaluski is nothing less than a Nihilist The sound waves set in motion by missus O Reilly s words were tumultuously heaving in the atmosphere when I sprang into being a young but perfectly formed and most promising slander A delicious odour of tea pervaded the drawing room it was orange flower pekoe and missus O Reilly was just handing one of the delicate Crown Derby cups to her visitor Miss Lena Houghton What a shocking thing Do you really mean it exclaimed Miss Houghton Thank you cream but no sugar don t you know missus O Reilly that it is only Low Church people who take sugar nowadays But really now about mister Zaluski How did you find it out My dear I am an old woman and I have learnt in the course of a wandering life to put two and two together said missus O Reilly She had somehow managed to ignore middle age and had passed from her position of renowned beauty to the position which she now firmly and constantly claimed of many years and much experience Of course she continued like every one else I was glad enough to be friendly and pleasant to Sigismund Zaluski and as to his being a Pole why I think it rather pleased me than otherwise You see my dear I have knocked about the world and mixed with all kinds of people Still one must draw the line somewhere and I confess it gave me a very painful shock to find that he had such violent antipathies to law and order When he took Ivy Cottage for the summer I made the General call at once and before long we had become very intimate with him but my dear he s not what I thought him not at all Well now I am delighted to hear you say that said Lena Houghton with some excitement in her manner for it exactly fits in with what I always felt about him From the first I disliked that man and the way he goes on with Gertrude Morley is simply dreadful If they are not engaged they ought to be that s all I can say Engaged my dear I trust not said missus O Reilly I had always hoped for something very different for dear Gertrude Quite between ourselves you know my nephew John Carew is over head and ears in love with her and they would make a very good pair don t you think so Well you see I like Gertrude to a certain extent replied Lena Houghton But I never raved about her as so many people do Still I hope she will not be entrapped into marrying mister Zaluski she deserves a better fate than that I quite agree with you said missus O Reilly with a troubled look And the worst of it is poor Gertrude is a girl who might very likely take up foolish revolutionary notions she needs a strong wise husband to keep her in order and form her opinions But is it really true that he flirts with her This is the first I have heard of it I can t think how it has escaped my notice Nor I for indeed he is up at the Morleys pretty nearly every day What with tennis and music and riding there is always some excuse for it I can t think what Gertrude sees in him he is not even good looking There is a certain surface good nature about him said missus O Reilly It deceived even me at first But my dear Lena mark my words that man has a fearful temper and I pray Heaven that poor Gertrude may have her eyes opened in time Besides to think of that little gentle delicate thing marrying a Nihilist It is too dreadful really quite too dreadful John would never get over it The thing I can t understand is why all the world has taken him up so said Lena Houghton One meets him everywhere yet nobody seems to know anything about him Just because he has taken Ivy Cottage for four months and because he seems to be rich and good natured every one is ready to run after him Well well said missus O Reilly we all like to be neighbourly my dear and a week ago I should have been ready to say nothing but good of him But now my eyes have been opened I ll tell you just how it was We were sitting here just as you and I are now at afternoon tea the talk had flagged a little and for the sake of something to say I made some remark about Bulgaria not that I really knew anything about it you know for I m no politician still I knew it was a subject that would make talk just now My dear I assure you I was positively frightened All in a minute his face changed his eyes flashed he broke into such a torrent of abuse as I never heard in my life before Do you mean that he abused you Dear me no but Russia and the Czar and tyranny and despotism and many other things I had never heard of I tried to calm him down and reason with him but I might as well have reasoned with the cockatoo in the window At last he caught himself up quickly in the middle of a sentence strode over to the piano and began to play as he generally does you know when he comes here Well would you believe it my dear instead of improvising or playing operatic airs as usual he began to play a stupid little tune which every child was taught years ago of course with variations of his own Then he turned round on the music stool with the oddest smile I ever saw and said Do you know that air missus O Reilly Yes I said but I forget now what it is It was composed by Pestal one of the victims of Russian tyranny said he The executioner did his work badly and Pestal had to be strung up twice In the interval he was heard to mutter Stupid country where they don t even know how to hang Then he gave a little forced laugh got up quickly wished me good bye and was gone before I could put in a word What a horrible story to tell in a drawing room said Lena Houghton I envy Gertrude less than ever Poor girl What a sad prospect it is for her said missus O Reilly with a sigh Of course my dear you ll not repeat what I have just told you Not for the world said Lena Houghton emphatically It is perfectly safe with me The conversation was here abruptly ended for the page threw open the drawing room door and announced mister Zaluski Talk of the angel murmured missus O Reilly with a significant smile at her companion Then skilfully altering the expression of her face she beamed graciously on the guest who was ushered into the room and Lena Houghton also prepared to greet him most pleasantly I looked with much interest at Sigismund Zaluski and as I looked I partly understood why Miss Houghton had been prejudiced against him at first sight He had lived five years in England and nothing pleased him more than to be taken for an Englishman He had had his silky black hair closely cropped in the very hideous fashion of the present day he wore the ostentatiously high collar now in vogue and he tried to be sedulously English in every respect But in spite of his wonderfully fluent speech and almost perfect accent there lingered about him something which would not harmonise with that ideal of an English gentleman which is latent in most minds Something he lacked something he possessed which interfered with the part he desired to play The something lacking showed itself in his ineradicable love of jewellery and in a transparent habit of fibbing the something possessed showed itself in his easy grace of movement his delightful readiness to amuse and to be amused and in a certain cleverness and rapidity of idea rarely if ever found in an Englishman He was a little above the average height and very finely built but there was nothing striking in his aquiline features and dark grey eyes and I think Miss Houghton spoke truly when she said that he was Not even good looking Still in spite of this it was a face which grew upon most people and I felt the least little bit of regret as I looked at him because I knew that I should persistently haunt and harass him and should do all that could be done to spoil his life Apparently he had forgotten all about Russia and Bulgaria for he looked radiantly happy Clearly his thoughts were engrossed with his own affairs which in other words meant with Gertrude Morley and though as I have since observed there are times when a man in love is an altogether intolerable sort of being there are other times when he is very much improved by the passion and regards the whole world with a genial kindliness which contrasts strangely with his previous cool cynicism How delightful and home like your room always looks he exclaimed taking the cup of tea which missus O Reilly handed to him I am horribly lonely at Ivy Cottage This house is a sort of oasis in the desert Why you are hardly ever at home I thought said missus O Reilly smiling You are the lion of the neighbourhood just now and I m sure it is very good of you to come in and cheer a lonely old woman Are you going to play me something rather more lively to day He laughed Ah Poor Pestal I had forgotten all about our last meeting You were very much excited that day said missus O Reilly I had no idea that your political notions He interrupted her Ah no politics to day dear missus O Reilly Let us have nothing but enjoyment and harmony See now I will play you something very much more cheerful And sitting down to the piano he played the bridal march from Lohengrin then wandered off into an improvised air and finally treated them to some recollections of the Mikado Lena Houghton watched him thoughtfully as she put on her gloves he was playing with great spirit and the words of the opera rang in her ears For he s going to marry Yum yum Yum yum And so you had better be dumb dumb dumb I knew well enough that she would not follow this moral advice and I laughed to myself because the whole scene was such a hollow mockery The placid benevolent looking old lady leaning back in her arm chair the girl in her blue gingham and straw hat preparing to go to the afternoon service the happy lover entering heart and soul into Sullivan s charming music the pretty room with its Chippendale furniture its aesthetic hangings its bowls of roses and the sound of church bells wafted through the open window on the soft summer breeze Yet all the time I lingered there unseen carrying with me all sorts of dread possibilities I had been introduced into the world and even if missus O Reilly had been willing to admit to herself that she had broken the ninth commandment and had earnestly desired to recall me all her sighs and tears and regrets would have availed nothing so true is the saying Of thy word unspoken thou art master thy spoken word is master of thee Thank you Thank you How I envy your power of playing The two ladies seemed to vie with each other in making pretty speeches and Zaluski who loved music and loved giving pleasure looked really pleased I am sure it did not enter his head that his two companions were not sincere or that they did not wish him well He was thinking to himself how simple and kindly the Muddleton people were and how great a contrast this life was to his life in London and he was saying to himself that he had been a fool to live a lonely bachelor life till he was nearly thirty and yet congratulating himself that he had done so since Gertrude was but nineteen Undoubtedly he was seeing blissful visions of the future all the time that he replied to the pretty speeches and shook hands with Lena Houghton and opened the drawing room door for her and took out his watch to assure her that she had plenty of time and need not hurry to church Poor Zaluski He looked so kindly and pleasant Though I was only a slander and might have been supposed to have no heart at all I did feel sorry for him when I thought of the future and of the grief and pain which would persistently dog his steps

2269_88761_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Bear not false witness slander not nor lie Truth is the speech of inward purity 
none	none	The Light of Asia 
2269_88761_000004_000000	train-clean-360	In my first stage the reader will perceive that I was a comparatively weak and harmless little slander with merely that taint of original sin which was to be expected in one of such parentage 
2269_88761_000004_000001	train-clean-360	But I developed with great rapidity and I believe men of science will tell you that this is always the case with low organisms 
2269_88761_000004_000002	train-clean-360	That for instance while it takes years to develop the man from the baby and months to develop the dog from the puppy the baby monad will grow to maturity in an hour 
2269_88761_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Personally I should have preferred to linger in missus O Reilly s pleasant drawing room for as I said before my victim interested me and I wanted to observe him more closely and hear what he talked about 
2269_88761_000005_000001	train-clean-360	But I received orders to attend evensong at the parish church and to haunt the mind of Lena Houghton 
2269_88761_000006_000000	train-clean-360	As we passed down the High Street the bells rang out loud and clear and they made me feel the same slight sense of discomfort that I had felt when I looked at Zaluski however I went on and soon entered the church 
2269_88761_000006_000001	train-clean-360	It was a fine old Gothic building and the afternoon sunshine seemed to flood the whole place even the white stones in the aisle were glorified here and there with gorgeous patches of colour from the stained glass windows 
2269_88761_000006_000002	train-clean-360	But the strange stillness and quiet oppressed me I did not feel nearly so much at home as in missus O Reilly s drawing room to use a terrestrial simile I felt like a fish out of water 
none	none	For some time too I could find no entrance at all into the mind of Lena Houghton 
2269_88761_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Try as I would I could not distract her attention or gain the slightest hold upon her and I really believe I should have been altogether baffled had not the rector unconsciously come to my aid 
2269_88761_000008_000000	train-clean-360	All through the prayers and psalms I had fought a desperate fight without gaining a single inch 
2269_88761_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Then the rector walked over to the lectern and the moment he opened his mouth I knew that my time had come and that there was a very fair chance of victory before me 
2269_88761_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Whether this clergyman had a toothache or a headache or a heavy load on his mind I cannot say but his reading was more lugubrious than the wind in an equinoctial gale 
none	none	I have since observed that he was only a degree worse than many other clerical readers and that a strange and delightfully mistaken notion seems prevalent that the Bible must be read in a dreary and unnatural tone of voice or with a sort of mournful monotony it is intended as a sort of reverence but I suspect that it often plays into the hands of my progenitor as it most assuredly did in the present instance 
2269_88761_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Hardly had the rector announced Here beginneth the forty fourth verse of the sixteenth chapter of the book of the prophet Ezekiel than a sort of relaxation took place in the mind I was attacking 
2269_88761_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Lena Houghton s attention could only have been given to the drearily read lesson by a very great effort she was a little lazy and did not make the effort she thought how nice it was to sit down again and then the melancholy voice lulled her into a vague interval of thoughtless inactivity 
2269_88761_000009_000002	train-clean-360	I promptly seized my opportunity and in a moment her whole mind was full of me 
2269_88761_000009_000003	train-clean-360	She was an excitable impressionable sort of girl and when once I had obtained an entrance into her mind I found it the easiest thing in the world to dominate her thoughts 
none	none	Though she stood and sat and knelt and curtseyed and articulated words her thoughts were entirely absorbed in me 
2269_88761_000009_000005	train-clean-360	I crowded out the Magnificat with a picture of Zaluski and Gertrude Morley 
2269_88761_000009_000006	train-clean-360	I led her through more terrible future possibilities in the second lesson than would be required for a three volume novel 
none	none	I entirely eclipsed the collects with reflections on unhappy marriages took her off via Russia and Nihilism in the State prayers and by the time we arrived at saint Chrysostom had become so powerful that I had worked her mind into exactly the condition I desired 
2269_88761_000010_000000	train-clean-360	The congregation rose 
2269_88761_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Lena Houghton still dominated by me knelt longer than the rest but at last she got up and walked down the aisle and I felt a great sense of relief and satisfaction 
2269_88761_000010_000002	train-clean-360	We were out in the open air once more and I had triumphed I was quite sure that she would tell the first person she met for as I have said before she was entirely taken up with me and to have kept me to herself would have required far more strength and unselfishness than she at that moment possessed 
2269_88761_000010_000003	train-clean-360	She walked slowly through the churchyard feeling much pleased to see that the curate had just left the vestry door and that in a few moments their paths must converge 
2269_88761_000011_000000	train-clean-360	mister Blackthorne had only been ordained three or four years and was a little younger and much less experienced in the ways of the world than Sigismund Zaluski 
2269_88761_000011_000001	train-clean-360	He was a good well meaning fellow a little narrow a little prejudiced a little spoiled by the devotion of the district visitors and Sunday School teachers but he was honest and energetic and as a worker among the poor few could have equalled him 
2269_88761_000011_000002	train-clean-360	He seemed to fancy however that with the poor his work ended and he was not always so wise as he might have been in Muddleton society 
2269_88761_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Good afternoon Miss Houghton he exclaimed 
2269_88761_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 Do you happen to know if your brother is at home 
2269_88761_000012_000002	train-clean-360	I want just to speak to him about the choir treat 
none	none	Oh he is sure to be in by this time said Lena 
2269_88761_000014_000000	train-clean-360	And they walked home together 
2269_88761_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 I am so glad to have this chance of speaking to you she began rather nervously 
2269_88761_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 I wanted particularly to ask your advice 
2269_88761_000016_000000	train-clean-360	mister Blackthorne being human and young was not unnaturally flattered by this remark 
2269_88761_000016_000001	train-clean-360	True he was becoming well accustomed to this sort of thing since the ladies of Muddleton were far more fond of seeking advice from the young and good looking curate than from the elderly and experienced rector 
none	none	They said it was because mister Blackthorne was so much more sympathetic and understood the difficulties of the day so much better but I think they unconsciously deceived themselves for the rector was one of a thousand and the curate though he had in him the makings of a fine man was as yet altogether crude and young Was it about anything in your district he asked devoutly hoping that she was not going to propound some difficult question about the origin of evil or any other obscure subject 
2269_88761_000017_000001	train-clean-360	For though he liked the honour of being consulted he did not always like the trouble it involved and he remembered with a shudder that Miss Houghton had once asked him his opinion about the Ethical Concept of the Good 
2269_88761_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 It was only that I was so troubled about something missus O Reilly has just told me said Lena Houghton 
2269_88761_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 You won t tell any one that I told you 
2269_88761_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 On no account said the curate warmly 
2269_88761_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Well you know mister Zaluski and how the Morleys have taken him up 
2269_88761_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Every one has taken him up said the curate with the least little touch of resentment in his tone 
2269_88761_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 I knew that the Morleys were his special friends I imagine that he admires Miss Morley 
2269_88761_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes every one thinks they are either engaged or on the brink of it 
none	none	And oh mister Blackthorne can t you or somebody put a stop to it for it seems such a dreadful fate for poor Gertrude 
2269_88761_000023_000000	train-clean-360	The curate looked startled 
2269_88761_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Why I don t profess to like mister Zaluski he said 
2269_88761_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 But I don t know anything exactly against him 
2269_88761_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 But I do 
none	none	missus O Reilly has just been telling me
2269_88761_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 What did she tell you he asked with some curiosity 
2269_88761_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Why she has found out that he is really a Nihilist just think of a Nihilist going about loose like this and playing tennis at the rectory and all the good houses 
2269_88761_000027_000001	train-clean-360	And not only that but she says he is altogether a dangerous unprincipled man with a dreadful temper 
2269_88761_000027_000002	train-clean-360	You can t think how unhappy she is about poor Gertrude and so am I for we were at school together and have always been friends 
2269_88761_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 I am very sorry to hear about it said mister Blackthorne but I don t see that anything can be done 
2269_88761_000028_000001	train-clean-360	You see one does not like to interfere in these sort of things 
2269_88761_000028_000002	train-clean-360	It seems officious rather and meddlesome 
2269_88761_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes that is the worst of it she replied with a sigh 
2269_88761_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 I suppose we can do nothing 
2269_88761_000029_000002	train-clean-360	Still it has been a great relief just to tell you about it and get it off my mind 
2269_88761_000029_000003	train-clean-360	I suppose we can only hope that something may put a stop to it all we must just leave it to chance 
2269_88761_000030_000000	train-clean-360	This sentiment amused me not a little 
2269_88761_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Leave it to chance indeed 
2269_88761_000030_000002	train-clean-360	Had she not caused me to grow stronger and larger by every word she uttered And had not the conversation revealed to me mister Blackthorn s one vulnerable part 
2269_88761_000030_000003	train-clean-360	I knew well enough that I should be able to dominate his thoughts as I had done hers 
2269_88761_000030_000004	train-clean-360	Finding me burdensome she had passed me on to somebody else with additions that vastly increased my working powers and then she talked of leaving it to chance 
2269_88761_000030_000005	train-clean-360	The way in which mortals practise pious frauds on themselves is really delightful 
2269_88761_000030_000006	train-clean-360	And yet Lena Houghton was a good sort of girl and had from her childhood repeated the catechism words which proclaim that My duty to my neighbour is to love him as myself 
2269_88761_000030_000007	train-clean-360	To keep my tongue from evil speaking lying and slandering What is more she took great pains to teach these words to a big class of Sunday School children and went rain or shine to spend two hours each Sunday in a stuffy school room for that purpose 
2269_88761_000030_000008	train-clean-360	It was strange that she should be so ready to believe evil of her neighbour and so eager to spread the story 
2269_88761_000030_000009	train-clean-360	But my progenitor is clever and doubtless knows very well whom to select as his tools 
none	none	By this time they had reached a comfortable looking red brick house with white stone facings and in the discussion of the arrangements for the choir treat I was entirely forgotten MY THIRD STAGE Alas such is our weakness that we often more readily believe and speak of another that which is evil than that which is good But perfect men do not easily give credit to every report because they know man s weakness which is very prone to evil and very subject to fail in words THOMAS A KEMPIS All through that evening and through the first part of the succeeding day I was crowded out of the curate s mind by a host of thoughts with which I had nothing in common and though I hovered about him as he taught in the school and visited several sick people and argued with an habitual drunkard and worked at his Sunday sermon a Power which I felt but did not understand baffled all my attempts to gain an entrance and attract his notice I made a desperate attack on him after lunch as he sat smoking and enjoying a well earned rest but it was of no avail I followed him to a large garden party later on but to my great annoyance he went about talking to every one in the pleasantest way imaginable though I perceived that he was longing to play tennis instead At length however my opportunity came mister Blackthorne was talking to the lady of the house missus Courtenay when she suddenly exclaimed Ah here is mister Zaluski just arriving I began to be afraid that he had forgotten the day and he is always such an acquisition How do you do mister Zaluski she said greeting my victim warmly as he stepped on to the terrace So glad you were able to come You know mister Blackthorne I think Zaluski greeted the curate pleasantly and his dark eyes lighted up with a gleam of amusement Oh we are great friends he said laughingly Only you know I sometimes shock him a little just a very little That is very unkind of you I am sure said missus Courtenay smiling No not at all said Zaluski with the audacity of a privileged being It is just my little amusement very harmless very what you call innocent mister Blackthorne cannot make up his mind about me One day I appear to him to be Catholic the next Comtist the next Orthodox Greek the next a convert to the Anglican communion I am a mystery you see And mysteries are as indispensable in life as in a romance He laughed missus Courtenay laughed too and a little friendly banter was carried on between them while the curate stood by feeling rather out of it I drew nearer to him perceiving that my prospects bid fair to improve For very few people can feel out of it without drifting into a self regarding mood and then they are the easiest prey imaginable Undoubtedly a man like Zaluski with his easy nonchalance his knowledge of the world his genuine good nature and the background of sterling qualities which came upon you as a surprise because he loved to make himself seem a mere idler was apt to eclipse an ordinary mortal like James Blackthorne The curate perceived this and did not like to be eclipsed as a matter of fact nobody does It seemed to him a little unfair that he who had hitherto been made much of should be called to play second fiddle to this rich Polish fellow who had never done anything for Muddleton or the neighbourhood And then too Sigismund Zaluski had a way of poking fun at him which he resented and would not take in good part Something of this began to stir in his mind and he cordially hated the Pole when Jim Courtenay who arranged the tennis came up and asked him to play in the next set passing the curate by altogether Then I found no difficulty at all in taking possession of him indeed he was delighted to have me brought back to his memory he positively gloated over me and I grew apace Zaluski in the seventh heaven of happiness was playing with Gertrude Morley and his play was so good and so graceful that every one was watching it with pleasure His partner too played well she was a pretty fair haired girl with soft grey eyes like the eyes of a dove she wore a white tennis dress and a white sailor hat and at her throat she had fastened a cluster of those beautiful orange coloured roses known by the prosaic name of William Allan Richardson If mister Blackthorne grew angry as he watched Sigismund Zaluski he grew doubly angry as he watched Gertrude Morley He said to himself that it was intolerable that such a girl should fall a prey to a vain shallow unprincipled foreigner and in a few minutes he had painted such a dark picture of poor Sigismund that my strength increased tenfold mister Blackthorne said missus Courtenay would you take missus Milton Cleave to have an ice Now missus Milton Cleave had always been one of the curate s great friends She was a very pleasant talkative woman of six and thirty and a general favourite Her popularity was well deserved for she was always ready to do a kind action and often went out of her way to help people who had not the slightest claim upon her There was however no repose about missus Milton Cleave and an acute observer would have discovered that her universal readiness to help was caused to some extent by her good heart but in a very large degree by her restless and over active brain Her sphere was scarcely large enough for her she would have made an excellent head of an orphan asylum or manager of some large institution but her quiet country life offered far too narrow a field for her energy It is really quite a treat to watch mister Zaluski s play she remarked as they walked to the refreshment tent at the other end of the lawn Certainly foreigners know how to move much better than we do our best players look awkward beside them Do you think so said mister Blackthorne I am afraid I am full of prejudice and consider that no one can equal a true born Briton And I quite agree with you in the main said missus Milton Cleave Though I confess that it is rather refreshing to have a little variety The curate was silent but his silence merely covered his absorption in me and I began to exercise a faint influence through his mind on the mind of his companion This caused her at length to say I don t think you quite like mister Zaluski Do you know much about him I have met him several times this summer said the curate in the tone of one who could have said much more if he would The less satisfying his replies the more missus Milton Cleave s curiosity grew Now tell me candidly she said at length Is there not some mystery about our new neighbour Is he quite what he seems to be I fear he is not said mister Blackthorne making the admission in a tone of reluctance though to tell the truth he had been longing to pass me on for the last five minutes You mean that he is fast Worse than that said James Blackthorne lowering his voice as they walked down one of the shady garden paths He is a dangerous unprincipled fellow and into the bargain an avowed Nihilist All that is involved in that word you perhaps scarcely realise Indeed I do she exclaimed with a shocked expression I have just been reading a review of that book by Stepniak Their social and religious views are terrible free love atheism everything that could bring ruin on the human race Is he indeed a Nihilist mister Blackthorne s conscience gave him a sharp prick for he knew that he ought not to have passed me on He tried to pacify it with the excuse that he had only promised not to tell that Miss Houghton had been his informant I assure you he said impressively it is only too true I know it on the best authority And here I cannot help remarking that it has always seemed to me strange that even experienced women of the world like missus Milton Cleave can be so easily hoodwinked by that vague nonentity The Best Authority I am inclined to think that were I a human being I should retort with an expressive motion of the finger and thumb Oh you know it on the best authority do you Then that for your story However I thrived wonderfully on the best authority and it would be ungrateful of me to speak evil of that powerful though imaginary being At right angles with the garden walk down which the two were pacing there was another wide pathway bordered by high closely clipped shrubs Down this paced a very different couple missus Milton Cleave caught sight of them and so did curate missus Milton Cleave sighed I am afraid he is running after Gertrude Morley Poor girl I hope she will not be deluded into encouraging him And then they made just the same little set remarks about the desirability of stopping so dangerous an acquaintance and the impossibility of interfering with other people s affairs and the sad necessity of standing by with folded hands I laughed so much over their hollow little phrases that at last I was fain to beat a retreat and prompted by curiosity to know a little of the truth I followed Sigismund and Gertrude down the broad grassy pathway I knew of course a good deal of Zaluski s character because my own existence and growth pointed out what he was not Still to study a man by a process of negation is tedious and though I knew that he was not a Nihilist or a free lover or an atheist or an unprincipled fellow with a dangerous temper yet I was curious to see him as he really was If you only knew how happy you had made me he was saying And indeed as far as happiness went there was not much to choose between them I fancy for Gertrude Morley looked radiant and in her clove like eyes there was the reflection of the love which flashed in his You must talk to my mother about it she said after a minute s silence You see I am still under age and she and Uncle Henry my guardian must consent before we are actually betrothed I will see them at once said Zaluski eagerly You could see my mother she replied But Uncle Henry is still in Sweden and will not be in town for another week Must we really wait so long sighed Sigismund impatiently She laughed at him gently A whole week But then we are sure of each other I do not think we ought to grumble But perhaps they may think that a merchant is no fitting match for you he suggested I am nothing but a plain merchant and my I people have been in the same business for four generations As far as wealth goes I might perhaps satisfy your people but for the rest I am but a prosaic fellow with neither noble blood nor the brain of a genius nor anything out of the common It will be enough for my mother that we love each other she said shyly And your uncle It will be enough for him that you are upright and honourable enough that you are yourself Sigismund They were sitting now in a little sheltered recess clipped out of the yew trees When that softly spoken Sigismund fell from her lips Zaluski caught her in his arms and kissed her again and again I have led such a lonely life he said after a few minutes during which their talk had baffled my comprehension All my people died while I was still a boy Then who brought you up she inquired An uncle of mine the head of our firm in saint Petersburg He was very good to me but he had children of his own and of course I could not be to him as one of them I have had many friends and much kindness shown to me but love none till to day And then again they fell into the talk which I could not fathom And so I left them in their brief happiness for my time of idleness was over and I was ordered to attend missus Milton Cleave without a moment s delay MY FOURTH STAGE Oh the little more and how much it is R BROWING missus Milton Cleave had one weakness she was possessed by an inordinate desire for influence This made her always eagerly anxious to be interesting both in her conversation and in her letters and to this end she exerted herself with unwearying activity She liked influencing mister Blackthorne and spared no pains on him that afternoon and indeed the curate was a good deal flattered by her friendship and considered her one of the most clever and charming women he had ever met Sigismund and Gertrude returned to the ordinary world just as missus Milton Cleave was saying good bye to the hostess She glanced at them searchingly Good bye Gertrude she said a little coldly Did you win at tennis Indeed we did said Gertrude smiling We came off with flying colours It was a love set The girl was looking more beautiful than ever and there was a tell tale colour in her cheeks and an unusual light in her soft grey eyes As for Zaluski he was so evidently in love and had the audacity to look so supremely happy that missus Milton Cleave was more than ever impressed with the gravity of the situation The curate handed her into her victoria and she drove home through the sheltered lanes musing sadly over the story she had heard and wondering what Gertrude s future would be When she reached home however the affair was driven from her thoughts by her children of whom she was devotedly fond They came running to meet her frisking like so many kittens round her as she went upstairs to her room and begging to stay with her while she dressed for dinner During dinner she was engrossed with her husband but afterwards when she was alone in the drawing room I found my opportunity for working on her restless mind Dear me she exclaimed throwing aside the newspaper she had just taken up I ought to write to missus Selldon at Dulminster about that G F S girl As a matter of fact she ought not to have written then the letter might well have waited till the morning and she was over tired and needed rest But I was glad to see her take up her pen for I knew I should come in most conveniently to fill up the second side of the sheet Before long Jane Stiggins the member who had migrated from Muddleton to Dulminster had been duly reported wound up and made over to the Archdeacon s wife Then the tired hand paused What more could she say to her friend We are leading our usual quiet life here she wrote with the ordinary round of tennis parties and picnics to enliven us The children have all been wonderfully well and I think you will see a great improvement in your god daughter when you next come to stay with us Oh dear sighed missus Milton Cleave how dull and stupid I am to night I can t think of a single thing to say Then at length I flashed into her mind and with a sigh of relief and a little rising flush of excitement she went on much more rapidly It is such a comfort to be quite at rest about them and to see them all looking so well But I suppose one can never be without some cause of worry and just now I am very unhappy about that nice girl Gertrude Morley whom you admired so much when you were last here The whole neighbourhood has been dominated this year by a young Polish merchant named Sigismund Zaluski who is very clever and musical and knows well how to win popularity He has taken Ivy Cottage for four mouths and is I fear doing great mischief The Morleys are his special friends and I greatly fear he is making love to Gertrude Now I know privately on the very best authority that although he has so completely deceived every one and has managed so cleverly to pose as a respectable man that mister Zaluski is really a Nihilist a free lover an atheist and altogether a most unprincipled man He is very clever and speaks English most fluently indeed he has lived in London since the spring of eighteen eighty one he told me so himself I cannot help fancying that he must have been concerned in the assassination of the late Czar which you will remember took place in that year early in March It is terrible to think of the poor Morleys entering blindfold on such an undesirable connection but at the same time I really do not feel that I can say anything about it Excuse this hurried note dear Charlotte and with love to yourself and kindest remembrances to the Archdeacon Believe me very affectionately yours GEORGINA MILTON CLEAVE P S It may perhaps be as well not to mention this affair about Gertrude Morley and mister Zaluski They are not yet engaged as far as I know and I sincerely trust it may prove to be a mere flirtation I had now grown to such enormous dimensions that any one who had known me in my infancy would scarcely have recognised me while naturally the more I grew the more powerful I became and the more capable both of impressing the minds which received me and of injuring Zaluski Poor Zaluski who was so foolishly thoughtlessly happy He little dreamed of the fate that awaited him His whole world was bright and full of promise each hour of love seemed to improve him to deepen his whole character to tone down his rather flippant manner to awaken for him new and hitherto unthought of realities But while he basked in his new happiness I travelled in my close stuffy envelope to Dulminster and after having been tossed in and out of bags shuffled stamped thumped tied up and generally shaken about I arrived one morning at Dulminster Archdeaconry and was laid on the breakfast table among other appetising things to greet missus Selldon when she came downstairs MY FIFTH STAGE Also it is wise not to believe everything you hear not immediately to carry to the ears of others what you have either heard or believed THOMAS A KEMPIS Though I was read in silence at the breakfast table and not passed on to the Archdeacon I lay dormant in missus Selldon s mind all day and came to her aid that night when she was at her wits end for something to talk about missus Selldon though a most worthy and estimable person was of a phlegmatic temperament her sympathies were not easily aroused her mind was lazy and torpid in conversation she was unutterably dull There were times when she was painfully conscious of this and would have given much for the ceaseless flow of words which fell from the lips of her friend missus Milton Cleave And that evening after my arrival chanced to be one of these occasions for there was a dinner party at the Archdeaconry given in honour of a well known author who was spending a few days in the neighbourhood I wish you could have mister Shrewsbury at your end of the table Thomas missus Selldon had remarked to her husband with a sigh as she was arranging the guests on paper that afternoon Oh he must certainly take you in my dear said the Archdeacon And he seems a very clever well read man I am sure you will find him easy to talk to Poor missus Selldon thought that she would rather have had some one who was neither clever nor well read But there was no help for her and whether she would or not she had to go in to dinner with the literary lion mister Mark Shrewsbury was a novelist of great ability Some twenty years before he had been called to the bar and conscious of real talent had been greatly embittered by the impossibility of getting on in his profession At length in disgust he gave up all hopes of success and devoted himself instead to literature In this field he won the recognition for which he craved his books were read everywhere his name became famous his income steadily increased and he had the pleasant consciousness that he had found his vocation Still in spite of his success he could not forget the bitter years of failure and disappointment which had gone before and though his novels were full of genius they were pervaded by an undertone of sarcasm so that people after reading them were more ready than before to take cynical views of life He was one of those men whose quiet impassive faces reveal scarcely anything of their character He was neither tall nor short neither dark nor fair neither handsome nor the reverse in fact his personality was not in the least impressive while like most true artists he observed all things so quietly that you rarely discovered that he was observing at all Dear me people would say Is Mark Shrewsbury really here Which is he I don t see any one at all like my idea of a novelist There he is that man in spectacles would be the reply And really the spectacles were the only noteworthy thing about him missus Selldon who had seen several authors and authoresses in her time and knew that they were as a rule most ordinary hum drum kind of people was quite prepared for her fate She remembered her astonishment as a girl when having laughed and cried at the play and taken the chief actor as her ideal hero she had had him pointed out to her one day in Regent Street and found him to be a most commonplace looking man the very last person one would have supposed capable of stirring the hearts of a great audience Meanwhile dinner progressed and missus Selldon talked to an empty headed but loquacious man on her left and racked her brains for something to say to the alarmingly silent author on her right She remembered hearing that Charles Dickens would often sit silent through the whole of dinner observing quietly those about him but that at dessert he would suddenly come to life and keep the whole table in roars of laughter She feared that mister Shrewsbury meant to imitate the great novelist in the first particular but was scarcely likely to follow his example in the last At length she asked him what he thought of the cathedral and a few tepid remarks followed How unutterably this good lady bores me thought the author How odd it is that his characters talk so well in his books and that he is such a stick thought missus Selldon I suppose it s the effect of cathedral town atmosphere reflected the author I suppose he is eaten up with conceit and won t trouble himself to talk to me thought the hostess By the time the fish had been removed they had arrived at a state of mutual contempt Mindful of the reputation they had to keep up however they exerted themselves a little more while the entrees went round Seldom reads I should fancy and never thinks reflected the author glancing at missus Selldon s placid unintellectual face What on earth can I say to her Very unpractical I am sure reflected missus Selldon The sort of man who lives in a world of his own and only lays down his pen to take up a book What subject shall I start What delightful weather we have been having the last few days observed the author Real genuine summer weather at last The same remark had been trembling on missus Selldon s lips She assented with great cheerfulness and alacrity and over that invaluable topic which is always so safe and so congenial and so ready to hand they grew quite friendly and the conversation for fully five minutes was animated An interval of thought followed How wearisome is society reflected missus Selldon It is hard that we must spend so much money in giving dinners and have so much trouble for so little enjoyment One pays dearly for fame reflected the author What a confounded nuisance it is to waste all this time when there are the last proofs of What Caste to be done for the nine o clock post to morrow morning Goodness knows what time I shall get to bed to night Then missus Selldon thought regretfully of the comfortable easy chair that she usually enjoyed after dinner and the ten minutes nap and the congenial needle work And Mark Shrewsbury thought of his chambers in Pump Court and longed for his type writer and his books and his swivel chair and his favourite meerschaum I should be less afraid to talk if there were not always the horrible idea that he may take down what one says thought missus Selldon I should be less bored if she would only be her natural self reflected the author And would not talk prim platitudes This was hard for he had talked nothing else himself Does she think she is so interesting that I am likely to study her for my next book Have you been abroad this summer inquired missus Selldon making another spasmodic attempt at conversation No I detest travelling replied Mark Shrewsbury When I need change I just settle down in some quiet country district for a few months somewhere near Windsor or Reigate or Muddleton There is nothing to my mind like our English scenery Oh do you know Muddleton exclaimed missus Selldon Is it not a charming little place I often stay in the neighbourhood with the Milton Cleaves I know Milton Cleave well said the author A capital fellow quite the typical country gentleman Is he not said missus Selldon much relieved to have found this subject in common His wife is a great friend of mine she is full of life and energy and does an immense amount of good Did you say you had stayed with them No but last year I took a house in that neighbourhood for a few months a most charming little place it was just fit for a lonely bachelor I dare say you remember it Ivy Cottage on the Newton Road Did you stay there Now what a curious coincidence Only this morning I heard from missus Milton Cleave that Ivy Cottage has been taken this summer by a mister Sigismund Zaluski a Polish merchant who is doing untold harm in the neighbourhood He is a very clever unscrupulous man and has managed to take in almost every one Why what is he A swindler Or a burglar in disguise like the House on the Marsh fellow asked the author with a little twinkle of amusement in his face Oh much worse than that said missus Selldon lowering her voice I assure you mister Shrewsbury you would hardly credit the story if I were to tell it you it is really stranger than fiction Mark Shrewsbury pricked up his ears he no longer felt bored he began to think that after all there might be some compensation for this wearisome dinner party He was always glad to seize upon material for future plots and somehow the notion of a mysterious Pole suddenly making his appearance in that quiet country neighbourhood and winning undeserved popularity rather took his fancy He thought he might make something of it However he knew human nature too well to ask a direct question I am sorry to hear that he said becoming all at once quite sympathetic and approachable I don t like the thought of those simple unsophisticated people being hoodwinked by a scoundrel No is it not sad said missus Selldon Such pleasant hospitable people as they are Do you remember the Morleys Oh yes There was a pretty daughter who played tennis well Quite so Gertrude Morley Well would you believe it this miserable fortune hunter is actually either engaged to her or on the eve of being engaged Poor missus Milton Cleave is so unhappy about it for she knows on the best authority that mister Zaluski is unfit to enter a respectable house Perhaps he is really some escaped criminal suggested mister Shrewsbury tentatively missus Selldon hesitated Then under the cover of the general roar of conversation she said in a low voice You have guessed quite rightly He is one of the Nihilists who were concerned in the assassination of the late Czar You don t say so exclaimed Mark Shrewsbury much startled Is it possible Indeed it is only too true said missus Selldon I heard it only the other morning and on the very best authority Poor Gertrude Morley My heart bleeds for her Now I can t help observing here that this must have been the merest figure of speech for just then there was a comfortable little glow of satisfaction about missus Selldon s heart She was so delighted to have got on well as she expressed it with the literary lion and by this time dessert was on the table and soon the tedious ceremony would be happily over But how did he escape asked Mark Shrewsbury still with the thought of copy in his mind I don t know the details said missus Selldon Probably they are only known to himself But he managed to escape somehow in the month of March eighteen eighty one and to reach England safely I fear it is only too often the case in this world wickedness is apt to be successful To flourish like a green bay tree said Mark Shrewsbury congratulating himself on the aptness of the quotation and its suitability to the Archediaconal dinner table It is the strangest story I have heard for a long time Just then there was a pause in the general conversation and missus Selldon took advantage of it to make the sign for rising so that no more passed with regard to Zaluski Shrewsbury flattering himself that he had left a good impression by his last remark thought better not to efface it later in the evening by any other conversation with his hostess But in the small hours of the night when he had finished his bundle of proofs he took up his notebook and strangling his yawns made two or three brief pithy notes of the story missus Selldon had told him adding a further development which occurred to him and wondering to himself whether Like a Green Bay Tree would be a selling title After this he went to bed and slept the sleep of the just or the unbroken sleep which goes by that name MY SIXTH STAGE But whispering tongues can poison truth COLERIDGE London in early September is a somewhat trying place Mark Shrewsbury found it less pleasing in reality than in his visions during the dinner party at Dulminster True his chambers were comfortable and his type writer was as invaluable a machine as ever and his novel was drawing to a successful conclusion but though all these things were calculated to cheer him he was nevertheless depressed Town was dull the heat was trying and he had never in his life found it so difficult to settle down to work He began to agree with the Preacher that of making many books there is no end and that in spite of his favourite Remington s perfected No two novel writing was a weariness to the flesh Soon he drifted into a sort of vague idleness which was not a good honest holiday but just a lazy waste of time and brains I was pleased to observe this and was not slow to take advantage of it Had he stayed in Pump Court he might have forgotten me altogether in his work but in the soft luxury of his Club life I found that I had a very fair chance of being passed on to some one else One hot afternoon on waking from a comfortable nap in the depths of an armchair at the Club Shrewsbury was greeted by one of his friends I thought you were in Switzerland old fellow he exclaimed yawning and stretching himself Came back yesterday awfully bad season confoundedly dull returned the other Where have you been Down with Warren near Dulminster Deathly dull hole Do for your next novel Eh said the other with a laugh Mark Shrewsbury smiled good naturedly Talking of novels he observed with another yawn I heard such a story down there Did you Let s hear it A nice little scandal would do instead of a pick me up It s not a scandal Don t raise your expectations It s the story of a successful scoundrel And then I came out again in full vigour nay with vastly increased powers for though Mark Shrewsbury did not add very much to me or alter my appearance yet his graphic words made me much more impressive than I had been under the management of missus Selldon H m that s a queer story said the limp looking young man from Switzerland I say have a game of billiards will you Shrewsbury with prodigious yawn dragged himself up out of his chair and the two went off together As they left the room the only other man present looked up from his newspaper following them with his eyes Shrewsbury the novelist he thought to himself A sterling fellow And he heard it from an Archdeacon s wife Confound it all the thing must be true then I ll write and make full inquiries about this Zaluski before consenting to the engagement And being a prompt business like man Gertrude Morley s uncle sat down and wrote the following letter to a Russian friend of his who lived at saint Petersburg and who might very likely be able to give some account of Zaluski Dear Leonoff Some very queer stories are afloat about a young Polish merchant by name Sigismund Zaluski the head of the London branch of the firm of Zaluski and Zernoff at saint Petersburg Will you kindly make inquiries for me as to his true character and history I would not trouble you with this affair but the fact is Zaluski has made an offer of marriage to one of my wards and before consenting to any betrothal I must know what sort of man he really is I take it for granted that there is no smoke without fire and that there must be something in the very strange tale which I have just heard on the best authority It is said that this Sigismund Zaluski left saint Petersburg in March eighteen eighty one after the assassination of the late Czar in which he was seriously compromised He is said to be an out and out Nihilist an atheist and in short a dangerous disreputable fellow Will you sift the matter for me I don t wish to dismiss the fellow without good reason but of course I could not think of permitting him to be engaged to my niece until these charges are entirely disproved With kind remembrances to your father I am yours faithfully HENRY CRICHTON MORLEY MY SEVENTH STAGE Yet on the dull silence breaking With a lightning flash a word Bearing endless desolation On its blighting wings I heard Earth can forge no keener weapon Dealing surer death and pain And the cruel echo answered Through long years again A A PROCTER Curiously enough I must actually have started for Russia on the same day that Sigismund Zaluski was summoned by his uncle at saint Petersburg to return on a matter of urgent business I learnt afterwards that the telegram arrived at Muddleton on the afternoon of one of those sunny September days and found Zaluski as usual at the Morleys He was very much annoyed at being called away just then and before he had received any reply from Gertrude s uncle as to the engagement However after a little ebullition of anger he regained his usual philosophic tone and reminding Gertrude that he need not be away from England for more than a fortnight he took leave of her and set off in a prompt manly fashion leaving most of his belongings at Ivy Cottage which was his for another six weeks and to which he hoped shortly to return After a weary time of imprisonment in my envelope I at length reached my destination at saint Petersburg and was read by Dmitry Leonoff He was a very busy man and by the same post received dozens of other letters He merely muttered That well known firm A most unlikely story and then thrust me into a drawer with other letters which had to be answered Very probably I escaped his memory altogether for the next few days however there I was a startling accusation in black and white and as everybody knows saint Petersburg is not London The Leonoff family lived on the third storey of a large block of buildings in the Sergeffskaia About two o clock in the morning on the third day after my arrival the whole household was roused from sleep by thundering raps on the door and the dreaded cry of Open to the police The unlucky master was forced to allow himself his wife and his children to be made prisoners while every corner of the house was searched and every book and paper examined Leonoff had nothing whatever to do with the Revolutionary movement but absolute innocence does not free people from the police inquisition and five or six years ago when the Search mania was at its height a case is on record of a poor lady whose house was searched seven times within twenty four hours though there was no evidence whatever that she was connected with the Nihilists the whole affair was in fact a misunderstanding as she was perfectly innocent This search in Dmitry Leonoff s house was also a misunderstanding and in the dominions of the Czar misunderstandings are of frequent occurrence Leonoff knew himself to be innocent and he felt no fear though considerable annoyance while the search was prosecuted he could hardly believe the evidence of his senses when without a word of explanation he was informed that he must take leave of his wife and children and go in charge of the gendarmes to the House of Preventive Detention Being a sensible man he kept his temper remarked courteously that some mistake must have been made embraced his weeping wife and went off passively while the pristav carried away a bundle of letters in which I occupied the most prominent place Leonoff remained a prisoner only for a few days there was not a shred of evidence against him and having suffered terrible anxiety he was finally released But mister Crichton Morley s letter was never restored to him it remained in the hands of the authorities and the night after Leonoff s arrest the pristav the procurator and the gendarmes made their way into the dwelling of Sigismund Zaluski s uncle where a similar search was prosecuted Sigismund was asleep and dreaming of Gertrude and of his idyllic summer in England when his bedroom door was forced open and he was roughly roused by the gendarmes His first feeling was one of amazement his second one of indignation however he was obliged to get up at once and dress the policeman rigorously keeping guard over him the whole time for fear he should destroy any treasonable document How I shall make them laugh in England when I tell them of this ridiculous affair reflected Sigismund as he was solemnly marched into the adjoining room where he found his uncle and cousins each guarded by a policeman He made some jesting remark but was promptly reprimanded by his gaoler and in wearisome silence the household waited while the most rigorous search of the premises was made Of course nothing was found but to the amazement of all Sigismund was formally arrested There must be some mistake he exclaimed I have been resident in England for some time I have no connection whatever with Russian politics Oh we are well aware of your residence in England said the pristav You left saint Petersburg early in March eighteen eighty one We are well aware of that Something in the man s tone made Sigismund s heart stand still Could he possibly be suspected of complicity in the plot to assassinate the late Czar The idea would have made him laugh had he been in England In saint Petersburg and under these circumstances it made him tremble There is some terrible mistake he said I have never had the slightest connection with the revolutionary party The pristav shrugged his shoulders and Sigismund feeling like one in a dream took leave of his relations and was escorted at once to the House of Preventive Detention Arrived at his destination he was examined in a brief unsatisfactory way but when he angrily asked for the evidence on which he had been arrested he was merely told that information had been received charging him with being concerned in the assassination of the late Emperor and of being an advanced member of the Nihilist party His vehement denials were received with scornful incredulity his departure for England just after the assassination and his prolonged absence from Russia of course gave colour to the accusation and he was ordered off to his cell to reflect MY TRIUMPHANT FINALE Words are mighty words are living Serpents with their venomous stings Or bright angels crowding round us With heaven s light upon their wings Every word has its own spirit True or false that never dies Every word man s lips have uttered Echoes in God s skies A A PROCTER My labours were now nearly at an end and being so to speak off duty I could occupy myself just as I pleased I therefore resolved to keep watch over Zaluski in his prison For the first few hours after his arrest he was in a violent passion he paced up and down his tiny cell like a lion in a cage he was beside himself with indignation and the blood leapt through his veins like wildfire Then he became a little ashamed of himself and tried to grow quiet and after a sleepless night he passed to the opposite extreme and sat all day long on the solitary stool in his grim abode his head resting on his hands and his mind a prey to the most fearful melancholy The second night however he slept and awoke with a steady resolve in his mind It will never do to give way like this or I shall be in a brain fever in no time he reflected I will get leave to have books and writing materials I will make the best of a bad business He remembered how pleased he had been when Gertrude had once smiled on him because when all the others in the party were grumbling at the discomforts of a certain picnic where the provisions had gone astray he had gaily made the best of it and ransacked the nearest cottages for bread and cheese He set to work bravely now hoped daily for his release read all the books he was allowed to receive invented solitary games began a novel and drew caricatures In October he was again examined but having nothing to reveal it was inevitable that he could reveal nothing and he was again sent back to his cell to reflect I perceived that after this his heart began to fail him There existed in the House of Preventive Detention a system of communication between the luckless prisoners carried on by means of tapping on the wall Sigismund being a clever fellow had become a great adept at this telegraphic system and had struck up a friendship with a young student in the next cell this poor fellow had been imprisoned three years his sole offence being that he had in his possession a book of which the Government did not approve and that he was first cousin to a well known Nihilist The two became as devoted to each other as Silvio Pellico and Count Oroboni but it soon became evident to Valerian Vasilowitch that unless Zaluski was released he would soon succumb to the terrible restrictions of prison life Keep up your heart my friend he used to say I have borne it three years and am still alive to tell the tale But you are stronger both in mind and body said Sigismund and you are not madly in love as I am And then he would pour forth a rhapsody about Gertrude and about English life and about his hopes and fears for the future to all of which Valerian like the brave fellow he was replied with words of encouragement But at length there came a day when his friend made no answer to his usual morning greeting Are you ill he asked For some time there was no reply but after a while Sigismund rapped faintly the despairing words Dead beat Valerian felt the tears start to his eyes It was what he had all along expected and for a time grief and indignation and his miserable helplessness made him almost beside himself At last he remembered that there was at least one thing in his power Each day he was escorted by a warder to a tiny square walled off in the exercising ground and was allowed to walk for a few minutes he would take this opportunity of begging the warder to get the doctor for his friend But unfortunately the doctor did not think very seriously of Zaluski s case In that dreary prison he had patients in the last stages of all kinds of disease and Sigismund who had been in confinement too short a time to look as ill as the others did not receive much attention Certainly the doctor admitted his lungs were affected probably the sudden change of climate and the lack of good food and fresh air had been too much for him so the solemn farce ended and he was left to his fate If I were indeed a Nihilist and suffered for a cause which I had at heart he telegraphed to Valerian I could bear it better But to be kept here for an imaginary offence to bear cold and hunger and illness all to no purpose that beats me There can t be a God or such things would not be allowed To me it seems said Valerian that we are the victims of violated law Others have shown tyranny or injustice or cruelty and we are the victims of their sin Don t say there is no God There must be a God to avenge such hideous wrong So they spoke to each other through their prison wall as men in the free outer world seldom care to speak and I who knew no barriers looked now on Valerian s gaunt figure and brave but prematurely old face now on poor Zaluski who in his weary imprisonment had wasted away till one could scarcely believe that he was indeed the same lithe active fellow who had played tennis at missus Courtenay s garden party Day and night Valerian listened to the terrible cough which came from the adjoining cell It became perfectly apparent to him that his friend was dying he knew it as well as if he had seen the burning hectic flush on his hollow cheeks and heard the panting hurried breaths and watched the unnatural brilliancy of his dark eyes At length he thought the time had come for another sort of comfort My friend he said one day it is too plain to me now that you are dying Write to the procurator and tell him so In some cases men have been allowed to go home to die A wild hope seized on poor Sigismund he sat down to the little table in his cell and wrote a letter to the procurator a letter which might almost have drawn tears from a flint Again and again he passionately asserted his innocence and begged to know on what evidence he was imprisoned He began to think that he could die content if he might leave this terrible cell might be a free agent once more if only for a few days At least he might in that case clear his character and convince Gertrude that his imprisonment had been all a hideous mistake nay he fancied that he might live through a journey to England and see her once again But the procurator would not let him be set free and refused to believe that his case was really a serious one Sigismund s last hope left him The days and weeks dragged slowly on and when according to English reckoning New Year s Eve arrived he could scarcely believe that only seventeen weeks ago he had actually been with Gertrude and that disgrace and imprisonment had seemed things that could never come near him and death had been a far away possibility and life had been full of bliss As I watched him a strong desire seized me to revisit the scenes of which he was thinking and I winged my way back to England and soon found myself in the drowsy respectable streets of Muddleton It was New Year s Eve and I saw missus O Reilly preparing presents for her grandchildren and talking as she tied them up of that dreadful Nihilist who had deceived them in the summer I saw Lena Houghton and mister Blackthorne and missus Milton Cleave kneeling in church on that Friday morning praying that pity might be shown upon all prisoners and captives and all that are desolate or oppressed It never occurred to them that they were responsible for the sufferings of one weary prisoner or that his death would be laid at their door I flew to Dulminster and saw missus Selldon kneeling in the cathedral at the late evening service and rigorously examining herself as to the shortcomings of the dying year She confessed many things in a vague untroubled way but had any one told her that she had cruelly wronged her neighbour and helped to bring an innocent man to shame and prison and death she would not have believed the accusation I sought out Mark Shrewsbury He was at his chambers in Pump Court working away with his type writer he had a fancy for working the old year out and the new year in and now he was in the full swing of that novel which had suggested itself to his mind when missus Selldon described the rich and mysterious foreigner who had settled down at Ivy Cottage Most happily he laboured on never dreaming that his careless words had doomed a fellow man to a painful and lingering death never dreaming that while his fingers flew to and fro over his dainty little keyboard describing the clever doings of the unscrupulous foreigner another man the victim of his idle gossip tapped dying messages on a dreary prison wall For the end had come Through the evening Sigismund rested wearily on his truckle bed He could not lie down because of his cough and since there were no extra pillows to prop him up he had to rest his head and shoulders against the wall There was a gas burner in the tiny cell and by its light he looked round the bare walls of his prison with a blank hopeless yet wistful gaze there was the stool there was the table there were the clothes he should never wear again there was the door through which his lifeless body would soon be carried He looked at everything lingeringly for he knew that this desolate prison was the last bit of the world he should ever see Presently the gas was turned out He sighed as he felt the darkness close in upon him for he knew that his eyes would never again see light knew that in this dark lonely cell he must lie and wait for death And he was young and wished to live and he was in love and longed most terribly for the presence of the woman he loved The awful desolateness of the cell was more than he could endure he tried to think of his past life he tried to live once again through those happy weeks with Gertrude but always he came back to the aching misery of the present the cold and the pain and the darkness and the terrible solitude His nerveless fingers felt their way to the wall and faintly rapped a summons Valerian he said I shall not live through the night Watch with me The faint raps sounded clearly in the stillness of the great building and Valerian dreaded lest the warders should hear them and deal out punishment for an offence which by day they were forced to wink at But he would not for the world have deserted his friend He drew his stool close to the wall wrapped himself round in all the clothes he could muster and shivering with cold kept watch through the long winter night I am near you he telegraphed I will watch with you till morning From time to time Sigismund rapped faint messages and Valerian replied with comfort and sympathy Once he thought to himself My friend is better there is more power in his hand And indeed he trembled fearing that the sharp emphatic raps must certainly attract notice and put an end to their communion Tell my love that the accusation was false false the word was vehemently repeated Tell her I died broken hearted loving her to the end I will tell her all when I am free said poor Valerian wondering with a sigh when his unjust imprisonment would end Do you suffer much he asked There was a brief interval Sigismund hesitated to tell a falsehood in his last extremity It will soon be over Do not be troubled for me he replied And after that there was a long long silence Poor fellow he died hard and I wished that those comfortable English people could have been dragged from their warm beds and brought into the cold dreary cell where their victim lay fighting for breath suffering cruelly both in mind and body Valerian listening in sad suspense heard one more faint word rapped by the dying man Farewell God be with you he replied unable to check the tears which rained down as he thought of the life so sadly ended and of his own bereavement He heard no more Sigismund s strength failed him and I to whom the darkness made no difference watched him through the last dread struggle there was no one to raise him or hold him no one to comfort him Alone in the cold and darkness of that first morning of the year eighteen eighty seven he died Valerian did not hear through the wall his last faint gasping cry but I heard it and its exceeding bitterness would have made mortals weep Gertrude he sobbed Gertrude And with that his head sank on his breast and the life which but for me might have been so happy and prosperous was ended Prompted by curiosity I instantly returned to Muddleton and sought out Gertrude Morley I stole into her room She lay asleep but her dreams were troubled and her face once so fresh and bright was worn with pain and anxiety Scarcely had I entered the room when to my amazement I saw the spirit of Sigismund Zaluski I saw him bend down and kiss the sleeping girl and for a moment her sad face lighted up with a radiant smile I looked again he was gone Then Gertrude threw up both her arms and with a bitter cry awoke from her dream Sigismund she cried Oh Sigismund Now I know that you are dead indeed For a long long time she lay in a sort of trance of misery It seemed as if the life had been almost crushed out of her and it was not until the bells began to ring for the six o clock service merrily pealing out their welcome of the new year morning that full consciousness returned to her again But as she clearly realised what had happened she broke into such a passion of tears as I had never before witnessed while still in the darkness the new year bells rang gaily and she knew that they heralded for her the beginning of a lonely life And so my work ended my part in this world was played out Nevertheless I still live and there will come a day when Sigismund and Gertrude shall be comforted and the slanderers punished For poor Valerian was right and there is an Avenger in whom even my progenitor believes and before whom he trembles There will come a time when those self satisfied ones whose hands are all the time steeped in blood shall be confronted with me and shall realise to the full all that their idle words have brought about For that day I wait and though afterwards I shall be finally destroyed in the general destruction of all that is unmitigatedly evil I promise myself a certain satisfaction and pleasure a feeling I doubtless inherit from my progenitor when I watch the shame and horror and remorse of missus O Reilly and the rest of the people to whom I owe my existence and rapid growth END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A SLANDER This file should be named twelve seventy three txt or twelve
