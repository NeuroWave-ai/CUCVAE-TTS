Hardy CHAPTER I The rambler who for old association or other reasons should trace the forsaken coach road running almost in a meridional line from Bristol to the south shore of England would find himself during the latter half of his journey in the vicinity of some extensive woodlands interspersed with apple orchards Here the trees timber or fruit bearing as the case may be make the wayside hedges ragged by their drip and shade stretching over the road with easeful horizontality as if they found the unsubstantial air an adequate support for their limbs At one place where a hill is crossed the largest of the woods shows itself bisected by the high way as the head of thick hair is bisected by the white line of its parting The spot is lonely The physiognomy of a deserted highway expresses solitude to a degree that is not reached by mere dales or downs and bespeaks a tomb like stillness more emphatic than that of glades and pools The contrast of what is with what might be probably accounts for this To step for instance at the place under notice from the hedge of the plantation into the adjoining pale thoroughfare and pause amid its emptiness for a moment was to exchange by the act of a single stride the simple absence of human companionship for an incubus of the forlorn At this spot on the lowering evening of a by gone winter s day there stood a man who had entered upon the scene much in the aforesaid manner Alighting into the road from a stile hard by he though by no means a chosen vessel for impressions was temporarily influenced by some such feeling of being suddenly more alone than before he had emerged upon the highway It could be seen by a glance at his rather finical style of dress that he did not belong to the country proper and from his air after a while that though there might be a sombre beauty in the scenery music in the breeze and a wan procession of coaching ghosts in the sentiment of this old turnpike road he was mainly puzzled about the way The dead men s work that had been expended in climbing that hill the blistered soles that had trodden it and the tears that had wetted it were not his concern for fate had given him no time for any but practical things He looked north and south and mechanically prodded the ground with his walking stick A closer glance at his face corroborated the testimony of his clothes It was self complacent yet there was small apparent ground for such complacence Nothing irradiated it to the eye of the magician in character if not to the ordinary observer the expression enthroned there was absolute submission to and belief in a little assortment of forms and habitudes At first not a soul appeared who could enlighten him as he desired or seemed likely to appear that night But presently a slight noise of laboring wheels and the steady dig of a horse s shoe tips became audible and there loomed in the notch of the hill and plantation that the road formed here at the summit a carrier s van drawn by a single horse When it got nearer he said with some relief to himself Tis missus Dollery s this will help me The vehicle was half full of passengers mostly women He held up his stick at its approach and the woman who was driving drew rein I ve been trying to find a short way to Little Hintock this last half hour missus Dollery he said But though I ve been to Great Hintock and Hintock House half a dozen times I am at fault about the small village You can help me I dare say She assured him that she could that as she went to Great Hintock her van passed near it that it was only up the lane that branched out of the lane into which she was about to turn just ahead Though continued missus Dollery tis such a little small place that as a town gentleman you d need have a candle and lantern to find it if ye don t know where tis Bedad I wouldn t live there if they d pay me to Now at Great Hintock you do see the world a bit He mounted and sat beside her with his feet outside where they were ever and anon brushed over by the horse s tail This van driven and owned by missus Dollery was rather a movable attachment of the roadway than an extraneous object to those who knew it well The old horse whose hair was of the roughness and color of heather whose leg joints shoulders and hoofs were distorted by harness and drudgery from colthood though if all had their rights he ought symmetrical in outline to have been picking the herbage of some Eastern plain instead of tugging here had trodden this road almost daily for twenty years Even his subjection was not made congruous throughout for the harness being too short his tail was not drawn through the crupper so that the breeching slipped awkwardly to one side He knew every subtle incline of the seven or eight miles of ground between Hintock and Sherton Abbas the market town to which he journeyed as accurately as any surveyor could have learned it by a Dumpy level The vehicle had a square black tilt which nodded with the motion of the wheels and at a point in it over the driver s head was a hook to which the reins were hitched at times when they formed a catenary curve from the horse s shoulders Somewhere about the axles was a loose chain whose only known purpose was to clink as it went missus Dollery having to hop up and down many times in the service of her passengers wore especially in windy weather short leggings under her gown for modesty s sake and instead of a bonnet a felt hat tied down with a handkerchief to guard against an earache to which she was frequently subject In the rear of the van was a glass window which she cleaned with her pocket handkerchief every market day before starting Looking at the van from the back the spectator could thus see through its interior a square piece of the same sky and landscape that he saw without but intruded on by the profiles of the seated passengers who as they rumbled onward their lips moving and heads nodding in animated private converse remained in happy unconsciousness that their mannerisms and facial peculiarities were sharply defined to the public eye This hour of coming home from market was the happy one if not the happiest of the week for them Snugly ensconced under the tilt they could forget the sorrows of the world without and survey life and recapitulate the incidents of the day with placid smiles The passengers in the back part formed a group to themselves and while the new comer spoke to the proprietress they indulged in a confidential chat about him as about other people which the noise of the van rendered inaudible to himself and missus Dollery sitting forward Tis Barber Percombe he that s got the waxen woman in his window at the top of Abbey Street said one What business can bring him from his shop out here at this time and not a journeyman hair cutter but a master barber that s left off his pole because tis not genteel They listened to his conversation but mister Percombe though he had nodded and spoken genially seemed indisposed to gratify the curiosity which he had aroused and the unrestrained flow of ideas which had animated the inside of the van before his arrival was checked thenceforward Thus they rode on till they turned into a half invisible little lane whence as it reached the verge of an eminence could be discerned in the dusk about half a mile to the right gardens and orchards sunk in a concave and as it were snipped out of the woodland From this self contained place rose in stealthy silence tall stems of smoke which the eye of imagination could trace downward to their root on quiet hearth stones festooned overhead with hams and flitches It was one of those sequestered spots outside the gates of the world where may usually be found more meditation than action and more passivity than meditation where reasoning proceeds on narrow premises and results in inferences wildly imaginative yet where from time to time no less than in other places dramas of a grandeur and unity truly Sophoclean are enacted in the real by virtue of the concentrated passions and closely knit interdependence of the lives therein This place was the Little Hintock of the master barber s search The coming night gradually obscured the smoke of the chimneys but the position of the sequestered little world could still be distinguished by a few faint lights winking more or less ineffectually through the leafless boughs and the undiscerned songsters they bore in the form of balls of feathers at roost among them Out of the lane followed by the van branched a yet smaller lane at the corner of which the barber alighted missus Dollery s van going on to the larger village whose superiority to the despised smaller one as an exemplar of the world s movements was not particularly apparent in its means of approach A very clever and learned young doctor who they say is in league with the devil lives in the place you be going to not because there s anybody for n to cure there but because tis the middle of his district The observation was flung at the barber by one of the women at parting as a last attempt to get at his errand that way But he made no reply and without further pause the pedestrian plunged towards the umbrageous nook and paced cautiously over the dead leaves which nearly buried the road or street of the hamlet As very few people except themselves passed this way after dark a majority of the denizens of Little Hintock deemed window curtains unnecessary and on this account mister Percombe made it his business to stop opposite the casements of each cottage that he came to with a demeanor which showed that he was endeavoring to conjecture from the persons and things he observed within the whereabouts of somebody or other who resided here Only the smaller dwellings interested him one or two houses whose size antiquity and rambling appurtenances signified that notwithstanding their remoteness they must formerly have been if they were not still inhabited by people of a certain social standing being neglected by him entirely Smells of pomace and the hiss of fermenting cider which reached him from the back quarters of other tenements revealed the recent occupation of some of the inhabitants and joined with the scent of decay from the perishing leaves underfoot Half a dozen dwellings were passed without result The next which stood opposite a tall tree was in an exceptional state of radiance the flickering brightness from the inside shining up the chimney and making a luminous mist of the emerging smoke The interior as seen through the window caused him to draw up with a terminative air and watch The house was rather large for a cottage and the door which opened immediately into the living room stood ajar so that a ribbon of light fell through the opening into the dark atmosphere without Every now and then a moth decrepit from the late season would flit for a moment across the out coming rays and disappear again into the night CHAPTER II In the room from which this cheerful blaze proceeded he beheld a girl seated on a willow chair and busily occupied by the light of the fire which was ample and of wood With a bill hook in one hand and a leather glove much too large for her on the other she was making spars such as are used by thatchers with great rapidity She wore a leather apron for this purpose which was also much too large for her figure On her left hand lay a bundle of the straight smooth sticks called spar gads the raw material of her manufacture on her right a heap of chips and ends the refuse with which the fire was maintained in front a pile of the finished articles To produce them she took up each gad looked critically at it from end to end cut it to length split it into four and sharpened each of the quarters with dexterous blows which brought it to a triangular point precisely resembling that of a bayonet Beside her in case she might require more light a brass candlestick stood on a little round table curiously formed of an old coffin stool with a deal top nailed on the white surface of the latter contrasting oddly with the black carved oak of the substructure The social position of the household in the past was almost as definitively shown by the presence of this article as that of an esquire or nobleman by his old helmets or shields It had been customary for every well to do villager whose tenure was by copy of court roll or in any way more permanent than that of the mere cotter to keep a pair of these stools for the use of his own dead but for the last generation or two a feeling of cui bono had led to the discontinuance of the custom and the stools were frequently made use of in the manner described The young woman laid down the bill hook for a moment and examined the palm of her right hand which unlike the other was ungloved and showed little hardness or roughness about it The palm was red and blistering as if this present occupation were not frequent enough with her to subdue it to what it worked in As with so many right hands born to manual labor there was nothing in its fundamental shape to bear out the physiological conventionalism that gradations of birth gentle or mean show themselves primarily in the form of this member Nothing but a cast of the die of destiny had decided that the girl should handle the tool and the fingers which clasped the heavy ash haft might have skilfully guided the pencil or swept the string had they only been set to do it in good time Her face had the usual fulness of expression which is developed by a life of solitude Where the eyes of a multitude beat like waves upon a countenance they seem to wear away its individuality but in the still water of privacy every tentacle of feeling and sentiment shoots out in visible luxuriance to be interpreted as readily as a child s look by an intruder In years she was no more than nineteen or twenty but the necessity of taking thought at a too early period of life had forced the provisional curves of her childhood s face to a premature finality Thus she had but little pretension to beauty save in one prominent particular her hair Its abundance made it almost unmanageable its color was roughly speaking and as seen here by firelight brown but careful notice or an observation by day would have revealed that its true shade was a rare and beautiful approximation to chestnut On this one bright gift of Time to the particular victim of his now before us the new comer s eyes were fixed meanwhile the fingers of his right hand mechanically played over something sticking up from his waistcoat pocket the bows of a pair of scissors whose polish made them feebly responsive to the light within In her present beholder s mind the scene formed by the girlish spar maker composed itself into a post Raffaelite picture of extremest quality wherein the girl s hair alone as the focus of observation was depicted with intensity and distinctness and her face shoulders hands and figure in general being a blurred mass of unimportant detail lost in haze and obscurity He hesitated no longer but tapped at the door and entered The young woman turned at the crunch of his boots on the sanded floor and exclaiming Oh mister Percombe how you frightened me quite lost her color for a moment He replied You should shut your door then you d hear folk open it I can t she said the chimney smokes so mister Percombe you look as unnatural out of your shop as a canary in a thorn hedge Surely you have not come out here on my account for Yes to have your answer about this He touched her head with his cane and she winced Do you agree he continued It is necessary that I should know at once as the lady is soon going away and it takes time to make up Don t press me it worries me I was in hopes you had thought no more of it I can NOT part with it so there Now look here Marty said the barber sitting down on the coffin stool table How much do you get for making these spars Hush father s up stairs awake and he don t know that I am doing his work Well now tell me said the man more softly How much do you get Eighteenpence a thousand she said reluctantly Who are you making them for mister Melbury the timber dealer just below here And how many can you make in a day In a day and half the night three bundles that s a thousand and a half Two and threepence The barber paused Well look here he continued with the remains of a calculation in his tone which calculation had been the reduction to figures of the probable monetary magnetism necessary to overpower the resistant force of her present purse and the woman s love of comeliness here s a sovereign a gold sovereign almost new He held it out between his finger and thumb That s as much as you d earn in a week and a half at that rough man s work and it s yours for just letting me snip off what you ve got too much of The girl s bosom moved a very little Why can t the lady send to some other girl who don t value her hair not to me she exclaimed Why simpleton because yours is the exact shade of her own and tis a shade you can t match by dyeing But you are not going to refuse me now I ve come all the way from Sherton o purpose I say I won t sell it to you or anybody Now listen and he drew up a little closer beside her The lady is very rich and won t be particular to a few shillings so I will advance to this on my own responsibility I ll make the one sovereign two rather than go back empty handed No no no she cried beginning to be much agitated You are a tempting me mister Percombe You go on like the Devil to doctor Faustus in the penny book But I don t want your money and won t agree Why did you come I said when you got me into your shop and urged me so much that I didn t mean to sell my hair The speaker was hot and stern Marty now hearken The lady that wants it wants it badly And between you and me you d better let her have it Twill be bad for you if you don t Bad for me Who is she then The barber held his tongue and the girl repeated the question I am not at liberty to tell you And as she is going abroad soon it makes no difference who she is at all She wants it to go abroad wi Percombe assented by a nod The girl regarded him reflectively Barber Percombe she said I know who tis Tis she at the House missus Charmond That s my secret However if you agree to let me have it I ll tell you in confidence I ll certainly not let you have it unless you tell me the truth It is missus Charmond The barber dropped his voice Well it is You sat in front of her in church the other day and she noticed how exactly your hair matched her own Ever since then she s been hankering for it and at last decided to get it As she won t wear it till she goes off abroad she knows nobody will recognize the change I m commissioned to get it for her and then it is to be made up I shouldn t have vamped all these miles for any less important employer Now mind tis as much as my business with her is worth if it should be known that I ve let out her name but honor between us two Marty and you ll say nothing that would injure me I don t wish to tell upon her said Marty coolly But my hair is my own and I m going to keep it Now that s not fair after what I ve told you said the nettled barber You see Marty as you are in the same parish and in one of her cottages and your father is ill and wouldn t like to turn out it would be as well to oblige her I say that as a friend But I won t press you to make up your mind to night You ll be coming to market to morrow I dare say and you can call then If you think it over you ll be inclined to bring what I want I know I ve nothing more to say she answered Her companion saw from her manner that it was useless to urge her further by speech As you are a trusty young woman he said I ll put these sovereigns up here for ornament that you may see how handsome they are Bring the hair to morrow or return the sovereigns He stuck them edgewise into the frame of a small mantle looking glass I hope you ll bring it for your sake and mine I should have thought she could have suited herself elsewhere but as it s her fancy it must be indulged if possible If you cut it off yourself mind how you do it so as to keep all the locks one way He showed her how this was to be done But I sha nt she replied with laconic indifference I value my looks too much to spoil em She wants my hair to get another lover with though if stories are true she s broke the heart of many a noble gentleman already Lord it s wonderful how you guess things Marty said the barber I ve had it from them that know that there certainly is some foreign gentleman in her eye However mind what I ask She s not going to get him through me Percombe had retired as far as the door he came back planted his cane on the coffin stool and looked her in the face Marty South he said with deliberate emphasis YOU VE GOT A LOVER YOURSELF and that s why you won t let it go She reddened so intensely as to pass the mild blush that suffices to heighten beauty she put the yellow leather glove on one hand took up the hook with the other and sat down doggedly to her work without turning her face to him again He regarded her head for a moment went to the door and with one look back at her departed on his way homeward Marty pursued her occupation for a few minutes then suddenly laying down the bill hook she jumped up and went to the back of the room where she opened a door which disclosed a staircase so whitely scrubbed that the grain of the wood was wellnigh sodden away by such cleansing At the top she gently approached a bedroom and without entering said Father do you want anything A weak voice inside answered in the negative adding I should be all right by to morrow if it were not for the tree The tree again always the tree Oh father don t worry so about that You know it can do you no harm Who have ye had talking to ye down stairs A Sherton man called nothing to trouble about she said soothingly Father she went on can missus Charmond turn us out of our house if she s minded to Turn us out No Nobody can turn us out till my poor soul is turned out of my body Tis life hold like Ambrose Winterborne s But when my life drops twill be hers not till then His words on this subject so far had been rational and firm enough But now he lapsed into his moaning strain And the tree will do it that tree will soon be the death of me Nonsense you know better How can it be She refrained from further speech and descended to the ground floor again Thank Heaven then she said to herself what belongs to me I keep CHAPTER III The lights in the village went out house after house till there only remained two in the darkness One of these came from a residence on the hill side of which there is nothing to say at present the other shone from the window of Marty South Precisely the same outward effect was produced here however by her rising when the clock struck ten and hanging up a thick cloth curtain The door it was necessary to keep ajar in hers as in most cottages because of the smoke but she obviated the effect of the ribbon of light through the chink by hanging a cloth over that also She was one of those people who if they have to work harder than their neighbors prefer to keep the necessity a secret as far as possible and but for the slight sounds of wood splintering which came from within no wayfarer would have perceived that here the cottager did not sleep as elsewhere Eleven twelve one o clock struck the heap of spars grew higher and the pile of chips and ends more bulky Even the light on the hill had now been extinguished but still she worked on When the temperature of the night without had fallen so low as to make her chilly she opened a large blue umbrella to ward off the draught from the door The two sovereigns confronted her from the looking glass in such a manner as to suggest a pair of jaundiced eyes on the watch for an opportunity Whenever she sighed for weariness she lifted her gaze towards them but withdrew it quickly stroking her tresses with her fingers for a moment as if to assure herself that they were still secure When the clock struck three she arose and tied up the spars she had last made in a bundle resembling those that lay against the wall She wrapped round her a long red woollen cravat and opened the door The night in all its fulness met her flatly on the threshold like the very brink of an absolute void or the antemundane Ginnung Gap believed in by her Teuton forefathers For her eyes were fresh from the blaze and here there was no street lamp or lantern to form a kindly transition between the inner glare and the outer dark A lingering wind brought to her ear the creaking sound of two over crowded branches in the neighboring wood which were rubbing each other into wounds and other vocalized sorrows of the trees together with the screech of owls and the fluttering tumble of some awkward wood pigeon ill balanced on its roosting bough But the pupils of her young eyes soon expanded and she could see well enough for her purpose Taking a bundle of spars under each arm and guided by the serrated line of tree tops against the sky she went some hundred yards or more down the lane till she reached a long open shed carpeted around with the dead leaves that lay about everywhere Night that strange personality which within walls brings ominous introspectiveness and self distrust but under the open sky banishes such subjective anxieties as too trivial for thought inspired Marty South with a less perturbed and brisker manner now She laid the spars on the ground within the shed and returned for more going to and fro till her whole manufactured stock were deposited here This erection was the wagon house of the chief man of business hereabout mister George Melbury the timber bark and copse ware merchant for whom Marty s father did work of this sort by the piece It formed one of the many rambling out houses which surrounded his dwelling an equally irregular block of building whose immense chimneys could just be discerned even now The four huge wagons under the shed were built on those ancient lines whose proportions have been ousted by modern patterns their shapes bulging and curving at the base and ends like Trafalgar line of battle ships with which venerable hulks indeed these vehicles evidenced a constructed spirit curiously in harmony One was laden with sheep cribs another with hurdles another with ash poles and the fourth at the foot of which she had placed her thatching spars was half full of similar bundles She was pausing a moment with that easeful sense of accomplishment which follows work done that has been a hard struggle in the doing when she heard a woman s voice on the other side of the hedge say anxiously George In a moment the name was repeated with Do come indoors What are you doing there The cart house adjoined the garden and before Marty had moved she saw enter the latter from the timber merchant s back door an elderly woman sheltering a candle with her hand the light from which cast a moving thorn pattern of shade on Marty s face Its rays soon fell upon a man whose clothes were roughly thrown on standing in advance of the speaker He was a thin slightly stooping figure with a small nervous mouth and a face cleanly shaven and he walked along the path with his eyes bent on the ground In the pair Marty South recognized her employer Melbury and his wife She was the second missus Melbury the first having died shortly after the birth of the timber merchant s only child Tis no use to stay in bed he said as soon as she came up to where he was pacing restlessly about I can t sleep I keep thinking of things and worrying about the girl till I m quite in a fever of anxiety He went on to say that he could not think why she Marty knew he was speaking of his daughter did not answer his letter She must be ill she must certainly he said No no Tis all right George said his wife and she assured him that such things always did appear so gloomy in the night time if people allowed their minds to run on them that when morning came it was seen that such fears were nothing but shadows Grace is as well as you or I she declared But he persisted that she did not see all that she did not see as much as he His daughter s not writing was only one part of his worry On account of her he was anxious concerning money affairs which he would never alarm his mind about otherwise The reason he gave was that as she had nobody to depend upon for a provision but himself he wished her when he was gone to be securely out of risk of poverty To this missus Melbury replied that Grace would be sure to marry well and that hence a hundred pounds more or less from him would not make much difference Her husband said that that was what she missus Melbury naturally thought but there she was wrong and in that lay the source of his trouble I have a plan in my head about her he said and according to my plan she won t marry a rich man A plan for her not to marry well said his wife surprised Well in one sense it is that replied Melbury It is a plan for her to marry a particular person and as he has not so much money as she might expect it might be called as you call it I may not be able to carry it out and even if I do it may not be a good thing for her I want her to marry Giles Winterborne His companion repeated the name Well it is all right she said presently He adores the very ground she walks on only he s close and won t show it much Marty South appeared startled and could not tear herself away Yes the timber merchant asserted he knew that well enough Winterborne had been interested in his daughter for years that was what had led him into the notion of their union And he knew that she used to have no objection to him But it was not any difficulty about that which embarrassed him It was that since he had educated her so well and so long and so far above the level of daughters thereabout it was wasting her to give her to a man of no higher standing than the young man in question That s what I have been thinking said missus Melbury Well then Lucy now you ve hit it answered the timber merchant with feeling There lies my trouble I vowed to let her marry him and to make her as valuable as I could to him by schooling her as many years and as thoroughly as possible I mean to keep my vow I made it because I did his father a terrible wrong and it was a weight on my conscience ever since that time till this scheme of making amends occurred to me through seeing that Giles liked her Wronged his father asked missus Melbury Yes grievously wronged him said her husband Well don t think of it to night she urged Come indoors No no the air cools my head I shall not stay long He was silent a while then he told her as nearly as Marty could gather that his first wife his daughter Grace s mother was first the sweetheart of Winterborne s father who loved her tenderly till he the speaker won her away from him by a trick because he wanted to marry her himself He sadly went on to say that the other man s happiness was ruined by it that though he married Winterborne s mother it was but a half hearted business with him Melbury added that he was afterwards very miserable at what he had done but that as time went on and the children grew up and seemed to be attached to each other he determined to do all he could to right the wrong by letting his daughter marry the lad not only that but to give her the best education he could afford so as to make the gift as valuable a one as it lay in his power to bestow I still mean to do it said Melbury Then do said she But all these things trouble me said he for I feel I am sacrificing her for my own sin and I think of her and often come down here and look at this Look at what asked his wife He took the candle from her hand held it to the ground and removed a tile which lay in the garden path Tis the track of her shoe that she made when she ran down here the day before she went away all those months ago I covered it up when she was gone and when I come here and look at it I ask myself again why should she be sacrificed to a poor man It is not altogether a sacrifice said the woman He is in love with her and he s honest and upright If she encourages him what can you wish for more I wish for nothing definite But there s a lot of things possible for her Why missus Charmond is wanting some refined young lady I hear to go abroad with her as companion or something of the kind She d jump at Grace That s all uncertain Better stick to what s sure True true said Melbury and I hope it will be for the best Yes let me get em married up as soon as I can so as to have it over and done with He continued looking at the imprint while he added Suppose she should be dying and never make a track on this path any more She ll write soon depend upon t Come tis wrong to stay here and brood so He admitted it but said he could not help it Whether she write or no I shall fetch her in a few days And thus speaking he covered the track and preceded his wife indoors Melbury perhaps was an unlucky man in having within him the sentiment which could indulge in this foolish fondness about the imprint of a daughter s footstep Nature does not carry on her government with a view to such feelings and when advancing years render the open hearts of those who possess them less dexterous than formerly in shutting against the blast they must suffer buffeting at will by rain and storm no less than Little Celandines But her own existence and not mister Melbury s was the centre of Marty s consciousness and it was in relation to this that the matter struck her as she slowly withdrew That then is the secret of it all she said And Giles Winterborne is not for me and the less I think of him the better She returned to her cottage The sovereigns were staring at her from the looking glass as she had left them With a preoccupied countenance and with tears in her eyes she got a pair of scissors and began mercilessly cutting off the long locks of her hair arranging and tying them with their points all one way as the barber had directed Upon the pale scrubbed deal of the coffin stool table they stretched like waving and ropy weeds over the washed gravel bed of a clear stream She would not turn again to the little looking glass out of humanity to herself knowing what a deflowered visage would look back at her and almost break her heart she dreaded it as much as did her own ancestral goddess Sif the reflection in the pool after the rape of her locks by Loke the malicious She steadily stuck to business wrapped the hair in a parcel and sealed it up after which she raked out the fire and went to bed having first set up an alarum made of a candle and piece of thread with a stone attached But such a reminder was unnecessary to night Having tossed till about five o clock Marty heard the sparrows walking down their long holes in the thatch above her sloping ceiling to their orifice at the eaves whereupon she also arose and descended to the ground floor again It was still dark but she began moving about the house in those automatic initiatory acts and touches which represent among housewives the installation of another day While thus engaged she heard the rumbling of mister Melbury s wagons and knew that there too the day s toil had begun An armful of gads thrown on the still hot embers caused them to blaze up cheerfully and bring her diminished head gear into sudden prominence as a shadow At this a step approached the door Are folk astir here yet inquired a voice she knew

none	none	mister Winterborne said Marty throwing on a tilt bonnet which completely hid the recent ravages of the scissors Come in The door was flung back and there stepped in upon the mat a man not particularly young for a lover nor particularly mature for a person of affairs There was reserve in his glance and restraint upon his mouth He carried a horn lantern which hung upon a swivel and wheeling as it dangled marked grotesque shapes upon the shadier part of the walls He said that he had looked in on his way down to tell her that they did not expect her father to make up his contract if he was not well mister Melbury would give him another week and they would go their journey with a short load that day They are done said Marty and lying in the cart house Done he repeated Your father has not been too ill to work after all then She made some evasive reply I ll show you where they be if you are going down she added They went out and walked together the pattern of the air holes in the top of the lantern being thrown upon the mist overhead where they appeared of giant size as if reaching the tent shaped sky They had no remarks to make to each other and they uttered none Hardly anything could be more isolated or more self contained than the lives of these two walking here in the lonely antelucan hour when gray shades material and mental are so very gray And yet looked at in a certain way their lonely courses formed no detached design at all but were part of the pattern in the great web of human doings then weaving in both hemispheres from the White Sea to Cape Horn The shed was reached and she pointed out the spars Winterborne regarded them silently then looked at her Now Marty I believe he said and shook his head What That you ve done the work yourself Don t you tell anybody will you mister Winterborne she pleaded by way of answer Because I am afraid mister Melbury may refuse my work if he knows it is mine But how could you learn to do it Tis a trade Trade said she I d be bound to learn it in two hours
3549_8890_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh no 
none	none	you wouldn t missus Marty Winterborne held down his lantern and examined the cleanly split hazels as they lay Marty he said with dry admiration your father with his forty years of practice never made a spar better than that They are too good for the thatching of houses they are good enough for the furniture But I won t tell Let me look at your hands your poor hands He had a kindly manner of a quietly severe tone and when she seemed reluctant to show her hands he took hold of one and examined it as if it were his own Her fingers were blistered They ll get harder in time she said For if father continues ill I shall have to go on wi it Now I ll help put em up in wagon Winterborne without speaking set down his lantern lifted her as she was about to stoop over the bundles placed her behind him and began throwing up the bundles himself Rather than you should do it I will he said But the men will be here directly Why Marty whatever has happened to your head Lord it has shrunk to nothing it looks an apple upon a gate post Her heart swelled and she could not speak At length she managed to groan looking on the ground I ve made myself ugly and hateful that s what I ve done No no he answered You ve only cut your hair I see now Then why must you needs say that about apples and gate posts Let me see No no She ran off into the gloom of the sluggish dawn He did not attempt to follow her When she reached her father s door she stood on the step and looked back mister Melbury s men had arrived and were loading up the spars and their lanterns appeared from the distance at which she stood to have wan circles round them like eyes weary with watching She observed them for a few seconds as they set about harnessing the horses and then went indoors CHAPTER IV There was now a distinct manifestation of morning in the air and presently the bleared white visage of a sunless winter day emerged like a dead born child The villagers everywhere had already bestirred themselves rising at this time of the year at the far less dreary hour of absolute darkness It had been above an hour earlier before a single bird had untucked his head that twenty lights were struck in as many bedrooms twenty pairs of shutters opened and twenty pairs of eyes stretched to the sky to forecast the weather for the day Owls that had been catching mice in the out houses rabbits that had been eating the wintergreens in the gardens and stoats that had been sucking the blood of the rabbits discerning that their human neighbors were on the move discreetly withdrew from publicity and were seen and heard no more that day The daylight revealed the whole of mister Melbury s homestead of which the wagon sheds had been an outlying erection It formed three sides of an open quadrangle and consisted of all sorts of buildings the largest and central one being the dwelling itself The fourth side of the quadrangle was the public road It was a dwelling house of respectable roomy almost dignified aspect which taken with the fact that there were the remains of other such buildings thereabout indicated that Little Hintock had at some time or other been of greater importance than now as its old name of Hintock saint Osmond also testified The house was of no marked antiquity yet of well advanced age older than a stale novelty but no canonized antique faded not hoary looking at you from the still distinct middle distance of the early Georgian time and awakening on that account the instincts of reminiscence more decidedly than the remoter and far grander memorials which have to speak from the misty reaches of mediaevalism The faces dress passions gratitudes and revenues of the great great grandfathers and grandmothers who had been the first to gaze from those rectangular windows and had stood under that key stoned doorway could be divined and measured by homely standards of to day It was a house in whose reverberations queer old personal tales were yet audible if properly listened for and not as with those of the castle and cloister silent beyond the possibility of echo The garden front remained much as it had always been and there was a porch and entrance that way But the principal house door opened on the square yard or quadrangle towards the road formerly a regular carriage entrance though the middle of the area was now made use of for stacking timber fagots bundles and other products of the wood It was divided from the lane by a lichen coated wall in which hung a pair of gates flanked by piers out of the perpendicular with a round white ball on the top of each The building on the left of the enclosure was a long backed erection now used for spar making sawing crib framing and copse ware manufacture in general Opposite were the wagon sheds where Marty had deposited her spars Here Winterborne had remained after the girl s abrupt departure to see that the wagon loads were properly made up Winterborne was connected with the Melbury family in various ways In addition to the sentimental relationship which arose from his father having been the first missus Melbury s lover Winterborne s aunt had married and emigrated with the brother of the timber merchant many years before an alliance that was sufficient to place Winterborne though the poorer on a footing of social intimacy with the Melburys As in most villages so secluded as this intermarriages were of Hapsburgian frequency among the inhabitants and there were hardly two houses in Little Hintock unrelated by some matrimonial tie or other For this reason a curious kind of partnership existed between Melbury and the younger man a partnership based upon an unwritten code by which each acted in the way he thought fair towards the other on a give and take principle Melbury with his timber and copse ware business found that the weight of his labor came in winter and spring Winterborne was in the apple and cider trade and his requirements in cartage and other work came in the autumn of each year Hence horses wagons and in some degree men were handed over to him when the apples began to fall he in return lending his assistance to Melbury in the busiest wood cutting season as now Before he had left the shed a boy came from the house to ask him to remain till mister Melbury had seen him Winterborne thereupon crossed over to the spar house where two or three men were already at work two of them being travelling spar makers from White hart Lane who when this kind of work began made their appearance regularly and when it was over disappeared in silence till the season came again Firewood was the one thing abundant in Little Hintock and a blaze of gad cuds made the outhouse gay with its light which vied with that of the day as yet In the hollow shades of the roof could be seen dangling etiolated arms of ivy which had crept through the joints of the tiles and were groping in vain for some support their leaves being dwarfed and sickly for want of sunlight others were pushing in with such force at the eaves as to lift from their supports the shelves that were fixed there Besides the itinerant journey workers there were also present John Upjohn engaged in the hollow turnery trade who lived hard by old Timothy Tangs and young Timothy Tangs top and bottom sawyers at work in mister Melbury s pit outside Farmer Bawtree who kept the cider house and Robert Creedle an old man who worked for Winterborne and stood warming his hands these latter being enticed in by the ruddy blaze though they had no particular business there None of them call for any remark except perhaps Creedle To have completely described him it would have been necessary to write a military memoir for he wore under his smock frock a cast off soldier s jacket that had seen hot service its collar showing just above the flap of the frock also a hunting memoir to include the top boots that he had picked up by chance also chronicles of voyaging and shipwreck for his pocket knife had been given him by a weather beaten sailor But Creedle carried about with him on his uneventful rounds these silent testimonies of war sport and adventure and thought nothing of their associations or their stories Copse work as it was called being an occupation which the secondary intelligence of the hands and arms could carry on without requiring the sovereign attention of the head the minds of its professors wandered considerably from the objects before them hence the tales chronicles and ramifications of family history which were recounted here were of a very exhaustive kind and sometimes so interminable as to defy description Winterborne seeing that Melbury had not arrived stepped back again outside the door and the conversation interrupted by his momentary presence flowed anew reaching his ears as an accompaniment to the regular dripping of the fog from the plantation boughs around The topic at present handled was a highly popular and frequent one the personal character of missus Charmond the owner of the surrounding woods and groves My brother in law told me and I have no reason to doubt it said Creedle that she d sit down to her dinner with a frock hardly higher than her elbows Oh you wicked woman he said to himself when he first see her you go to your church and sit and kneel as if your knee jints were greased with very saint s anointment and tell off your Hear us good Lords like a business man counting money and yet you can eat your victuals such a figure as that Whether she s a reformed character by this time I can t say but I don t care who the man is that s how she went on when my brother in law lived there Did she do it in her husband s time That I don t know hardly I should think considering his temper Ah Here Creedle threw grieved remembrance into physical form by slowly resigning his head to obliquity and letting his eyes water That man Not if the angels of heaven come down Creedle he said shall you do another day s work for me Yes he d say anything anything and would as soon take a winged creature s name in vain as yours or mine Well now I must get these spars home along and to morrow thank God I must see about using em An old woman now entered upon the scene She was mister Melbury s servant and passed a great part of her time in crossing the yard between the house door and the spar shed whither she had come now for fuel She had two facial aspects one of a soft and flexible kind she used indoors when assisting about the parlor or upstairs the other with stiff lines and corners when she was bustling among the men in the spar house or out of doors Ah Grammer Oliver said John Upjohn it do do my heart good to see a old woman like you so dapper and stirring when I bear in mind that after fifty one year counts as two did afore But your smoke didn t rise this morning till twenty minutes past seven by my beater and that s late Grammer Oliver If you was a full sized man John people might take notice of your scornful meanings But your growing up was such a scrimped and scanty business that really a woman couldn t feel hurt if you were to spit fire and brimstone itself at her Here she added holding out a spar gad to one of the workmen from which dangled a long black pudding here s something for thy breakfast and if you want tea you must fetch it from in doors mister Melbury is late this morning said the bottom sawyer Yes Twas a dark dawn said missus Oliver Even when I opened the door so late as I was you couldn t have told poor men from gentlemen or John from a reasonable sized object And I don t think maister s slept at all well to night He s anxious about his daughter and I know what that is for I ve cried bucketfuls for my own When the old woman had gone Creedle said He ll fret his gizzard green if he don t soon hear from that maid of his Well learning is better than houses and lands But to keep a maid at school till she is taller out of pattens than her mother was in em tis tempting Providence It seems no time ago that she was a little playward girl said young Timothy Tangs I can mind her mother said the hollow turner Always a teuny delicate piece her touch upon your hand was as soft and cool as wind She was inoculated for the small pox and had it beautifully fine just about the time that I was out of my apprenticeship ay and a long apprenticeship twas I served that master of mine six years and three hundred and fourteen days The hollow turner pronounced the days with emphasis as if considering their number they were a rather more remarkable fact than the years mister Winterborne s father walked with her at one time said old Timothy Tangs But mister Melbury won her She was a child of a woman and would cry like rain if so be he huffed her Whenever she and her husband came to a puddle in their walks together he d take her up like a half penny doll and put her over without dirting her a speck And if he keeps the daughter so long at boarding school he ll make her as nesh as her mother was But here he comes Just before this moment Winterborne had seen Melbury crossing the court from his door He was carrying an open letter in his hand and came straight to Winterborne His gloom of the preceding night had quite gone I d no sooner made up my mind Giles to go and see why Grace didn t come or write than I get a letter from her Clifton Wednesday My dear father says she I m coming home to morrow that s to day but I didn t think it worth while to write long beforehand The little rascal and didn t she Now Giles as you are going to Sherton market to day with your apple trees why not join me and Grace there and we ll drive home all together He made the proposal with cheerful energy he was hardly the same man as the man of the small dark hours Ever it happens that even among the moodiest the tendency to be cheered is stronger than the tendency to be cast down and a soul s specific gravity stands permanently less than that of the sea of troubles into which it is thrown Winterborne though not demonstrative replied to this suggestion with something like alacrity There was not much doubt that Marty s grounds for cutting off her hair were substantial enough if Ambrose s eyes had been a reason for keeping it on As for the timber merchant it was plain that his invitation had been given solely in pursuance of his scheme for uniting the pair He had made up his mind to the course as a duty and was strenuously bent upon following it out Accompanied by Winterborne he now turned towards the door of the spar house when his footsteps were heard by the men as aforesaid Well John and Lot he said nodding as he entered A rimy morning Tis sir said Creedle energetically for not having as yet been able to summon force sufficient to go away and begin work he felt the necessity of throwing some into his speech I don t care who the man is tis the rimiest morning we ve had this fall I heard you wondering why I ve kept my daughter so long at boarding school resumed mister Melbury looking up from the letter which he was reading anew by the fire and turning to them with the suddenness that was a trait in him Hey he asked with affected shrewdness But you did you know Well now though it is my own business more than anybody else s I ll tell ye When I was a boy another boy the pa son s son along with a lot of others asked me Who dragged Whom round the walls of What and I said Sam Barrett who dragged his wife in a chair round the tower corner when she went to be churched They laughed at me with such torrents of scorn that I went home ashamed and couldn t sleep for shame and I cried that night till my pillow was wet till at last I thought to myself there and then They may laugh at me for my ignorance but that was father s fault and none o my making and I must bear it But they shall never laugh at my children if I have any I ll starve first Thank God I ve been able to keep her at school without sacrifice and her scholarship is such that she stayed on as governess for a time Let em laugh now if they can missus Charmond herself is not better informed than my girl Grace There was something between high indifference and humble emotion in his delivery which made it difficult for them to reply Winterborne s interest was of a kind which did not show itself in words listening he stood by the fire mechanically stirring the embers with a spar gad You ll be then ready Giles Melbury continued awaking from a reverie Well what was the latest news at Shottsford yesterday mister Bawtree Well Shottsford is Shottsford still you can t victual your carcass there unless you ve got money and you can t buy a cup of genuine there whether or no But as the saying is Go abroad and you ll hear news of home It seems that our new neighbor this young doctor What s his name is a strange deep perusing gentleman and there s good reason for supposing he has sold his soul to the wicked one Od name it all murmured the timber merchant unimpressed by the news but reminded of other things by the subject of it I ve got to meet a gentleman this very morning and yet I ve planned to go to Sherton Abbas for the maid I won t praise the doctor s wisdom till I hear what sort of bargain he s made said the top sawyer Tis only an old woman s tale said Bawtree But it seems that he wanted certain books on some mysterious science or black art and in order that the people hereabout should not know anything about his dark readings he ordered em direct from London and not from the Sherton book seller The parcel was delivered by mistake at the pa son s and he wasn t at home so his wife opened it and went into hysterics when she read em thinking her husband had turned heathen and twould be the ruin of the children But when he came he said he knew no more about em than she and found they were this mister Fitzpier s property So he wrote Beware outside and sent em on by the sexton He must be a curious young man mused the hollow turner He must said Timothy Tangs Nonsense said mister Melbury authoritatively he s only a gentleman fond of science and philosophy and poetry and in fact every kind of knowledge and being lonely here he passes his time in making such matters his hobby Well said old Timothy tis a strange thing about doctors that the worse they be the better they be I mean that if you hear anything of this sort about em ten to one they can cure ye as nobody else can True said Bawtree emphatically And for my part I shall take my custom from old Jones and go to this one directly I ve anything the matter with me That last medicine old Jones gave me had no taste in it at all mister Melbury as became a well informed man did not listen to these recitals being moreover preoccupied with the business appointment which had come into his head He walked up and down looking on the floor his usual custom when undecided That stiffness about the arm hip and knee joint which was apparent when he walked was the net product of the divers sprains and over exertions that had been required of him in handling trees and timber when a young man for he was of the sort called self made and had worked hard He knew the origin of every one of these cramps that in his left shoulder had come of carrying a pollard unassisted from Tutcombe Bottom home that in one leg was caused by the crash of an elm against it when they were felling that in the other was from lifting a bole On many a morrow after wearying himself by these prodigious muscular efforts he had risen from his bed fresh as usual his lassitude had departed apparently forever and confident in the recuperative power of his youth he had repeated the strains anew But treacherous Time had been only hiding ill results when they could be guarded against for greater accumulation when they could not In his declining years the store had been unfolded in the form of rheumatisms pricks and spasms in every one of which Melbury recognized some act which had its consequence been contemporaneously made known he would wisely have abstained from repeating On a summons by Grammer Oliver to breakfast he left the shed Reaching the kitchen where the family breakfasted in winter to save house labor he sat down by the fire and looked a long time at the pair of dancing shadows cast by each fire iron and dog knob on the whitewashed chimney corner a yellow one from the window and a blue one from the fire I don t quite know what to do to day he said to his wife at last I ve recollected that I promised to meet missus Charmond s steward in Round Wood at twelve o clock and yet I want to go for Grace Why not let Giles fetch her by himself Twill bring em together all the quicker I could do that but I should like to go myself I always have gone without fail every time hitherto It has been a great pleasure to drive into Sherton and wait and see her arrive and perhaps she ll be disappointed if I stay away Yon may be disappointed but I don t think she will if you send Giles said missus Melbury dryly Very well I ll send him Melbury was often persuaded by the quietude of his wife s words when strenuous argument would have had no effect This second missus Melbury was a placid woman who had been nurse to his child Grace before her mother s death After that melancholy event little Grace had clung to the nurse with much affection and ultimately Melbury in dread lest the only woman who cared for the girl should be induced to leave her persuaded the mild Lucy to marry him The arrangement for it was little more had worked satisfactorily enough Grace had thriven and Melbury had not repented He returned to the spar house and found Giles near at hand to whom he explained the change of plan As she won t arrive till five o clock you can get your business very well over in time to receive her said Melbury The green gig will do for her you ll spin along quicker with that and won t be late upon the road Her boxes can be called for by one of the wagons Winterborne knowing nothing of the timber merchant s restitutory aims quietly thought all this to be a kindly chance Wishing even more than her father to despatch his apple tree business in the market before Grace s arrival he prepared to start at once Melbury was careful that the turnout should be seemly The gig wheels for instance were not always washed during winter time before a journey the muddy roads rendering that labor useless but they were washed to day The harness was blacked and when the rather elderly white horse had been put in and Winterborne was in his seat ready to start mister Melbury stepped out with a blacking brush and with his own hands touched over the yellow hoofs of the animal You see Giles he said as he blacked coming from a fashionable school she might feel shocked at the homeliness of home and tis these little things that catch a dainty woman s eye if they are neglected We living here alone don t notice how the whitey brown creeps out of the earth over us but she fresh from a city why she ll notice everything That she will said Giles And scorn us if we don t mind Not scorn us No no no that s only words She s too good a girl to do that But when we consider what she knows and what she has seen since she last saw us tis as well to meet her views as nearly as possible Why tis a year since she was in this old place owing to her going abroad in the summer which I agreed to thinking it best for her and naturally we shall look small just at first I only say just at first mister Melbury s tone evinced a certain exultation in the very sense of that inferiority he affected to deplore for this advanced and refined being was she not his own all the time Not so Giles he felt doubtful perhaps a trifle cynical for that strand was wound into him with the rest He looked at his clothes with misgiving then with indifference It was his custom during the planting season to carry a specimen apple tree to market with him as an advertisement of what he dealt in This had been tied across the gig and as it would be left behind in the town it would cause no inconvenience to Miss Grace Melbury coming home He drove away the twigs nodding with each step of the horse and Melbury went in doors Before the gig had passed out of sight mister Melbury reappeared and shouted after Here Giles he said breathlessly following with some wraps it may be very chilly to night and she may want something extra about her And Giles he added when the young man having taken the articles put the horse in motion once more tell her that I should have come myself but I had particular business with missus Charmond s agent which prevented me Don t forget He watched Winterborne out of sight saying with a jerk a shape into which emotion with him often resolved itself There now I hope the two will bring it to a point and have done with it Tis a pity to let such a girl throw herself away upon him a thousand pities And yet tis my duty for his father s sake CHAPTER V Winterborne sped on his way to Sherton Abbas without elation and without discomposure Had he regarded his inner self spectacularly as lovers are now daily more wont to do he might have felt pride in the discernment of a somewhat rare power in him that of keeping not only judgment but emotion suspended in difficult cases But he noted it not Neither did he observe what was also the fact that though he cherished a true and warm feeling towards Grace Melbury he was not altogether her fool just now It must be remembered that he had not seen her for a year Arrived at the entrance to a long flat lane which had taken the spirit out of many a pedestrian in times when with the majority to travel meant to walk he saw before him the trim figure of a young woman in pattens journeying with that steadfast concentration which means purpose and not pleasure He was soon near enough to see that she was Marty South Click click click went the pattens and she did not turn her head She had however become aware before this that the driver of the approaching gig was Giles She had shrunk from being overtaken by him thus but as it was inevitable she had braced herself up for his inspection by closing her lips so as to make her mouth quite unemotional and by throwing an additional firmness into her tread Why do you wear pattens Marty The turnpike is clean enough although the lanes are muddy They save my boots But twelve miles in pattens twill twist your feet off Come get up and ride with me She hesitated removed her pattens knocked the gravel out of them against the wheel and mounted in front of the nodding specimen apple tree She had so arranged her bonnet with a full border and trimmings that her lack of long hair did not much injure her appearance though Giles of course saw that it was gone and may have guessed her motive in parting with it such sales though infrequent being not unheard of in that locality But nature s adornment was still hard by in fact within two feet of him though he did not know it In Marty s basket was a brown paper packet and in the packet the chestnut locks which by reason of the barber s request for secrecy she had not ventured to intrust to other hands Giles asked with some hesitation how her father was getting on He was better she said he would be able to work in a day or two he would be quite well but for his craze about the tree falling on him You know why I don t ask for him so often as I might I suppose said Winterborne Or don t you know I think I do Because of the houses She nodded Yes I am afraid it may seem that my anxiety is about those houses which I should lose by his death more than about him Marty I do feel anxious about the houses since half my income depends upon them but I do likewise care for him and it almost seems wrong that houses should be leased for lives so as to lead to such mixed feelings After father s death they will be missus Charmond s They ll be hers They are going to keep company with my hair she thought Thus talking they reached the town By no pressure would she ride up the street with him That s the right of another woman she said with playful malice as she put on her pattens I wonder what you are thinking of Thank you for the lift in that handsome gig Good by He blushed a little shook his head at her and drove on ahead into the streets the churches the abbey and other buildings on this clear bright morning having the liny distinctness of architectural drawings as if the original dream and vision of the conceiving master mason some mediaeval Vilars or other unknown to fame were for a few minutes flashed down through the centuries to an unappreciative age Giles saw their eloquent look on this day of transparency but could not construe it He turned into the inn yard Marty following the same track marched promptly to the hair dresser s mister Percombe s Percombe was the chief of his trade in Sherton Abbas He had the patronage of such county offshoots as had been obliged to seek the shelter of small houses in that ancient town of the local clergy and so on for some of whom he had made wigs while others among them had compensated for neglecting him in their lifetime by patronizing him when they were dead and letting him shave their corpses On the strength of all this he had taken down his pole and called himself Perruquier to the aristocracy Nevertheless this sort of support did not quite fill his children s mouths and they had to be filled So behind his house there was a little yard reached by a passage from the back street and in that yard was a pole and under the pole a shop of quite another description than the ornamental one in the front street Here on Saturday nights from seven till ten he took an almost innumerable succession of twopences from the farm laborers who flocked thither in crowds from the country And thus he lived Marty of course went to the front shop and handed her packet to him silently Thank you said the barber quite joyfully I hardly expected it after what you said last night She turned aside while a tear welled up and stood in each eye at this reminder Nothing of what I told you he whispered there being others in the shop But I can trust you I see She had now reached the end of this distressing business and went listlessly along the street to attend to other errands These occupied her till four o clock at which time she recrossed the market place It was impossible to avoid rediscovering Winterborne every time she passed that way for standing as he always did at this season of the year with his specimen apple tree in the midst the boughs rose above the heads of the crowd and brought a delightful suggestion of orchards among the crowded buildings there When her eye fell upon him for the last time he was standing somewhat apart holding the tree like an ensign and looking on the ground instead of pushing his produce as he ought to have been doing He was in fact not a very successful seller either of his trees or of his cider his habit of speaking his mind when he spoke at all militating against this branch of his business While she regarded him he suddenly lifted his eyes in a direction away from Marty his face simultaneously kindling with recognition and surprise She followed his gaze and saw walking across to him a flexible young creature in whom she perceived the features of her she had known as Miss Grace Melbury but now looking glorified and refined above her former level Winterborne being fixed to the spot by his apple tree could not advance to meet her he held out his spare hand with his hat in it and with some embarrassment beheld her coming on tiptoe through the mud to the middle of the square where he stood Miss Melbury s arrival so early was as Marty could see unexpected by Giles which accounted for his not being ready to receive her Indeed her father had named five o clock as her probable time for which reason that hour had been looming out all the day in his forward perspective like an important edifice on a plain Now here she was come he knew not how and his arranged welcome stultified His face became gloomy at her necessity for stepping into the road and more still at the little look of embarrassment which appeared on hers at having to perform the meeting with him under an apple tree ten feet high in the middle of the market place Having had occasion to take off the new gloves she had bought to come home in she held out to him a hand graduating from pink at the tips of the fingers to white at the palm and the reception formed a scene with the tree over their heads which was not by any means an ordinary one in Sherton Abbas streets Nevertheless the greeting on her looks and lips was of a restrained type which perhaps was not unnatural For true it was that Giles Winterborne well attired and well mannered as he was for a yeoman looked rough beside her It had sometimes dimly occurred to him in his ruminating silence at Little Hintock that external phenomena such as the lowness or height or color of a hat the fold of a coat the make of a boot or the chance attitude or occupation of a limb at the instant of view may have a great influence upon feminine opinion of a man s worth so frequently founded on non essentials but a certain causticity of mental tone towards himself and the world in general had prevented to day as always any enthusiastic action on the strength of that reflection and her momentary instinct of reserve at first sight of him was the penalty he paid for his laxness He gave away the tree to a by stander as soon as he could find one who would accept the cumbersome gift and the twain moved on towards the inn at which he had put up Marty made as if to step forward for the pleasure of being recognized by Miss Melbury but abruptly checking herself she glided behind a carrier s van saying dryly No I baint wanted there and critically regarded Winterborne s companion It would have been very difficult to describe Grace Melbury with precision either now or at any time Nay from the highest point of view to precisely describe a human being the focus of a universe how impossible But apart from transcendentalism there never probably lived a person who was in herself more completely a reductio ad absurdum of attempts to appraise a woman even externally by items of face and figure Speaking generally it may be said that she was sometimes beautiful at other times not beautiful according to the state of her health and spirits In simple corporeal presentment she was of a fair and clear complexion rather pale than pink slim in build and elastic in movement Her look expressed a tendency to wait for others thoughts before uttering her own possibly also to wait for others deeds before her own doing In her small delicate mouth which had perhaps hardly settled down to its matured curves there was a gentleness that might hinder sufficient self assertion for her own good She had well formed eyebrows which had her portrait been painted would probably have been done in Prout s or Vandyke brown There was nothing remarkable in her dress just now beyond a natural fitness and a style that was recent for the streets of Sherton But indeed had it been the reverse and quite striking it would have meant just as little For there can be hardly anything less connected with a woman s personality than drapery which she has neither designed manufactured cut sewed or even seen except by a glance of approval when told that such and such a shape and color must be had because it has been decided by others as imperative at that particular time What people therefore saw of her in a cursory view was very little in truth mainly something that was not she The woman herself was a shadowy conjectural creature who had little to do with the outlines presented to Sherton eyes a shape in the gloom whose true description could only be approximated by putting together a movement now and a glance then in that patient and long continued attentiveness which nothing but watchful loving kindness ever troubles to give There was a little delay in their setting out from the town and Marty South took advantage of it to hasten forward with the view of escaping them on the way lest they should feel compelled to spoil their tete a tete by asking her to ride She walked fast and one third of the journey was done and the evening rapidly darkening before she perceived any sign of them behind her Then while ascending a hill she dimly saw their vehicle drawing near the lowest part of the incline their heads slightly bent towards each other drawn together no doubt by their souls as the heads of a pair of horses well in hand are drawn in by the rein She walked still faster But between these and herself there was a carriage apparently a brougham coming in the same direction with lighted lamps When it overtook her which was not soon on account of her pace the scene was much darker and the lights glared in her eyes sufficiently to hide the details of the equipage It occurred to Marty that she might take hold behind this carriage and so keep along with it to save herself the mortification of being overtaken and picked up for pity s sake by the coming pair Accordingly as the carriage drew abreast of her in climbing the long ascent she walked close to the wheels the rays of the nearest lamp penetrating her very pores She had only just dropped behind when the carriage stopped and to her surprise the coachman asked her over his shoulder if she would ride What made the question more surprising was that it came in obedience to an order from the interior of the vehicle Marty gladly assented for she was weary very weary after working all night and keeping afoot all day She mounted beside the coachman wondering why this good fortune had happened to her He was rather a great man in aspect and she did not like to inquire of him for some time At last she said Who has been so kind as to ask me to ride missus Charmond replied her statuesque companion Marty was stirred at the name so closely connected with her last night s experiences Is this her carriage she whispered Yes she s inside Marty reflected and perceived that missus Charmond must have recognized her plodding up the hill under the blaze of the lamp recognized probably her stubbly poll since she had kept away her face and thought that those stubbles were the result of her own desire Marty South was not so very far wrong Inside the carriage a pair of bright eyes looked from a ripely handsome face and though behind those bright eyes was a mind of unfathomed mysteries beneath them there beat a heart capable of quick extempore warmth a heart which could indeed be passionately and imprudently warm on certain occasions At present after recognizing the girl she had acted on a mere impulse possibly feeling gratified at the denuded appearance which signified the success of her agent in obtaining what she had required Tis wonderful that she should ask ye observed the magisterial coachman presently I have never known her do it before for as a rule she takes no interest in the village folk at all Marty said no more but occasionally turned her head to see if she could get a glimpse of the Olympian creature who as the coachman had truly observed hardly ever descended from her clouds into the Tempe of the parishioners But she could discern nothing of the lady She also looked for Miss Melbury and Winterborne The nose of their horse sometimes came quite near the back of missus Charmond s carriage But they never attempted to pass it till the latter conveyance turned towards the park gate when they sped by Here the carriage drew up that the gate might be opened and in the momentary silence Marty heard a gentle oral sound soft as a breeze What s that she whispered Mis ess yawning Why should she yawn Oh because she s been used to such wonderfully good life and finds it dull here She ll soon be off again on account of it So rich and so powerful and yet to yawn the girl murmured Then things don t fay with she any more than with we Marty now alighted the lamp again shone upon her and as the carriage rolled on a soft voice said to her from the interior Good night Good night ma am said Marty But she had not been able to see the woman who began so greatly to interest her the second person of her own sex who had operated strongly on her mind that day CHAPTER VI Meanwhile Winterborne and Grace Melbury had also undergone their little experiences of the same homeward journey As he drove off with her out of the town the glances of people fell upon them the younger thinking that mister Winterborne was in a pleasant place and wondering in what relation he stood towards her Winterborne himself was unconscious of this Occupied solely with the idea of having her in charge he did not notice much with outward eye neither observing how she was dressed nor the effect of the picture they together composed in the landscape Their conversation was in briefest phrase for some time Grace being somewhat disconcerted through not having understood till they were about to start that Giles was to be her sole conductor in place of her father When they were in the open country he spoke Don t Brownley s farm buildings look strange to you now they have been moved bodily from the hollow where the old ones stood to the top of the hill She admitted that they did though she should not have seen any difference in them if he had not pointed it out They had a good crop of bitter sweets they couldn t grind them all nodding towards an orchard where some heaps of apples had been left lying ever since the ingathering She said Yes but looking at another orchard Why you are looking at John apple trees You know bitter sweets you used to well enough I am afraid I have forgotten and it is getting too dark to distinguish Winterborne did not continue It seemed as if the knowledge and interest which had formerly moved Grace s mind had quite died away from her He wondered whether the special attributes of his image in the past had evaporated like these other things However that might be the fact at present was merely this that where he was seeing John apples and farm buildings she was beholding a far remoter scene a scene no less innocent and simple indeed but much contrasting a broad lawn in the fashionable suburb of a fast city the evergreen leaves shining in the evening sun amid which bounding girls gracefully clad in artistic arrangements of blue brown red black and white were playing at games with laughter and chat in all the pride of life the notes of piano and harp trembling in the air from the open windows adjoining Moreover they were girls and this was a fact which Grace Melbury s delicate femininity could not lose sight of whose parents Giles would have addressed with a deferential Sir or Madam Beside this visioned scene the homely farmsteads did not quite hold their own from her present twenty year point of survey For all his woodland sequestration Giles knew the primitive simplicity of the subject he had started and now sounded a deeper note Twas very odd what we said to each other years ago I often think of it I mean our saying that if we still liked each other when you were twenty and I twenty five we d It was child s tattle H m said Giles suddenly I mean we were young said she more considerately That gruff manner of his in making inquiries reminded her that he was unaltered in much Yes I beg your pardon Miss Melbury your father SENT me to meet you to day I know it and I am glad of it He seemed satisfied with her tone and went on At that time you were sitting beside me at the back of your father s covered car when we were coming home from gypsying all the party being squeezed in together as tight as sheep in an auction pen It got darker and darker and I said I forget the exact words but I put my arm round your waist and there you let it stay till your father sitting in front suddenly stopped telling his story to Farmer Bollen to light his pipe The flash shone into the car and showed us all up distinctly my arm flew from your waist like lightning yet not so quickly but that some of em had seen and laughed at us Yet your father to our amazement instead of being angry was mild as milk and seemed quite pleased Have you forgot all that or haven t you She owned that she remembered it very well now that he mentioned the circumstances But goodness I must have been in short frocks she said Come now Miss Melbury that won t do Short frocks indeed You know better as well as I Grace thereupon declared that she would not argue with an old friend she valued so highly as she valued him saying the words with the easy elusiveness that will be polite at all costs It might possibly be true she added that she was getting on in girlhood when that event took place but if it were so then she was virtually no less than an old woman now so far did the time seem removed from her present Do you ever look at things philosophically instead of personally she asked I can t say that I do answered Giles his eyes lingering far ahead upon a dark spot which proved to be a brougham I think you may sometimes with advantage said she Look at yourself as a pitcher drifting on the stream with other pitchers and consider what contrivances are most desirable for avoiding cracks in general and not only for saving your poor one Shall I tell you all about Bath or Cheltenham or places on the Continent that I visited last summer With all my heart She then described places and persons in such terms as might have been used for that purpose by any woman to any man within the four seas so entirely absent from that description was everything specially appertaining to her own existence When she had done she said gayly Now do you tell me in return what has happened in Hintock since I have been away Anything to keep the conversation away from her and me said Giles within him It was true cultivation had so far advanced in the soil of Miss Melbury s mind as to lead her to talk by rote of anything save of that she knew well and had the greatest interest in developing that is to say herself He had not proceeded far with his somewhat bald narration when they drew near the carriage that had been preceding them for some time Miss Melbury inquired if he knew whose carriage it was Winterborne although he had seen it had not taken it into account On examination he said it was missus Charmond s Grace watched the vehicle and its easy roll and seemed to feel more nearly akin to it than to the one she was in Pooh We can polish off the mileage as well as they come to that said Winterborne reading her mind and rising to emulation at what it bespoke he whipped on the horse This it was which had brought the nose of mister Melbury s old gray close to the back of missus Charmond s much eclipsing vehicle There s Marty South Sitting up with the coachman said he discerning her by her dress Ah poor Marty I must ask her to come to see me this very evening How does she happen to be riding there I don t know It is very singular Thus these people with converging destinies went along the road together till Winterborne leaving the track of the carriage turned into Little Hintock where almost the first house was the timber merchant s Pencils of dancing light streamed out of the windows sufficiently to show the white laurestinus flowers and glance over the polished leaves of laurel The interior of the rooms could be seen distinctly warmed up by the fire flames which in the parlor were reflected from the glass of the pictures and bookcase and in the kitchen from the utensils and ware Let us look at the dear place for a moment before we call them she said In the kitchen dinner was preparing for though Melbury dined at one o clock at other times to day the meal had been kept back for Grace A rickety old spit was in motion its end being fixed in the fire dog and the whole kept going by means of a cord conveyed over pulleys along the ceiling to a large stone suspended in a corner of the room Old Grammer Oliver came and wound it up with a rattle like that of a mill In the parlor a large shade of missus Melbury s head fell on the wall and ceiling but before the girl had regarded this room many moments their presence was discovered and her father and stepmother came out to welcome her The character of the Melbury family was of that kind which evinces some shyness in showing strong emotion among each other a trait frequent in rural households and one which stands in curiously inverse relation to most of the peculiarities distinguishing villagers from the people of towns Thus hiding their warmer feelings under commonplace talk all round Grace s reception produced no extraordinary demonstrations But that more was felt than was enacted appeared from the fact that her father in taking her in doors quite forgot the presence of Giles without as did also Grace herself He said nothing but took the gig round to the yard and called out from the spar house the man who particularly attended to these matters when there was no conversation to draw him off among the copse workers inside Winterborne then returned to the door with the intention of entering the house The family had gone into the parlor and were still absorbed in themselves The fire was as before the only light and it irradiated Grace s face and hands so as to make them look wondrously smooth and fair beside those of the two elders shining also through the loose hair about her temples as sunlight through a brake Her father was surveying her in a dazed conjecture so much had she developed and progressed in manner and stature since he last had set eyes on her Observing these things Winterborne remained dubious by the door mechanically tracing with his fingers certain time worn letters carved in the jambs initials of by gone generations of householders who had lived and died there No he declared to himself he would not enter and join the family they had forgotten him and it was enough for to day that he had brought her home Still he was a little surprised that her father s eagerness to send him for Grace should have resulted in such an anticlimax as this He walked softly away into the lane towards his own house looking back when he reached the turning from which he could get a last glimpse of the timber merchant s roof He hazarded guesses as to what Grace was saying just at that moment and murmured with some self derision nothing about me He looked also in the other direction and saw against the sky the thatched hip and solitary chimney of Marty s cottage and thought of her too struggling bravely along under that humble shelter among her spar gads and pots and skimmers At the timber merchant s in the mean time the conversation flowed and as Giles Winterborne had rightly enough deemed on subjects in which he had no share Among the excluding matters there was for one the effect upon mister Melbury of the womanly mien and manners of his daughter which took him so much unawares that though it did not make him absolutely forget the existence of her conductor homeward thrust Giles s image back into quite the obscurest cellarage of his brain Another was his interview with missus Charmond s agent that morning at which the lady herself had been present for a few minutes Melbury had purchased some standing timber from her a long time before and now that the date had come for felling it he was left to pursue almost his own course This was what the household were actually talking of during Giles s cogitation without and Melbury s satisfaction with the clear atmosphere that had arisen between himself and the deity of the groves which enclosed his residence was the cause of a counterbalancing mistiness on the side towards Winterborne So thoroughly does she trust me said Melbury that I might fell top or lop on my own judgment any stick o timber whatever in her wood and fix the price o t and settle the matter But name it all I wouldn t do such a thing However it may be useful to have this good understanding with her I wish she took more interest in the place and stayed here all the year round I am afraid tis not her regard for you but her dislike of Hintock that makes her so easy about the trees said missus Melbury When dinner was over Grace took a candle and began to ramble pleasurably through the rooms of her old home from which she had latterly become wellnigh an alien Each nook and each object revived a memory and simultaneously modified it The chambers seemed lower than they had appeared on any previous occasion of her return the surfaces of both walls and ceilings standing in such relations to the eye that it could not avoid taking microscopic note of their irregularities and old fashion Her own bedroom wore at once a look more familiar than when she had left it and yet a face estranged The world of little things therein gazed at her in helpless stationariness as though they had tried and been unable to make any progress without her presence Over the place where her candle had been accustomed to stand when she had used to read in bed till the midnight hour there was still the brown spot of smoke She did not know that her father had taken especial care to keep it from being cleaned off Having concluded her perambulation of this now uselessly commodious edifice Grace began to feel that she had come a long journey since the morning and when her father had been up himself as well as his wife to see that her room was comfortable and the fire burning she prepared to retire for the night No sooner however was she in bed than her momentary sleepiness took itself off and she wished she had stayed up longer She amused herself by listening to the old familiar noises that she could hear to be still going on down stairs and by looking towards the window as she lay The blind had been drawn up as she used to have it when a girl and she could just discern the dim tree tops against the sky on the neighboring hill Beneath this meeting line of light and shade nothing was visible save one solitary point of light which blinked as the tree twigs waved to and fro before its beams From its position it seemed to radiate from the window of a house on the hill side The house had been empty when she was last at home and she wondered who inhabited the place now Her conjectures however were not intently carried on and she was watching the light quite idly when it gradually changed color and at length shone blue as sapphire Thus it remained several minutes and then it passed through violet to red Her curiosity was so widely awakened by the phenomenon that she sat up in bed and stared steadily at the shine An appearance of this sort sufficient to excite attention anywhere was no less than a marvel in Hintock as Grace had known the hamlet Almost every diurnal and nocturnal effect in that woodland place had hitherto been the direct result of the regular terrestrial roll which produced the season s changes but here was something dissociated from these normal sequences and foreign to local habit and knowledge It was about this moment that Grace heard the household below preparing to retire the most emphatic noise in the proceeding being that of her father bolting the doors Then the stairs creaked and her father and mother passed her chamber The last to come was Grammer Oliver Grace slid out of bed ran across the room and lifting the latch said I am not asleep Grammer Come in and talk to me Before the old woman had entered Grace was again under the bedclothes Grammer set down her candlestick and seated herself on the edge of Miss Melbury s coverlet I want you to tell me what light that is I see on the hill side said Grace missus Oliver looked across Oh that she said is from the doctor s He s often doing things of that sort Perhaps you don t know that we ve a doctor living here now mister Fitzpiers by name Grace admitted that she had not heard of him Well then miss he s come here to get up a practice I know him very well through going there to help em scrub sometimes which your father said I might do if I wanted to in my spare time Being a bachelor man he ve only a lad in the house Oh yes I know him very well Sometimes he ll talk to me as if I were his own mother Indeed Yes Grammer he said one day when I asked him why he came here where there s hardly anybody living I ll tell you why I came here I took a map and I marked on it where doctor Jones s practice ends to the north of this district and where mister Taylor s ends on the south and little Jimmy Green s on the east and somebody else s to the west Then I took a pair of compasses and found the exact middle of the country that was left between these bounds and that middle was Little Hintock so here I am But Lord there poor young man Why He said Grammer Oliver I ve been here three months and although there are a good many people in the Hintocks and the villages round and a scattered practice is often a very good one I don t seem to get many patients And there s no society at all and I m pretty near melancholy mad he said with a great yawn I should be quite if it were not for my books and my lab laboratory and what not Grammer I was made for higher things And then he d yawn and yawn again Was he really made for higher things do you think I mean is he clever Well no How can he be clever He may be able to jine up a broken man or woman after a fashion and put his finger upon an ache if you tell him nearly where tis but these young men they should live to my time of life and then they d see how clever they were at five and twenty And yet he s a projick a real projick and says the oddest of rozums Ah Grammer he said at another time let me tell you that Everything is Nothing There s only Me and not Me in the whole world And he told me that no man s hands could help what they did any more than the hands of a clock Yes he s a man of strange meditations and his eyes seem to see as far as the north star He will soon go away no doubt I don t think so Grace did not say Why and Grammer hesitated At last she went on Don t tell your father or mother miss if I let you know a secret Grace gave the required promise Well he talks of buying me so he won t go away just yet Buying you how Not my soul my body when I m dead One day when I was there cleaning he said Grammer you ve a large brain a very large organ of brain he said A woman s is usually four ounces less than a man s but yours is man s size Well then hee hee after he d flattered me a bit like that he said he d give me ten pounds to have me as a natomy after my death Well knowing I d no chick nor chiel left and nobody with any interest in me I thought faith if I can be of any use to my fellow creatures after I m gone they are welcome to my services so I said I d think it over and would most likely agree and take the ten pounds Now this is a secret miss between us two The money would be very useful to me and I see no harm in it Of course there s no harm But oh Grammer how can you think to do it I wish you hadn t told me I wish I hadn t if you don t like to know it miss But you needn t mind Lord hee hee I shall keep him waiting many a year yet bless ye I hope you will I am sure The girl thereupon fell into such deep reflection that conversation languished and Grammer Oliver taking her candle wished Miss Melbury good night The latter s eyes rested on the distant glimmer around which she allowed her reasoning fancy to play in vague eddies that shaped the doings of the philosopher behind that light on the lines of intelligence just received It was strange to her to come back from the world to Little Hintock and find in one of its nooks like a tropical plant in a hedgerow a nucleus of advanced ideas and practices which had nothing in common with the life around Chemical experiments anatomical projects and metaphysical conceptions had found a strange home here Thus she remained thinking the imagined pursuits of the man behind the light intermingling with conjectural sketches of his personality till her eyes fell together with their own heaviness and she slept CHAPTER VII Kaleidoscopic dreams of a weird alchemist surgeon Grammer Oliver s skeleton and the face of Giles Winterborne brought Grace Melbury to the morning of the next day It was fine A north wind was blowing that not unacceptable compromise between the atmospheric cutlery of the eastern blast and the spongy gales of the west quarter She looked from her window in the direction of the light of the previous evening and could just discern through the trees the shape of the surgeon s house Somehow in the broad practical daylight that unknown and lonely gentleman seemed to be shorn of much of the interest which had invested his personality and pursuits in the hours of darkness and as Grace s dressing proceeded he faded from her mind Meanwhile Winterborne though half assured of her father s favor was rendered a little restless by Miss Melbury s behavior Despite his dry self control he could not help looking continually from his own door towards the timber merchant s in the probability of somebody s emergence therefrom His attention was at length justified by the appearance of two figures that of mister Melbury himself and Grace beside him They stepped out in a direction towards the densest quarter of the wood and Winterborne walked contemplatively behind them till all three were soon under the trees Although the time of bare boughs had now set in there were sheltered hollows amid the Hintock plantations and copses in which a more tardy leave taking than on windy summits was the rule with the foliage This caused here and there an apparent mixture of the seasons so that in some of the dells that they passed by holly berries in full red were found growing beside oak and hazel whose leaves were as yet not far removed from green and brambles whose verdure was rich and deep as in the month of August To Grace these well known peculiarities were as an old painting restored Now could be beheld that change from the handsome to the curious which the features of a wood undergo at the ingress of the winter months Angles were taking the place of curves and reticulations of surfaces a change constituting a sudden lapse from the ornate to the primitive on Nature s canvas and comparable to a retrogressive step from the art of an advanced school of painting to that of the Pacific Islander Winterborne followed and kept his eye upon the two figures as they threaded their way through these sylvan phenomena mister Melbury s long legs and gaiters drawn in to the bone at the ankles his slight stoop his habit of getting lost in thought and arousing himself with an exclamation of Hah accompanied with an upward jerk of the head composed a personage recognizable by his neighbors as far as he could be seen It seemed as if the squirrels and birds knew him One of the former would occasionally run from the path to hide behind the arm of some tree which the little animal carefully edged round pari passu with Melbury and his daughters movement onward assuming a mock manner as though he were saying Ho ho you are only a timber merchant and carry no gun They went noiselessly over mats of starry moss rustled through interspersed tracts of leaves skirted trunks with spreading roots whose mossed rinds made them like hands wearing green gloves elbowed old elms and ashes with great forks in which stood pools of water that overflowed on rainy days and ran down their stems in green cascades On older trees still than these huge lobes of fungi grew like lungs Here as everywhere the Unfulfilled Intention which makes life what it is was as obvious as it could be among the depraved crowds of a city slum The leaf was deformed the curve was crippled the taper was interrupted the lichen eat the vigor of the stalk and the ivy slowly strangled to death the promising sapling They dived amid beeches under which nothing grew the younger boughs still retaining their hectic leaves that rustled in the breeze with a sound almost metallic like the sheet iron foliage of the fabled Jarnvid wood Some flecks of white in Grace s drapery had enabled Giles to keep her and her father in view till this time but now he lost sight of them and was obliged to follow by ear no difficult matter for on the line of their course every wood pigeon rose from its perch with a continued clash dashing its wings against the branches with wellnigh force enough to break every quill By taking the track of this noise he soon came to a stile Was it worth while to go farther He examined the doughy soil at the foot of the stile and saw among the large sole and heel tracks an impression of a slighter kind from a boot that was obviously not local for Winterborne knew all the cobblers patterns in that district because they were very few to know The mud picture was enough to make him swing himself over and proceed The character of the woodland now changed The bases of the smaller trees were nibbled bare by rabbits and at divers points heaps of fresh made chips and the newly cut stool of a tree stared white through the undergrowth There had been a large fall of timber this year which explained the meaning of some sounds that soon reached him A voice was shouting intermittently in a sort of human bark which reminded Giles that there was a sale of trees and fagots that very day Melbury would naturally be present Thereupon Winterborne remembered that he himself wanted a few fagots and entered upon the scene A large group of buyers stood round the auctioneer or followed him when between his pauses he wandered on from one lot of plantation produce to another like some philosopher of the Peripatetic school delivering his lectures in the shady groves of the Lyceum His companions were timber dealers yeomen farmers villagers and others mostly woodland men who on that account could afford to be curious in their walking sticks which consequently exhibited various monstrosities of vegetation the chief being cork screw shapes in black and white thorn brought to that pattern by the slow torture of an encircling woodbine during their growth as the Chinese have been said to mould human beings into grotesque toys by continued compression in infancy Two women wearing men s jackets on their gowns conducted in the rear of the halting procession a pony cart containing a tapped barrel of beer from which they drew and replenished horns that were handed round with bread and cheese from a basket The auctioneer adjusted himself to circumstances by using his walking stick as a hammer and knocked down the lot on any convenient object that took his fancy such as the crown of a little boy s head or the shoulders of a by stander who had no business there except to taste the brew a proceeding which would have been deemed humorous but for the air of stern rigidity which that auctioneer s face preserved tending to show that the eccentricity was a result of that absence of mind which is engendered by the press of affairs and no freak of fancy at all mister Melbury stood slightly apart from the rest of the Peripatetics and Grace beside him clinging closely to his arm her modern attire looking almost odd where everything else was old fashioned and throwing over the familiar garniture of the trees a homeliness that seemed to demand improvement by the addition of a few contemporary novelties also Grace seemed to regard the selling with the interest which attaches to memories revived after an interval of obliviousness Winterborne went and stood close to them the timber merchant spoke and continued his buying Grace merely smiled To justify his presence there Winterborne began bidding for timber and fagots that he did not want pursuing the occupation in an abstracted mood in which the auctioneer s voice seemed to become one of the natural sounds of the woodland A few flakes of snow descended at the sight of which a robin alarmed at these signs of imminent winter and seeing that no offence was meant by the human invasion came and perched on the tip of the fagots that were being sold and looked into the auctioneer s face while waiting for some chance crumb from the bread basket Standing a little behind Grace Winterborne observed how one flake would sail downward and settle on a curl of her hair and how another would choose her shoulder and another the edge of her bonnet which took up so much of his attention that his biddings proceeded incoherently and when the auctioneer said every now and then with a nod towards him Yours mister Winterborne he had no idea whether he had bought fagots poles or logwood He regretted with some causticity of humor that her father should show such inequalities of temperament as to keep Grace tightly on his arm to day when he had quite lately seemed anxious to recognize their betrothal as a fact And thus musing and joining in no conversation with other buyers except when directly addressed he followed the assemblage hither and thither till the end of the auction when Giles for the first time realized what his purchases had been Hundreds of fagots and divers lots of timber had been set down to him when all he had required had been a few bundles of spray for his odd man Robert Creedle s use in baking and lighting fires Business being over he turned to speak to the timber merchant But Melbury s manner was short and distant and Grace too looked vexed and reproachful Winterborne then discovered that he had been unwittingly bidding against her father and picking up his favorite lots in spite of him With a very few words they left the spot and pursued their way homeward Giles was extremely sorry at what he had done and remained standing under the trees all the other men having strayed silently away He saw Melbury and his daughter pass down a glade without looking back While they moved slowly through it a lady appeared on horseback in the middle distance the line of her progress converging upon that of Melbury s They met Melbury took off his hat and she reined in her horse A conversation was evidently in progress between Grace and her father and this equestrian in whom he was almost sure that he recognized missus Charmond less by her outline than by the livery of the groom who had halted some yards off The interlocutors did not part till after a prolonged pause during which much seemed to be said When Melbury and Grace resumed their walk it was with something of a lighter tread than before Winterborne then pursued his own course homeward He was unwilling to let coldness grow up between himself and the Melburys for any trivial reason and in the evening he went to their house On drawing near the gate his attention was attracted by the sight of one of the bedrooms blinking into a state of illumination In it stood Grace lighting several candles her right hand elevating the taper her left hand on her bosom her face thoughtfully fixed on each wick as it kindled as if she saw in every flame s growth the rise of a life to maturity He wondered what such unusual brilliancy could mean to night On getting in doors he found her father and step mother in a state of suppressed excitement which at first he could not comprehend I am sorry about my biddings to day said Giles I don t know what I was doing I have come to say that any of the lots you may require are yours Oh never mind never mind replied the timber merchant with a slight wave of his hand I have so much else to think of that I nearly had forgot it Just now too there are matters of a different kind from trade to attend to so don t let it concern ye As the timber merchant spoke as it were down to him from a higher moral plane than his own Giles turned to missus Melbury Grace is going to the House to morrow she said quietly She is looking out her things now I dare say she is wanting me this minute to assist her Thereupon missus Melbury left the room Nothing is more remarkable than the independent personality of the tongue now and then mister Melbury knew that his words had been a sort of boast He decried boasting particularly to Giles yet whenever the subject was Grace his judgment resigned the ministry of speech in spite of him Winterborne felt surprise pleasure and also a little apprehension at the news He repeated missus Melbury s words Yes said paternal pride not sorry to have dragged out of him what he could not in any circumstances have kept in Coming home from the woods this afternoon we met missus Charmond out for a ride She spoke to me on a little matter of business and then got acquainted with Grace Twas wonderful how she took to Grace in a few minutes that freemasonry of education made em close at once Naturally enough she was amazed that such an article ha ha could come out of my house At last it led on to Mis ess Grace being asked to the House So she s busy hunting up her frills and furbelows to go in As Giles remained in thought without responding Melbury continued But I ll call her down stairs No no don t do that since she s busy said Winterborne Melbury feeling from the young man s manner that his own talk had been too much at Giles and too little to him repented at once His face changed and he said in lower tones with an effort She s yours Giles as far as I am concerned Thanks my best thanks But I think since it is all right between us about the biddings that I ll not interrupt her now I ll step homeward and call another time On leaving the house he looked up at the bedroom again Grace surrounded by a sufficient number of candles to answer all purposes of self criticism was standing before a cheval glass that her father had lately bought expressly for her use she was bonneted cloaked and gloved and glanced over her shoulder into the mirror estimating her aspect Her face was lit with the natural elation of a young girl hoping to inaugurate on the morrow an intimate acquaintance with a new interesting and powerful friend CHAPTER VIII The inspiriting appointment which had led Grace Melbury to indulge in a six candle illumination for the arrangement of her attire carried her over the ground the next morning with a springy tread Her sense of being properly appreciated on her own native soil seemed to brighten the atmosphere and herbage around her as the glowworm s lamp irradiates the grass Thus she moved along a vessel of emotion going to empty itself on she knew not what Twenty minutes walking through copses over a stile and along an upland lawn brought her to the verge of a deep glen at the bottom of which Hintock House appeared immediately beneath her eye To describe it as standing in a hollow would not express the situation of the manor house it stood in a hole notwithstanding that the hole was full of beauty 
3911-8888-0000	train-other-500	From the spot which Grace had reached a stone could easily have been thrown over or into the birds nested chimneys of the mansion Its walls were surmounted by a battlemented parapet

3911-8888-0004	train-other-500	Above the house to the back was a dense plantation the roots of whose trees were above the level of the chimneys The corresponding high ground on which Grace stood was richly grassed with only an old tree here and there
3911-8888-0005	train-other-500	A few sheep lay about which as they ruminated looked quietly into the bedroom windows The situation of the house prejudicial to humanity was a stimulus to vegetation

3911-8888-0010	train-other-500	and to draw groans from the gregariously disposed Grace descended the green escarpment by a zigzag path into the drive which swept round beneath the slope The exterior of the house had been familiar to her from her childhood
3911-8888-0011	train-other-500	but she had never been inside and the approach to knowing an old thing in a new way was a lively experience It was with a little flutter that she was shown in but she recollected that missus Charmond would probably be alone

none	none	 owing it was supposed to a quarrel 
3911-8888-0013	train-other-500	and missus Charmond had been left desolate Being presumably a woman who did not care for solitude this deprivation might possibly account for her sudden interest in Grace
none	none	 missus Charmond was at the end of a gallery opening from the hall 
3911-8888-0014	train-other-500	when Miss Melbury was announced and saw her through the glass doors between them She came forward with a smile on her face and told the young girl it was good of her to come Ah you have noticed those she said
3911-8888-0015	train-other-500	seeing that Grace s eyes were attracted by some curious objects against the walls They are man traps My husband was a connoisseur in man traps and spring guns and such articles collecting them from all his neighbors
3911-8888-0016	train-other-500	He knew the histories of all these which gin had broken a man s leg which gun had killed a man That one I remember his saying
none	none	 had been set by a game keeper in the track of a notorious poacher 
3911-8888-0017	train-other-500	but the keeper forgetting what he had done went that way himself received the charge in the lower part of his body and died of the wound I don t like them here but I ve never yet given directions for them to be taken away She added playfully
3911-8888-0018	train-other-500	Man traps are of rather ominous significance where a person of our sex lives are they not Grace was bound to smile but that side of womanliness was one which her inexperience had no great zest in contemplating
3911-8888-0019	train-other-500	They are interesting no doubt as relics of a barbarous time happily past she said looking thoughtfully at the varied designs of these instruments of torture some with semi circular jaws some with rectangular
3911-8888-0020	train-other-500	most of them with long sharp teeth but a few with none so that their jaws looked like the blank gums of old age Well we must not take them too seriously said missus Charmond with an indolent turn of her head
3911-8888-0021	train-other-500	and they moved on inward When she had shown her visitor different articles in cabinets that she deemed likely to interest her some tapestries wood carvings ivories miniatures and so on
3911-8888-0022	train-other-500	always with a mien of listlessness which might either have been constitutional or partly owing to the situation of the place they sat down to an early cup of tea Will you pour it out please Do she said
3911-8888-0023	train-other-500	leaning back in her chair and placing her hand above her forehead while her almond eyes those long eyes so common to the angelic legions of early Italian art became longer and her voice more languishing
3911-8888-0024	train-other-500	She showed that oblique mannered softness which is perhaps most frequent in women of darker complexion and more lymphatic temperament than missus Charmond s was who lingeringly smile their meanings to men rather than speak them
none	none	 who inveigle rather than prompt 
3911-8888-0025	train-other-500	and take advantage of currents rather than steer I am the most inactive woman when I am here she said I think sometimes I was born to live and do nothing nothing nothing but float about
3911-8888-0026	train-other-500	as we fancy we do sometimes in dreams But that cannot be really my destiny and I must struggle against such fancies I am so sorry you do not enjoy exertion it is quite sad I wish I could tend you and make you very happy
3911-8888-0027	train-other-500	There was something so sympathetic so appreciative in the sound of Grace s voice that it impelled people to play havoc with their customary reservations in talking to her It is tender and kind of you to feel that said missus Charmond
3911-8888-0028	train-other-500	Perhaps I have given you the notion that my languor is more than it really is But this place oppresses me and I have a plan of going abroad a good deal I used to go with a relative but that arrangement has dropped through
3911-8888-0029	train-other-500	Regarding Grace with a final glance of criticism she seemed to make up her mind to consider the young girl satisfactory and continued Now I am often impelled to record my impressions of times and places
3911-8888-0030	train-other-500	I have often thought of writing a New Sentimental Journey But I cannot find energy enough to do it alone When I am at different places in the south of Europe I feel a crowd of ideas and fancies thronging upon me continually
3911-8888-0031	train-other-500	but to unfold writing materials take up a cold steel pen and put these impressions down systematically on cold smooth paper that I cannot do So I have thought that if I always could have somebody at my elbow with whom I am in sympathy
none	none	 I might dictate any ideas that come into my head 
3911-8888-0032	train-other-500	And directly I had made your acquaintance the other day it struck me that you would suit me so well Would you like to undertake it You might read to me too if desirable Will you think it over and ask your parents if they are willing
3911-8888-0033	train-other-500	Oh yes said Grace I am almost sure they would be very glad You are so accomplished I hear I should be quite honored by such intellectual company
3911-8888-0034	train-other-500	Grace modestly blushing deprecated any such idea Do you keep up your lucubrations at Little Hintock Oh no Lucubrations are not unknown at Little Hintock but they are not carried on by me
3911-8888-0035	train-other-500	What another student in that retreat There is a surgeon lately come and I have heard that he reads a great deal I see his light sometimes through the trees late at night
3911-8888-0036	train-other-500	Oh yes a doctor I believe I was told of him It is a strange place for him to settle in It is a convenient centre for a practice they say But he does not confine his studies to medicine it seems
3911-8888-0037	train-other-500	He investigates theology and metaphysics and all sorts of subjects What is his name Fitzpiers He represents a very old family I believe the Fitzpierses of Buckbury Fitzpiers
3911-8888-0038	train-other-500	not a great many miles from here I am not sufficiently local to know the history of the family I was never in the county till my husband brought me here missus Charmond did not care to pursue this line of investigation
3911-8888-0039	train-other-500	Whatever mysterious merit might attach to family antiquity it was one which though she herself could claim it her adaptable wandering weltburgerliche nature had grown tired of caring about
3911-8888-0040	train-other-500	a peculiarity that made her a contrast to her neighbors It is of rather more importance to know what the man is himself than what his family is she said if he is going to practise upon us as a surgeon Have you seen him
3911-8888-0041	train-other-500	Grace had not I think he is not a very old man she added Has he a wife I am not aware that he has Well I hope he will be useful here I must get to know him when I come back
3911-8888-0042	train-other-500	It will be very convenient to have a medical man if he is clever in one s own parish I get dreadfully nervous sometimes living in such an outlandish place and Sherton is so far to send to
3911-8888-0043	train-other-500	No doubt you feel Hintock to be a great change after watering place life I do But it is home It has its advantages and its disadvantages Grace was thinking less of the solitude than of the attendant circumstances
3911-8888-0044	train-other-500	They chatted on for some time Grace being set quite at her ease by her entertainer missus Charmond was far too well practised a woman not to know that to show a marked patronage to a sensitive young girl who would probably be very quick to discern it
3911-8888-0045	train-other-500	was to demolish her dignity rather than to establish it in that young girl s eyes So being violently possessed with her idea of making use of this gentle acquaintance ready and waiting at her own door she took great pains to win her confidence at starting
3911-8888-0046	train-other-500	Just before Grace s departure the two chanced to pause before a mirror which reflected their faces in immediate juxtaposition so as to bring into prominence their resemblances and their contrasts
3911-8888-0047	train-other-500	Both looked attractive as glassed back by the faithful reflector but Grace s countenance had the effect of making missus Charmond appear more than her full age There are complexions which set off each other to great advantage
3911-8888-0048	train-other-500	and there are those which antagonize the one killing or damaging its neighbor unmercifully This was unhappily the case here missus Charmond fell into a meditation and replied abstractedly to a cursory remark of her companion s
3911-8888-0049	train-other-500	However she parted from her young friend in the kindliest tones promising to send and let her know as soon as her mind was made up on the arrangement she had suggested When Grace had ascended nearly to the top of the adjoining slope
3911-8888-0050	train-other-500	she looked back and saw that missus Charmond still stood at the door meditatively regarding her Often during the previous night after his call on the Melburys
3911-8888-0051	train-other-500	Winterborne s thoughts ran upon Grace s announced visit to Hintock House Why could he not have proposed to walk with her part of the way Something told him that she might not on such an occasion care for his company
3911-8888-0052	train-other-500	He was still more of that opinion when standing in his garden next day he saw her go past on the journey with such a pretty pride in the event He wondered if her father s ambition which had purchased for her the means of intellectual light and culture
3911-8888-0053	train-other-500	far beyond those of any other native of the village would conduce to the flight of her future interests above and away from the local life which was once to her the movement of the world Nevertheless he had her father s permission to win her if he could
3911-8888-0054	train-other-500	and to this end it became desirable to bring matters soon to a crisis if he ever hoped to do so If she should think herself too good for him he could let her go and make the best of his loss but until he had really tested her
3911-8888-0055	train-other-500	he could not say that she despised his suit The question was how to quicken events towards an issue He thought and thought and at last decided that as good a way as any would be to give a Christmas party and ask Grace and her parents to come as chief guests
none	none	 These ruminations were occupying him when there became audible a slight knocking at his front door 
3911-8888-0056	train-other-500	He descended the path and looked out and beheld Marty South dressed for out door work Why didn t you come mister Winterborne she said I ve been waiting there hours and hours and at last I thought I must try to find you
3911-8888-0057	train-other-500	Bless my soul I d quite forgot said Giles What he had forgotten was that there was a thousand young fir trees to be planted in a neighboring spot which had been cleared by the wood cutters
3911-8888-0058	train-other-500	and that he had arranged to plant them with his own hands He had a marvellous power of making trees grow Although he would seem to shovel in the earth quite carelessly
3911-8888-0059	train-other-500	there was a sort of sympathy between himself and the fir oak or beech that he was operating on so that the roots took hold of the soil in a few days When on the other hand any of the journeymen planted
3911-8888-0060	train-other-500	although they seemed to go through an identically similar process one quarter of the trees would die away during the ensuing August Hence Winterborne found delight in the work even when as at present
3911-8888-0061	train-other-500	he contracted to do it on portions of the woodland in which he had no personal interest Marty who turned her hand to anything was usually the one who performed the part of keeping the trees in a perpendicular position while he threw in the mould
3911-8888-0062	train-other-500	He accompanied her towards the spot being stimulated yet further to proceed with the work by the knowledge that the ground was close to the way side along which Grace must pass on her return from Hintock House
3911-8888-0063	train-other-500	You ve a cold in the head Marty he said as they walked That comes of cutting off your hair I suppose it do Yes I ve three headaches going on in my head at the same time Three headaches
3911-8888-0064	train-other-500	Yes a rheumatic headache in my poll a sick headache over my eyes and a misery headache in the middle of my brain However I came out for I thought you might be waiting and grumbling like anything if I was not there
none	none	 The holes were already dug and they set to work 
3911-8888-0065	train-other-500	Winterborne s fingers were endowed with a gentle conjuror s touch in spreading the roots of each little tree resulting in a sort of caress under which the delicate fibres all laid themselves out in their proper directions for growth
3911-8888-0066	train-other-500	He put most of these roots towards the south west for he said in forty years time when some great gale is blowing from that quarter the trees will require the strongest holdfast on that side to stand against it and not fall
3911-8888-0067	train-other-500	How they sigh directly we put em upright though while they are lying down they don t sigh at all said Marty Do they said Giles I ve never noticed it
3911-8888-0068	train-other-500	She erected one of the young pines into its hole and held up her finger the soft musical breathing instantly set in which was not to cease night or day till the grown tree should be felled
3911-8888-0069	train-other-500	probably long after the two planters should be felled themselves It seems to me the girl continued as if they sigh because they are very sorry to begin life in earnest just as we be Just as we be
3911-8888-0070	train-other-500	He looked critically at her You ought not to feel like that Marty Her only reply was turning to take up the next tree and they planted on through a great part of the day almost without another word
3911-8888-0071	train-other-500	Winterborne s mind ran on his contemplated evening party his abstraction being such that he hardly was conscious of Marty s presence beside him From the nature of their employment in which he handled the spade and she merely held the tree
3911-8888-0072	train-other-500	it followed that he got good exercise and she got none But she was an heroic girl and though her out stretched hand was chill as a stone and her cheeks blue and her cold worse than ever
3911-8888-0073	train-other-500	she would not complain while he was disposed to continue work But when he paused she said mister Winterborne can I run down the lane and back to warm my feet Why yes of course
none	none	 he said awakening anew to her existence 
3911-8888-0074	train-other-500	Though I was just thinking what a mild day it is for the season Now I warrant that cold of yours is twice as bad as it was You had no business to chop that hair off Marty it serves you almost right Look here cut off home at once
3911-8888-0075	train-other-500	A run down the lane will be quite enough No it won t You ought not to have come out to day at all But I should like to finish the
none	none	 Marty I tell you to go home said he peremptorily 
3911-8888-0076	train-other-500	I can manage to keep the rest of them upright with a stick or something She went away without saying any more When she had gone down the orchard a little distance she looked back Giles suddenly went after her
3911-8888-0077	train-other-500	Marty it was for your good that I was rough you know But warm yourself in your own way I don t care When she had run off he fancied he discerned a woman s dress through the holly bushes which divided the coppice from the road
3911-8888-0078	train-other-500	It was Grace at last on her way back from the interview with missus Charmond He threw down the tree he was planting and was about to break through the belt of holly when he suddenly became aware of the presence of another man
3911-8888-0079	train-other-500	who was looking over the hedge on the opposite side of the way upon the figure of the unconscious Grace He appeared as a handsome and gentlemanly personage of six or eight and twenty and was quizzing her through an eye glass
3911-8888-0080	train-other-500	Seeing that Winterborne was noticing him he let his glass drop with a click upon the rail which protected the hedge and walked away in the opposite direction Giles knew in a moment that this must be mister Fitzpiers
none	none	 When he was gone Winterborne pushed through the hollies and emerged close beside the interesting object of their contemplation CHAPTER IX I heard the bushes move long before I saw you she began I said first it is some terrible beast next it is a poacher next it is a friend He regarded her with a slight smile weighing not her speech but the question whether he should tell her that she had been watched He decided in the negative You have been to the house he said But I need not ask The fact was that there shone upon Miss Melbury s face a species of exaltation which saw no environing details nor his own occupation nothing more than his bare presence Why need you not ask Your face is like the face of Moses when he came down from the Mount She reddened a little and said How can you be so profane Giles Winterborne How can you think so much of that class of people Well I beg pardon I didn t mean to speak so freely How do you like her house and her Exceedingly I had not been inside the walls since I was a child when it used to be let to strangers before missus Charmond s late husband bought the property She is SO nice And Grace fell into such an abstracted gaze at the imaginary image of missus Charmond and her niceness that it almost conjured up a vision of that lady in mid air before them She has only been here a month or two it seems and cannot stay much longer because she finds it so lonely and damp in winter She is going abroad Only think she would like me to go with her Giles s features stiffened a little at the news Indeed what for But I won t keep you standing here Hoi Robert he cried to a swaying collection of clothes in the distance which was the figure of Creedle his man Go on filling in there till I come back I m a coming sir I m a coming Well the reason is this continued she as 
4236_8927_000049_000001	train-clean-360	they went on together 
none	none	missus Charmond has a delightful side to her character a desire to record her impressions of travel like Alexandre Dumas and Mery and Sterne and others But she cannot find energy enough to do it herself And Grace proceeded to explain missus Charmond s proposal at large My notion is that Mery s style will suit her best because he writes in that soft emotional luxurious way she has Grace said musingly Indeed said Winterborne with mock awe Suppose you talk over my head a little longer Miss Grace Melbury Oh I didn t mean it she said repentantly looking into his eyes And as for myself I hate French books And I love dear old Hintock AND THE PEOPLE IN IT fifty times better than all the Continent But the scheme I think it an enchanting notion don t you Giles It is well enough in one sense but it will take yon away said he mollified Only for a short time We should return in May Well Miss Melbury it is a question for your father Winterborne walked with her nearly to her house He had awaited her coming mainly with the view of mentioning to her his proposal to have a Christmas party but homely Christmas gatherings in the venerable and jovial Hintock style seemed so primitive and uncouth beside the lofty matters of her converse and thought that he refrained As soon as she was gone he turned back towards the scene of his planting and could not help saying to himself as he walked that this engagement of his was a very unpromising business Her outing to day had not improved it A woman who could go to Hintock House and be friendly with its mistress enter into the views of its mistress talk like her and dress not much unlike her why she would hardly be contented with him a yeoman now immersed in tree planting even though he planted them well And yet she s a true hearted girl he said thinking of her words about Hintock I must bring matters to a point and there s an end of it When he reached the plantation he found that Marty had come back and dismissing Creedle he went on planting silently with the girl as before Suppose Marty he said after a while looking at her extended arm upon which old scratches from briers showed themselves purple in the cold wind suppose you know a person and want to bring that person to a good understanding with you do you think a Christmas party of some sort is a warming up thing and likely to be useful in hastening on the matter Is there to be dancing There might be certainly Will He dance with She Well yes Then it might bring things to a head one way or the other I won t be the one to say which It shall be done said Winterborne not to her though he spoke the words quite loudly And as the day was nearly ended he added Here Marty I ll send up a man to plant the rest to morrow I ve other things to think of just now She did not inquire what other things for she had seen him walking with Grace Melbury She looked towards the western sky which was now aglow like some vast foundery wherein new worlds were being cast Across it the bare bough of a tree stretched horizontally revealing every twig against the red and showing in dark profile every beck and movement of three pheasants that were settling themselves down on it in a row to roost It will be fine to morrow said Marty observing them with the vermilion light of the sun in the pupils of her eyes for they are a croupied down nearly at the end of the bough If it were going to be stormy they d squeeze close to the trunk The weather is almost all they have to think of isn t it mister Winterborne and so they must be lighter hearted than we I dare say they are said Winterborne Before taking a single step in the preparations Winterborne with no great hopes went across that evening to the timber merchant s to ascertain if Grace and her parents would honor him with their presence Having first to set his nightly gins in the garden to catch the rabbits that ate his winter greens his call was delayed till just after the rising of the moon whose rays reached the Hintock houses but fitfully as yet on account of the trees Melbury was crossing his yard on his way to call on some one at the larger village but he readily turned and walked up and down the path with the young man Giles in his self deprecatory sense of living on a much smaller scale than the Melburys did would not for the world imply that his invitation was to a gathering of any importance So he put it in the mild form of Can you come in for an hour when you have done business the day after to morrow and missus and Miss Melbury if they have nothing more pressing to do Melbury would give no answer at once No I can t tell you to day he said I must talk it over with the women As far as I am concerned my dear Giles you know I ll come with pleasure But how do I know what Grace s notions may be You see she has been away among cultivated folks a good while and now this acquaintance with missus Charmond Well I ll ask her I can say no more When Winterborne was gone the timber merchant went on his way He knew very well that Grace whatever her own feelings would either go or not go according as he suggested and his instinct was for the moment to suggest the negative His errand took him past the church and the way to his destination was either across the church yard or along side it the distances being the same For some reason or other he chose the former way The moon was faintly lighting up the gravestones and the path and the front of the building Suddenly mister Melbury paused turned ill upon the grass and approached a particular headstone where he read In memory of John Winterborne with the subjoined date and age It was the grave of Giles s father The timber merchant laid his hand upon the stone and was humanized Jack my wronged friend he said I ll be faithful to my plan of making amends to ee When he reached home that evening he said to Grace and missus Melbury who were working at a little table by the fire Giles wants us to go down and spend an hour with him the day after to morrow and I m thinking that as tis Giles who asks us we ll go They assented without demur and accordingly the timber merchant sent Giles the next morning an answer in the affirmative Winterborne in his modesty or indifference had mentioned no particular hour in his invitation and accordingly mister Melbury and his family expecting no other guests chose their own time which chanced to be rather early in the afternoon by reason of the somewhat quicker despatch than usual of the timber merchant s business that day To show their sense of the unimportance of the occasion they walked quite slowly to the house as if they were merely out for a ramble and going to nothing special at all or at most intending to pay a casual call and take a cup of tea At this hour stir and bustle pervaded the interior of Winterborne s domicile from cellar to apple loft He had planned an elaborate high tea for six o clock or thereabouts and a good roaring supper to come on about eleven Being a bachelor of rather retiring habits the whole of the preparations devolved upon himself and his trusty man and familiar Robert Creedle who did everything that required doing from making Giles s bed to catching moles in his field He was a survival from the days when Giles s father held the homestead and Giles was a playing boy These two with a certain dilatoriousness which appertained to both were now in the heat of preparation in the bake house expecting nobody before six o clock Winterborne was standing before the brick oven in his shirt sleeves tossing in thorn sprays and stirring about the blazing mass with a long handled three pronged Beelzebub kind of fork the heat shining out upon his streaming face and making his eyes like furnaces the thorns crackling and sputtering while Creedle having ranged the pastry dishes in a row on the table till the oven should be ready was pressing out the crust of a final apple pie with a rolling pin A great pot boiled on the fire and through the open door of the back kitchen a boy was seen seated on the fender emptying the snuffers and scouring the candlesticks a row of the latter standing upside down on the hob to melt out the grease Looking up from the rolling pin Creedle saw passing the window first the timber merchant in his second best suit missus Melbury in her best silk and Grace in the fashionable attire which in part brought home with her from the Continent she had worn on her visit to missus Charmond s The eyes of the three had been attracted to the proceedings within by the fierce illumination which the oven threw out upon the operators and their utensils Lord Lord if they baint come a ready said Creedle No hey said Giles looking round aghast while the boy in the background waved a reeking candlestick in his delight As there was no help for it Winterborne went to meet them in the door way My dear Giles I see we have made a mistake in the time said the timber merchant s wife her face lengthening with concern Oh it is not much difference I hope you ll come in But this means a regular randyvoo said mister Melbury accusingly glancing round and pointing towards the bake house with his stick Well yes said Giles And not Great Hintock band and dancing surely I told three of em they might drop in if they d nothing else to do Giles mildly admitted Now why the name didn t ye tell us twas going to be a serious kind of thing before How should I know what folk mean if they don t say Now shall we come in or shall we go home and come back along in a couple of hours I hope you ll stay if you ll be so good as not to mind now you are here I shall have it all right and tidy in a very little time I ought not to have been so backward Giles spoke quite anxiously for one of his undemonstrative temperament for he feared that if the Melburys once were back in their own house they would not be disposed to turn out again Tis we ought not to have been so forward that s what tis said mister Melbury testily Don t keep us here in the sitting room lead on to the bakehouse man Now we are here we ll help ye get ready for the rest Here mis ess take off your things and help him out in his baking or he won t get done to night I ll finish heating the oven and set you free to go and skiver up them ducks His eye had passed with pitiless directness of criticism into yet remote recesses of Winterborne s awkwardly built premises where the aforesaid birds were hanging And I ll help finish the tarts said Grace cheerfully I don t know about that said her father Tisn t quite so much in your line as it is in your mother law s and mine Of course I couldn t let you Grace said Giles with some distress I ll do it of course said missus Melbury taking off her silk train hanging it up to a nail carefully rolling back her sleeves pinning them to her shoulders and stripping Giles of his apron for her own use So Grace pottered idly about while her father and his wife helped on the preparations A kindly pity of his household management which Winterborne saw in her eyes whenever he caught them depressed him much more than her contempt would have done Creedle met Giles at the pump after a while when each of the others was absorbed in the difficulties of a cuisine based on utensils cupboards and provisions that were strange to them He groaned to the young man in a whisper This is a bruckle het maister I m much afeared Who d ha thought they d ha come so soon The bitter placidity of Winterborne s look adumbrated the misgivings he did not care to express Have you got the celery ready he asked quickly Now that s a thing I never could mind no not if you d paid me in silver and gold And I don t care who the man is I says that a stick of celery that isn t scrubbed with the scrubbing brush is not clean Very well very well I ll attend to it You go and get em comfortable in doors He hastened to the garden and soon returned tossing the stalks to Creedle who was still in a tragic mood If ye d ha married d ye see maister he said this caddle couldn t have happened to us Everything being at last under way the oven set and all done that could insure the supper turning up ready at some time or other Giles and his friends entered the parlor where the Melburys again dropped into position as guests though the room was not nearly so warm and cheerful as the blazing bakehouse Others now arrived among them Farmer Bawtree and the hollow turner and tea went off very well Grace s disposition to make the best of everything and to wink at deficiencies in Winterborne s menage was so uniform and persistent that he suspected her of seeing even more deficiencies than he was aware of That suppressed sympathy which had showed in her face ever since her arrival told him as much too plainly This muddling style of house keeping is what you ve not lately been used to I suppose he said when they were a little apart No but I like it it reminds me so pleasantly that everything here in dear old Hintock is just as it used to be The oil is not quite nice but everything else is The oil On the chairs I mean because it gets on one s dress Still mine is not a new one Giles found that Creedle in his zeal to make things look bright had smeared the chairs with some greasy kind of furniture polish and refrained from rubbing it dry in order not to diminish the mirror like effect that the mixture produced as laid on Giles apologized and called Creedle but he felt that the Fates were against him

none	none	Supper time came and with it the hot baked from the oven laid on a snowy cloth fresh from the press and reticulated with folds as in Flemish Last Suppers Creedle and the boy fetched and carried with amazing alacrity the latter to mollify his superior and make things pleasant expressing his admiration of Creedle s cleverness when they were alone
3549_8890_000002_000000	train-clean-360	 I s pose the time when you learned all these knowing things mister Creedle was when you was in the militia 
none	none	Well yes 
3549_8890_000003_000001	train-clean-360	I seed the world at that time somewhat certainly and many ways of strange dashing life 
3549_8890_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Not but that Giles has worked hard in helping me to bring things to such perfection to day Giles says I though he s maister 
3549_8890_000003_000003	train-clean-360	Not that I should call n maister by rights for his father growed up side by side with me as if one mother had twinned us and been our nourishing 
3549_8890_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 I s pose your memory can reach a long way back into history mister Creedle 
none	none	Oh yes 
3549_8890_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Ancient days when there was battles and famines and hang fairs and other pomps seem to me as yesterday 
none	none	Ah many s the patriarch I ve seed come and go in this parish 
3549_8890_000005_000003	train-clean-360	There he s calling for more plates 
none	none	Lord why can t em turn their plates bottom upward for pudding as they used to do in former days Meanwhile in the adjoining room Giles was presiding in a half unconscious state 
3549_8890_000006_000001	train-clean-360	He could not get over the initial failures in his scheme for advancing his suit and hence he did not know that he was eating mouthfuls of bread and nothing else and continually snuffing the two candles next him till he had reduced them to mere glimmers drowned in their own grease 
none	none	Creedle now appeared with a specially prepared dish which he served by elevating the little three legged pot that contained it and tilting the contents into a dish exclaiming simultaneously Draw back gentlemen and ladies please 
3549_8890_000007_000000	train-clean-360	A splash followed 
3549_8890_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Grace gave a quick involuntary nod and blink and put her handkerchief to her face 
3549_8890_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Good heavens what did you do that for Creedle said Giles sternly and jumping up 
3549_8890_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Tis how I do it when they baint here maister mildly expostulated Creedle in an aside audible to all the company 
3549_8890_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Well yes but replied Giles 
none	none	He went over to Grace and hoped none of it had gone into her eye
3549_8890_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh no she said 
3549_8890_000011_000001	train-clean-360	 Only a sprinkle on my face 
3549_8890_000011_000002	train-clean-360	It was nothing 
3549_8890_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Kiss it and make it well gallantly observed mister Bawtree 
3549_8890_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Miss Melbury blushed 
3549_8890_000014_000000	train-clean-360	The timber merchant said quickly Oh it is nothing 
3549_8890_000014_000001	train-clean-360	She must bear these little mishaps But there could be discerned in his face something which said I ought to have foreseen this 
3549_8890_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Giles himself since the untoward beginning of the feast had not quite liked to see Grace present 
none	none	He wished he had not asked such people as Bawtree and the hollow turner 
3549_8890_000015_000002	train-clean-360	He had done it in dearth of other friends that the room might not appear empty 
none	none	In his mind s eye before the event they had been the mere background or padding of the scene but somehow in reality they were the most prominent personages there After supper they played cards Bawtree and the hollow turner monopolizing the new packs for an interminable game in which a lump of chalk was incessantly used a game those two always played wherever they were taking a solitary candle and going to a private table in a corner with the mien of persons bent on weighty matters The rest of the company on this account were obliged to put up with old packs for their round game that had been lying by in a drawer ever since the time that Giles s grandmother was alive Each card had a great stain in the middle of its back produced by the touch of generations of damp and excited thumbs now fleshless in the grave and the kings and queens wore a decayed expression of feature as if they were rather an impecunious dethroned race of monarchs hiding in obscure slums than real regal characters 
3549_8890_000016_000003	train-clean-360	Every now and then the comparatively few remarks of the players at the round game were harshly intruded on by the measured jingle of Farmer Bawtree and the hollow turner from the back of the room 
none	none	And I will hold a wa ger with you That all these marks are thirt y two accompanied by rapping strokes with the chalk on the table then an exclamation an argument a dealing of the cards then the commencement of the rhymes anew 
3549_8890_000019_000000	train-clean-360	The timber merchant showed his feelings by talking with a satisfied sense of weight in his words and by praising the party in a patronizing tone when Winterborne expressed his fear that he and his were not enjoying themselves 
3549_8890_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes yes pretty much 
3549_8890_000020_000001	train-clean-360	What handsome glasses those are 
3549_8890_000020_000002	train-clean-360	I didn t know you had such glasses in the house 
none	none	Now Lucy to his wife you ought to get some like them for ourselves And when they had abandoned cards and Winterborne was talking to Melbury by the fire it was the timber merchant who stood with his back to the mantle in a proprietary attitude from which post of vantage he critically regarded Giles s person rather as a superficies than as a solid with ideas and feelings inside it saying What a splendid coat that one is you have on Giles 
3549_8890_000020_000004	train-clean-360	I can t get such coats 
3549_8890_000020_000005	train-clean-360	You dress better than I 
3549_8890_000021_000000	train-clean-360	After supper there was a dance the bandsmen from Great Hintock having arrived some time before 
3549_8890_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Grace had been away from home so long that she had forgotten the old figures and hence did not join in the movement 
3549_8890_000021_000002	train-clean-360	Then Giles felt that all was over 
3549_8890_000021_000003	train-clean-360	As for her she was thinking as she watched the gyrations of a very different measure that she had been accustomed to tread with a bevy of sylph like creatures in muslin in the music room of a large house most of whom were now moving in scenes widely removed from this both as regarded place and character 
3549_8890_000022_000000	train-clean-360	A woman she did not know came and offered to tell her fortune with the abandoned cards 
3549_8890_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Grace assented to the proposal and the woman told her tale unskilfully for want of practice as she declared 
3549_8890_000023_000000	train-clean-360	mister Melbury was standing by and exclaimed contemptuously Tell her fortune indeed 
3549_8890_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Her fortune has been told by men of science what do you call em 
none	none	Phrenologists 
3549_8890_000023_000003	train-clean-360	You can t teach her anything new 
3549_8890_000023_000004	train-clean-360	She s been too far among the wise ones to be astonished at anything she can hear among us folks in Hintock 
3549_8890_000024_000000	train-clean-360	At last the time came for breaking up Melbury and his family being the earliest to leave the two card players still pursuing their game doggedly in the corner where they had completely covered Giles s mahogany table with chalk scratches 
3549_8890_000024_000001	train-clean-360	The three walked home the distance being short and the night clear 
3549_8890_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Well Giles is a very good fellow said mister Melbury as they struck down the lane under boughs which formed a black filigree in which the stars seemed set 
none	none	Certainly he is said Grace quickly and in such a tone as to show that he stood no lower if no higher in her regard than he had stood before 
3549_8890_000027_000000	train-clean-360	When they were opposite an opening through which by day the doctor s house could be seen they observed a light in one of his rooms although it was now about two o clock 
3549_8890_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 The doctor is not abed yet said missus Melbury 
3549_8890_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Hard study no doubt said her husband 
3549_8890_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 One would think that as he seems to have nothing to do about here by day he could at least afford to go to bed early at night 
3549_8890_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 Tis astonishing how little we see of him 
none	none	Melbury s mind seemed to turn with much relief to the contemplation of mister Fitzpiers after the scenes of the evening
3549_8890_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 It is natural enough he replied 
3549_8890_000031_000002	train-clean-360	 What can a man of that sort find to interest him in Hintock 
3549_8890_000031_000003	train-clean-360	I don t expect he ll stay here long 
none	none	His mind reverted to Giles s party and when they were nearly home he spoke again his daughter being a few steps in advance It is hardly the line of life for a girl like Grace after what she s been accustomed to I didn t foresee that in sending her to boarding school and letting her travel and what not to make her a good bargain for Giles I should be really spoiling her for him Ah tis a thousand pities But he ought to have her he ought 
3549_8890_000033_000000	train-clean-360	At this moment the two exclusive chalk mark men having at last really finished their play could be heard coming along in the rear vociferously singing a song to march time and keeping vigorous step to the same in far reaching strides 
3549_8890_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 She may go oh She may go oh She may go to the d for me 
3549_8890_000035_000000	train-clean-360	The timber merchant turned indignantly to missus Melbury 
none	none	That s the sort of society we ve been asked to meet he said
3549_8890_000035_000002	train-clean-360	 For us old folk it didn t matter but for Grace Giles should have known better 
3549_8890_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Meanwhile in the empty house from which the guests had just cleared out the subject of their discourse was walking from room to room surveying the general displacement of furniture with no ecstatic feeling rather the reverse indeed 
3549_8890_000036_000001	train-clean-360	At last he entered the bakehouse and found there Robert Creedle sitting over the embers also lost in contemplation 
none	none	Winterborne sat down beside him
3549_8890_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Well Robert you must be tired 
none	none	You d better get on to bed Ay ay Giles what do I call ye Maister I would say 
3549_8890_000038_000002	train-clean-360	But tis well to think the day IS done when tis done 
3549_8890_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Winterborne had abstractedly taken the poker and with a wrinkled forehead was ploughing abroad the wood embers on the broad hearth till it was like a vast scorching Sahara with red hot bowlders lying about everywhere 
3549_8890_000039_000001	train-clean-360	 Do you think it went off well Creedle he asked 
3549_8890_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 The victuals did that I know 
3549_8890_000040_000001	train-clean-360	And the drink did that I steadfastly believe from the holler sound of the barrels 
none	none	Good honest drink twere the headiest mead I ever brewed and the best wine that berries could rise to and the briskest Horner and Cleeves cider ever wrung down leaving out the spice and sperrits I put into it while that egg flip would ha passed through muslin so little curdled twere Twas good enough to make any king s heart merry ay to make his whole carcass smile 
3549_8890_000040_000003	train-clean-360	Still I don t deny I m afeared some things didn t go well with He and his Creedle nodded in a direction which signified where the Melburys lived 
3549_8890_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 I m afraid too that it was a failure there 
none	none	If so twere doomed to be so 
3549_8890_000042_000001	train-clean-360	Not but what that snail might as well have come upon anybody else s plate as hers 
3549_8890_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 What snail 
none	none	Well maister there was a little one upon the edge of her plate when I brought it out and so it must have been in her few leaves of wintergreen How the deuce did a snail get there That I don t know no more than the dead but there my gentleman was
3549_8890_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 But Robert of all places that was where he shouldn t have been 
3549_8890_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Well twas his native home come to that and where else could we expect him to be 
3549_8890_000048_000001	train-clean-360	I don t care who the man is snails and caterpillars always will lurk in close to the stump of cabbages in that tantalizing way 
3549_8890_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 He wasn t alive I suppose said Giles with a shudder on Grace s account 
none	none	Oh no He was well boiled I warrant him well boiled God forbid that a LIVE snail should be seed on any plate of victuals that s served by Robert Creedle But Lord there I don t mind em myself them small ones for they were born on cabbage and they ve lived on cabbage so they must be made of cabbage But she the close mouthed little lady she didn t say a word about it though twould have made good small conversation as to the nater of such creatures especially as wit ran short among us sometimes
3549_8890_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes tis all over murmured Giles to himself shaking his head over the glooming plain of embers and lining his forehead more than ever 
3549_8890_000051_000001	train-clean-360	 Do you know Robert he said that she s been accustomed to servants and everything superfine these many years 
3549_8890_000051_000002	train-clean-360	How then could she stand our ways 
none	none	Well all I can say is then that she ought to hob and nob elsewhere They shouldn t have schooled her so monstrous high or else bachelor men shouldn t give randys or if they do give em only to their own race Perhaps that s true said Winterborne rising and yawning a sigh CHAPTER XI Tis a pity a thousand pities her father kept saying next morning at breakfast Grace being still in her bedroom But how could he with any self respect obstruct Winterborne s suit at this stage and nullify a scheme he had labored to promote was indeed mechanically promoting at this moment A crisis was approaching mainly as a result of his contrivances and it would have to be met But here was the fact which could not be disguised since seeing what an immense change her last twelve months of absence had produced in his daughter after the heavy sum per annum that he had been spending for several years upon her education he was reluctant to let her marry Giles Winterborne indefinitely occupied as woodsman cider merchant apple farmer and what not even were she willing to marry him herself She will be his wife if you don t upset her notion that she s bound to accept him as an understood thing said missus Melbury Bless ye she ll soon shake down here in Hintock and be content with Giles s way of living which he ll improve with what money she ll have from you Tis the strangeness after her genteel life that makes her feel uncomfortable at first Why when I saw Hintock the first time I thought I never could like it But things gradually get familiar and stone floors seem not so very cold and hard and the hooting of the owls not so very dreadful and loneliness not so very lonely after a while Yes I believe ye That s just it I KNOW Grace will gradually sink down to our level again and catch our manners and way of speaking and feel a drowsy content in being Giles s wife But I can t bear the thought of dragging down to that old level as promising a piece of maidenhood as ever lived fit to ornament a palace wi that I ve taken so much trouble to lift up Fancy her white hands getting redder every day and her tongue losing its pretty up country curl in talking and her bounding walk becoming the regular Hintock shail and wamble She may shail but she ll never wamble replied his wife decisively When Grace came down stairs he complained of her lying in bed so late not so much moved by a particular objection to that form of indulgence as discomposed by these other reflections The corners of her pretty mouth dropped a little down You used to complain with justice when I was a girl she said But I am a woman now and can judge for myself But it is not that it is something else Instead of sitting down she went outside the door He was sorry The petulance that relatives show towards each other is in truth directed against that intangible Causality which has shaped the situation no less for the offenders than the offended but is too elusive to be discerned and cornered by poor humanity in irritated mood Melbury followed her She had rambled on to the paddock where the white frost lay and where starlings in flocks of twenties and thirties were walking about watched by a comfortable family of sparrows perched in a line along the string course of the chimney preening themselves in the rays of the sun Come in to breakfast my girl he said And as to Giles use your own mind Whatever pleases you will please me I am promised to him father and I cannot help thinking that in honor I ought to marry him whenever I do marry He had a strong suspicion that somewhere in the bottom of her heart there pulsed an old simple indigenous feeling favorable to Giles though it had become overlaid with implanted tastes But he would not distinctly express his views on the promise Very well he said But I hope I sha n t lose you yet Come in to breakfast What did you think of the inside of Hintock House the other day I liked it much Different from friend Winterborne s She said nothing but he who knew her was aware that she meant by her silence to reproach him with drawing cruel comparisons missus Charmond has asked you to come again when did you say She thought Tuesday but would send the day before to let me know if it suited her And with this subject upon their lips they entered to breakfast Tuesday came but no message from missus Charmond Nor was there any on Wednesday In brief a fortnight slipped by without a sign and it looked suspiciously as if missus Charmond were not going further in the direction of taking up Grace at present Her father reasoned thereon Immediately after his daughter s two indubitable successes with missus Charmond the interview in the wood and a visit to the House she had attended Winterborne s party No doubt the out and out joviality of that gathering had made it a topic in the neighborhood and that every one present as guests had been widely spoken of Grace with her exceptional qualities above all What then so natural as that missus Charmond should have heard the village news and become quite disappointed in her expectations of Grace at finding she kept such company Full of this post hoc argument mister Melbury overlooked the infinite throng of other possible reasons and unreasons for a woman changing her mind For instance while knowing that his Grace was attractive he quite forgot that missus Charmond had also great pretensions to beauty In his simple estimate an attractive woman attracted all around So it was settled in his mind that her sudden mingling with the villagers at the unlucky Winterborne s was the cause of her most grievous loss as he deemed it in the direction of Hintock House Tis a thousand pities he would repeat to himself I am ruining her for conscience sake It was one morning later on while these things were agitating his mind that curiously enough something darkened the window just as they finished breakfast Looking up they saw Giles in person mounted on horseback and straining his neck forward as he had been doing for some time to catch their attention through the window Grace had been the first to see him and involuntarily exclaimed There he is and a new horse On their faces as they regarded Giles were written their suspended thoughts and compound feelings concerning him could he have read them through those old panes But he saw nothing his features just now were for a wonder lit up with a red smile at some other idea So they rose from breakfast and went to the door Grace with an anxious wistful manner her father in a reverie missus Melbury placid and inquiring We have come out to look at your horse she said It could be seen that he was pleased at their attention and explained that he had ridden a mile or two to try the animal s paces I bought her he added with warmth so severely repressed as to seem indifference because she has been used to carry a lady Still mister Melbury did not brighten missus Melbury said And is she quiet Winterborne assured her that there was no doubt of it I took care of that She s five and twenty and very clever for her age Well get off and come in said Melbury brusquely and Giles dismounted accordingly This event was the concrete result of Winterborne s thoughts during the past week or two The want of success with his evening party he had accepted in as philosophic a mood as he was capable of but there had been enthusiasm enough left in him one day at Sherton Abbas market to purchase this old mare which had belonged to a neighboring parson with several daughters and was offered him to carry either a gentleman or a lady and to do odd jobs of carting and agriculture at a pinch This obliging quadruped seemed to furnish Giles with a means of reinstating himself in Melbury s good opinion as a man of considerateness by throwing out future possibilities to Grace The latter looked at him with intensified interest this morning in the mood which is altogether peculiar to woman s nature and which when reduced into plain words seems as impossible as the penetrability of matter that of entertaining a tender pity for the object of her own unnecessary coldness The imperturbable poise which marked Winterborne in general was enlivened now by a freshness and animation that set a brightness in his eye and on his cheek missus Melbury asked him to have some breakfast and he pleasurably replied that he would join them with his usual lack of tactical observation not perceiving that they had all finished the meal that the hour was inconveniently late and that the note piped by the kettle denoted it to be nearly empty so that fresh water had to be brought in trouble taken to make it boil and a general renovation of the table carried out Neither did he know so full was he of his tender ulterior object in buying that horse how many cups of tea he was gulping down one after another nor how the morning was slipping nor how he was keeping the family from dispersing about their duties Then he told throughout the humorous story of the horse s purchase looking particularly grim at some fixed object in the room a way he always looked when he narrated anything that amused him While he was still thinking of the scene he had described Grace rose and said I have to go and help my mother now mister Winterborne H m he ejaculated turning his eyes suddenly upon her She repeated her words with a slight blush of awkwardness whereupon Giles becoming suddenly conscious too conscious jumped up saying To be sure to be sure wished them quickly good morning and bolted out of the house Nevertheless he had upon the whole strengthened his position with her at least Time too was on his side for as her father saw with some regret already the homeliness of Hintock life was fast becoming effaced from her observation as a singularity just as the first strangeness of a face from which we have for years been separated insensibly passes off with renewed intercourse and tones itself down into simple identity with the lineaments of the past Thus mister Melbury went out of the house still unreconciled to the sacrifice of the gem he had been at such pains in mounting He fain could hope in the secret nether chamber of his mind that something would happen before the balance of her feeling had quite turned in Winterborne s favor to relieve his conscience and preserve her on her elevated plane He could not forget that missus Charmond had apparently abandoned all interest in his daughter as suddenly as she had conceived it and was as firmly convinced as ever that the comradeship which Grace had shown with Giles and his crew by attending his party had been the cause Matters lingered on thus And then as a hoop by gentle knocks on this side and on that is made to travel in specific directions the little touches of circumstance in the life of this young girl shaped the curves of her career CHAPTER XII It was a day of rather bright weather for the season 
4344-8892-0000	train-other-500	Miss Melbury went out for a morning walk and her ever regardful father having an hour s leisure offered to walk with her The breeze was fresh and quite steady filtering itself through the denuded mass of twigs without swaying them
4344-8892-0001	train-other-500	but making the point of each ivy leaf on the trunks scratch its underlying neighbor restlessly Grace s lips sucked in this native air of hers like milk They soon reached a place where the wood ran down into a corner
4344-8892-0002	train-other-500	and went outside it towards comparatively open ground Having looked round about they were intending to re enter the copse when a fox quietly emerged with a dragging brush trotted past them tamely as a domestic cat and disappeared amid some dead fern
4344-8892-0003	train-other-500	They walked on her father merely observing after watching the animal They are hunting somewhere near Farther up they saw in the mid distance the hounds running hither and thither as if there were little or no scent that day
none	none	 Soon divers members of the hunt appeared on the scene and it was evident from their movements that the chase had been stultified by general puzzle headedness 
4344-8892-0004	train-other-500	as to the whereabouts of the intended victim In a minute
none	none	 a farmer rode up to the two pedestrians panting with acteonic excitement 
4344-8892-0005	train-other-500	and Grace being a few steps in advance he addressed her asking if she had seen the fox
none	none	 Yes said she We saw him some time ago just out there 
4344-8892-0006	train-other-500	Did you cry Halloo
none	none	 We said nothing Then why the d didn t you 
4344-8892-0007	train-other-500	or get the old buffer to do it for you said the man as he cantered away She looked rather disconcerted at this reply and observing her father s face saw that it was quite red He ought not to have spoken to ye like that said the old man in the tone of one whose heart was bruised
none	none	 though it was not by the epithet applied to himself 
4344-8892-0008	train-other-500	And he wouldn t if he had been a gentleman
none	none	 Twas not the language to use to a woman of any niceness 
4344-8892-0009	train-other-500	You so well read and cultivated
none	none	 how could he expect ye to know what tom boy field folk are in the habit of doing If so be you had just come from trimming swedes or mangolds 
4344-8892-0010	train-other-500	joking with the rough work folk and all that I could have stood it
none	none	 But hasn t it cost me near a hundred a year to lift you out of all that so as to show an example to the neighborhood of what a woman can be 
4344-8892-0011	train-other-500	Grace shall I tell you the secret of it
none	none	 Twas because I was in your company 
4344-8892-0012	train-other-500	If a black coated squire or pa son had been walking with you instead of me
none	none	 he wouldn t have spoken so No no father there s nothing in you rough or ill mannered 
4344-8892-0013	train-other-500	I tell you it is that I ve noticed and I ve noticed it many times that a woman takes her color from the man she s walking with The woman who looks an unquestionable lady when she s with a polished up fellow looks a mere tawdry imitation article when she s hobbing and nobbing with a homely blade
none	none	 You sha n t be treated like that for long or at least your children sha n t 
4344-8892-0014	train-other-500	You shall have somebody to walk with you who looks more of a dandy than I please God you shall But my dear father she said much distressed I don t mind at all I don t wish for more honor than I already have
none	none	 A perplexing and ticklish possession is a daughter 
4344-8892-0015	train-other-500	according to Menander or some old Greek poet and to nobody was one ever more so than to Melbury by reason of her very dearness to him As for Grace she began to feel troubled
4344-8892-0016	train-other-500	she did not perhaps wish there and then to unambitiously devote her life to Giles Winterborne
none	none	 but she was conscious of more and more uneasiness at the possibility of being the social hope of the family You would like to have more honor if it pleases me asked her father in continuation of the subject 
4344-8892-0017	train-other-500	Despite her feeling she assented to this His reasoning had not been without its weight upon her Grace he said just before they had reached the house if it costs me my life you shall marry well
4344-8892-0018	train-other-500	To day has shown me that whatever a young woman s niceness she stands for nothing alone You shall marry well He breathed heavily and his breathing was caught up by the breeze which seemed to sigh a soft remonstrance She looked calmly at him
none	none	 And how about mister Winterborne she asked 
4344-8892-0019	train-other-500	I mention it father not as a matter of sentiment but as a question of keeping faith The timber merchant s eyes fell for a moment I don t know I don t know he said Tis a trying strait Well
4344-8892-0020	train-other-500	well there s no hurry We ll wait and see how he gets on
none	none	 That evening he called her into his room a snug little apartment behind the large parlor 
4344-8892-0021	train-other-500	It had at one time been part of the bakehouse with the ordinary oval brick oven in the wall but mister Melbury in turning it into an office had built into the cavity an iron safe which he used for holding his private papers
4344-8892-0022	train-other-500	The door of the safe was now open and his keys were hanging from it Sit down Grace and keep me company he said You may amuse yourself by looking over these He threw out a heap of papers before her What are they she asked
4344-8892-0023	train-other-500	Securities of various sorts He unfolded them one by one Papers worth so much money each Now
none	none	 here s a lot of turnpike bonds for one thing Would you think that each of these pieces of paper is worth two hundred pounds 
4344-8892-0024	train-other-500	No indeed if you didn t say so Tis so then Now here are papers of another sort They are for different sums in the three per cents Now these are Port Breedy Harbor bonds We have a great stake in that harbor you know because I send off timber there
none	none	 Open the rest at your pleasure They ll interest ye Yes I will some day said she rising 
4344-8892-0025	train-other-500	Nonsense open them now You ought to learn a little of such matters A young lady of education should not be ignorant of money affairs altogether Suppose you should be left a widow some day with your husband s title deeds and investments thrown upon your hands
none	none	 Don t say that father title deeds it sounds so vain 
4344-8892-0026	train-other-500	It does not Come to that I have title deeds myself There that piece of parchment represents houses in Sherton Abbas Yes but She hesitated looked at the fire and went on in a low voice
4344-8892-0027	train-other-500	If what has been arranged about me should come to anything my sphere will be quite a middling one Your sphere ought not to be middling he exclaimed not in passion but in earnest conviction
none	none	 You said you never felt more at home more in your element anywhere than you did that afternoon with missus Charmond 
4344-8892-0028	train-other-500	when she showed you her house and all her knick knacks and made you stay to tea so nicely in her drawing room surely you did Yes I did say so admitted Grace Was it true Yes I felt so at the time
4344-8892-0029	train-other-500	The feeling is less strong now perhaps Ah Now though you don t see it your feeling at the time was the right one because your mind and body were just in full and fresh cultivation so that going there with her was like meeting like
none	none	 Since then you ve been biding with us and have fallen back a little 
4344-8892-0030	train-other-500	and so you don t feel your place so strongly
none	none	 Now do as I tell ye and look over these papers and see what you ll be worth some day For they ll all be yours you know who have I got to leave em to but you 
4344-8892-0031	train-other-500	Perhaps when your education is backed up by what these papers represent
none	none	 and that backed up by another such a set and their owner men such as that fellow was this morning may think you a little more than a buffer s girl So she did as commanded and opened each of the folded representatives of hard cash that her father put before her To sow in her heart cravings for social position was obviously his strong desire 
4344-8892-0032	train-other-500	though in direct antagonism to a better feeling which had hitherto prevailed with him and had indeed only succumbed that morning during the ramble She wished that she was not his worldly hope the responsibility of such a position was too great
4344-8892-0033	train-other-500	She had made it for herself mainly by her appearance and attractive behavior to him since her return If I had only come home in a shabby dress and tried to speak roughly this might not have happened she thought
4344-8892-0034	train-other-500	She deplored less the fact than the sad possibilities that might lie hidden therein Her father then insisted upon her looking over his checkbook and reading the counterfoils This also she obediently did and at last came to two or three
4344-8892-0035	train-other-500	which had been drawn to defray some of the late expenses of her clothes board and education I too cost a good deal like the horses and wagons and corn
none	none	 she said looking up sorrily I didn t want you to look at those I merely meant to give you an idea of my investment transactions But if you do cost as much as they never mind 
4344-8892-0036	train-other-500	You ll yield a better return Don t think of me like that she begged A mere chattel
none	none	 A what Oh a dictionary word Well as that s in your line I don t forbid it 
4344-8892-0037	train-other-500	even if it tells against me he said good humoredly And he looked her proudly up and down
none	none	 A few minutes later Grammer Oliver came to tell them that supper was ready 
4344-8892-0038	train-other-500	and in giving the information she added incidentally So we shall soon lose the mistress of Hintock House for some time I hear
none	none	 Maister Melbury 
4344-8892-0039	train-other-500	Yes she s going off to foreign parts to morrow for the rest of the winter months
none	none	 and be chok d if I don t wish I could do the same for my wynd pipe is furred like a flue 
4344-8892-0040	train-other-500	When the old woman had left the room Melbury turned to his daughter and said So Grace you ve lost your new friend
none	none	 and your chance of keeping her company and writing her travels is quite gone from ye 
4344-8892-0041	train-other-500	Grace said nothing Now
none	none	 he went on emphatically 
4344-8892-0042	train-other-500	tis Winterborne s affair has done this Oh yes tis So let me say one word
none	none	 Promise me that you will not meet him again without my knowledge 
4344-8892-0043	train-other-500	I never do meet him father
none	none	 either without your knowledge or with it 
4344-8892-0044	train-other-500	So much the better I don t like the look of this at all And I say it not out of harshness to him poor fellow but out of tenderness to you
none	none	 For how could a woman brought up delicately as you have been 
4344-8892-0045	train-other-500	bear the roughness of a life with him She sighed
none	none	 it was a sigh of sympathy with Giles complicated by a sense of the intractability of circumstances 
4344-8892-0046	train-other-500	At that same hour and almost at that same minute there was a conversation about Winterborne in progress in the village street
none	none	 opposite mister Melbury s gates where Timothy Tangs the elder and Robert Creedle had accidentally met The sawyer was asking Creedle if he had heard what was all over the parish the skin of his face being drawn two ways on the matter towards brightness in respect of it as news and towards concern in respect of it as circumstance Why that poor little lonesome thing Marty South is likely to lose her father He was almost well but is much worse again A man all skin and grief he ever were and if he leave Little Hintock for a better land won t it make some difference to your Maister Winterborne neighbor Creedle Can I be a prophet in Israel said Creedle Won t it I was only shaping of such a thing yesterday in my poor long seeing way and all the work of the house upon my one shoulders You know what it means 
4344-8892-0047	train-other-500	It is upon John South s life that all mister Winterborne s houses hang
none	none	 If so be South die and so make his decease 
4344-8892-0048	train-other-500	thereupon the law is that the houses fall without the least chance of absolution into HER hands at the House
none	none	 I told him so but the words of the faithful be only as wind CHAPTER XIII The news was true The life the one fragile life that had been used as a measuring tape of time by law was in danger of being frayed away It was the last of a group of lives which had served this purpose at the end of whose breathings the small homestead occupied by South himself the larger one of Giles Winterborne and half a dozen others that had been in the possession of various Hintock village families for the previous hundred years and were now Winterborne s would fall in and become part of the encompassing estate Yet a short two months earlier Marty s father aged fifty five years though something of a fidgety anxious being would have been looked on as a man whose existence was so far removed from hazardous as any in the parish and as bidding fair to be prolonged for another quarter of a century Winterborne walked up and down his garden next day thinking of the contingency The sense that the paths he was pacing the cabbage plots the apple trees his dwelling cider cellar wring house stables and weathercock were all slipping away over his head and beneath his feet as if they were painted on a magic lantern slide was curious In spite of John South s late indisposition he had not anticipated danger To inquire concerning his health had been to show less sympathy than to remain silent considering the material interest he possessed in the woodman s life and he had accordingly made a point of avoiding Marty s house While he was here in the garden somebody came to fetch him It was Marty herself and she showed her distress by her unconsciousness of a cropped poll Father is still so much troubled in his mind about that tree she said You know the tree I mean mister Winterborne the tall one in front of the house that he thinks will blow down and kill us Can you come and see if you can persuade him out of his notion I can do nothing He accompanied her to the cottage and she conducted him upstairs John South was pillowed up in a chair between the bed and the window exactly opposite the latter towards which his face was turned Ah neighbor Winterborne he said I wouldn t have minded if my life had only been my own to lose I don t vallie it in much of itself and can let it go if tis required of me But to think what tis worth to you a young man rising in life that do trouble me It seems a trick of dishonesty towards ye to go off at fifty five I could bear up I know I could if it were not for the tree yes the tree tis that s killing me There he stands threatening my life every minute that the wind do blow He ll come down upon us and squat us dead and what will ye do when the life on your property is taken away Never you mind me that s of no consequence said Giles Think of yourself alone He looked out of the window in the direction of the woodman s gaze The tree was a tall elm familiar to him from childhood which stood at a distance of two thirds its own height from the front of South s dwelling Whenever the wind blew as it did now the tree rocked naturally enough and the sight of its motion and sound of its sighs had gradually bred the terrifying illusion in the woodman s mind that it would descend and kill him Thus he would sit all day in spite of persuasion watching its every sway and listening to the melancholy Gregorian melodies which the air wrung out of it This fear it apparently was rather than any organic disease which was eating away the health of John South As the tree waved South waved his head making it his flugel man with abject obedience Ah when it was quite a small tree he said and I was a little boy I thought one day of chopping it off with my hook to make a clothes line prop with But I put off doing it and then I again thought that I would but I forgot it and didn t And at last it got too big and now tis my enemy and will be the death o me Little did I think when I let that sapling stay that a time would come when it would torment me and dash me into my grave No no said Winterborne and Marty soothingly But they thought it possible that it might hasten him into his grave though in another way than by falling I tell you what added Winterborne I ll climb up this afternoon and shroud off the lower boughs and then it won t be so heavy and the wind won t affect it so She won t allow it a strange woman come from nobody knows where she won t have it done You mean missus Charmond Oh she doesn t know there s such a tree on her estate Besides shrouding is not felling and I ll risk that much He went out and when afternoon came he returned took a billhook from the woodman s shed and with a ladder climbed into the lower part of the tree where he began lopping off shrouding as they called it at Hintock the lowest boughs Each of these quivered under his attack bent cracked and fell into the hedge Having cut away the lowest tier he stepped off the ladder climbed a few steps higher and attacked those at the next level Thus he ascended with the progress of his work far above the top of the ladder cutting away his perches as he went and leaving nothing but a bare stem below him The work was troublesome for the tree was large The afternoon wore on turning dark and misty about four o clock From time to time Giles cast his eyes across towards the bedroom window of South where by the flickering fire in the chamber he could see the old man watching him sitting motionless with a hand upon each arm of the chair Beside him sat Marty also straining her eyes towards the skyey field of his operations A curious question suddenly occurred to Winterborne and he stopped his chopping He was operating on another person s property to prolong the years of a lease by whose termination that person would considerably benefit In that aspect of the case he doubted if he ought to go on On the other hand he was working to save a man s life and this seemed to empower him to adopt arbitrary measures The wind had died down to a calm and while he was weighing the circumstances he saw coming along the road through the increasing mist a figure which indistinct as it was he knew well It was Grace Melbury on her way out from the house probably for a short evening walk before dark He arranged himself for a greeting from her since she could hardly avoid passing immediately beneath the tree But Grace though she looked up and saw him was just at that time too full of the words of her father to give him any encouragement The years long regard that she had had for him was not kindled by her return into a flame of sufficient brilliancy to make her rebellious Thinking that she might not see him he cried Miss Melbury here I am She looked up again She was near enough to see the expression of his face and the nails in his soles silver bright with constant walking But she did not reply and dropping her glance again went on Winterborne s face grew strange he mused and proceeded automatically with his work Grace meanwhile had not gone far She had reached a gate whereon she had leaned sadly and whispered to herself What shall I do A sudden fog came on and she curtailed her walk passing under the tree again on her return Again he addressed her Grace he said when she was close to the trunk speak to me She shook her head without stopping and went on to a little distance where she stood observing him from behind the hedge Her coldness had been kindly meant If it was to be done she had said to herself it should be begun at once While she stood out of observation Giles seemed to recognize her meaning with a sudden start he worked on climbing higher and cutting himself off more and more from all intercourse with the sublunary world At last he had worked himself so high up the elm and the mist had so thickened that he could only just be discerned as a dark gray spot on the light gray sky he would have been altogether out of notice but for the stroke of his billhook and the flight of a bough downward and its crash upon the hedge at intervals It was not to be done thus after all plainness and candor were best She went back a third time he did not see her now and she lingeringly gazed up at his unconscious figure loath to put an end to any kind of hope that might live on in him still Giles mister Winterborne she said He was so high amid the fog that he did not hear mister Winterborne she cried again and this time he stopped looked down and replied My silence just now was not accident she said in an unequal voice My father says it is best not to think too much of that engagement or understanding between us that you know of I too think that upon the whole he is right But we are friends you know Giles and almost relations Very well he answered as if without surprise in a voice which barely reached down the tree I have nothing to say in objection I cannot say anything till I ve thought a while She added with emotion in her tone For myself I would have married you some day I think But I give way for I see it would be unwise He made no reply but sat back upon a bough placed his elbow in a fork and rested his head upon his hand Thus he remained till the fog and the night had completely enclosed him from her view Grace heaved a divided sigh with a tense pause between and moved onward her heart feeling uncomfortably big and heavy and her eyes wet Had Giles instead of remaining still immediately come down from the tree to her would she have continued in that filial acquiescent frame of mind which she had announced to him as final If it be true as women themselves have declared that one of their sex is never so much inclined to throw in her lot with a man for good and all as five minutes after she has told him such a thing cannot be the probabilities are that something might have been done by the appearance of Winterborne on the ground beside Grace But he continued motionless and silent in that gloomy Niflheim or fog land which involved him and she proceeded on her way The spot seemed now to be quite deserted The light from South s window made rays on the fog but did not reach the tree A quarter of an hour passed and all was blackness overhead Giles had not yet come down Then the tree seemed to shiver then to heave a sigh a movement was audible and Winterborne dropped almost noiselessly to the ground He had thought the matter out and having returned the ladder and billhook to their places pursued his way homeward He would not allow this incident to affect his outer conduct any more than the danger to his leaseholds had done and went to bed as usual Two simultaneous troubles do not always make a double trouble and thus it came to pass that Giles s practical anxiety about his houses which would have been enough to keep him awake half the night at any other time was displaced and not reinforced by his sentimental trouble about Grace Melbury This severance was in truth more like a burial of her than a rupture with her but he did not realize so much at present even when he arose in the morning he felt quite moody and stern as yet the second note in the gamut of such emotions a tender regret for his loss had not made itself heard A load of oak timber was to be sent away that morning to a builder whose works were in a town many miles off The proud trunks were taken up from the silent spot which had known them through the buddings and sheddings of their growth for the foregoing hundred years chained down like slaves to a heavy timber carriage with enormous red wheels and four of the most powerful of Melbury s horses were harnessed in front to draw them The horses wore their bells that day There were sixteen to the team carried on a frame above each animal s shoulders and tuned to scale so as to form two octaves running from the highest note on the right or off side of the leader to the lowest on the left or near side of the shaft horse Melbury was among the last to retain horse bells in that neighborhood for living at Little Hintock where the lanes yet remained as narrow as before the days of turnpike roads these sound signals were still as useful to him and his neighbors as they had ever been in former times Much backing was saved in the course of a year by the warning notes they cast ahead moreover the tones of all the teams in the district being known to the carters of each they could tell a long way off on a dark night whether they were about to encounter friends or strangers The fog of the previous evening still lingered so heavily over the woods that the morning could not penetrate the trees till long after its time The load being a ponderous one the lane crooked and the air so thick Winterborne set out as he often did to accompany the team as far as the corner where it would turn into a wider road So they rumbled on shaking the foundations of the roadside cottages by the weight of their progress the sixteen bells chiming harmoniously over all till they had risen out of the valley and were descending towards the more open route the sparks rising from their creaking skid and nearly setting fire to the dead leaves alongside Then occurred one of the very incidents against which the bells were an endeavor to guard Suddenly there beamed into their eyes quite close to them the two lamps of a carriage shorn of rays by the fog Its approach had been quite unheard by reason of their own noise The carriage was a covered one while behind it could be discerned another vehicle laden with luggage Winterborne went to the head of the team and heard the coachman telling the carter that he must turn back The carter declared that this was impossible You can turn if you unhitch your string horses said the coachman It is much easier for you to turn than for us said Winterborne We ve five tons of timber on these wheels if we ve an ounce But I ve another carriage with luggage at my back Winterborne admitted the strength of the argument But even with that he said you can back better than we And you ought to for you could hear our bells half a mile off And you could see our lights We couldn t because of the fog Well our time s precious said the coachman haughtily You are only going to some trumpery little village or other in the neighborhood while we are going straight to Italy Driving all the way I suppose said Winterborne sarcastically The argument continued in these terms till a voice from the interior of the carriage inquired what was the matter It was a lady s She was briefly informed of the timber people s obstinacy and then Giles could hear her telling the footman to direct the timber people to turn their horses heads The message was brought and Winterborne sent the bearer back to say that he begged the lady s pardon but that he could not do as she requested that though he would not assert it to be impossible it was impossible by comparison with the slight difficulty to her party to back their light carriages As fate would have it the incident with Grace Melbury on the previous day made Giles less gentle than he might otherwise have shown himself his confidence in the sex being rudely shaken In fine nothing could move him and the carriages were compelled to back till they reached one of the sidings or turnouts constructed in the bank for the purpose Then the team came on ponderously and the clanging of its sixteen bells as it passed the discomfited carriages tilted up against the bank lent a particularly triumphant tone to the team s progress a tone which in point of fact did not at all attach to its conductor s feelings Giles walked behind the timber and just as he had got past the yet stationary carriages he heard a soft voice say Who is that rude man Not Melbury The sex of the speaker was so prominent in the voice that Winterborne felt a pang of regret No ma am A younger man in a smaller way of business in Little Hintock Winterborne is his name Thus they parted company Why mister Winterborne said the wagoner when they were out of hearing that was She missus Charmond Who d ha thought it What in the world can a woman that does nothing be cock watching out here at this time o day for Oh going to Italy yes to be sure I heard she was going abroad she can t endure the winter here Winterborne was vexed at the incident the more so that he knew mister Melbury in his adoration of Hintock House would be the first to blame him if it became known But saying no more he accompanied the load to the end of the lane and then turned back with an intention to call at South s to learn the result of the experiment of the preceding evening It chanced that a few minutes before this time Grace Melbury who now rose soon enough to breakfast with her father in spite of the unwontedness of the hour had been commissioned by him to make the same inquiry at South s Marty had been standing at the door when Miss Melbury arrived Almost before the latter had spoken missus Charmond s carriages released from the obstruction up the lane came bowling along and the two girls turned to regard the spectacle missus Charmond did not see them but there was sufficient light for them to discern her outline between the carriage windows A noticeable feature in her tournure was a magnificent mass of braided locks How well she looks this morning said Grace forgetting missus Charmond s slight in her generous admiration Her hair so becomes her worn that way I have never seen any more beautiful Nor have I miss said Marty dryly unconsciously stroking her crown Grace watched the carriages with lingering regret till they were out of sight She then learned of Marty that South was no better Before she had come away Winterborne approached the house but seeing that one of the two girls standing on the door step was Grace he suddenly turned back again and sought the shelter of his own home till she should have gone away CHAPTER XIV 
3845-8894-0000	train-other-500	The encounter with the carriages having sprung upon Winterborne s mind the image of missus Charmond his thoughts by a natural channel went from her to the fact that several cottages and other houses in the two Hintocks now his own would fall into her possession in the event of South s death
3845-8894-0001	train-other-500	He marvelled what people could have been thinking about in the past to invent such precarious tenures as these still more what could have induced his ancestors at Hintock and other village people to exchange their old copyholds for life leases
3845-8894-0002	train-other-500	But having naturally succeeded to these properties through his father
none	none	 he had done his best to keep them in order though he was much struck with his father s negligence in not insuring South s life 
3845-8894-0003	train-other-500	After breakfast still musing on the circumstances he went upstairs turned over his bed and drew out a flat canvas bag which lay between the mattress and the sacking In this he kept his leases which had remained there unopened ever since his father s death
3845-8894-0004	train-other-500	It was the usual hiding place among rural lifeholders for such documents Winterborne sat down on the bed and looked them over They were ordinary leases for three lives which a member of the South family some fifty years before this time
none	none	 had accepted of the lord of the manor in lieu of certain copyholds and other rights in consideration of having the dilapidated houses rebuilt by said lord They had come into his father s possession chiefly through his mother who was a South Pinned to the parchment of one of the indentures was a letter which Winterborne had never seen before It bore a remote date the handwriting being that of some solicitor or agent and the signature the landholder s 
3845-8894-0005	train-other-500	It was to the effect that at any time before the last of the stated lives should drop mister Giles Winterborne senior or his representative
none	none	 should have the privilege of adding his own and his son s life to the life remaining on payment of a merely nominal sum the concession being in consequence of the elder Winterborne s consent to demolish one of the houses and relinquish its site which stood at an awkward corner of the lane and impeded the way 
3845-8894-0006	train-other-500	The house had been pulled down years before
none	none	 Why Giles s father had not taken advantage of his privilege to insert his own and his son s lives it was impossible to say 
3845-8894-0007	train-other-500	The likelihood was that death alone had hindered him in the execution of his project
none	none	 as it surely was the elder Winterborne having been a 
3845-8894-0008	train-other-500	man who took much pleasure in dealing with house property in his small way Since one of the Souths still survived there was not much doubt that Giles could do what his father had left undone as far as his own life was concerned This possibility cheered him much
3845-8894-0009	train-other-500	for by those houses hung many things Melbury s doubt of the young man s fitness to be the husband of Grace had been based not a little on the precariousness of his holdings in Little and Great Hintock
none	none	 He resolved to attend to the business at once 
3845-8894-0010	train-other-500	the fine for renewal being a sum that he could easily muster His scheme however
none	none	 could not be carried out in a day 
3845-8894-0011	train-other-500	and meanwhile he would run up to South s
none	none	 as he had intended to do to learn the result of the experiment with the tree 
3845-8894-0012	train-other-500	Marty met him at the door Well Marty he said
none	none	 and was surprised to read in her face that the case was not so hopeful as he had imagined 
3845-8894-0013	train-other-500	I am sorry for your labor she said It is all lost He says the tree seems taller than ever Winterborne looked round at it Taller the tree certainly did seem the gauntness of its now naked stem being more marked than before
3845-8894-0014	train-other-500	It quite terrified him when he first saw what you had done to it this morning she added
none	none	 He declares it will come down upon us and cleave us 
3845-8894-0015	train-other-500	like the sword of the Lord and of Gideon Well can I do anything else asked he The doctor says the tree ought to be cut down Oh
none	none	 you ve had the doctor 
3845-8894-0016	train-other-500	I didn t send for him missus Charmond before she left heard that father was ill and told him to attend him at her expense That was very good of her And he says it ought to be cut down
none	none	 We mustn t cut it down without her knowledge I suppose He went up stairs There the old man sat staring at the now gaunt tree as if his gaze were frozen on to its trunk 
3845-8894-0017	train-other-500	Unluckily the tree waved afresh by this time a wind having sprung up and blown the fog away and his eyes turned with its wavings They heard footsteps a man s but of a lighter type than usual There is Doctor Fitzpiers again she said and descended
3845-8894-0018	train-other-500	Presently his tread was heard on the naked stairs mister Fitzpiers entered the sick chamber just as a doctor is more or less wont to do on such occasions and pre eminently when the room is that of a humble cottager looking round towards the patient with that preoccupied gaze
none	none	 which so plainly reveals that he has wellnigh forgotten all about the case and the whole circumstances since he dismissed them from his mind 
3845-8894-0019	train-other-500	at his last exit from the same apartment He nodded to Winterborne
none	none	 with whom he was already a little acquainted 
3845-8894-0020	train-other-500	recalled the case to his thoughts and went leisurely on to where South sat Fitzpiers was on the whole a finely formed handsome man His eyes were dark and impressive and beamed with the light either of energy
none	none	 or of susceptivity it was difficult to say which it might have been a little of both 
3845-8894-0021	train-other-500	That quick glittering practical eye sharp for the surface of things and for nothing beneath it he had not But whether his apparent depth of vision was real or only an artistic accident of his corporeal moulding nothing but his deeds could reveal
3845-8894-0022	train-other-500	His face was rather soft than stern charming than grand pale than flushed his nose
none	none	 if a sketch of his features be de rigueur for a person of his pretensions was artistically beautiful enough to have been worth doing in marble by any sculptor not over busy 
3845-8894-0023	train-other-500	and was hence devoid of those knotty irregularities which often mean power while the double cyma or classical curve of his mouth was not without a looseness in its close Nevertheless either from his readily appreciative mien
none	none	 or his reflective manner or the instinct towards profound things which was said to possess him his presence bespoke the philosopher rather than the dandy or macaroni an effect which was helped by the absence of trinkets or other trivialities from his attire though this was more finished and up to date than is usually the case among rural practitioners 
3845-8894-0024	train-other-500	Strict people of the highly respectable class knowing a little about him by report might have said that he seemed likely to err rather in the possession of too many ideas than too few to be a dreamy ist of some sort or too deeply steeped in some false kind of ism
none	none	 However this may be it will be seen that he was undoubtedly a somewhat rare kind of gentleman and doctor to have descended 
3845-8894-0025	train-other-500	as from the clouds upon Little Hintock This is an extraordinary case he said at last to Winterborne after examining South by conversation look and touch and learning that the craze about the elm was stronger than ever Come down stairs and I ll tell you what I think
3845-8894-0026	train-other-500	They accordingly descended and the doctor continued The tree must be cut down or I won t answer for his life Tis missus Charmond s tree and I suppose we must get permission said Giles
3845-8894-0027	train-other-500	If so as she is gone away I must speak to her agent Oh never mind whose tree it is
none	none	 what s a tree beside a life Cut it down I have not the honor of knowing missus Charmond as yet but I am disposed to risk that much with her 
3845-8894-0028	train-other-500	Tis timber rejoined Giles more scrupulous than he would have been had not his own interests stood so closely involved
none	none	 They ll never fell a stick about here without it being marked first either by her or the agent 
3845-8894-0029	train-other-500	Then we ll inaugurate a new era forthwith
none	none	 How long has he complained of the tree asked the doctor of Marty 
3845-8894-0030	train-other-500	Weeks and weeks sir The shape of it seems to haunt him like an evil spirit
none	none	 He says that it is exactly his own age that it has got human sense and sprouted up when he was born on purpose to rule him and keep him as its slave 
3845-8894-0031	train-other-500	Others have been like it afore in Hintock They could hear South s voice up stairs Oh he s rocking this way he must come
none	none	 And then my poor life that s worth houses upon houses will be squashed out o me Oh oh That s how he goes on she added And he ll never look anywhere else but out of the window and scarcely have the curtains drawn 
3845-8894-0032	train-other-500	Down with it then and hang missus Charmond said mister Fitzpiers
none	none	 The best plan will be to wait till the evening when it is dark 
3845-8894-0033	train-other-500	or early in the morning before he is awake so that he doesn t see it fall for that would terrify him worse than ever Keep the blind down till I come and then I ll assure him and show him that his trouble is over The doctor then departed and they waited till the evening
3845-8894-0034	train-other-500	When it was dusk and the curtains drawn Winterborne directed a couple of woodmen to bring a crosscut saw and the tall threatening tree was soon nearly off at its base He would not fell it completely then on account of the possible crash but next morning before South was awake
3845-8894-0035	train-other-500	they went and lowered it cautiously in a direction away from the cottage It was a business difficult to do quite silently but it was done at last and the elm of the same birth year as the woodman s lay stretched upon the ground The weakest idler that passed could now set foot on marks formerly made
none	none	 in the upper forks by the shoes of adventurous climbers only once inaccessible nests could be examined microscopically and on swaying extremities where birds alone had perched the by standers sat down As soon as it was broad daylight the doctor came and Winterborne entered the house with him Marty said that her father was wrapped up and ready as usual to be put into his chair 
3845-8894-0036	train-other-500	They ascended the stairs and soon seated him
none	none	 He began at once to complain of the tree and the danger to his life and Winterborne s house property in consequence The doctor signalled to Giles who went and drew back the printed cotton curtains 
3845-8894-0037	train-other-500	Tis gone see said mister Fitzpiers As soon as the old man saw the vacant patch of sky in place of the branched column so familiar to his gaze he sprang up speechless his eyes rose from their hollows till the whites showed all round he fell back and a bluish whiteness overspread him
none	none	 Greatly alarmed they put him on the bed 
3845-8894-0038	train-other-500	As soon as he came a little out of his fit he gasped Oh it is gone where where His whole system seemed paralyzed by amazement
none	none	 They were thunder struck at the result of the experiment and did all they could Nothing seemed to avail Giles and Fitzpiers went and came but uselessly He lingered through the day and died that evening as the sun went down D d if my remedy hasn t killed him murmured the doctor CHAPTER XV 
4019-8895-0000	train-other-500	When Melbury heard what had happened he seemed much moved and walked thoughtfully about the premises
none	none	 On South s own account he was genuinely sorry and on Winterborne s he was the more grieved in that this catastrophe had so closely followed the somewhat harsh dismissal of Giles 
4019-8895-0001	train-other-500	as the betrothed of his daughter He was quite angry with circumstances for so heedlessly inflicting on Giles a second trouble
none	none	 when the needful one inflicted by himself was all that the proper order of events demanded I told Giles s father when he came into those houses not to spend too much money on lifehold property held neither for his own life nor his son s he exclaimed 
4019-8895-0002	train-other-500	But he wouldn t listen to me And now Giles has to suffer for it Poor Giles murmured Grace
none	none	 Now Grace between us two it is very very remarkable It is almost as if I had foreseen this and I am thankful for your escape though I am sincerely sorry for Giles 
4019-8895-0003	train-other-500	Had we not dismissed him already we could hardly have found it in our hearts to dismiss him now So I say be thankful I ll do all I can for him as a friend but as a pretender to the position of my son in law that can never be thought of more
4019-8895-0004	train-other-500	And yet at that very moment the impracticability to which poor Winterborne s suit had been reduced was touching Grace s heart to a warmer sentiment on his behalf than she had felt for years concerning him
4019-8895-0005	train-other-500	He meanwhile was sitting down alone in the old familiar house which had ceased to be his taking a calm if somewhat dismal survey of affairs The pendulum of the clock bumped every now and then against one side of the case in which it swung
4019-8895-0006	train-other-500	as the muffled drum to his worldly march
none	none	 Looking out of the window he could perceive that a paralysis had come over Creedle s occupation of manuring the garden 
4019-8895-0007	train-other-500	owing obviously to a conviction that they might not be living there long enough to profit by next season s crop He looked at the leases again and the letter attached
4019-8895-0008	train-other-500	There was no doubt that he had lost his houses by an accident which might easily have been circumvented if he had known the true conditions of his holding The time for performance had now lapsed in strict law but might not the intention be considered by the landholder when she became aware of the circumstances
4019-8895-0009	train-other-500	and his moral right to retain the holdings for the term of his life be conceded His heart sank within him when he perceived that despite all the legal reciprocities and safeguards prepared and written the upshot of the matter amounted to this
none	none	 that it depended upon the mere caprice good or ill of the woman he had met the day before in such an unfortunate way 
4019-8895-0010	train-other-500	whether he was to possess his houses for life or no While he was sitting and thinking a step came to the door and Melbury appeared looking very sorry for his position
4019-8895-0011	train-other-500	Winterborne welcomed him by a word and a look and went on with his examination of the parchments His visitor sat down
none	none	 Giles he said this is very awkward and I am sorry for it What are you going to do Giles informed him of the real state of affairs and how barely he had missed availing himself of his chance of renewal What a misfortune Why was this neglected Well the best thing you can do is to write and tell her all about it and 
4019-8895-0012	train-other-500	throw yourself upon her generosity
none	none	 I would rather not murmured Giles 
4019-8895-0013	train-other-500	But you must said Melbury In short
none	none	 he argued so cogently that Giles allowed himself to be persuaded and the letter to missus Charmond was written 
4019-8895-0014	train-other-500	and sent to Hintock House whence
none	none	 as he knew it would at once be forwarded to her 
4019-8895-0015	train-other-500	Melbury feeling that he had done so good an action in coming as almost to extenuate his previous arbitrary conduct to nothing went home and Giles was left alone to the suspense of waiting for a reply from the divinity who shaped the ends of the Hintock population
4019-8895-0016	train-other-500	By this time all the villagers knew of the circumstances and being wellnigh like one family a keen interest was the result all round Everybody thought of Giles nobody thought of Marty
4019-8895-0017	train-other-500	Had any of them looked in upon her during those moonlight nights which preceded the burial of her father
none	none	 they would have seen the girl absolutely alone in the house with the dead man Her own chamber being nearest the stairs the coffin had been placed there for convenience and at a certain hour of the night when the moon arrived opposite the window 
4019-8895-0018	train-other-500	its beams streamed across the still profile of South sublimed by the august presence of death and onward a few feet farther upon the face of his daughter
none	none	 lying in her little bed in the stillness of a repose almost as dignified as that of her companion 
4019-8895-0019	train-other-500	the repose of a guileless soul that had nothing more left on earth to lose except a life which she did not overvalue South was buried and a week passed and Winterborne watched for a reply from missus Charmond Melbury was very sanguine as to its tenor
4019-8895-0020	train-other-500	but Winterborne had not told him of the encounter with her carriage when if ever he had heard an affronted tone on a woman s lips he had heard it on hers The postman s time for passing was just after Melbury s men had assembled in the spar house and Winterborne who when not busy on his own account
none	none	 would lend assistance there used to go out into the lane every morning 
4019-8895-0021	train-other-500	and meet the post man at the end of one of the green rides through the hazel copse in the straight stretch of which his laden figure could be seen a long way off
none	none	 Grace also was very anxious more anxious than her father 
4019-8895-0022	train-other-500	more perhaps than Winterborne himself
none	none	 This anxiety led her into the spar house on some pretext or other almost every morning while they were awaiting the reply 
4019-8895-0023	train-other-500	Fitzpiers too
none	none	 though he did not personally appear was much interested and not altogether easy in his mind for he had been informed by an authority of what he had himself conjectured that if the tree had been allowed to stand the old man would have gone on complaining 
4019-8895-0024	train-other-500	but might have lived for twenty years Eleven times had Winterborne gone to that corner of the ride and looked up its long straight slope through the wet grays of winter dawn But though the postman s bowed figure loomed in view pretty regularly he brought nothing for Giles
4019-8895-0025	train-other-500	On the twelfth day the man of missives while yet in the extreme distance held up his hand and Winterborne saw a letter in it He took it into the spar house before he broke the seal
none	none	 and those who were there gathered round him while he read Grace looking in at the door 
4019-8895-0026	train-other-500	The letter was not from missus Charmond herself but her agent at Sherton Winterborne glanced it over and looked up
none	none	 It s all over he said Ah said they altogether Her lawyer is instructed to say that missus Charmond sees no reason for disturbing the natural course of things 
4019-8895-0027	train-other-500	particularly as she contemplates pulling the houses down he said quietly Only think of that said several Winterborne had turned away and said vehemently to himself Then let her pull em down
4019-8895-0028	train-other-500	and be d d to her Creedle looked at him with a face of seven sorrows saying Ah twas that sperrit that lost em for ye maister Winterborne subdued his feelings and from that hour whatever they were kept them entirely to himself
4019-8895-0029	train-other-500	There could be no doubt that up to this last moment he had nourished a feeble hope of regaining Grace in the event
none	none	 of this negotiation turning out a success 
4019-8895-0030	train-other-500	Not being aware of the fact that her father could have settled upon her a fortune sufficient to enable both to live in comfort he deemed it now an absurdity to dream any longer of such a vanity as making her his wife and sank into silence forthwith Yet
4019-8895-0031	train-other-500	whatever the value of taciturnity to a man among strangers it is apt to express more than talkativeness when he dwells among friends
4019-8895-0032	train-other-500	The countryman who is obliged to judge the time of day from changes in external nature sees a thousand successive tints and traits in the landscape which are never discerned by him who hears the regular chime of a clock because they are never in request
4019-8895-0033	train-other-500	In like manner do we use our eyes on our taciturn comrade The infinitesimal movement of muscle curve hair and wrinkle which when accompanied by a voice goes unregarded is watched and translated in the lack of it
4019-8895-0034	train-other-500	till virtually the whole surrounding circle of familiars is charged with the reserved one s moods and meanings This was the condition of affairs between Winterborne and his neighbors after his stroke of ill luck
4019-8895-0035	train-other-500	He held his tongue and they observed him and knew that he was discomposed mister Melbury in his compunction thought more of the matter than any one else except his daughter
none	none	 Had Winterborne been going on in the old fashion Grace s father could have alluded to his disapproval of the alliance every day with the greatest frankness 
4019-8895-0036	train-other-500	but to speak any further on the subject he could not find it in his heart to do now
none	none	 He hoped that Giles would of his own accord make some final announcement that he entirely withdrew his pretensions to Grace and so get the thing past and done with For though Giles had in a measure acquiesced in the wish of her family 
4019-8895-0037	train-other-500	he could make matters unpleasant if he chose to work upon Grace and hence when Melbury saw the young man approaching along the road one day
none	none	 he kept friendliness and frigidity exactly balanced in his eye till he could see whether Giles s manner was presumptive or not 
4019-8895-0038	train-other-500	His manner was that of a man who abandoned all claims I am glad to meet ye mister Melbury he said in a low voice whose quality he endeavored to make as practical as possible I am afraid I shall not be able to keep that mare I bought and
4019-8895-0039	train-other-500	as I don t care to sell her I should like
none	none	 if you don t object to give her to Miss Melbury The horse is very quiet and would be quite safe for her mister Melbury was rather affected at this You sha n t hurt your pocket like that on our account Giles Grace shall have the horse but I ll pay you what you gave for her and any expense you may have been put to for her keep He would not hear of any other terms and thus it was arranged They were now opposite Melbury s house and the timber merchant pressed Winterborne to enter Grace being out of the way Pull round the settle Giles said the timber merchant as soon as they were within I should like to have a serious talk with you Thereupon he put the case to Winterborne frankly and in quite a friendly way 
4019-8895-0040	train-other-500	He declared that he did not like to be hard on a man when he was in difficulty but he really did not see how Winterborne could marry his daughter now without even a house to take her to
none	none	 Giles quite acquiesced in the awkwardness of his situation But from a momentary feeling that he would like to know Grace s mind from her own lips 
4019-8895-0041	train-other-500	he did not speak out positively there and then He accordingly departed somewhat abruptly and went home to consider whether he would seek to bring about a meeting with her In the evening while he sat quietly pondering he fancied that he heard a scraping on the wall outside his house
none	none	 The boughs of a monthly rose which grew there made such a noise sometimes but 
4019-8895-0042	train-other-500	as no wind was stirring he knew that it could not be the rose tree He took up the candle and went out Nobody was near As he turned the light flickered on the whitewashed rough case of the front and he saw words written thereon in charcoal
none	none	 which he read as follows 
4019-8895-0043	train-other-500	O Giles you ve lost your dwelling place And therefore Giles you ll lose your Grace Giles went in doors He had his suspicions as to the scrawler of those lines but he could not be sure
4019-8895-0044	train-other-500	What suddenly filled his heart far more than curiosity about their authorship was a terrible belief that they were turning out to be true try to see Grace as he might They decided the question for him
none	none	 He sat down and wrote a formal note to Melbury 
4019-8895-0045	train-other-500	in which he briefly stated that he was placed in such a position as to make him share to the full Melbury s view of his own and his daughter s promise made some years before to wish that it should be considered as cancelled
none	none	 and they themselves quite released from any obligation on account of it 
4019-8895-0046	train-other-500	Having fastened up this their plenary absolution he determined to get it out of his hands and have done with it to which end he went off to Melbury s at once It was now so late that the family had all retired he crept up to the house
none	none	 thrust the note under the door and stole away as silently as he had come 
4019-8895-0047	train-other-500	Melbury himself was the first to rise the next morning and when he had read the letter his relief was great
none	none	 Very honorable of Giles very honorable he kept saying to himself 
4019-8895-0048	train-other-500	I shall not forget him Now to keep her up to her own true level It happened that Grace went out for an early ramble that morning passing through the door and gate while her father was in the spar house To go in her customary direction she could not avoid passing Winterborne s house
4019-8895-0049	train-other-500	The morning sun was shining flat upon its white surface and the words which still remained were immediately visible to her She read them Her face flushed to crimson
4019-8895-0050	train-other-500	She could see Giles and Creedle talking together at the back the charred spar gad with which the lines had been written lay on the ground beneath the wall Feeling pretty sure that Winterborne would observe her action she quickly went up to the wall rubbed out lose and inserted keep in its stead
4019-8895-0051	train-other-500	Then she made the best of her way home without looking behind her Giles could draw an inference now if he chose There could not be the least doubt that gentle Grace was warming to more sympathy with and interest in Giles Winterborne than ever she had done while he was
4019-8895-0052	train-other-500	her promised lover that since his misfortune those social shortcomings of his which contrasted so awkwardly with her later experiences of life had become obscured by the generous revival of an old romantic attachment to him Though mentally trained and tilled into foreignness of view
4019-8895-0053	train-other-500	as compared with her youthful time Grace was not an ambitious girl and might if left to herself have declined Winterborne without much discontent or unhappiness Her feelings just now were so far from latent that the writing on the wall had thus quickened her to an unusual rashness
4019-8895-0054	train-other-500	Having returned from her walk she sat at breakfast silently When her step mother had left the room she said to her father I have made up my mind that I should like my engagement to Giles to continue for the present at any rate till I can see further what I ought to do
4019-8895-0055	train-other-500	Melbury looked much surprised Nonsense he said sharply
none	none	 You don t know what you are talking about 
4019-8895-0056	train-other-500	Look here He handed across to her the letter received from Giles She read it and said no more Could he have seen her write on the wall She did not know
none	none	 Fate it seemed would have it this way and there was nothing to do but to acquiesce 
4019-8895-0057	train-other-500	It was a few hours after this that Winterborne who curiously enough had NOT perceived Grace writing
none	none	 was clearing away the tree from the front of South s late dwelling 
4019-8895-0058	train-other-500	He saw Marty standing in her door way
none	none	 a slim figure in meagre black 
4019-8895-0059	train-other-500	almost without womanly contours as yet He went up to her and said Marty why did you write that on my wall last night It WAS you you know Because it was the truth I didn t mean to let it stay mister Winterborne but
4019-8895-0060	train-other-500	when I was going to rub it out you came and I was obliged to run off Having prophesied one thing why did you alter it to another Your predictions can t be worth much I have not altered it But you have No It is altered Go and see
none	none	 She went and read that in spite of losing his dwelling place he would KEEP his Grace 
4019-8895-0061	train-other-500	Marty came back surprised Well I never she said Who can have made such nonsense of it Who indeed said he I have rubbed it all out as the point of it is quite gone
4019-8895-0062	train-other-500	You d no business to rub it out I didn t tell you to
none	none	 I meant to let it stay a little longer 
4019-8895-0063	train-other-500	Some idle boy did it no doubt she murmured As this seemed very probable and the actual perpetrator was unsuspected Winterborne said no more and dismissed the matter from his mind
none	none	 From this day of his life onward for a considerable time 
4019-8895-0064	train-other-500	Winterborne though not absolutely out of his house as yet retired into the background of human life and action thereabout a feat not particularly difficult of performance anywhere when the doer has the assistance of a lost prestige Grace thinking that Winterborne saw her write made no further sign
none	none	 and the frail bark of fidelity that she had thus timidly launched was stranded and lost CHAPTER XVI doctor Fitzpiers lived on the slope of the hill in a house of much less pretension both as to architecture and as to magnitude than the timber merchant s The latter had without doubt been once the manorial residence appertaining to the snug and modest domain of Little Hintock of which the boundaries were now lost by its absorption with others of its kind into the adjoining estate of missus Charmond Though the Melburys themselves were unaware of the fact there was every reason to believe at least so the parson said that the owners of that little manor had been Melbury s own ancestors the family name occurring in numerous documents relating to transfers of land about the time of the civil wars mister Fitzpiers s dwelling on the contrary was small cottage like and comparatively modern It had been occupied and was in part occupied still by a retired farmer and his wife who on the surgeon s arrival in quest of a home had accommodated him by receding from their front rooms into the kitchen quarter whence they administered to his wants and emerged at regular intervals to receive from him a not unwelcome addition to their income The cottage and its garden were so regular in their arrangement that they might have been laid out by a Dutch designer of the time of William and Mary In a low dense hedge cut to wedge shape was a door over which the hedge formed an arch and from the inside of the door a straight path bordered with clipped box ran up the slope of the garden to the porch which was exactly in the middle of the house front with two windows on each side Right and left of the path were first a bed of gooseberry bushes next of currant next of raspberry next of strawberry next of old fashioned flowers at the corners opposite the porch being spheres of box resembling a pair of school globes Over the roof of the house could be seen the orchard on yet higher ground and behind the orchard the forest trees reaching up to the crest of the hill Opposite the garden door and visible from the parlor window was a swing gate leading into a field across which there ran a footpath The swing gate had just been repainted and on one fine afternoon before the paint was dry and while gnats were still dying thereon the surgeon was standing in his sitting room abstractedly looking out at the different pedestrians who passed and repassed along that route Being of a philosophical stamp he perceived that the character of each of these travellers exhibited itself in a somewhat amusing manner by his or her method of handling the gate As regarded the men there was not much variety they gave the gate a kick and passed through The women were more contrasting To them the sticky wood work was a barricade a disgust a menace a treachery as the case might be The first that he noticed was a bouncing woman with her skirts tucked up and her hair uncombed She grasped the gate without looking giving it a supplementary push with her shoulder when the white imprint drew from her an exclamation in language not too refined She went to the green bank sat down and rubbed herself in the grass cursing the while Ha ha ha laughed the doctor The next was a girl with her hair cropped short in whom the surgeon recognized the daughter of his late patient the woodman South Moreover a black bonnet that she wore by way of mourning unpleasantly reminded him that he had ordered the felling of a tree which had caused her parent s death and Winterborne s losses She walked and thought and not recklessly but her preoccupation led her to grasp unsuspectingly the bar of the gate and touch it with her arm Fitzpiers felt sorry that she should have soiled that new black frock poor as it was for it was probably her only one She looked at her hand and arm seemed but little surprised wiped off the disfigurement with an almost unmoved face and as if without abandoning her original thoughts Thus she went on her way Then there came over the green quite a different sort of personage She walked as delicately as if she had been bred in town and as firmly as if she had been bred in the country she seemed one who dimly knew her appearance to be attractive but who retained some of the charm of being ignorant of that fact by forgetting it in a general pensiveness She approached the gate To let such a creature touch it even with a tip of her glove was to Fitzpiers almost like letting her proceed to tragical self destruction He jumped up and looked for his hat but was unable to find the right one glancing again out of the window he saw that he was too late Having come up she stopped looked at the gate picked up a little stick and using it as a bayonet pushed open the obstacle without touching it at all He steadily watched her till she had passed out of sight recognizing her as the very young lady whom he had seen once before and been unable to identify Whose could that emotional face be All the others he had seen in Hintock as yet oppressed him with their crude rusticity the contrast offered by this suggested that she hailed from elsewhere Precisely these thoughts had occurred to him at the first time of seeing her but he now went a little further with them and considered that as there had been no carriage seen or heard lately in that spot she could not have come a very long distance She must be somebody staying at Hintock House Possibly missus Charmond of whom he had heard so much at any rate an inmate and this probability was sufficient to set a mild radiance in the surgeon s somewhat dull sky Fitzpiers sat down to the book he had been perusing It happened to be that of a German metaphysician for the doctor was not a practical man except by fits and much preferred the ideal world to the real and the discovery of principles to their application The young lady remained in his thoughts He might have followed her but he was not constitutionally active and preferred a conjectural pursuit However when he went out for a ramble just before dusk he insensibly took the direction of Hintock House which was the way that Grace had been walking it having happened that her mind had run on missus Charmond that day and she had walked to the brow of a hill whence the house could be seen returning by another route Fitzpiers in his turn reached the edge of the glen overlooking the manor house The shutters were shut and only one chimney smoked The mere aspect of the place was enough to inform him that missus Charmond had gone away and that nobody else was staying there Fitzpiers felt a vague disappointment that the young lady was not missus Charmond of whom he had heard so much and without pausing longer to gaze at a carcass from which the spirit had flown he bent his steps homeward Later in the evening Fitzpiers was summoned to visit a cottage patient about two miles distant Like the majority of young practitioners in his position he was far from having assumed the dignity of being driven his rounds by a servant in a brougham that flashed the sunlight like a mirror his way of getting about was by means of a gig which he drove himself hitching the rein of the horse to the gate post shutter hook or garden paling of the domicile under visitation or giving pennies to little boys to hold the animal during his stay pennies which were well earned when the cases to be attended were of a certain cheerful kind that wore out the patience of the little boys On this account of travelling alone the night journeys which Fitzpiers had frequently to take were dismal enough a serious apparent perversity in nature ruling that whenever there was to be a birth in a particularly inaccessible and lonely place that event should occur in the night The surgeon having been of late years a town man hated the solitary midnight woodland He was not altogether skilful with the reins and it often occurred to his mind that if in some remote depths of the trees an accident were to happen the fact of his being alone might be the death of him Hence he made a practice of picking up any countryman or lad whom he chanced to pass by and under the disguise of treating him to a nice drive obtained his companionship on the journey and his convenient assistance in opening gates The doctor had started on his way out of the village on the night in question when the light of his lamps fell upon the musing form of Winterborne walking leisurely along as if he had no object in life Winterborne was a better class of companion than the doctor usually could get and he at once pulled up and asked him if he would like a drive through the wood that fine night Giles seemed rather surprised at the doctor s friendliness but said that he had no objection and accordingly mounted beside mister Fitzpiers They drove along under the black boughs which formed a network upon the stars all the trees of a species alike in one respect and no two of them alike in another Looking up as they passed under a horizontal bough they sometimes saw objects like large tadpoles lodged diametrically across it which Giles explained to be pheasants there at roost and they sometimes heard the report of a gun which reminded him that others knew what those tadpole shapes represented as well as he Presently the doctor said what he had been going to say for some time Is there a young lady staying in this neighborhood a very attractive girl with a little white boa round her neck and white fur round her gloves Winterborne of course knew in a moment that Grace whom he had caught the doctor peering at was represented by these accessaries With a wary grimness partly in his character partly induced by the circumstances he evaded an answer by saying I saw a young lady talking to missus Charmond the other day perhaps it was she Fitzpiers concluded from this that Winterborne had not seen him looking over the hedge It might have been he said She is quite a gentlewoman the one I mean She cannot be a permanent resident in Hintock or I should have seen her before Nor does she look like one She is not staying at Hintock House No it is closed Then perhaps she is staying at one of the cottages or farmhouses Oh no you mistake She was a different sort of girl altogether As Giles was nobody Fitzpiers treated him accordingly and apostrophized the night in continuation She moved upon this earth a shape of brightness A power that from its objects scarcely drew One impulse of her being in her lightness Most like some radiant cloud of morning dew Which wanders through the waste air s pathless blue To nourish some far desert she did seem Beside me gathering beauty as she grew Like the bright shade of some immortal dream Which walks when tempests sleep the wave of life s dark stream The consummate charm of the lines seemed to Winterborne though he divined that they were a quotation to be somehow the result of his lost love s charms upon Fitzpiers You seem to be mightily in love with her sir he said with a sensation of heart sickness and more than ever resolved not to mention Grace by name Oh no I am not that Winterborne people living insulated as I do by the solitude of this place get charged with emotive fluid like a Leyden jar with electric for want of some conductor at hand to disperse it Human love is a subjective thing the essence itself of man as that great thinker Spinoza the philosopher says ipsa hominis essentia it is joy accompanied by an idea which we project against any suitable object in the line of our vision just as the rainbow iris is projected against an oak ash or elm tree indifferently So that if any other young lady had appeared instead of the one who did appear I should have felt just the same interest in her and have quoted precisely the same lines from Shelley about her as about this one I saw Such miserable creatures of circumstance are we all Well it is what we call being in love down in these parts whether or no said Winterborne You are right enough if you admit that I am in love with something in my own head and no thing in itself outside it at all Is it part of a country doctor s duties to learn that view of things may I ask sir said Winterborne adopting the Socratic with such well assumed simplicity that Fitzpiers answered readily Oh no The real truth is Winterborne that medical practice in places like this is a very rule of thumb matter a bottle of bitter stuff for this and that old woman the bitterer the better compounded from a few simple stereotyped prescriptions occasional attendance at births where mere presence is almost sufficient so healthy and strong are the people and a lance for an abscess now and then Investigation and experiment cannot be carried on without more appliances than one has here though I have attempted it a little Giles did not enter into this view of the case what he had been struck with was the curious parallelism between mister Fitzpiers s manner and Grace s as shown by the fact of both of them straying into a subject of discourse so engrossing to themselves that it made them forget it was foreign to him Nothing further passed between himself and the doctor in relation to Grace till they were on their way back They had stopped at a way side inn for a glass of brandy and cider hot and when they were again in motion Fitzpiers possibly a little warmed by the liquor resumed the subject by saying I should like very much to know who that young lady was What difference can it make if she s only the tree your rainbow falls on Ha ha True You have no wife sir I have no wife and no idea of one I hope to do better things than marry and settle in Hintock Not but that it is well for a medical man to be married and sometimes begad twould be pleasant enough in this place with the wind roaring round the house and the rain and the boughs beating against it I hear that you lost your life holds by the death of South I did I lost in more ways than one They had reached the top of Hintock Lane or Street if it could be called such where three quarters of the road side consisted of copse and orchard One of the first houses to be passed was Melbury s A light was shining from a bedroom window facing lengthwise of the lane Winterborne glanced at it and saw what was coming He had withheld an answer to the doctor s inquiry to hinder his knowledge of Grace but as he thought to himself who hath gathered the wind in his fists who hath bound the waters in a garment he could not hinder what was doomed to arrive and might just as well have been outspoken As they came up to the house Grace s figure was distinctly visible drawing the two white curtains together which were used here instead of blinds Why there she is said Fitzpiers How does she come there In the most natural way in the world It is her home mister Melbury is her father Oh indeed indeed indeed How comes he to have a daughter of that stamp Winterborne laughed coldly Won t money do anything he said if you ve promising material to work upon Why shouldn t a Hintock girl taken early from home and put under proper instruction become as finished as any other young lady if she s got brains and good looks to begin with No reason at all why she shouldn t murmured the surgeon with reflective disappointment Only I didn t anticipate quite that kind of origin for her And you think an inch or two less of her now There was a little tremor in Winterborne s voice as he spoke Well said the doctor with recovered warmth I am not so sure that I think less of her At first it was a sort of blow but dammy I ll stick up for her She s charming every inch of her So she is said Winterborne but not to me From this ambiguous expression of the reticent woodlander s doctor Fitzpiers inferred that Giles disliked Miss Melbury because of some haughtiness in her bearing towards him and had on that account withheld her name The supposition did not tend to diminish his admiration for her CHAPTER XVII Grace s exhibition of herself in the act of pulling to the window curtains had been the result of an unfortunate incident in the house that day nothing less than the illness of Grammer Oliver a woman who had never till now lain down for such a reason in her life Like others to whom unbroken years of health has made the idea of keeping their bed almost as repugnant as death itself she had continued on foot till she literally fell on the floor and though she had as yet been scarcely a day off duty she had sickened into quite a different personage from the independent Grammer of the yard and spar house Ill as she was on one point she was firm On no account would she see a doctor in other words Fitzpiers The room in which Grace had been discerned was not her own but the old woman s On the girl s way to bed she had received a message from Grammer to the effect that she would much like to speak to her that night Grace entered and set the candle on a low chair beside the bed so that the profile of Grammer as she lay cast itself in a keen shadow upon the whitened wall her large head being still further magnified by an enormous turban which was really her petticoat wound in a wreath round her temples Grace put the room a little in order and approaching the sick woman said I am come Grammer as you wish Do let us send for the doctor before it gets later I will not have him said Grammer Oliver decisively Then somebody to sit up with you Can t abear it No I wanted to see you Miss Grace because ch have something on my mind Dear Miss Grace I TOOK THAT MONEY OF THE DOCTOR AFTER ALL What money The ten pounds Grace did not quite understand The ten pounds he offered me for my head because I ve a large brain I signed a paper when I took the money not feeling concerned about it at all I have not liked to tell ye that it was really settled with him because you showed such horror at the notion Well having thought it over more at length I wish I hadn t done it and it weighs upon my mind John South s death of fear about the tree makes me think that I shall die of this Ch have been going to ask him again to let me off but I hadn t the face Why I ve spent some of the money more n two pounds o t It do wherrit me terribly and I shall die o the thought of that paper I signed with my holy cross as South died of his trouble If you ask him to burn the paper he will I m sure and think no more of it Ch have done it once already miss But he laughed cruel like Yours is such a fine brain Grammer er said that science couldn t afford to lose you Besides you ve taken my money Don t let your father know of this please on no account whatever No no I will let you have the money to return to him Grammer rolled her head negatively upon the pillow Even if I should be well enough to take it to him he won t like it Though why he should so particular want to look into the works of a poor old woman s head piece like mine when there s so many other folks about I don t know I know how he ll answer me A lonely person like you Grammer er woll say What difference is it to you what becomes of ye when the breath s out of your body Oh it do trouble me If you only knew how he do chevy me round the chimmer in my dreams you d pity me How I could do it I can t think But ch was always so rackless If I only had anybody to plead for me missus Melbury would I am sure Ay but he wouldn t hearken to she It wants a younger face than hers to work upon such as he Grace started with comprehension You don t think he would do it for me she said Oh wouldn t he I couldn t go to him Grammer on any account I don t know him at all Ah if I were a young lady said the artful Grammer and could save a poor old woman s skellington from a heathen doctor instead of a Christian grave I would do it and be glad to But nobody will do anything for a poor old familiar friend but push her out of the way You are very ungrateful Grammer to say that But you are ill I know and that s why you speak so Now believe me you are not going to die yet Remember you told me yourself that you meant to keep him waiting many a year Ay one can joke when one is well even in old age but in sickness one s gayety falters to grief and that which seemed small looks large and the grim far off seems near Grace s eyes had tears in them I don t like to go to him on such an errand Grammer she said brokenly But I will to ease your mind It was with extreme reluctance that Grace cloaked herself next morning for the undertaking She was all the more indisposed to the journey by reason of Grammer s allusion to the effect of a pretty face upon doctor Fitzpiers and hence she most illogically did that which had the doctor never seen her would have operated to stultify the sole motive of her journey that is to say she put on a woollen veil which hid all her face except an occasional spark of her eyes Her own wish that nothing should be known of this strange and grewsome proceeding no less than Grammer Oliver s own desire led Grace to take every precaution against being discovered She went out by the garden door as the safest way all the household having occupations at the other side The morning looked forbidding enough when she stealthily opened it The battle between frost and thaw was continuing in mid air the trees dripped on the garden plots where no vegetables would grow for the dripping though they were planted year after year with that curious mechanical regularity of country people in the face of hopelessness the moss which covered the once broad gravel terrace was swamped and Grace stood irresolute Then she thought of poor Grammer and her dreams of the doctor running after her scalpel in hand and the possibility of a case so curiously similar to South s ending in the same way thereupon she stepped out into the drizzle The nature of her errand and Grammer Oliver s account of the compact she had made lent a fascinating horror to Grace s conception of Fitzpiers She knew that he was a young man but her single object in seeking an interview with him put all considerations of his age and social aspect from her mind Standing as she stood in Grammer Oliver s shoes he was simply a remorseless Jove of the sciences who would not have mercy and would have sacrifice a man whom save for this she would have preferred to avoid knowing But since in such a small village it was improbable that any long time could pass without their meeting there was not much to deplore in her having to meet him now But as need hardly be said Miss Melbury s view of the doctor as a merciless unwavering irresistible scientist was not quite in accordance with fact The real doctor Fitzpiers w as a man of too many hobbies to show likelihood of rising to any great eminence in the profession he had chosen or even to acquire any wide practice in the rural district he had marked out as his field of survey for the present In the course of a year his mind was accustomed to pass in a grand solar sweep through all the zodiacal signs of the intellectual heaven Sometimes it was in the Ram sometimes in the Bull one month he would be immersed in alchemy another in poesy one month in the Twins of astrology and astronomy then in the Crab of German literature and metaphysics In justice to him it must be stated that he took such studies as were immediately related to his own profession in turn with the rest and it had been in a month of anatomical ardor without the possibility of a subject that he had proposed to Grammer Oliver the terms she had mentioned to her mistress As may be inferred from the tone of his conversation with Winterborne he had lately plunged into abstract philosophy with much zest perhaps his keenly appreciative modern unpractical mind found this a realm more to his taste than any other Though his aims were desultory Fitzpiers s mental constitution was not without its admirable side a keen inquirer he honestly was even if the midnight rays of his lamp visible so far through the trees of Hintock lighted rank literatures of emotion and passion as often as or oftener than the books and materiel of science But whether he meditated the Muses or the philosophers the loneliness of Hintock life was beginning to tell upon his impressionable nature Winter in a solitary house in the country without society is tolerable nay even enjoyable and delightful given certain conditions but these are not the conditions which attach to the life of a professional man who drops down into such a place by mere accident They were present to the lives of Winterborne Melbury and Grace but not to the doctor s They are old association an almost exhaustive biographical or historical acquaintance with every object animate and inanimate within the observer s horizon He must know all about those invisible ones of the days gone by whose feet have traversed the fields which look so gray from his windows recall whose creaking plough has turned those sods from time to time whose hands planted the trees that form a crest to the opposite hill whose horses and hounds have torn through that underwood what birds affect that particular brake what domestic dramas of love jealousy revenge or disappointment have been enacted in the cottages the mansion the street or on the green The spot may have beauty grandeur salubrity convenience but if it lack memories it will ultimately pall upon him who settles there without opportunity of intercourse with his kind In such circumstances maybe an old man dreams of an ideal friend till he throws himself into the arms of any impostor who chooses to wear that title on his face A young man may dream of an ideal friend likewise but some humor of the blood will probably lead him to think rather of an ideal mistress and at length the rustle of a woman s dress the sound of her voice or the transit of her form across the field of his vision will enkindle his soul with a flame that blinds his eyes The discovery of the attractive Grace s name and family would have been enough in other circumstances to lead the doctor if not to put her personality out of his head to change the character of his interest in her Instead of treasuring her image as a rarity he would at most have played with it as a toy He was that kind of a man But situated here he could not go so far as amative cruelty He dismissed all reverential thought about her but he could not help taking her seriously He went on to imagine the impossible So far indeed did he go in this futile direction that as others are wont to do he constructed dialogues and scenes in which Grace had turned out to be the mistress of Hintock Manor house the mysterious missus Charmond particularly ready and willing to be wooed by himself and nobody else Well she isn t that he said finally But she s a very sweet nice exceptional girl The next morning he breakfasted alone as usual It was snowing with a fine flaked desultoriness just sufficient to make the woodland gray without ever achieving whiteness There was not a single letter for Fitzpiers only a medical circular and a weekly newspaper To sit before a large fire on such mornings and read and gradually acquire energy till the evening came and then with lamp alight and feeling full of vigor to pursue some engrossing subject or other till the small hours had hitherto been his practice But to day he could not settle into his chair That self contained position he had lately occupied in which the only attention demanded was the concentration of the inner eye all outer regard being quite gratuitous seemed to have been taken by insidious stratagem and for the first time he had an interest outside the house He walked from one window to another and became aware that the most irksome of solitudes is not the solitude of remoteness but that which is just outside desirable company The breakfast hour went by heavily enough and the next followed in the same half snowy half rainy style the weather now being the inevitable relapse which sooner or later succeeds a time too radiant for the season such as they had enjoyed in the late midwinter at Hintock To people at home there these changeful tricks had their interests the strange mistakes that some of the more sanguine trees had made in budding before their month to be incontinently glued up by frozen thawings now the similar sanguine errors of impulsive birds in framing nests that were now swamped by snow water and other such incidents prevented any sense of wearisomeness in the minds of the natives But these were features of a world not familiar to Fitzpiers and the inner visions to which he had almost exclusively attended having suddenly failed in their power to absorb him he felt unutterably dreary He wondered how long Miss Melbury was going to stay in Hintock The season was unpropitious for accidental encounters with her out of doors and except by accident he saw not how they were to become acquainted One thing was clear any acquaintance with her could only with a due regard to his future be casual at most of the nature of a flirtation for he had high aims and they would some day lead him into other spheres than this Thus desultorily thinking he flung himself down upon the couch which as in many draughty old country houses was constructed with a hood being in fact a legitimate development from the settle He tried to read as he reclined but having sat up till three o clock that morning the book slipped from his hand and he fell asleep CHAPTER XVIII It was at this time that Grace approached the house Her knock always soft in virtue of her nature was softer to day by reason of her strange errand However it was heard by the farmer s wife who kept the house and Grace was admitted Opening the door of the doctor s room the housewife glanced in and imagining Fitzpiers absent asked Miss Melbury to enter and wait a few minutes while she should go and find him believing him to be somewhere on the premises Grace acquiesced went in and sat down close to the door As soon as the door was shut upon her she looked round the room and started at perceiving a handsome man snugly ensconced in the couch like the recumbent figure within some canopied mural tomb of the fifteenth century except that his hands were by no means clasped in prayer She had no doubt that this was the doctor Awaken him herself she could not and her immediate impulse was to go and pull the broad ribbon with a brass rosette which hung at one side of the fireplace But expecting the landlady to re enter in a moment she abandoned this intention and stood gazing in great embarrassment at the reclining philosopher The windows of Fitzpiers s soul being at present shuttered he probably appeared less impressive than in his hours of animation but the light abstracted from his material presence by sleep was more than counterbalanced by the mysterious influence of that state in a stranger upon the consciousness of a beholder so sensitive So far as she could criticise at all she became aware that she had encountered a specimen of creation altogether unusual in that locality The occasions on which Grace had observed men of this stamp were when she had been far removed away from Hintock and even then such examples as had met her eye were at a distance and mainly of coarser fibre than the one who now confronted her She nervously wondered why the woman had not discovered her mistake and returned and went again towards the bell pull Approaching the chimney her back was to Fitzpiers but she could see him in the glass An indescribable thrill passed through her as she perceived that the eyes of the reflected image were open gazing wonderingly at her and under the curious unexpectedness of the sight she became as if spellbound almost powerless to turn her head and regard the original However by an effort she did turn when there he lay asleep the same as before Her startled perplexity as to what he could be meaning was sufficient to lead her to precipitately abandon her errand She crossed quickly to the door opened and closed it noiselessly and went out of the house unobserved By the time that she had gone down the path and through the garden door into the lane she had recovered her equanimity Here screened by the hedge she stood and considered a while Drip drip drip fell the rain upon her umbrella and around she had come out on such a morning because of the seriousness of the matter in hand yet now she had allowed her mission to be stultified by a momentary tremulousness concerning an incident which perhaps had meant nothing after all In the mean time her departure from the room stealthy as it had been had roused Fitzpiers and he sat up In the reflection from the mirror which Grace had beheld there was no mystery he had opened his eyes for a few moments but had immediately relapsed into unconsciousness if indeed he had ever been positively awake That somebody had just left the room he was certain and that the lovely form which seemed to have visited him in a dream was no less than the real presentation of the person departed he could hardly doubt Looking out of the window a few minutes later down the box edged gravel path which led to the bottom he saw the garden door gently open and through it enter the young girl of his thoughts Grace having just at this juncture determined to return and attempt the interview a second time That he saw her coming instead of going made him ask himself if his first impression of her were not a dream indeed She came hesitatingly along carrying her umbrella so low over her head that he could hardly see her face When she reached the point where the raspberry bushes ended and the strawberry bed began she made a little pause Fitzpiers feared that she might not be coming to him even now and hastily quitting the room he ran down the path to meet her The nature of her errand he could not divine but he was prepared to give her any amount of encouragement I beg pardon Miss Melbury he said I saw you from the window and fancied you might imagine that I was not at home if it is I you were coming for I was coming to speak one word to you nothing more she replied And I can say it here No no Please do come in Well then if you will not come into the house come as far as the porch Thus pressed she went on to the porch and they stood together inside it Fitzpiers closing her umbrella for her I have merely a request or petition to make she said My father s servant is ill a woman you know and her illness is serious I am sorry to hear it You wish me to come and see her at once No I particularly wish you not to come Oh indeed Yes and she wishes the same It would make her seriously worse if you were to come It would almost kill her My errand is of a peculiar and awkward nature It is concerning a subject which weighs on her mind that unfortunate arrangement she made with you that you might have her body after death Oh Grammer Oliver the old woman with the fine head Seriously ill is she And SO disturbed by her rash compact I have brought the money back will you please return to her the agreement she signed Grace held out to him a couple of five pound notes which she had kept ready tucked in her glove Without replying or considering the notes Fitzpiers allowed his thoughts to follow his eyes and dwell upon Grace s personality and the sudden close relation in which he stood to her The porch was narrow the rain increased It ran off the porch and dripped on the creepers and from the creepers upon the edge of Grace s cloak and skirts The rain is wetting your dress please do come in he said It really makes my heart ache to let you stay here Immediately inside the front door was the door of his sitting room he flung it open and stood in a coaxing attitude Try how she would Grace could not resist the supplicatory mandate written in the face and manner of this man and distressful resignation sat on her as she glided past him into the room brushing his coat with her elbow by reason of the narrowness He followed her shut the door which she somehow had hoped he would leave open and placing a chair for her sat down The concern which Grace felt at the development of these commonplace incidents was of course mainly owing to the strange effect upon her nerves of that view of him in the mirror gazing at her with open eyes when she had thought him sleeping which made her fancy that his slumber might have been a feint based on inexplicable reasons She again proffered the notes he awoke from looking at her as at a piece of live statuary and listened deferentially as she said Will you then reconsider and cancel the bond which poor Grammer Oliver so foolishly gave I ll cancel it without reconsideration Though you will allow me to have my own opinion about her foolishness Grammer is a very wise woman and she was as wise in that as in other things You think there was something very fiendish in the compact do you not Miss Melbury But remember that the most eminent of our surgeons in past times have entered into such agreements Not fiendish strange Yes that may be since strangeness is not in the nature of a thing but in its relation to something extrinsic in this case an unessential observer He went to his desk and searching a while found a paper which be unfolded and brought to her A thick cross appeared in ink at the bottom evidently from the hand of Grammer Grace put the paper in her pocket with a look of much relief As Fitzpiers did not take up the money half of which had come from Grace s own purse she pushed it a little nearer to him No no I shall not take it from the old woman he said It is more strange than the fact of a surgeon arranging to obtain a subject for dissection that our acquaintance should be formed out of it I am afraid you think me uncivil in showing my dislike to the notion But I did not mean to be Oh no no He looked at her as he had done before with puzzled interest I cannot think I cannot think he murmured Something bewilders me greatly He still reflected and hesitated Last night I sat up very late he at last went on and on that account I fell into a little nap on that couch about half an hour ago And during my few minutes of unconsciousness I dreamed what do you think that you stood in the room Should she tell She merely blushed You may imagine Fitzpiers continued now persuaded that it had indeed been a dream that I should not have dreamed of you without considerable thinking about you first He could not be acting of that she felt assured I fancied in my vision that you stood there he said pointing to where she had paused I did not see you directly but reflected in the glass I thought what a lovely creature The design is for once carried out Nature has at last recovered her lost union with the Idea My thoughts ran in that direction because I had been reading the work of a transcendental philosopher last night and I dare say it was the dose of Idealism that I received from it that made me scarcely able to distinguish between reality and fancy I almost wept when I awoke and found that you had appeared to me in Time but not in Space alas At moments there was something theatrical in the delivery of Fitzpiers s effusion yet it would have been inexact to say that it was intrinsically theatrical It often happens that in situations of unrestraint where there is no thought of the eye of criticism real feeling glides into a mode of manifestation not easily distinguishable from rodomontade A veneer of affectation overlies a bulk of truth with the evil consequence if perceived that the substance is estimated by the superficies and the whole rejected Grace however was no specialist in men s manners and she admired the sentiment without thinking of the form And she was embarrassed lovely creature made explanation awkward to her gentle modesty But can it be said he suddenly that you really were here I have to confess that I have been in the room once before faltered she The woman showed me in and went away to fetch you but as she did not return I left And you saw me asleep he murmured with the faintest show of humiliation Yes IF you were asleep and did not deceive me Why do you say if I saw your eyes open in the glass but as they were closed when I looked round upon you I thought you were perhaps deceiving me Never said Fitzpiers fervently never could I deceive you Foreknowledge to the distance of a year or so in either of them might have spoiled the effect of that pretty speech Never deceive her But they knew nothing and the phrase had its day Grace began now to be anxious to terminate the interview but the compelling power of Fitzpiers s atmosphere still held her there She was like an inexperienced actress who having at last taken up her position on the boards and spoken her speeches does not know how to move off The thought of Grammer occurred to her I ll go at once and tell poor Grammer of your generosity she said It will relieve her at once Grammer s a nervous disease too how singular he answered accompanying her to the door One moment look at this it is something which may interest you He had thrown open the door on the other side of the passage and she saw a microscope on the table of the confronting room Look into it please you ll be interested he repeated She applied her eye and saw the usual circle of light patterned all over with a cellular tissue of some indescribable sort What do you think that is said Fitzpiers She did not know That s a fragment of old John South s brain which I am investigating She started back not with aversion but with wonder as to how it should have got there Fitzpiers laughed Here am I he said endeavoring to carry on simultaneously the study of physiology and transcendental philosophy the material world and the ideal so as to discover if possible a point of contrast between them and your finer sense is quite offended Oh no mister Fitzpiers said Grace earnestly It is not so at all I know from seeing your light at night how deeply you meditate and work Instead of condemning you for your studies I admire you very much Her face upturned from the microscope was so sweet sincere and self forgetful in its aspect that the susceptible Fitzpiers more than wished to annihilate the lineal yard which separated it from his own Whether anything of the kind showed in his eyes or not Grace remained no longer at the microscope but quickly went her way into the rain CHAPTER XIX 
4019-8899-0000	train-other-500	Instead of resuming his investigation of South s brain which perhaps was not so interesting under the microscope as might have been expected from the importance of that organ in life Fitzpiers reclined and ruminated on the interview
4019-8899-0001	train-other-500	Grace s curious susceptibility to his presence though it was as if the currents of her life were disturbed rather than attracted by him added a special interest to her general charm Fitzpiers was in a distinct degree scientific

4019-8899-0005	train-other-500	One habit of Fitzpiers s commoner in dreamers of more advanced age than in men of his years was that of talking to himself He paced round his room with a selective tread upon the more prominent blooms of the carpet and murmured
4019-8899-0006	train-other-500	This phenomenal girl will be the light of my life while I am at Hintock and the special beauty of the situation is that our attitude and relations to each other will be purely spiritual
none	none	 Socially we can never be intimate Anything like matrimonial intentions towards her charming as she is 
4019-8899-0007	train-other-500	would be absurd They would spoil the ethereal character of my regard And
none	none	 indeed I have other aims on the practical side of my life 
4019-8899-0008	train-other-500	Fitzpiers bestowed a regulation thought on the advantageous marriage he was bound to make with a woman of family as good as his own and of purse much longer But as an object of contemplation for the present as objective spirit rather than corporeal presence
4019-8899-0009	train-other-500	Grace Melbury would serve to keep his soul alive and to relieve the monotony of his days His first notion acquired from the mere sight of her without converse that of an idle and vulgar flirtation with a timber merchant s pretty daughter
none	none	 grated painfully upon him now that he had found what Grace intrinsically was 
4019-8899-0010	train-other-500	Personal intercourse with such as she could take no lower form than intellectual communion and mutual explorations of the world of thought Since he could not call at her father s having no practical views cursory encounters in the lane in the wood
none	none	 coming and going to and from church or in passing her dwelling 
4019-8899-0011	train-other-500	were what the acquaintance would have to feed on Such anticipated glimpses of her now and then realized themselves in the event Rencounters of not more than a minute s duration frequently repeated will build up mutual interest even an intimacy in a lonely place
4019-8899-0012	train-other-500	Theirs grew as imperceptibly as the tree twigs budded
none	none	 There never was a particular moment at which it could be said they became friends yet a delicate understanding now existed between two who in the winter had been strangers 
4019-8899-0013	train-other-500	Spring weather came on rather suddenly the unsealing of buds that had long been swollen accomplishing itself in the space of one warm night The rush of sap in the veins of the trees could almost be heard
4019-8899-0014	train-other-500	The flowers of late April took up a position unseen and looked as if they had been blooming a long while
none	none	 though there had been no trace of them the day before yesterday 
4019-8899-0015	train-other-500	birds began not to mind getting wet In door people said they had heard the nightingale to which out door people replied contemptuously that they had heard him a fortnight before The young doctor s practice being scarcely so large as a London surgeon s he frequently walked in the wood
4019-8899-0016	train-other-500	Indeed such practice as he had he did not follow up with the assiduity that would have been necessary for developing it to exceptional proportions One day book in hand he walked in a part of the wood where the trees were mainly oaks
none	none	 It was a calm afternoon and there was everywhere around that sign of great undertakings on the part of vegetable nature 
4019-8899-0017	train-other-500	which is apt to fill reflective human beings who are not undertaking much themselves with a sudden uneasiness at the contrast He heard in the distance a curious sound something like the quack of a duck which
none	none	 though it was common enough here about this time 
4019-8899-0018	train-other-500	was not common to him Looking through the trees Fitzpiers soon perceived the origin of the noise The barking season had just commenced and what he had heard was the tear of the ripping tool as it ploughed its way along the sticky parting between the trunk and the rind
4019-8899-0019	train-other-500	Melbury did a large business in bark and as he was Grace s father and possibly might be found on the spot Fitzpiers was attracted to the scene even more than he might have been by its intrinsic interest When he got nearer he recognized among the workmen
none	none	 the two Timothys and Robert Creedle who probably had been lent by Winterborne Marty South also assisted 
4019-8899-0020	train-other-500	Each tree doomed to this flaying process was first attacked by Creedle With a small billhook he carefully freed the collar of the tree from twigs and patches of moss which incrusted it to a height of a foot or two above the ground
4019-8899-0021	train-other-500	an operation comparable to the little toilet of the executioner s victim After this it was barked in its erect position to a point as high as a man could reach If a fine product of vegetable nature could ever be said to look ridiculous it was the case now
none	none	 when the oak stood naked legged and as if ashamed 
4019-8899-0022	train-other-500	till the axe man came and cut a ring round it and the two Timothys finished the work with the crosscut saw As soon as it had fallen the barkers attacked it like locusts
none	none	 and in a short time not a particle of rind was left on the trunk and larger limbs Marty South was an adept at peeling the upper parts and there she stood encaged amid the mass of twigs and buds like a great bird 
4019-8899-0023	train-other-500	running her tool into the smallest branches beyond the farthest points to which the skill and patience of the men enabled them to proceed branches which in their lifetime had swayed high above the bulk of the wood and caught the latest and earliest rays of the sun and moon
none	none	 while the lower part of the forest was still in darkness 
4019-8899-0024	train-other-500	You seem to have a better instrument than they Marty said Fitzpiers No sir she said holding up the tool a horse s leg bone fitted into a handle and filed to an edge
none	none	 tis only that they ve less patience with the twigs because their time is worth more than mine A little shed had been constructed on the spot of thatched hurdles and boughs and in front of it was a fire over which a kettle sung 
4019-8899-0025	train-other-500	Fitzpiers sat down inside the shelter and went on with his reading except when he looked up to observe the scene and the actors The thought that he might settle here and become welded in with this sylvan life by marrying Grace Melbury crossed his mind for a moment
none	none	 Why should he go farther into the world than where he was 
4019-8899-0026	train-other-500	The secret of quiet happiness lay in limiting the ideas and aspirations these men s thoughts were conterminous with the margin of the Hintock woodlands and why should not his be likewise limited a small practice among the people around him being the bound of his desires
none	none	 Presently Marty South discontinued her operations upon the quivering boughs came out from the reclining oak and prepared tea 
4019-8899-0027	train-other-500	When it was ready the men were called and Fitzpiers being in a mood to join sat down with them The latent reason of his lingering here so long revealed itself when the faint creaking of the joints of a vehicle became audible and one of the men said Here s he
4019-8899-0028	train-other-500	Turning their heads they saw Melbury s gig approaching the wheels muffled by the yielding moss
none	none	 The timber merchant was on foot leading the horse looking back at every few steps to caution his daughter 
4019-8899-0029	train-other-500	who kept her seat where and how to duck her head so as to avoid the overhanging branches They stopped at the spot where the bark ripping had been temporarily suspended
none	none	 Melbury cursorily examined the heaps of bark and drawing near to where the workmen were sitting down 
4019-8899-0030	train-other-500	accepted their shouted invitation to have a dish of tea for which purpose he hitched the horse to a bough Grace declined to take any of their beverage and remained in her place in the vehicle
none	none	 looking dreamily at the sunlight that came in thin threads through the hollies with which the oaks were interspersed When Melbury stepped up close to the shelter he for the first time perceived that the doctor was present 
4019-8899-0031	train-other-500	and warmly appreciated Fitzpiers s invitation to sit down on the log beside him
none	none	 Bless my heart who would have thought of finding you here he said 
4019-8899-0032	train-other-500	obviously much pleased at the circumstance I wonder now if my daughter knows you are so nigh at hand I don t expect she do
none	none	 He looked out towards the gig wherein Grace sat her face still turned in the opposite direction 
4019-8899-0033	train-other-500	She doesn t see us Well never mind let her be Grace was indeed quite unconscious of Fitzpiers s propinquity She was thinking of something which had little connection with the scene before her thinking of her friend lost as soon as found missus Charmond
none	none	 of her capricious conduct and of the contrasting scenes she was possibly enjoying at that very moment in other climes 
4019-8899-0034	train-other-500	to which Grace herself had hoped to be introduced by her friend s means She wondered if this patronizing lady would return to Hintock during the summer and whether the acquaintance which had been nipped on the last occasion of her residence there would develop on the next
4019-8899-0035	train-other-500	Melbury told ancient timber stories as he sat
none	none	 relating them directly to Fitzpiers and obliquely to the men who had heard them often before 
4019-8899-0036	train-other-500	Marty who poured out tea was just saying
none	none	 I think I ll take out a cup to Miss Grace when they heard a clashing of the gig harness and turning round Melbury 
4019-8899-0037	train-other-500	saw that the horse had become restless
none	none	 and was jerking about the vehicle in a way which alarmed its occupant 
4019-8899-0038	train-other-500	though she refrained from screaming Melbury jumped up immediately but not more quickly than Fitzpiers and while her father ran to the horse s head and speedily began to control him
none	none	 Fitzpiers was alongside the gig assisting Grace to descend 
4019-8899-0039	train-other-500	Her surprise at his appearance was so great that far from making a calm and independent descent she was very nearly lifted down in his arms He relinquished her when she touched ground and hoped she was not frightened Oh no not much she managed to say
none	none	 There was no danger unless he had run under the trees where the boughs are low enough to hit my head 
4019-8899-0040	train-other-500	Which was by no means an impossibility and justifies any amount of alarm
none	none	 He referred to what he thought he saw written in her face and she could not tell him that this had little to do with the horse but much with himself His contiguity had in fact the same effect upon her as on those former occasions when he had come closer to her than usual 
4019-8899-0041	train-other-500	that of producing in her an unaccountable tendency to tearfulness Melbury soon put the horse to rights and seeing that Grace was safe turned again to the work people His daughter s nervous distress had passed off in a few moments and she said quite gayly to Fitzpiers as she walked with him towards the group
none	none	 There s destiny in it you see I was doomed to join in your picnic although I did not intend to do so 
4019-8899-0042	train-other-500	Marty prepared her a comfortable place and she sat down in the circle and listened to Fitzpiers while he drew from her father and the bark rippers sundry narratives of their fathers their grandfathers
none	none	 and their own adventures in these woods of the mysterious sights they had seen only to be accounted for by supernatural agency 
4019-8899-0043	train-other-500	of white witches and black witches and the standard story of the spirits of the two brothers who had fought and fallen
none	none	 and had haunted Hintock House till they were exorcised by the priest 
4019-8899-0044	train-other-500	and compelled to retreat to a swamp in this very wood whence they were returning to their old quarters at the rate of a cock s stride every New year s Day old style hence the local saying On New year s tide a cock s stride
4019-8899-0045	train-other-500	It was a pleasant time The smoke from the little fire of peeled sticks rose between the sitters and the sunlight and behind its blue veil stretched the naked arms of the prostrate trees The smell of the uncovered sap mingled with the smell of the burning wood
4019-8899-0046	train-other-500	and the sticky inner surface of the scattered bark glistened as it revealed its pale madder hues to the eye Melbury was so highly satisfied at having Fitzpiers as a sort of guest
none	none	 that he would have sat on for any length of time 
4019-8899-0047	train-other-500	but Grace on whom Fitzpiers s eyes only too frequently alighted seemed to think it incumbent upon her to make a show of going and her father thereupon accompanied her to the vehicle
4019-8899-0048	train-other-500	As the doctor had helped her out of it he appeared to think that he had excellent reasons for helping her in and performed the attention lingeringly enough What were you almost in tears about just now he asked softly
none	none	 I don t know she said 
4019-8899-0049	train-other-500	and the words were strictly true Melbury mounted on the other side and they drove on out of the grove their wheels silently crushing delicate patterned mosses hyacinths primroses lords and ladies and other strange and ordinary plants and cracking up little sticks that lay across the track
4019-8899-0050	train-other-500	Their way homeward ran along the crest of a lofty hill whence on the right they beheld a wide valley differing both in feature and atmosphere from that of the Hintock precincts It was the cider country which met the woodland district on the axis of this hill
4019-8899-0051	train-other-500	Over the vale the air was blue as sapphire such a blue as outside that apple valley was never seen Under the blue the orchards were in a blaze of bloom some of the richly flowered trees running almost up to where they drove along
4019-8899-0052	train-other-500	Over a gate which opened down the incline a man leaned on his arms regarding this fair promise so intently that he did not observe their passing That was Giles said Melbury when they had gone by Was it
none	none	 Poor Giles said she All that blooth means heavy autumn work for him and his hands If no blight happens before the setting the apple yield will be such as we have not had for years 
4019-8899-0053	train-other-500	Meanwhile in the wood they had come from the men had sat on so long that they were indisposed to begin work again that evening they were paid by the ton and their time for labor was as they chose
4019-8899-0054	train-other-500	They placed the last gatherings of bark in rows for the curers which led them farther and farther away from the shed and thus they gradually withdrew as the sun went down Fitzpiers lingered yet He had opened his book again though he could hardly see a word in it
4019-8899-0055	train-other-500	and sat before the dying fire scarcely knowing of the men s departure He dreamed and mused till his consciousness seemed to occupy the whole space of the woodland around so little was there of jarring sight or sound to hinder perfect unity with the sentiment of the place
4019-8899-0056	train-other-500	The idea returned upon him of sacrificing all practical aims to live in calm contentment here and instead of going on elaborating new conceptions with infinite pains
none	none	 to accept quiet domesticity according to oldest and homeliest notions 
4019-8899-0057	train-other-500	These reflections detained him till the wood was embrowned with the coming night
none	none	 and the shy little bird of this dusky time had begun to pour out all the intensity of his eloquence 
4019-8899-0058	train-other-500	from a bush not very far off Fitzpiers s eyes commanded as much of the ground in front as was open Entering upon this he saw a figure whose direction of movement was towards the spot where he sat
4019-8899-0059	train-other-500	The surgeon was quite shrouded from observation by the recessed shadow of the hut and there was no reason why he should move till the stranger had passed by The shape resolved itself into a woman s she was looking on the ground and walking slowly
4019-8899-0060	train-other-500	as if searching for something that had been lost her course being precisely that of mister Melbury s gig Fitzpiers by a sort of divination jumped to the idea that the figure was Grace s her nearer approach made the guess a certainty
none	none	 Yes she was looking for something and she came round by the prostrate trees that would have been invisible but for the white nakedness which enabled her to avoid them easily 
4019-8899-0061	train-other-500	Thus she approached the heap of ashes and acting upon what was suggested by a still shining ember or two she took a stick and stirred the heap which thereupon burst into a flame On looking around by the light thus obtained
4019-8899-0062	train-other-500	she for the first time saw the illumined face of Fitzpiers
none	none	 precisely in the spot where she had left him 
4019-8899-0063	train-other-500	Grace gave a start and a scream the place had been associated with him in her thoughts but she had not expected to find him there still Fitzpiers lost not a moment in rising and going to her side I frightened you dreadfully I know he said
none	none	 I ought to have spoken but I did not at first expect it to be you I have been sitting here ever since 
4019-8899-0064	train-other-500	He was actually supporting her with his arm as though under the impression that she was quite overcome and in danger of falling As soon as she could collect her ideas she gently withdrew from his grasp and explained what she had returned for
4019-8899-0065	train-other-500	in getting up or down from the gig or when sitting by the hut fire she had dropped her purse
none	none	 Now we will find it 
4019-8899-0066	train-other-500	said Fitzpiers He threw an armful of last year s leaves on to the fire which made the flame leap higher and the encompassing shades to weave themselves into a denser contrast turning eve into night in a moment
4019-8899-0067	train-other-500	By this radiance they groped about on their hands and knees till Fitzpiers rested on his elbow and looked at Grace We must always meet in odd circumstances he said and this is one of the oddest I wonder if it means anything Oh
none	none	 no I am sure it doesn t said Grace in haste quickly assuming an erect posture Pray don t say it any more I hope there was not much money in the purse said Fitzpiers rising to his feet more slowly and brushing the leaves from his trousers Scarcely any I cared most about the purse itself because it was given me 
4019-8899-0068	train-other-500	Indeed money is of little more use at Hintock than on Crusoe s island there s hardly any way of spending it
none	none	 They had given up the search when Fitzpiers discerned something by his foot Here it is he said so that your father mother friend or ADMIRER will not have his or her feelings hurt by a sense of your negligence after all 
4019-8899-0069	train-other-500	Oh he knows nothing of what I do now The admirer said Fitzpiers slyly
none	none	 I don t know if you would call him that said Grace with simplicity 
4019-8899-0070	train-other-500	The admirer is a superficial conditional creature and this person is quite different He has all the cardinal virtues Perhaps though I don t know them precisely
none	none	 You unconsciously practise them Miss Melbury which is better 
4019-8899-0071	train-other-500	According to Schleiermacher they are Self control Perseverance Wisdom and Love and his is the best list that I know I am afraid poor
none	none	 She was going to say that she feared Winterborne the giver of the purse years before 
4019-8899-0072	train-other-500	had not much perseverance though
none	none	 he had all the other three 
4019-8899-0073	train-other-500	but she determined to go no further in this direction and was silent These half revelations made a perceptible difference in Fitzpiers His sense of personal superiority wasted away and Grace assumed in his eyes
4019-8899-0074	train-other-500	the true aspect of a mistress in her lover s regard Miss Melbury he said suddenly I divine that this virtuous man you mention has been refused by you She could do no otherwise than admit it
4019-8899-0075	train-other-500	I do not inquire without good reason God forbid that I should kneel in another s place at any shrine unfairly But my dear Miss Melbury now that he is gone may I draw near
4019-8899-0076	train-other-500	I I can t say anything about that she cried quickly Because when a man has been refused you feel pity for him and like him more than you did before
4019-8899-0077	train-other-500	This increasing complication added still more value to Grace in the surgeon s eyes it rendered her adorable But cannot you say he pleaded distractedly I d rather not I think I must go home at once Oh yes said Fitzpiers
4019-8899-0078	train-other-500	But as he did not move she felt it awkward to walk straight away from him and so they stood silently together A diversion was created by the accident of two birds that had either been roosting above their heads or nesting there tumbling one over the other into the hot ashes at their feet
4019-8899-0079	train-other-500	apparently engrossed in a desperate quarrel that prevented the use of their wings They speedily parted however and flew up and were seen no more
none	none	 That s the end of what is called love said some one 
4019-8899-0080	train-other-500	The speaker was neither Grace nor Fitzpiers but Marty South who approached with her face turned up to the sky in her endeavor to trace the birds Suddenly perceiving Grace she exclaimed Oh Miss Melbury
none	none	 I have been following they pigeons and didn t see you 
4019-8899-0081	train-other-500	And here s mister Winterborne she continued shyly as she looked towards Fitzpiers who stood in the background Marty
none	none	 Grace interrupted I want you to walk home with me 
4019-8899-0082	train-other-500	will you Come along And without lingering longer she took hold of Marty s arm and led her away They went between the spectral arms of the peeled trees as they lay and onward among the growing trees by a path where there were no oaks and no barking and no Fitzpiers
none	none	 nothing but copse wood between which the primroses could be discerned in pale bunches I didn t know mister Winterborne was there said Marty breaking the silence when they had nearly reached Grace s door Nor was he said Grace But Miss Melbury I saw him No said Grace It was somebody else Giles Winterborne is nothing to me CHAPTER XX The leaves over Hintock grew denser in their substance and the woodland seemed to change from an open filigree to a solid opaque body of infinitely larger shape and importance The boughs cast green shades which hurt the complexion of the girls who walked there and a fringe of them which overhung mister Melbury s garden dripped on his seed plots when it rained pitting their surface all over as with pock marks till Melbury declared that gardens in such a place were no good at all The two trees that had creaked all the winter left off creaking the whir of the night jar however forming a very satisfactory continuation of uncanny music from that quarter Except at mid day the sun was not seen complete by the Hintock people but rather in the form of numerous little stars staring through the leaves Such an appearance it had on Midsummer Eve of this year and as the hour grew later and nine o clock drew on the irradiation of the daytime became broken up by weird shadows and ghostly nooks of indistinctness Imagination could trace upon the trunks and boughs strange faces and figures shaped by the dying lights the surfaces of the holly leaves would here and there shine like peeping eyes while such fragments of the sky as were visible between the trunks assumed the aspect of sheeted forms and cloven tongues This was before the moonrise Later on when that planet was getting command of the upper heaven and consequently shining with an unbroken face into such open glades as there were in the neighborhood of the hamlet it became apparent that the margin of the wood which approached the timber merchant s premises was not to be left to the customary stillness of that reposeful time Fitzpiers having heard a voice or voices was looking over his garden gate where he now looked more frequently than into his books fancying that Grace might be abroad with some friends He was now irretrievably committed in heart to Grace Melbury though he was by no means sure that she was so far committed to him That the Idea had for once completely fulfilled itself in the objective substance which he had hitherto deemed an impossibility he was enchanted enough to fancy must be the case at last It was not Grace who had passed however but several of the ordinary village girls in a group some steadily walking some in a mood of wild gayety He quietly asked his landlady who was also in the garden what these girls were intending and she informed him that it being Old Midsummer Eve they were about to attempt some spell or enchantment which would afford them a glimpse of their future partners for life She declared it to be an ungodly performance and one which she for her part would never countenance saying which she entered her house and retired to bed The young man lit a cigar and followed the bevy of maidens slowly up the road They had turned into the wood at an opening between Melbury s and Marty South s but Fitzpiers could easily track them by their voices low as they endeavored to keep their tones In the mean time other inhabitants of Little Hintock had become aware of the nocturnal experiment about to be tried and were also sauntering stealthily after the frisky maidens Miss Melbury had been informed by Marty South during the day of the proposed peep into futurity and being only a girl like the rest she was sufficiently interested to wish to see the issue The moon was so bright and the night so calm that she had no difficulty in persuading missus Melbury to accompany her and thus joined by Marty these went onward in the same direction Passing Winterborne s house they heard a noise of hammering Marty explained it This was the last night on which his paternal roof would shelter him the days of grace since it fell into hand having expired and Giles was taking down his cupboards and bedsteads with a view to an early exit next morning His encounter with missus Charmond had cost him dearly When they had proceeded a little farther Marty was joined by Grammer Oliver who was as young as the youngest in such matters and Grace and missus Melbury went on by themselves till they had arrived at the spot chosen by the village daughters whose primary intention of keeping their expedition a secret had been quite defeated Grace and her step mother paused by a holly tree and at a little distance stood Fitzpiers under the shade of a young oak intently observing Grace who was in the full rays of the moon He watched her without speaking and unperceived by any but Marty and Grammer who had drawn up on the dark side of the same holly which sheltered missus and Miss Melbury on its bright side The two former conversed in low tones If they two come up in Wood next Midsummer Night they ll come as one said Grammer signifying Fitzpiers and Grace Instead of my skellington he ll carry home her living carcass before long But though she s a lady in herself and worthy of any such as he it do seem to me that he ought to marry somebody more of the sort of missus Charmond and that Miss Grace should make the best of Winterborne Marty returned no comment and at that minute the girls some of whom were from Great Hintock were seen advancing to work the incantation it being now about midnight Directly we see anything we ll run home as fast as we can said one whose courage had begun to fail her To this the rest assented not knowing that a dozen neighbors lurked in the bushes around I wish we had not thought of trying this said another but had contented ourselves with the hole digging to morrow at twelve and hearing our husbands trades It is too much like having dealings with the Evil One to try to raise their forms However they had gone too far to recede and slowly began to march forward in a skirmishing line through the trees towards the deeper recesses of the wood As far as the listeners could gather the particular form of black art to be practised on this occasion was one connected with the sowing of hemp seed a handful of which was carried by each girl At the moment of their advance they looked back and discerned the figure of Miss Melbury who alone of all the observers stood in the full face of the moonlight deeply engrossed in the proceedings By contrast with her life of late years they made her feel as if she had receded a couple of centuries in the world s history She was rendered doubly conspicuous by her light dress and after a few whispered words one of the girls a bouncing maiden plighted to young Timothy Tangs asked her if she would join in Grace with some excitement said that she would and moved on a little in the rear of the rest Soon the listeners could hear nothing of their proceedings beyond the faintest occasional rustle of leaves Grammer whispered again to Marty Why didn t ye go and try your luck with the rest of the maids I don t believe in it said Marty shortly Why half the parish is here the silly hussies should have kept it quiet I see mister Winterborne through the leaves just come up with Robert Creedle Marty we ought to act the part o Providence sometimes Do go and tell him that if he stands just behind the bush at the bottom of the slope Miss Grace must pass down it when she comes back and she will most likely rush into his arms for as soon as the clock strikes they ll bundle back home along like hares I ve seen such larries before Do you think I d better said Marty reluctantly Oh yes he ll bless ye for it I don t want that kind of blessing But after a moment s thought she went and delivered the information and Grammer had the satisfaction of seeing Giles walk slowly to the bend in the leafy defile along which Grace would have to return Meanwhile missus Melbury deserted by Grace had perceived Fitzpiers and Winterborne and also the move of the latter An improvement on Grammer s idea entered the mind of missus Melbury for she had lately discerned what her husband had not that Grace was rapidly fascinating the surgeon She therefore drew near to Fitzpiers You should be where mister Winterborne is standing she said to him significantly She will run down through that opening much faster than she went up it if she is like the rest of the girls Fitzpiers did not require to be told twice He went across to Winterborne and stood beside him Each knew the probable purpose of the other in standing there and neither spoke Fitzpiers scorning to look upon Winterborne as a rival and Winterborne adhering to the off hand manner of indifference which had grown upon him since his dismissal Neither Grammer nor Marty South had seen the surgeon s manoeuvre and still to help Winterborne as she supposed the old woman suggested to the wood girl that she should walk forward at the heels of Grace and tole her down the required way if she showed a tendency to run in another direction Poor Marty always doomed to sacrifice desire to obligation walked forward accordingly and waited as a beacon still and silent for the retreat of Grace and her giddy companions now quite out of hearing The first sound to break the silence was the distant note of Great Hintock clock striking the significant hour About a minute later that quarter of the wood to which the girls had wandered resounded with the flapping of disturbed birds then two or three hares and rabbits bounded down the glade from the same direction and after these the rustling and crackling of leaves and dead twigs denoted the hurried approach of the adventurers whose fluttering gowns soon became visible Miss Melbury having gone forward quite in the rear of the rest was one of the first to return and the excitement being contagious she ran laughing towards Marty who still stood as a hand post to guide her then passing on she flew round the fatal bush where the undergrowth narrowed to a gorge Marty arrived at her heels just in time to see the result Fitzpiers had quickly stepped forward in front of Winterborne who disdaining to shift his position had turned on his heel and then the surgeon did what he would not have thought of doing but for missus Melbury s encouragement and the sentiment of an eve which effaced conventionality Stretching out his arms as the white figure burst upon him he captured her in a moment as if she had been a bird Oh cried Grace in her fright You are in my arms dearest said Fitzpiers and I am going to claim you and keep you there all our two lives She rested on him like one utterly mastered and it was several seconds before she recovered from this helplessness Subdued screams and struggles audible from neighboring brakes revealed that there had been other lurkers thereabout for a similar purpose Grace unlike most of these companions of hers instead of gasping and writhing said in a trembling voice mister Fitzpiers will you let me go Certainly he said laughing as soon as you have recovered She waited another few moments then quietly and firmly pushed him aside and glided on her path the moon whitening her hot blush away But it had been enough new relations between them had begun The case of the other girls was different as has been said They wrestled and tittered only escaping after a desperate struggle Fitzpiers could hear these enactments still going on after Grace had left him and he remained on the spot where he had caught her Winterborne having gone away On a sudden another girl came bounding down the same descent that had been followed by Grace a fine framed young woman with naked arms Seeing Fitzpiers standing there she said with playful effrontery May saint kiss me if canst catch me Tim Fitzpiers recognized her as Suke Damson a hoydenish damsel of the hamlet who was plainly mistaking him for her lover He was impulsively disposed to profit by her error and as soon as she began racing away he started in pursuit On she went under the boughs now in light now in shade looking over her shoulder at him every few moments and kissing her hand but so cunningly dodging about among the trees and moon shades that she never allowed him to get dangerously near her Thus they ran and doubled Fitzpiers warming with the chase till the sound of their companions had quite died away He began to lose hope of ever overtaking her when all at once by way of encouragement she turned to a fence in which there was a stile and leaped over it Outside the scene was a changed one a meadow where the half made hay lay about in heaps in the uninterrupted shine of the now high moon Fitzpiers saw in a moment that having taken to open ground she had placed herself at his mercy and he promptly vaulted over after her She flitted a little way down the mead when all at once her light form disappeared as if it had sunk into the earth She had buried herself in one of the hay cocks Fitzpiers now thoroughly excited was not going to let her escape him thus He approached and set about turning over the heaps one by one As soon as he paused tantalized and puzzled he was directed anew by an imitative kiss which came from her hiding place and by snatches of a local ballad in the smallest voice she could assume O come in from the foggy foggy dew In a minute or two he uncovered her Oh tis not Tim said she burying her face Fitzpiers however disregarded her resistance by reason of its mildness stooped and imprinted the purposed kiss then sunk down on the next hay cock panting with his race Whom do you mean by Tim he asked presently My young man Tim Tangs said she Now honor bright did you really think it was he I did at first But you didn t at last I didn t at last Do you much mind that it was not No she answered slyly Fitzpiers did not pursue his questioning In the moonlight Suke looked very beautiful the scratches and blemishes incidental to her out door occupation being invisible under these pale rays While they remain silent the coarse whir of the eternal night jar burst sarcastically from the top of a tree at the nearest corner of the wood Besides this not a sound of any kind reached their ears the time of nightingales being now past and Hintock lying at a distance of two miles at least In the opposite direction the hay field stretched away into remoteness till it was lost to the eye in a soft mist CHAPTER XXI When the general stampede occurred Winterborne had also been looking on and encountering one of the girls had asked her what caused them all to fly She said with solemn breathlessness that they had seen something very different from what they had hoped to see and that she for one would never attempt such unholy ceremonies again We saw Satan pursuing us with his hour glass It was terrible This account being a little incoherent Giles went forward towards the spot from which the girls had retreated After listening there a few minutes he heard slow footsteps rustling over the leaves and looking through a tangled screen of honeysuckle which hung from a bough he saw in the open space beyond a short stout man in evening dress carrying on one arm a light overcoat and also his hat so awkwardly arranged as possibly to have suggested the hour glass to his timid observers if this were the person whom the girls had seen With the other hand he silently gesticulated and the moonlight falling upon his bare brow showed him to have dark hair and a high forehead of the shape seen oftener in old prints and paintings than in real life His curious and altogether alien aspect his strange gestures like those of one who is rehearsing a scene to himself and the unusual place and hour were sufficient to account for any trepidation among the Hintock daughters at encountering him He paused and looked round as if he had forgotten where he was not observing Giles who was of the color of his environment The latter advanced into the light The gentleman held up his hand and came towards Giles the two meeting half way I have lost my way said the stranger Perhaps you can put me in the path again He wiped his forehead with the air of one suffering under an agitation more than that of simple fatigue The turnpike road is over there said Giles I don t want the turnpike road said the gentleman impatiently I came from that I want Hintock House Is there not a path to it across here Well yes a sort of path But it is hard to find from this point I ll show you the way sir with great pleasure Thanks my good friend The truth is that I decided to walk across the country after dinner from the hotel at Sherton where I am staying for a day or two But I did not know it was so far It is about a mile to the house from here They walked on together As there was no path Giles occasionally stepped in front and bent aside the underboughs of the trees to give his companion a passage saying every now and then when the twigs on being released flew back like whips Mind your eyes sir To which the stranger replied Yes yes in a preoccupied tone So they went on the leaf shadows running in their usual quick succession over the forms of the pedestrians till the stranger said Is it far Not much farther said Winterborne The plantation runs up into a corner here close behind the house He added with hesitation You know I suppose sir that missus Charmond is not at home You mistake said the other quickly missus Charmond has been away for some time but she s at home now Giles did not contradict him though he felt sure that the gentleman was wrong You are a native of this place the stranger said Yes Well you are happy in having a home It is what I don t possess You come from far seemingly I come now from the south of Europe Oh indeed sir You are an Italian or Spanish or French gentleman perhaps I am not either Giles did not fill the pause which ensued and the gentleman who seemed of an emotional nature unable to resist friendship at length answered the question I am an Italianized American a South Carolinian by birth he said I left my native country on the failure of the Southern cause and have never returned to it since He spoke no more about himself and they came to the verge of the wood Here striding over the fence out upon the upland sward they could at once see the chimneys of the house in the gorge immediately beneath their position silent still and pale Can you tell me the time the gentleman asked My watch has stopped It is between twelve and one said Giles His companion expressed his astonishment I thought it between nine and ten at latest Dear me dear me He now begged Giles to return and offered him a gold coin which looked like a sovereign for the assistance rendered Giles declined to accept anything to the surprise of the stranger who on putting the money back into his pocket said awkwardly I offered it because I want you to utter no word about this meeting with me Will you promise Winterborne promised readily He thereupon stood still while the other ascended the slope At the bottom he looked back dubiously Giles would no longer remain when he was so evidently desired to leave and returned through the boughs to Hintock He suspected that this man who seemed so distressed and melancholy might be that lover and persistent wooer of missus Charmond whom he had heard so frequently spoken of and whom it was said she had treated cavalierly But he received no confirmation of his suspicion beyond a report which reached him a few days later that a gentleman had called up the servants who were taking care of Hintock House at an hour past midnight and on learning that missus Charmond though returned from abroad was as yet in London he had sworn bitterly and gone away without leaving a card or any trace of himself The girls who related the story added that he sighed three times before he swore but this part of the narrative was not corroborated Anyhow such a gentleman had driven away from the hotel at Sherton next day in a carriage hired at that inn CHAPTER XXII The sunny leafy week which followed the tender doings of Midsummer Eve brought a visitor to Fitzpiers s door a voice that he knew sounded in the passage mister Melbury had called At first he had a particular objection to enter the parlor because his boots were dusty but as the surgeon insisted he waived the point and came in Looking neither to the right nor to the left hardly at Fitzpiers himself he put his hat under his chair and with a preoccupied gaze at the floor he said I ve called to ask you doctor quite privately a question that troubles me I ve a daughter Grace an only daughter as you may have heard Well she s been out in the dew on Midsummer Eve in particular she went out in thin slippers to watch some vagary of the Hintock maids and she s got a cough a distinct hemming and hacking that makes me uneasy Now I have decided to send her away to some seaside place for a change Send her away Fitzpiers s countenance had fallen Yes And the question is where would you advise me to send her The timber merchant had happened to call at a moment when Fitzpiers was at the spring tide of a sentiment that Grace was a necessity of his existence The sudden pressure of her form upon his breast as she came headlong round the bush had never ceased to linger with him ever since he adopted the manoeuvre for which the hour and the moonlight and the occasion had been the only excuse Now she was to be sent away Ambition it could be postponed Family culture and reciprocity of tastes had taken the place of family nowadays He allowed himself to be carried forward on the wave of his desire How strange how very strange it is he said that you should have come to me about her just now I have been thinking every day of coming to you on the very same errand Ah you have noticed too that her health I have noticed nothing the matter with her health because there is nothing But mister Melbury I have seen your daughter several times by accident I have admired her infinitely and I was coming to ask you if I may become better acquainted with her pay my addresses to her Melbury was looking down as he listened and did not see the air of half misgiving at his own rashness that spread over Fitzpiers s face as he made this declaration You have got to know her said Melbury a spell of dead silence having preceded his utterance during which his emotion rose with almost visible effect Yes said Fitzpiers And you wish to become better acquainted with her You mean with a view to marriage of course that is what you mean Yes said the young man I mean get acquainted with her with a view to being her accepted lover and if we suited each other what would naturally follow The timber merchant was much surprised and fairly agitated his hand trembled as he laid by his walking stick This takes me unawares said he his voice wellnigh breaking down I don t mean that there is anything unexpected in a gentleman being attracted by her but it did not occur to me that it would be you I always said continued he with a lump in his throat that my Grace would make a mark at her own level some day That was why I educated her I said to myself I ll do it cost what it may though her mother law was pretty frightened at my paying out so much money year after year I knew it would tell in the end Where you ve not good material to work on such doings would be waste and vanity I said But where you have that material it is sure to be worth while I am glad you don t object said Fitzpiers almost wishing that Grace had not been quite so cheap for him If she is willing I don t object certainly Indeed added the honest man it would be deceit if I were to pretend to feel anything else than highly honored personally and it is a great credit to her to have drawn to her a man of such good professional station and venerable old family That huntsman fellow little thought how wrong he was about her Take her and welcome sir I ll endeavor to ascertain her mind Yes yes But she will be agreeable I should think She ought to be I hope she may Well now you ll expect to see me frequently Oh yes But name it all about her cough and her going away I had quite forgot that that was what I came about I assure you said the surgeon that her cough can only be the result of a slight cold and it is not necessary to banish her to any seaside place at all Melbury looked unconvinced doubting whether he ought to take Fitzpiers s professional opinion in circumstances which naturally led him to wish to keep her there The doctor saw this and honestly dreading to lose sight of her he said eagerly Between ourselves if I am successful with her I will take her away myself for a month or two as soon as we are married which I hope will be before the chilly weather comes on This will be so very much better than letting her go now The proposal pleased Melbury much There could be hardly any danger in postponing any desirable change of air as long as the warm weather lasted and for such a reason Suddenly recollecting himself he said Your time must be precious doctor I ll get home along I am much obliged to ye As you will see her often you ll discover for yourself if anything serious is the matter I can assure you it is nothing said Fitzpiers who had seen Grace much oftener already than her father knew of When he was gone Fitzpiers paused silent registering his sensations like a man who has made a plunge for a pearl into a medium of which he knows not the density or temperature But he had done it and Grace was the sweetest girl alive As for the departed visitor his own last words lingered in Melbury s ears as he walked homeward he felt that what he had said in the emotion of the moment was very stupid ungenteel and unsuited to a dialogue with an educated gentleman the smallness of whose practice was more than compensated by the former greatness of his family He had uttered thoughts before they were weighed and almost before they were shaped They had expressed in a certain sense his feeling at Fitzpiers s news but yet they were not right Looking on the ground and planting his stick at each tread as if it were a flag staff he reached his own precincts where as he passed through the court he automatically stopped to look at the men working in the shed and around One of them asked him a question about wagon spokes Hey said Melbury looking hard at him The man repeated the words Melbury stood then turning suddenly away without answering he went up the court and entered the house As time was no object with the journeymen except as a thing to get past they leisurely surveyed the door through which he had disappeared What maggot has the gaffer got in his head now said Tangs the elder Sommit to do with that chiel of his When you ve got a maid of yer own John Upjohn that costs ye what she costs him that will take the squeak out of your Sunday shoes John But you ll never be tall enough to accomplish such as she and tis a lucky thing for ye John as things be Well he ought to have a dozen that would bring him to reason I see em walking together last Sunday and when they came to a puddle he lifted her over like a halfpenny doll He ought to have a dozen he d let em walk through puddles for themselves then Meanwhile Melbury had entered the house with the look of a man who sees a vision before him His wife was in the room Without taking off his hat he sat down at random Luce we ve done it he said Yes the thing is as I expected The spell that I foresaw might be worked has worked She s done it and done it well Where is she Grace I mean Up in her room what has happened mister Melbury explained the circumstances as coherently as he could I told you so he said A maid like her couldn t stay hid long even in a place like this But where is Grace Let s have her down Here Gra a ace She appeared after a reasonable interval for she was sufficiently spoiled by this father of hers not to put herself in a hurry however impatient his tones What is it father said she with a smile Why you scamp what s this you ve been doing Not home here more than six months yet instead of confining yourself to your father s rank making havoc in the educated classes Though accustomed to show herself instantly appreciative of her father s meanings Grace was fairly unable to look anyhow but at a loss now No no of course you don t know what I mean or you pretend you don t though for my part I believe women can see these things through a double hedge But I suppose I must tell ye Why you ve flung your grapnel over the doctor and he s coming courting forthwith Only think of that my dear Don t you feel it a triumph said missus Melbury Coming courting I ve done nothing to make him Grace exclaimed Twasn t necessary that you should Tis voluntary that rules in these things Well he has behaved very honorably and asked my consent You ll know what to do when he gets here I dare say I needn t tell you to make it all smooth for him You mean to lead him on to marry me I do Haven t I educated you for it Grace looked out of the window and at the fireplace with no animation in her face Why is it settled off hand in this way said she coquettishly You ll wait till you hear what I think of him I suppose Oh yes of course But you see what a good thing it will be She weighed the statement without speaking You will be restored to the society you ve been taken away from continued her father for I don t suppose he ll stay here long She admitted the advantage but it was plain that though Fitzpiers exercised a certain fascination over her when he was present or even more an almost psychic influence and though his impulsive act in the wood had stirred her feelings indescribably she had never regarded him in the light of a destined husband I don t know what to answer she said I have learned that he is very clever He s all right and he s coming here to see you A premonition that she could not resist him if he came strangely moved her Of course father you remember that it is only lately that Giles You know that you can t think of him He has given up all claim to you She could not explain the subtleties of her feeling as he could state his opinion even though she had skill in speech and her father had none That Fitzpiers acted upon her like a dram exciting her throwing her into a novel atmosphere which biassed her doings until the influence was over when she felt something of the nature of regret for the mood she had experienced still more if she reflected on the silent almost sarcastic criticism apparent in Winterborne s air towards her could not be told to this worthy couple in words It so happened that on this very day Fitzpiers was called away from Hintock by an engagement to attend some medical meetings and his visits therefore did not begin at once A note however arrived from him addressed to Grace deploring his enforced absence As a material object this note was pretty and superfine a note of a sort that she had been unaccustomed to see since her return to Hintock except when a school friend wrote to her a rare instance for the girls were respecters of persons and many cooled down towards the timber dealer s daughter when she was out of sight Thus the receipt of it pleased her and she afterwards walked about with a reflective air In the evening her father who knew that the note had come said Why be ye not sitting down to answer your letter That s what young folks did in my time She replied that it did not require an answer Oh you know best he said Nevertheless he went about his business doubting if she were right in not replying possibly she might be so mismanaging matters as to risk the loss of an alliance which would bring her much happiness Melbury s respect for Fitzpiers was based less on his professional position which was not much than on the standing of his family in the county in by gone days That implicit faith in members of long established families as such irrespective of their personal condition or character which is still found among old fashioned people in the rural districts reached its full intensity in Melbury His daughter s suitor was descended from a family he had heard of in his grandfather s time as being once great a family which had conferred its name upon a neighboring village how then could anything be amiss in this betrothal I must keep her up to this he said to his wife She sees it is for her happiness but still she s young and may want a little prompting from an older tongue CHAPTER XXIII With this in view he took her out for a walk a custom of his when he wished to say anything specially impressive Their way was over the top of that lofty ridge dividing their woodland from the cider district whence they had in the spring beheld the miles of apple trees in bloom All was now deep green The spot recalled to Grace s mind the last occasion of her presence there and she said The promise of an enormous apple crop is fulfilling itself is it not I suppose Giles is getting his mills and presses ready This was just what her father had not come there to talk about Without replying he raised his arm and moved his finger till he fixed it at a point There he said you see that plantation reaching over the hill like a great slug and just behind the hill a particularly green sheltered bottom That s where mister Fitzpiers s family were lords of the manor for I don t know how many hundred years and there stands the village of Buckbury Fitzpiers A wonderful property twas wonderful But they are not lords of the manor there now Why no But good and great things die as well as little and foolish The only ones representing the family now I believe are our doctor and a maiden lady living I don t know where You can t help being happy Grace in allying yourself with such a romantical family You ll feel as if you ve stepped into history We ve been at Hintock as long as they ve been at Buckbury is it not so You say our name occurs in old deeds continually Oh yes as yeomen copyholders and such like But think how much better this will be for ee You ll be living a high intellectual life such as has now become natural to you and though the doctor s practice is small here he ll no doubt go to a dashing town when he s got his hand in and keep a stylish carriage and you ll be brought to know a good many ladies of excellent society If you should ever meet me then Grace you can drive past me looking the other way I shouldn t expect you to speak to me or wish such a thing unless it happened to be in some lonely private place where twouldn t lower ye at all Don t think such men as neighbor Giles your equal He and I shall be good friends enough but he s not for the like of you He s lived our rough and homely life here and his wife s life must be rough and homely likewise So much pressure could not but produce some displacement As Grace was left very much to herself she took advantage of one fine day before Fitzpiers s return to drive into the aforesaid vale where stood the village of Buckbury Fitzpiers Leaving her father s man at the inn with the horse and gig she rambled onward to the ruins of a castle which stood in a field hard by She had no doubt that it represented the ancient stronghold of the Fitzpiers family The remains were few and consisted mostly of remnants of the lower vaulting supported on low stout columns surmounted by the crochet capital of the period The two or three arches of these vaults that were still in position were utilized by the adjoining farmer as shelter for his calves the floor being spread with straw amid which the young creatures rustled cooling their thirsty tongues by licking the quaint Norman carving which glistened with the moisture It was a degradation of even such a rude form of art as this to be treatad so grossly she thought and for the first time the family of Fitzpiers assumed in her imagination the hues of a melancholy romanticism It was soon time to drive home and she traversed the distance with a preoccupied mind The idea of so modern a man in science and aesthetics as the young surgeon springing out of relics so ancient was a kind of novelty she had never before experienced The combination lent him a social and intellectual interest which she dreaded so much weight did it add to the strange influence he exercised upon her whenever he came near her In an excitement which was not love not ambition rather a fearful consciousness of hazard in the air she awaited his return Meanwhile her father was awaiting him also In his house there was an old work on medicine published towards the end of the last century and to put himself in harmony with events Melbury spread this work on his knees when he had done his day s business and read about Galen Hippocrates and Herophilus of the dogmatic the empiric the hermetical and other sects of practitioners that have arisen in history and thence proceeded to the classification of maladies and the rules for their treatment as laid down in this valuable book with absolute precision Melbury regretted that the treatise was so old fearing that he might in consequence be unable to hold as complete a conversation as he could wish with mister Fitzpiers primed no doubt with more recent discoveries The day of Fitzpiers s return arrived and he sent to say that he would call immediately In the little time that was afforded for putting the house in order the sweeping of Melbury s parlor was as the sweeping of the parlor at the Interpreter s which wellnigh choked the Pilgrim At the end of it missus Melbury sat down folded her hands and lips and waited Her husband restlessly walked in and out from the timber yard stared at the interior of the room jerked out ay ay and retreated again Between four and five Fitzpiers arrived hitching his horse to the hook outside the door As soon as he had walked in and perceived that Grace was not in the room he seemed to have a misgiving Nothing less than her actual presence could long keep him to the level of this impassioned enterprise and that lacking he appeared as one who wished to retrace his steps He mechanically talked at what he considered a woodland matron s level of thought till a rustling was heard on the stairs and Grace came in Fitzpiers was for once as agitated as she Over and above the genuine emotion which she raised in his heart there hung the sense that he was casting a die by impulse which he might not have thrown by judgment mister Melbury was not in the room Having to attend to matters in the yard he had delayed putting on his afternoon coat and waistcoat till the doctor s appearance when not wishing to be backward in receiving him he entered the parlor hastily buttoning up those garments Grace s fastidiousness was a little distressed that Fitzpiers should see by this action the strain his visit was putting upon her father and to make matters worse for her just then old Grammer seemed to have a passion for incessantly pumping in the back kitchen leaving the doors open so that the banging and splashing were distinct above the parlor conversation Whenever the chat over the tea sank into pleasant desultoriness mister Melbury broke in with speeches of labored precision on very remote topics as if he feared to let Fitzpiers s mind dwell critically on the subject nearest the hearts of all In truth a constrained manner was natural enough in Melbury just now for the greatest interest of his life was reaching its crisis Could the real have been beheld instead of the corporeal merely the corner of the room in which he sat would have been filled with a form typical of anxious suspense large eyed tight lipped awaiting the issue That paternal hopes and fears so intense should be bound up in the person of one child so peculiarly circumstanced and not have dispersed themselves over the larger field of a whole family involved dangerous risks to future happiness Fitzpiers did not stay more than an hour but that time had apparently advanced his sentiments towards Grace once and for all from a vaguely liquescent to an organic shape She would not have accompanied him to the door in response to his whispered Come if her mother had not said in a matter of fact way Of course Grace go to the door with mister Fitzpiers Accordingly Grace went both her parents remaining in the room When the young pair were in the great brick floored hall the lover took the girl s hand in his drew it under his arm and thus led her on to the door where he stealthily kissed her She broke from him trembling blushed and turned aside hardly knowing how things had advanced to this Fitzpiers drove off kissing his hand to her and waving it to Melbury who was visible through the window Her father returned the surgeon s action with a great flourish of his own hand and a satisfied smile The intoxication that Fitzpiers had as usual produced in Grace s brain during the visit passed off somewhat with his withdrawal She felt like a woman who did not know what she had been doing for the previous hour but supposed with trepidation that the afternoon s proceedings though vague had amounted to an engagement between herself and the handsome coercive irresistible Fitzpiers This visit was a type of many which followed it during the long summer days of that year Grace was borne along upon a stream of reasonings arguments and persuasions supplemented it must be added by inclinations of her own at times No woman is without aspirations which may be innocent enough within certain limits and Grace had been so trained socially and educated intellectually as to see clearly enough a pleasure in the position of wife to such a man as Fitzpiers His material standing of itself either present or future had little in it to give her ambition but the possibilities of a refined and cultivated inner life of subtle psychological intercourse had their charm It was this rather than any vulgar idea of marrying well which caused her to float with the current and to yield to the immense influence which Fitzpiers exercised over her whenever she shared his society Any observer would shrewdly have prophesied that whether or not she loved him as yet in the ordinary sense she was pretty sure to do so in time One evening just before dusk they had taken a rather long walk together and for a short cut homeward passed through the shrubberies of Hintock House still deserted and still blankly confronting with its sightless shuttered windows the surrounding foliage and slopes Grace was tired and they approached the wall and sat together on one of the stone sills still warm with the sun that had been pouring its rays upon them all the afternoon This place would just do for us would it not dearest said her betrothed as they sat turning and looking idly at the old facade Oh yes said Grace plainly showing that no such fancy had ever crossed her mind She is away from home still Grace added in a minute rather sadly for she could not forget that she had somehow lost the valuable friendship of the lady of this bower Who is oh you mean missus Charmond Do you know dear that at one time I thought you lived here Indeed said Grace How was that He explained as far as he could do so without mentioning his disappointment at finding it was otherwise and then went on Well never mind that Now I want to ask you something There is one detail of our wedding which I am sure you will leave to me My inclination is not to be married at the horrid little church here with all the yokels staring round at us and a droning parson reading Where then can it be At a church in town No Not at a church at all At a registry office It is a quieter snugger and more convenient place in every way Oh said she with real distress How can I be married except at church and with all my dear friends round me Yeoman Winterborne among them Yes why not You know there was nothing serious between him and me You see dear a noisy bell ringing marriage at church has this objection in our case it would be a thing of report a long way round Now I would gently as gently as possible indicate to you how inadvisable such publicity would be if we leave Hintock and I purchase the practice that I contemplate purchasing at Budmouth hardly more than twenty miles off Forgive my saying that it will be far better if nobody there knows where you come from nor anything about your parents Your beauty and knowledge and manners will carry you anywhere if you are not hampered by such retrospective criticism But could it not be a quiet ceremony even at church she pleaded I don t see the necessity of going there he said a trifle impatiently Marriage is a civil contract and the shorter and simpler it is made the better People don t go to church when they take a house or even when they make a will Oh Edgar I don t like to hear you speak like that Well well I didn t mean to But I have mentioned as much to your father who has made no objection and why should you She gave way deeming the point one on which she ought to allow sentiment to give way to policy if there were indeed policy in his plan But she was indefinably depressed as they walked homeward CHAPTER XXIV 
4492-8904-0000	train-other-500	He left her at the door of her father s house As he receded and was clasped out of sight by the filmy shades he impressed Grace as a man who hardly appertained to her existence at all

4492-8904-0010	train-other-500	the white skirt of a long loose garment A gray arm stretching from within the porch adjusted the shawl over the woman s shoulders it was withdrawn and disappeared the door closing behind her
4492-8904-0011	train-other-500	The woman went quickly down the box edged path between the raspberries and currants and as she walked her well developed form and gait betrayed her individuality
none	none	 It was Suke Damson the affianced one of simple young 
4492-8904-0012	train-other-500	Tim Tangs At the bottom of the garden she entered the shelter of the tall hedge and only the top of her head could be seen hastening in the direction of her own dwelling
none	none	 Grace had recognized or thought she recognized in the gray arm stretching from the porch 
4492-8904-0013	train-other-500	the sleeve of a dressing gown which mister Fitzpiers had been wearing on her own memorable visit to him Her face fired red She had just before thought of dressing herself and taking a lonely walk under the trees
none	none	 so coolly green this early morning but she now sat down on her bed and fell into reverie It seemed as if hardly any time had passed when she heard the household moving briskly about and breakfast 
4492-8904-0014	train-other-500	preparing down stairs though on rousing herself to robe and descend she found that the sun was throwing his rays completely over the tree tops a progress of natural phenomena denoting that at least three hours had elapsed
none	none	 since she last looked out of the window 
4492-8904-0015	train-other-500	When attired she searched about the house for her father she found him at last in the garden stooping to examine the potatoes for signs of disease Hearing her rustle he stood up and stretched his back and arms saying
none	none	 Morning t ye Gracie 
4492-8904-0016	train-other-500	I congratulate ye It is only a month to day to the time She did not answer but without lifting her dress waded between the dewy rows of tall potato green into the middle of the plot where he was
4492-8904-0017	train-other-500	I have been thinking very much about my position this morning ever since it was light she began excitedly and trembling so that she could hardly stand And I feel it is a false one I wish not to marry mister Fitzpiers
4492-8904-0018	train-other-500	I wish not to marry anybody but I ll marry Giles Winterborne if you say I must as an alternative Her father s face settled into rigidity he turned pale and came deliberately out of the plot before he answered her
4492-8904-0019	train-other-500	She had never seen him look so incensed before Now hearken to me he said There s a time for a woman to alter her mind and there s a time when she can no longer alter it if she has any right eye to her parents honor
4492-8904-0020	train-other-500	and the seemliness of things
none	none	 That time has come 
4492-8904-0021	train-other-500	I won t say to ye you SHALL marry him But I will say that if you refuse I shall forever be ashamed and a weary of ye as a daughter and shall look upon you as the hope of my life no more
4492-8904-0022	train-other-500	What do you know about life and what it can bring forth and how you ought to act to lead up to best ends Oh you are an ungrateful maid Grace you ve seen that fellow Giles and he has got over ye
4492-8904-0023	train-other-500	that s where the secret lies I ll warrant me No father no It is not Giles it is something I cannot tell you of Well make fools of us all make us laughing stocks break it off have your own way
4492-8904-0024	train-other-500	But who knows of the engagement as yet how can breaking it disgrace you Melbury then by degrees admitted that he had mentioned the engagement
none	none	 to this acquaintance and to that 
4492-8904-0025	train-other-500	till she perceived that in his restlessness and pride he had published it everywhere
none	none	 She went dismally away to a bower of laurel at the top of the garden Her father followed her It is that Giles Winterborne he said with an upbraiding gaze at her No it is not though for that matter you encouraged him once she said troubled to the verge of despair It is not Giles it is mister Fitzpiers 
4492-8904-0026	train-other-500	You ve had a tiff a lovers tiff that s all I suppose It is some woman
none	none	 Ay ay you are jealous The old story 
4492-8904-0027	train-other-500	Don t tell me Now do you bide here I ll send Fitzpiers to you I saw him smoking in front of his house but a minute by gone He went off hastily out of the garden gate and down the lane But she would not stay where she was
4492-8904-0028	train-other-500	and edging through a slit in the garden fence walked away into the wood Just about here the trees were large and wide apart and there was no undergrowth so that she could be seen to some distance a sylph like greenish white creature
4492-8904-0029	train-other-500	as toned by the sunlight and leafage She heard a foot fall crushing dead leaves behind her and found herself reconnoitered by Fitzpiers himself approaching gay and fresh as the morning around them
4492-8904-0030	train-other-500	His remote gaze at her had been one of mild interest rather than of rapture But she looked so lovely in the green world about her her pink cheeks her simple light dress
4492-8904-0031	train-other-500	and the delicate flexibility of her movement acquired such rarity from their wild wood setting that his eyes kindled as he drew near My darling what is it Your father says you are in the pouts and jealous
4492-8904-0032	train-other-500	and I don t know what Ha ha ha
none	none	 as if there were any rival to you except vegetable nature in this home of recluses 
4492-8904-0033	train-other-500	We know better Jealous oh no
none	none	 it is not so said she gravely 
4492-8904-0034	train-other-500	That s a mistake of his and yours sir I spoke to him so closely about the question of marriage with you that he did not apprehend my state of mind
none	none	 But there s something wrong eh he asked eying her narrowly and bending to kiss her 
4492-8904-0035	train-other-500	She shrank away and his purposed kiss miscarried What is it he said more seriously for this little defeat She made no answer beyond mister Fitzpiers I have had no breakfast I must go in
4492-8904-0036	train-other-500	Come he insisted fixing his eyes upon her Tell me at once I say It was the greater strength against the smaller but she was mastered less by his manner than by her own sense of the unfairness of silence
none	none	 I looked out of the window 
4492-8904-0037	train-other-500	she said with hesitation I ll tell you by and by I must go in doors I have had no breakfast By a sort of divination his conjecture went straight to the fact Nor I said he lightly
4492-8904-0038	train-other-500	Indeed I rose late to day I have had a broken night or rather morning
none	none	 A girl of the village I don t know her name came and rang at my bell as soon as it was light between four and five I should think it was 
4492-8904-0039	train-other-500	perfectly maddened with an aching tooth As no body heard her ring she threw some gravel at my window till at last I heard her and slipped on my dressing gown and went down The poor thing begged me with tears in her eyes to take out her tormentor
4492-8904-0040	train-other-500	if I dragged her head off Down she sat and out it came a lovely molar not a speck upon it and off she went with it in her handkerchief
none	none	 much contented though it would have done good work for her for fifty years to come 
4492-8904-0041	train-other-500	It was all so plausible so completely explained Knowing nothing of the incident in the wood on old Midsummer eve Grace felt that her suspicions were unworthy and absurd and with the readiness of an honest heart
4492-8904-0042	train-other-500	she jumped at the opportunity of honoring his word At the moment of her mental liberation the bushes about the garden had moved and her father emerged into the shady glade Well I hope it is made up he said cheerily
4492-8904-0043	train-other-500	Oh yes said Fitzpiers with his eyes fixed on Grace whose eyes were shyly bent downward Now said her father tell me the pair of ye
none	none	 that you still mean to take one another for good and all and on the strength o t you shall have another couple of hundred paid down I swear it by the name 
4492-8904-0044	train-other-500	Fitzpiers took her hand We declare it do we not my dear Grace said he Relieved of her doubt somewhat overawed and ever anxious to please she was disposed to settle the matter yet womanlike
4492-8904-0045	train-other-500	she would not relinquish her opportunity
none	none	 of asking a concession of some sort 
4492-8904-0046	train-other-500	If our wedding can be at church I say yes she answered in a measured voice If not I say no Fitzpiers was generous in his turn It shall be so he rejoined gracefully
4492-8904-0047	train-other-500	To holy church we ll go and much good may it do us They returned through the bushes indoors Grace walking full of thought between the other two somewhat comforted both by Fitzpiers s ingenious explanation and by the sense that she was not
4492-8904-0048	train-other-500	to be deprived of a religious ceremony
none	none	 So let it be she said to herself 
4492-8904-0049	train-other-500	Pray God it is for the best From this hour there was no serious attempt at recalcitration on her part Fitzpiers kept himself continually near her dominating any rebellious impulse
4492-8904-0050	train-other-500	and shaping her will into passive concurrence with all his desires Apart from his lover like anxiety to possess her the few golden hundreds of the timber dealer ready to hand formed a warm background to Grace s lovely face
4492-8904-0051	train-other-500	and went some way to remove his uneasiness at the prospect of endangering his professional and social chances by an alliance with the family of a simple countryman The interim closed up its perspective
4492-8904-0052	train-other-500	surely and silently Whenever Grace had any doubts of her position the sense of contracting time was like a shortening chamber at other moments she was comparatively blithe Day after day waxed and waned
4492-8904-0053	train-other-500	the one or two woodmen who sawed shaped spokeshaved on her father s premises at this inactive season of the year regularly came and unlocked the doors in the morning locked them in the evening supped
4492-8904-0054	train-other-500	leaned over their garden gates for a whiff of evening air and to catch any last and farthest throb of news from the outer world which entered and expired at Little Hintock like the exhausted swell of a wave in some innermost cavern
4492-8904-0055	train-other-500	of some innermost creek of an embayed sea yet no news interfered with the nuptial purpose at their neighbor s house The sappy green twig tips of the season s growth would not she thought be appreciably woodier
4492-8904-0056	train-other-500	on the day she became a wife so near was the time the tints of the foliage would hardly have changed Everything was so much as usual that no itinerant stranger would have supposed a woman s fate to be hanging in the balance at that summer s decline
4492-8904-0057	train-other-500	But there were preparations imaginable readily enough by those who had special knowledge In the remote and fashionable town of Sandbourne something was growing up under the hands of several persons who had never seen Grace Melbury
4492-8904-0058	train-other-500	never would see her or care anything about her at all though their creation had such interesting relation to her life that it would enclose her very heart at a moment when that heart would beat if not with more emotional ardor
4492-8904-0059	train-other-500	at least with more emotional turbulence than at any previous time Why did missus Dollery s van instead of passing along at the end of the smaller village to Great Hintock direct turn one Saturday night into Little Hintock Lane
4492-8904-0060	train-other-500	and never pull up till it reached mister Melbury s gates The gilding shine of evening fell upon a large flat box not less than a yard square and safely tied with cord as it was handed out from under the tilt
4492-8904-0061	train-other-500	with a great deal of care But it was not heavy for its size missus Dollery herself carried it into the house
none	none	 Tim Tangs the hollow turner Bawtree Suke Damson and others looked knowing 
4492-8904-0062	train-other-500	and made remarks to each other as they watched its entrance Melbury stood at the door of the timber shed in the attitude of a man to whom such an arrival was a trifling domestic detail with which he did not condescend to be concerned
4492-8904-0063	train-other-500	Yet he well divined the contents of that box and was in truth all the while in a pleasant exaltation at the proof that thus far at any rate no disappointment had supervened
none	none	 While missus Dollery remained which was rather long from her sense of the importance of her errand he went into the out house but as soon as she had had her say 
4492-8904-0064	train-other-500	been paid and had rumbled away he entered the dwelling
none	none	 to find there what he knew he should find 
4492-8904-0065	train-other-500	his wife and daughter in a flutter of excitement over the wedding gown just arrived from the leading dress maker of Sandbourne watering place aforesaid During these weeks Giles Winterborne was nowhere to be seen or heard of
4492-8904-0066	train-other-500	At the close of his tenure in Hintock he had sold some of his furniture
none	none	 packed up the rest a few pieces endeared by associations or necessary to his occupation 
4492-8904-0067	train-other-500	in the house of a friendly neighbor and gone away People said that a certain laxity had crept into his life that he had never gone near a church latterly and had been sometimes seen on Sundays with unblacked boots lying on his elbow under a tree
4492-8904-0068	train-other-500	with a cynical gaze at surrounding objects He was likely to return to Hintock when the cider making season came round his apparatus being stored there and travel with his mill and press from village to village
4492-8904-0069	train-other-500	The narrow interval that stood before the day diminished yet There was in Grace s mind sometimes a certain anticipative satisfaction the satisfaction of feeling that she would be the heroine of an hour
4492-8904-0070	train-other-500	moreover she was proud as a cultivated woman to be the wife of a cultivated man It was an opportunity denied very frequently to young women in her position nowadays not a few
4492-8904-0071	train-other-500	those in whom parental discovery of the value of education has implanted tastes which parental circles fail to gratify But what an attenuation was this cold pride of the dream of her youth
4492-8904-0072	train-other-500	in which she had pictured herself walking in state towards the altar flushed by the purple light and bloom of her own passion without a single misgiving as to the sealing of the bond and fervently receiving as her due
4492-8904-0073	train-other-500	The homage of a thousand hearts the fond deep love of one Everything had been clear then in imagination now something was undefined She had little carking anxieties a curious fatefulness seemed to rule her
4492-8904-0074	train-other-500	and she experienced a mournful want of some one to confide in The day loomed so big and nigh that her prophetic ear could in fancy catch the noise of it hear the murmur of the villagers as she came out of church
4492-8904-0075	train-other-500	imagine the jangle of the three thin toned Hintock bells The dialogues seemed to grow louder and the ding ding dong of those three crazed bells more persistent She awoke the morning had come
none	none	 Five hours later she was the wife of Fitzpiers CHAPTER XXV The chief hotel at Sherton Abbas was an old stone fronted inn with a yawning arch under which vehicles were driven by stooping coachmen to back premises of wonderful commodiousness The windows to the street were mullioned into narrow lights and only commanded a view of the opposite houses hence perhaps it arose that the best and most luxurious private sitting room that the inn could afford over looked the nether parts of the establishment where beyond the yard were to be seen gardens and orchards now bossed nay incrusted with scarlet and gold fruit stretching to infinite distance under a luminous lavender mist The time was early autumn When the fair apples red as evening sky Do bend the tree unto the fruitful ground When juicy pears and berries of black dye Do dance in air and call the eyes around The landscape confronting the window might indeed have been part of the identical stretch of country which the youthful Chatterton had in his mind In this room sat she who had been the maiden Grace Melbury till the finger of fate touched her and turned her to a wife It was two months after the wedding and she was alone Fitzpiers had walked out to see the abbey by the light of sunset but she had been too fatigued to accompany him They had reached the last stage of a long eight weeks tour and were going on to Hintock that night In the yard between Grace and the orchards there progressed a scene natural to the locality at this time of the year An apple mill and press had been erected on the spot to which some men were bringing fruit from divers points in mawn baskets while others were grinding them and others wringing down the pomace whose sweet juice gushed forth into tubs and pails The superintendent of these proceedings to whom the others spoke as master was a young yeoman of prepossessing manner and aspect whose form she recognized in a moment He had hung his coat to a nail of the out house wall and wore his shirt sleeves rolled up beyond his elbows to keep them unstained while he rammed the pomace into the bags of horse hair Fragments of apple rind had alighted upon the brim of his hat probably from the bursting of a bag while brown pips of the same fruit were sticking among the down upon his fine round arms She realized in a moment how he had come there Down in the heart of the apple country nearly every farmer kept up a cider making apparatus and wring house for his own use building up the pomace in great straw cheeses as they were called but here on the margin of Pomona s plain was a debatable land neither orchard nor sylvan exclusively where the apple produce was hardly sufficient to warrant each proprietor in keeping a mill of his own This was the field of the travelling cider maker His press and mill were fixed to wheels instead of being set up in a cider house and with a couple of horses buckets tubs strainers and an assistant or two he wandered from place to place deriving very satisfactory returns for his trouble in such a prolific season as the present The back parts of the town were just now abounding with apple gatherings They stood in the yards in carts baskets and loose heaps and the blue stagnant air of autumn which hung over everything was heavy with a sweet cidery smell Cakes of pomace lay against the walls in the yellow sun where they were drying to be used as fuel Yet it was not the great make of the year as yet before the standard crop came in there accumulated in abundant times like this a large superfluity of early apples and windfalls from the trees of later harvest which would not keep long Thus in the baskets and quivering in the hopper of the mill she saw specimens of mixed dates including the mellow countenances of streaked jacks codlins costards stubbards ratheripes and other well known friends of her ravenous youth Grace watched the head man with interest The slightest sigh escaped her Perhaps she thought of the day not so far distant when that friend of her childhood had met her by her father s arrangement in this same town warm with hope though diffident and trusting in a promise rather implied than given Or she might have thought of days earlier yet days of childhood when her mouth was somewhat more ready to receive a kiss from his than was his to bestow one However all that was over She had felt superior to him then and she felt superior to him now She wondered why he never looked towards her open window She did not know that in the slight commotion caused by their arrival at the inn that afternoon Winterborne had caught sight of her through the archway had turned red and was continuing his work with more concentrated attention on the very account of his discovery Robert Creedle too who travelled with Giles had been incidentally informed by the hostler that doctor Fitzpiers and his young wife were in the hotel after which news Creedle kept shaking his head and saying to himself Ah very audibly between his thrusts at the screw of the cider press Why the deuce do you sigh like that Robert asked Winterborne at last Ah maister tis my thoughts tis my thoughts Yes ye ve lost a hundred load o timber well seasoned ye ve lost five hundred pound in good money ye ve lost the stone windered house that s big enough to hold a dozen families ye ve lost your share of half a dozen good wagons and their horses all lost through your letting slip she that was once yer own Good God Creedle you ll drive me mad said Giles sternly Don t speak of that any more Thus the subject had ended in the yard Meanwhile the passive cause of all this loss still regarded the scene She was beautifully dressed she was seated in the most comfortable room that the inn afforded her long journey had been full of variety and almost luxuriously performed for Fitzpiers did not study economy where pleasure was in question Hence it perhaps arose that Giles and all his belongings seemed sorry and common to her for the moment moving in a plane so far removed from her own of late that she could scarcely believe she had ever found congruity therein No I could never have married him she said gently shaking her head Dear father was right It would have been too coarse a life for me And she looked at the rings of sapphire and opal upon her white and slender fingers that had been gifts from Fitzpiers Seeing that Giles still kept his back turned and with a little of the above described pride of life easily to be understood and possibly excused in a young inexperienced woman who thought she had married well she said at last with a smile on her lips mister Winterborne He appeared to take no heed and she said a second time mister Winterborne Even now he seemed not to hear though a person close enough to him to see the expression of his face might have doubted it and she said a third time with a timid loudness mister Winterborne What have you forgotten my voice She remained with her lips parted in a welcoming smile He turned without surprise and came deliberately towards the window Why do you call me he said with a sternness that took her completely unawares his face being now pale Is it not enough that you see me here moiling and muddling for my daily bread while you are sitting there in your success that you can t refrain from opening old wounds by calling out my name She flushed and was struck dumb for some moments but she forgave his unreasoning anger knowing so well in what it had its root I am sorry I offended you by speaking she replied meekly Believe me I did not intend to do that I could hardly sit here so near you without a word of recognition Winterborne s heart had swollen big and his eyes grown moist by this time so much had the gentle answer of that familiar voice moved him He assured her hurriedly and without looking at her that he was not angry He then managed to ask her in a clumsy constrained way if she had had a pleasant journey and seen many interesting sights She spoke of a few places that she had visited and so the time passed till he withdrew to take his place at one of the levers which pulled round the screw Forgotten her voice Indeed he had not forgotten her voice as his bitterness showed But though in the heat of the moment he had reproached her keenly his second mood was a far more tender one that which could regard her renunciation of such as he as her glory and her privilege his own fidelity notwithstanding He could have declared with a contemporary poet If I forget The salt creek may forget the ocean If I forget The heart whence flows my heart s bright motion May I sink meanlier than the worst Abandoned outcast crushed accurst If I forget Though you forget No word of mine shall mar your pleasure Though you forget You filled my barren life with treasure You may withdraw the gift you gave You still are queen I still am slave Though you forget She had tears in her eyes at the thought that she could not remind him of what he ought to have remembered that not herself but the pressure of events had dissipated the dreams of their early youth Grace was thus unexpectedly worsted in her encounter with her old friend She had opened the window with a faint sense of triumph but he had turned it into sadness she did not quite comprehend the reason why In truth it was because she was not cruel enough in her cruelty If you have to use the knife use it say the great surgeons and for her own peace Grace should have contemned Winterborne thoroughly or not at all As it was on closing the window an indescribable some might have said dangerous pity quavered in her bosom for him Presently her husband entered the room and told her what a wonderful sunset there was to be seen I have not noticed it But I have seen somebody out there that we know she replied looking into the court Fitzpiers followed the direction of her eyes and said he did not recognize anybody Why mister Winterborne there he is cider making He combines that with his other business you know Oh that fellow said Fitzpiers his curiosity becoming extinct She reproachfully What call mister Winterborne a fellow Edgar It is true I was just saying to myself that I never could have married him but I have much regard for him and always shall Well do by all means my dear one I dare say I am inhuman and supercilious and contemptibly proud of my poor old ramshackle family but I do honestly confess to you that I feel as if I belonged to a different species from the people who are working in that yard And from me too then For my blood is no better than theirs He looked at her with a droll sort of awakening It was indeed a startling anomaly that this woman of the tribe without should be standing there beside him as his wife if his sentiments were as he had said In their travels together she had ranged so unerringly at his level in ideas tastes and habits that he had almost forgotten how his heart had played havoc with his principles in taking her to him Ah YOU you are refined and educated into something quite different he said self assuringly I don t quite like to think that she murmured with soft regret And I think you underestimate Giles Winterborne Remember I was brought up with him till I was sent away to school so I cannot be radically different At any rate I don t feel so That is no doubt my fault and a great blemish in me But I hope you will put up with it Edgar Fitzpiers said that he would endeavor to do so and as it was now getting on for dusk they prepared to perform the last stage of their journey so as to arrive at Hintock before it grew very late In less than half an hour they started the cider makers in the yard having ceased their labors and gone away so that the only sounds audible there now were the trickling of the juice from the tightly screwed press and the buzz of a single wasp which had drunk itself so tipsy that it was unconscious of nightfall Grace was very cheerful at the thought of being soon in her sylvan home but Fitzpiers sat beside her almost silent An indescribable oppressiveness had overtaken him with the near approach of the journey s end and the realities of life that lay there You don t say a word Edgar she observed Aren t you glad to get back I am You have friends here I have none But my friends are yours Oh yes in that sense The conversation languished and they drew near the end of Hintock Lane It had been decided that they should at least for a time take up their abode in her father s roomy house one wing of which was quite at their service being almost disused by the Melburys Workmen had been painting papering and whitewashing this set of rooms in the wedded pair s absence and so scrupulous had been the timber dealer that there should occur no hitch or disappointment on their arrival that not the smallest detail remained undone To make it all complete a ground floor room had been fitted up as a surgery with an independent outer door to which Fitzpiers s brass plate was screwed for mere ornament such a sign being quite superfluous where everybody knew the latitude and longitude of his neighbors for miles round Melbury and his wife welcomed the twain with affection and all the house with deference They went up to explore their rooms that opened from a passage on the left hand of the staircase the entrance to which could be shut off on the landing by a door that Melbury had hung for the purpose A friendly fire was burning in the grate although it was not cold Fitzpiers said it was too soon for any sort of meal they only having dined shortly before leaving Sherton Abbas He would walk across to his old lodging to learn how his locum tenens had got on in his absence In leaving Melbury s door he looked back at the house There was economy in living under that roof and economy was desirable but in some way he was dissatisfied with the arrangement it immersed him so deeply in son in lawship to Melbury He went on to his former residence His deputy was out and Fitzpiers fell into conversation with his former landlady Well missus Cox what s the best news he asked of her with cheery weariness She was a little soured at losing by his marriage so profitable a tenant as the surgeon had proved to be duling his residence under her roof and the more so in there being hardly the remotest chance of her getting such another settler in the Hintock solitudes Tis what I don t wish to repeat sir least of all to you she mumbled Never mind me missus Cox go ahead It is what people say about your hasty marrying doctor Fitzpiers Whereas they won t believe you know such clever doctrines in physic as they once supposed of ye seeing as you could marry into mister Melbury s family which is only Hintock born such as me They are kindly welcome to their opinion said Fitzpiers not allowing himself to recognize that he winced Anything else Yes SHE S come home at last Who s she missus Charmond Oh indeed said Fitzpiers with but slight interest I ve never seen her She has seen you sir whether or no Never Yes she saw you in some hotel or street for a minute or two while you were away travelling and accidentally heard your name and when she made some remark about you Miss Ellis that s her maid told her you was on your wedding tower with mister Melbury s daughter and she said He ought to have done better than that I fear he has spoiled his chances she says Fitzpiers did not talk much longer to this cheering housewife and walked home with no very brisk step He entered the door quietly and went straight up stairs to the drawing room extemporized for their use by Melbury in his and his bride s absence expecting to find her there as he had left her The fire was burning still but there were no lights He looked into the next apartment fitted up as a little dining room but no supper was laid He went to the top of the stairs and heard a chorus of voices in the timber merchant s parlor below Grace s being occasionally intermingled Descending and looking into the room from the door way he found quite a large gathering of neighbors and other acquaintances praising and congratulating missus Fitzpiers on her return among them being the dairyman Farmer Bawtree and the master blacksmith from Great Hintock also the cooper the hollow turner the exciseman and some others with their wives who lived hard by Grace girl that she was had quite forgotten her new dignity and her husband s she was in the midst of them blushing and receiving their compliments with all the pleasure of old comradeship Fitzpiers experienced a profound distaste for the situation Melbury was nowhere in the room but Melbury s wife perceiving the doctor came to him We thought Grace and I she said that as they have called hearing you were come we could do no less than ask them to supper and then Grace proposed that we should all sup together as it is the first night of your return By this time Grace had come round to him Is it not good of them to welcome me so warmly she exclaimed with tears of friendship in her eyes After so much good feeling I could not think of our shutting ourselves up away from them in our own dining room Certainly not certainly not said Fitzpiers and he entered the room with the heroic smile of a martyr As soon as they sat down to table Melbury came in and seemed to see at once that Fitzpiers would much rather have received no such demonstrative reception He thereupon privately chid his wife for her forwardness in the matter missus Melbury declared that it was as much Grace s doing as hers after which there was no more to be said by that young woman s tender father By this time Fitzpiers was making the best of his position among the wide elbowed and genial company who sat eating and drinking and laughing and joking around him and getting warmed himself by the good cheer was obliged to admit that after all the supper was not the least enjoyable he had ever known At times however the words about his having spoiled his opportunities repeated to him as those of missus Charmond haunted him like a handwriting on the wall Then his manner would become suddenly abstracted At one moment he would mentally put an indignant query why missus Charmond or any other woman should make it her business to have opinions about his opportunities at another he thought that he could hardly be angry with her for taking an interest in the doctor of her own parish Then he would drink a glass of grog and so get rid of the misgiving These hitches and quaffings were soon perceived by Grace as well as by her father and hence both of them were much relieved when the first of the guests to discover that the hour was growing late rose and declared that he must think of moving homeward At the words Melbury rose as alertly as if lifted by a spring and in ten minutes they were gone Now Grace said her husband as soon as he found himself alone with her in their private apartments we ve had a very pleasant evening and everybody has been very kind But we must come to an understanding about our way of living here If we continue in these rooms there must be no mixing in with your people below I can t stand it and that s the truth She had been sadly surprised at the suddenness of his distaste for those old fashioned woodland forms of life which in his courtship he had professed to regard with so much interest But she assented in a moment We must be simply your father s tenants he continued and our goings and comings must be as independent as if we lived elsewhere Certainly Edgar I quite see that it must be so But you joined in with all those people in my absence without knowing whether I should approve or disapprove When I came I couldn t help myself at all She sighing Yes I see I ought to have waited though they came unexpectedly and I thought I had acted for the best Thus the discussion ended and the next day Fitzpiers went on his old rounds as usual But it was easy for so super subtle an eye as his to discern or to think he discerned that he was no longer regarded as an extrinsic unfathomed gentleman of limitless potentiality scientific and social but as mister Melbury s compeer and therefore in a degree only one of themselves The Hintock woodlandlers held with all the strength of inherited conviction to the aristocratic principle and as soon as they had discovered that Fitzpiers was one of the old Buckbury Fitzpierses they had accorded to him for nothing a touching of hat brims promptness of service and deference of approach which Melbury had to do without though he paid for it over and over But now having proved a traitor to his own cause by this marriage Fitzpiers was believed in no more as a superior hedged by his own divinity while as doctor he began to be rated no higher than old Jones whom they had so long despised His few patients seemed in his two months absence to have dwindled considerably in number and no sooner had he returned than there came to him from the Board of Guardians a complaint that a pauper had been neglected by his substitute In a fit of pride Fitzpiers resigned his appointment as one of the surgeons to the union which had been the nucleus of his practice here At the end of a fortnight he came in doors one evening to Grace more briskly than usual They have written to me again about that practice in Budmouth that I once negotiated for he said to her The premium asked is eight hundred pounds and I think that between your father and myself it ought to be raised Then we can get away from this place forever The question had been mooted between them before and she was not unprepared to consider it They had not proceeded far with the discussion when a knock came to the door and in a minute Grammer ran up to say that a message had arrived from Hintock House requesting doctor Fitzpiers to attend there at once missus Charmond had met with a slight accident through the overturning of her carriage This is something anyhow said Fitzpiers rising with an interest which he could not have defined I have had a presentiment that this mysterious woman and I were to be better acquainted The latter words were murmured to himself alone Good night said Grace as soon as he was ready I shall be asleep probably when you return Good night he replied inattentively and went down stairs It was the first time since their marriage that he had left her without a kiss CHAPTER XXVI Winterborne s house had been pulled down On this account his face had been seen but fitfully in Hintock and he would probably have disappeared from the place altogether but for his slight business connection with Melbury on whose premises Giles kept his cider making apparatus now that he had no place of his own to stow it in Coming here one evening on his way to a hut beyond the wood where he now slept he noticed that the familiar brown thatched pinion of his paternal roof had vanished from its site and that the walls were levelled In present circumstances he had a feeling for the spot that might have been called morbid and when he had supped in the hut aforesaid he made use of the spare hour before bedtime to return to Little Hintock in the twilight and ramble over the patch of ground on which he had first seen the day He repeated this evening visit on several like occasions Even in the gloom he could trace where the different rooms had stood could mark the shape of the kitchen chimney corner in which he had roasted apples and potatoes in his boyhood cast his bullets and burned his initials on articles that did and did not belong to him The apple trees still remained to show where the garden had been the oldest of them even now retaining the crippled slant to north east given them by the great November gale of eighteen twenty four which carried a brig bodily over the Chesil Bank They were at present bent to still greater obliquity by the heaviness of their produce Apples bobbed against his head and in the grass beneath he crunched scores of them as he walked There was nobody to gather them now It was on the evening under notice that half sitting half leaning against one of these inclined trunks Winterborne had become lost in his thoughts as usual till one little star after another had taken up a position in the piece of sky which now confronted him where his walls and chimneys had formerly raised their outlines The house had jutted awkwardly into the road and the opening caused by its absence was very distinct In the silence the trot of horses and the spin of carriage wheels became audible and the vehicle soon shaped itself against the blank sky bearing down upon him with the bend in the lane which here occurred and of which the house had been the cause He could discern the figure of a woman high up on the driving seat of a phaeton a groom being just visible behind Presently there was a slight scrape then a scream Winterborne went across to the spot and found the phaeton half overturned its driver sitting on the heap of rubbish which had once been his dwelling and the man seizing the horses heads The equipage was missus Charmond s and the unseated charioteer that lady herself To his inquiry if she were hurt she made some incoherent reply to the effect that she did not know The damage in other respects was little or none the phaeton was righted missus Charmond placed in it and the reins given to the servant It appeared that she had been deceived by the removal of the house imagining the gap caused by the demolition to be the opening of the road so that she turned in upon the ruins instead of at the bend a few yards farther on Drive home drive home cried the lady impatiently and they started on their way They had not however gone many paces when the air being still Winterborne heard her say Stop tell that man to call the doctor mister Fitzpiers and send him on to the House I find I am hurt more seriously than I thought Winterborne took the message from the groom and proceeded to the doctor s at once Having delivered it he stepped back into the darkness and waited till he had seen Fitzpiers leave the door He stood for a few minutes looking at the window which by its light revealed the room where Grace was sitting and went away under the gloomy trees Fitzpiers duly arrived at Hintock House whose doors he now saw open for the first time Contrary to his expectation there was visible no sign of that confusion or alarm which a serious accident to the mistress of the abode would have occasioned He was shown into a room at the top of the staircase cosily and femininely draped where by the light of the shaded lamp he saw a woman of full round figure reclining upon a couch in such a position as not to disturb a pile of magnificent hair on the crown of her head A deep purple dressing gown formed an admirable foil to the peculiarly rich brown of her hair plaits her left arm which was naked nearly up to the shoulder was thrown upward and between the fingers of her right hand she held a cigarette while she idly breathed from her plump lips a thin stream of smoke towards the ceiling The doctor s first feeling was a sense of his exaggerated prevision in having brought appliances for a serious case the next something more curious While the scene and the moment were new to him and unanticipated the sentiment and essence of the moment were indescribably familiar What could be the cause of it Probably a dream missus Charmond did not move more than to raise her eyes to him and he came and stood by her She glanced up at his face across her brows and forehead and then he observed a blush creep slowly over her decidedly handsome cheeks Her eyes which had lingered upon him with an inquiring conscious expression were hastily withdrawn and she mechanically applied the cigarette again to her lips For a moment he forgot his errand till suddenly arousing himself he addressed her formally condoled with her and made the usual professional inquiries about what had happened to her and where she was hurt That s what I want you to tell me she murmured in tones of indefinable reserve I quite believe in you for I know you are very accomplished because you study so hard I ll do my best to justify your good opinion said the young man bowing And none the less that I am happy to find the accident has not been serious I am very much shaken she said Oh yes he replied and completed his examination which convinced him that there was really nothing the matter with her and more than ever puzzled him as to why he had been fetched since she did not appear to be a timid woman You must rest a while and I ll send something he said Oh I forgot she returned Look here And she showed him a little scrape on her arm the full round arm that was exposed Put some court plaster on that please He obeyed And now she said before you go I want to put a question to you Sit round there in front of me on that low chair and bring the candles or one to the little table Do you smoke Yes That s right I am learning Take one of these and here s a light She threw a matchbox across Fitzpiers caught it and having lit up regarded her from his new position which with the shifting of the candles for the first time afforded him a full view of her face How many years have passed since first we met she resumed in a voice which she mainly endeavored to maintain at its former pitch of composure and eying him with daring bashfulness WE met do you say She nodded I saw you recently at an hotel in London when you were passing through I suppose with your bride and I recognized you as one I had met in my girlhood Do you remember when you were studying at Heidelberg an English family that was staying there who used to walk And the young lady who wore a long tail of rare colored hair ah I see it before my eyes who lost her gloves on the Great Terrace who was going back in the dusk to find them to whom I said I ll go for them and you said Oh they are not worth coming all the way up again for I DO remember and how very long we stayed talking there I went next morning while the dew was on the grass there they lay the little fingers sticking out damp and thin I see them now I picked them up and then Well I kissed them he rejoined rather shamefacedly But you had hardly ever seen me except in the dusk Never mind I was young then and I kissed them I wondered how I could make the most of my trouvaille and decided that I would call at your hotel with them that afternoon It rained and I waited till next day I called and you were gone Yes answered she with dry melancholy My mother knowing my disposition said she had no wish for such a chit as me to go falling in love with an impecunious student and spirited me away to Baden As it is all over and past I ll tell you one thing I should have sent you a line passing warm had I known your name That name I never knew till my maid said as you passed up the hotel stairs a month ago There s doctor Fitzpiers Good Heaven said Fitzpiers musingly How the time comes back to me The evening the morning the dew the spot When I found that you really were gone it was as if a cold iron had been passed down my back I went up to where you had stood when I last saw you I flung myself on the grass and being not much more than a boy my eyes were literally blinded with tears Nameless unknown to me as you were I couldn t forget your voice For how long Oh ever so long Days and days Days and days ONLY days and days Oh the heart of a man Days and days But my dear madam I had not known you more than a day or two It was not a full blown love it was the merest bud red fresh vivid but small It was a colossal passion in posse a giant in embryo It never matured So much the better perhaps Perhaps But see how powerless is the human will against predestination We were prevented meeting we have met One feature of the case remains the same amid many changes You are still rich and I am still poor Better than that you have judging by your last remark outgrown the foolish impulsive passions of your early girl hood I have not outgrown mine I beg your pardon said she with vibrations of strong feeling in her words I have been placed in a position which hinders such outgrowings Besides I don t believe that the genuine subjects of emotion do outgrow them I believe that the older such people get the worse they are Possibly at ninety or a hundred they may feel they are cured but a mere threescore and ten won t do it at least for me He gazed at her in undisguised admiration Here was a soul of souls missus Charmond you speak truly he exclaimed But you speak sadly as well Why is that I always am sad when I come here she said dropping to a low tone with a sense of having been too demonstrative Then may I inquire why you came A man brought me Women are always carried about like corks upon the waves of masculine desires I hope I have not alarmed you but Hintock has the curious effect of bottling up the emotions till one can no longer hold them I am often obliged to fly away and discharge my sentiments somewhere or I should die outright There is very good society in the county for those who have the privilege of entering it Perhaps so But the misery of remote country life is that your neighbors have no toleration for difference of opinion and habit My neighbors think I am an atheist except those who think I am a Roman Catholic and when I speak disrespectfully of the weather or the crops they think I am a blasphemer She broke into a low musical laugh at the idea You don t wish me to stay any longer he inquired when he found that she remained musing No I think not Then tell me that I am to be gone Why Cannot you go without I may consult my own feelings only if left to myself Well if you do what then Do you suppose you ll be in my way I feared it might be so Then fear no more But good night Come to morrow and see if I am going on right This renewal of acquaintance touches me I have already a friendship for you If it depends upon myself it shall last forever My best hopes that it may Good by Fitzpiers went down the stairs absolutely unable to decide whether she had sent for him in the natural alarm which might have followed her mishap or with the single view of making herself known to him as she had done for which the capsize had afforded excellent opportunity Outside the house he mused over the spot under the light of the stars It seemed very strange that he should have come there more than once when its inhabitant was absent and observed the house with a nameless interest that he should have assumed off hand before he knew Grace that it was here she lived that in short at sundry times and seasons the individuality of Hintock House should have forced itself upon him as appertaining to some existence with which he was concerned The intersection of his temporal orbit with missus Charmond s for a day or two in the past had created a sentimental interest in her at the time but it had been so evanescent that in the ordinary onward roll of affairs he would scarce ever have recalled it again To find her here however in these somewhat romantic circumstances magnified that by gone and transitory tenderness to indescribable proportions On entering Little Hintock he found himself regarding it in a new way from the Hintock House point of view rather than from his own and the Melburys The household had all gone to bed and as he went up stairs he heard the snore of the timber merchant from his quarter of the building and turned into the passage communicating with his own rooms in a strange access of sadness A light was burning for him in the chamber but Grace though in bed was not asleep In a moment her sympathetic voice came from behind the curtains Edgar is she very seriously hurt Fitzpiers had so entirely lost sight of missus Charmond as a patient that he was not on the instant ready with a reply Oh no he said There are no bones broken but she is shaken I am going again to morrow Another inquiry or two and Grace said Did she ask for me Well I think she did I don t quite remember but I am under the impression that she spoke of you Cannot you recollect at all what she said I cannot just this minute At any rate she did not talk much about me said Grace with disappointment Oh no But you did perhaps she added innocently fishing for a compliment Oh yes you may depend upon that replied he warmly though scarcely thinking of what he was saving so vividly was there present to his mind the personality of missus Charmond CHAPTER XXVII 
4492-8907-0000	train-other-500	The doctor s professional visit to Hintock House was promptly repeated the next day and the next
none	none	 He always found missus Charmond reclining on a sofa 
4492-8907-0001	train-other-500	and behaving generally as became a patient who was in no great hurry to lose that title On each occasion he looked gravely at the little scratch on her arm as if it had been a serious wound
4492-8907-0002	train-other-500	He had also to his further satisfaction found a slight scar on her temple and it was very convenient to put a piece of black plaster on this conspicuous part of her person in preference to gold beater s skin
4492-8907-0003	train-other-500	so that it might catch the eyes of the servants and make his presence appear decidedly necessary in case there should be any doubt of the fact Oh you hurt me she exclaimed one day He was peeling off the bit of plaster on her arm
4492-8907-0004	train-other-500	under which the scrape had turned the color of an unripe blackberry previous to vanishing altogether Wait a moment then I ll damp it said Fitzpiers He put his lips to the place and kept them there till the plaster came off easily
4492-8907-0005	train-other-500	It was at your request I put it on said he I know it she replied Is that blue vein still in my temple that used to show there The scar must be just upon it If the cut had been a little deeper it would have spilt
4492-8907-0006	train-other-500	my hot blood indeed Fitzpiers examined so closely that his breath touched her tenderly at which their eyes rose to an encounter hers showing themselves as deep and mysterious as interstellar space
4492-8907-0007	train-other-500	She turned her face away suddenly Ah none of that none of that I cannot coquet with you she cried Don t suppose I consent to for one moment Our poor brief youthful hour of love making was too long ago to bear continuing now
none	none	 It is as well that we should understand each other on that point before we go further 
4492-8907-0008	train-other-500	Coquet Nor I with you As it was when I found the historic gloves so it is now I might have been and may be foolish but I am no trifler
4492-8907-0009	train-other-500	I naturally cannot forget that little space in which I flitted across the field of your vision in those days of the past and the recollection opens up all sorts of imaginings Suppose my mother had not taken me away she murmured
4492-8907-0010	train-other-500	her dreamy eyes resting on the swaying tip of a distant tree
none	none	 I should have seen you again 
4492-8907-0011	train-other-500	And then Then the fire would have burned higher and higher What would have immediately followed I know not but sorrow and sickness of heart at last
none	none	 Why 
4492-8907-0012	train-other-500	Well that s the end of all love according to Nature s law I can give no other reason Oh don t speak like that she exclaimed Since we are only picturing the possibilities of that time don t for pity s sake spoil the picture
4492-8907-0013	train-other-500	Her voice sank almost to a whisper as she added with an incipient pout upon her full lips Let me think at least that if you had really loved me at all seriously you would have loved me for ever and ever You are right
4492-8907-0014	train-other-500	think it with all your heart said he It is a pleasant thought and costs nothing She weighed that remark in silence a while Did you ever hear anything of me from then till now she inquired Not a word
4492-8907-0015	train-other-500	So much the better I had to fight the battle of life as well as you I may tell you about it some day But don t ever ask me to do it and particularly do not press me to tell you now
4492-8907-0016	train-other-500	Thus the two or three days that they had spent in tender acquaintance on the romantic slopes above the Neckar were stretched out in retrospect to the length and importance of years made to form a canvas for infinite fancies
4492-8907-0017	train-other-500	idle dreams luxurious melancholies and sweet alluring assertions which could neither be proved nor disproved Grace was never mentioned between them but a rumor of his proposed domestic changes somehow reached her ears
4492-8907-0018	train-other-500	Doctor you are going away she exclaimed confronting him with accusatory reproach in her large dark eyes no less than in her rich cooing voice Oh yes you are she went on springing to her feet
4492-8907-0019	train-other-500	with an air which might almost have been called passionate It is no use denying it You have bought a practice at Budmouth
none	none	 I don t blame you 
4492-8907-0020	train-other-500	Nobody can live at Hintock least of all a professional man who wants to keep abreast of recent discovery And there is nobody here to induce such a one to stay for other reasons That s right
none	none	 that s right go away But no I have not actually bought the practice as yet though I am indeed in treaty for it 
4492-8907-0021	train-other-500	And my dear friend if I continue to feel about the business as I feel at this moment perhaps I may conclude never to go at all But you hate Hintock and everybody and everything in it that you don t mean to take away with you
4492-8907-0022	train-other-500	Fitzpiers contradicted this idea in his most vibratory tones and she lapsed into the frivolous archness under which she hid passions of no mean strength strange smouldering erratic passions kept down like a stifled
4492-8907-0023	train-other-500	conflagration but bursting out now here now there the only certain element in their direction being its unexpectedness
none	none	 If one word could have expressed her it would have been Inconsequence She was a woman of perversities delighting in frequent contrasts 
4492-8907-0024	train-other-500	She liked mystery in her life in her love in her history
none	none	 To be fair to her there was nothing in the latter which she had any great reason to be ashamed of 
4492-8907-0025	train-other-500	and many things of which she might have been proud but it had never been fathomed by the honest minds of Hintock and she rarely volunteered her experiences As for her capricious nature the people on her estates grew accustomed to it
4492-8907-0026	train-other-500	and with that marvellous subtlety of contrivance in steering round odd tempers that is found in sons of the soil and dependants generally they managed to get along under her government rather better than they would have done beneath a more equable rule
4492-8907-0027	train-other-500	Now with regard to the doctor s notion of leaving Hintock he had advanced further towards completing the purchase of the Budmouth surgeon s good will than he had admitted to missus Charmond The whole matter hung upon what he might do
4492-8907-0028	train-other-500	in the ensuing twenty four hours The evening after leaving her he went out into the lane and walked and pondered between the high hedges now greenish white with wild clematis here called old man s beard from its aspect later in the year
none	none	 The letter of acceptance was to be written that night 
4492-8907-0029	train-other-500	after which his departure from Hintock would be irrevocable But could he go away remembering what had just passed The trees the hills the leaves the grass
4492-8907-0030	train-other-500	each had been endowed and quickened with a subtle charm since he had discovered the person and history and above all mood of their owner There was every temporal reason for leaving it
none	none	 would be entering again into a world which he had only quitted in a passion for isolation induced by a fit of Achillean moodiness after an imagined slight 
4492-8907-0031	train-other-500	His wife herself saw the awkwardness of their position here and cheerfully welcomed the purposed change towards which every step had been taken but the last But could he find it in his heart as he found it clearly enough in his conscience to go away
4492-8907-0032	train-other-500	He drew a troubled breath and went in doors Here he rapidly penned a letter
none	none	 wherein he withdrew once for all from the treaty for the Budmouth practice As the postman had already left Little Hintock for that night he sent one of Melbury s men to intercept a mail cart on another turnpike road 
4492-8907-0033	train-other-500	and so got the letter off The man returned met Fitzpiers in the lane and told him the thing was done Fitzpiers went back to his house musing
4492-8907-0034	train-other-500	Why had he carried out this impulse taken such wild trouble to effect a probable injury to his own and his young wife s prospects His motive was fantastic glowing shapeless as the fiery scenery about the western sky
4492-8907-0035	train-other-500	missus Charmond could overtly be nothing more to him than a patient now and to his wife at the outside a patron In the unattached bachelor days of his first sojourning here how highly proper an emotional reason for lingering on would have appeared
4492-8907-0036	train-other-500	to troublesome dubiousness Matrimonial ambition is such an honorable thing My father has told me that you have sent off one of the men with a late letter to Budmouth cried Grace coming out vivaciously to meet him under the declining light of the sky
4492-8907-0037	train-other-500	wherein hung solitary the folding star I said at once that you had finally agreed to pay the premium they ask and that the tedious question had been settled When do we go Edgar I have altered my mind said he
4492-8907-0038	train-other-500	They want too much seven hundred and fifty is too large a sum and in short I have declined to go further We must wait for another opportunity I fear I am not a good business man
4492-8907-0039	train-other-500	He spoke the last words with a momentary faltering at the great foolishness of his act for as he looked in her fair and honorable face his heart reproached him for what he had done Her manner that evening showed her disappointment
4492-8907-0040	train-other-500	Personally she liked the home of her childhood much and she was not ambitious But her husband had seemed so dissatisfied with the circumstances hereabout since their marriage that she had sincerely hoped to go for his sake
4492-8907-0041	train-other-500	It was two or three days before he visited missus Charmond again The morning had been windy and little showers had sowed themselves like grain against the walls and window panes of the Hintock cottages
none	none	 He went on foot across the wilder recesses of the park where slimy streams of green moisture exuding from decayed holes caused by old amputations 
4492-8907-0042	train-other-500	ran down the bark of the oaks and elms the rind below being coated with a lichenous wash as green as emerald They were stout trunked trees that never rocked their stems in the fiercest gale
4492-8907-0043	train-other-500	responding to it entirely by crooking their limbs Wrinkled like an old crone s face and antlered with dead branches that rose above the foliage of their summits
none	none	 they were nevertheless still green though yellow had invaded the leaves of other trees She was in a little boudoir or writing room on the first floor 
4492-8907-0044	train-other-500	and Fitzpiers was much surprised to find that the window curtains were closed and a red shaded lamp and candles burning
none	none	 though out of doors it was broad daylight Moreover a large fire was burning in the grate 
4492-8907-0045	train-other-500	though it was not cold What does it all mean he asked She sat in an easy chair her face being turned away Oh she murmured it is because the world is so dreary outside
4492-8907-0046	train-other-500	Sorrow and bitterness in the sky and floods of agonized tears beating against the panes I lay awake last night and I could hear the scrape of snails creeping up the window glass it was so sad
4492-8907-0047	train-other-500	My eyes were so heavy this morning that I could have wept my life away I cannot bear you to see my face I keep it away from you purposely
none	none	 Oh why were we given hungry hearts and wild desires if we have to live in a world like this 
4492-8907-0048	train-other-500	Why should Death only lend what Life is compelled to borrow rest Answer that doctor Fitzpiers You must eat of a second tree of knowledge before you can do it Felice Charmond Then when my emotions have exhausted themselves
4492-8907-0049	train-other-500	I become full of fears till I think I shall die for very fear The terrible insistencies of society how severe they are and cold and inexorable ghastly towards those who are made of wax and not of stone Oh I am afraid of them
none	none	 a stab for this error and a stab for that 
4492-8907-0050	train-other-500	correctives and regulations framed that society may tend to perfection
none	none	 an end which I don t care for in the least Yet for this all I do care for has to be stunted and starved 
4492-8907-0051	train-other-500	Fitzpiers had seated himself near her What sets you in this mournful mood he asked gently In reality he knew that it was the result of a loss of tone from staying in doors so much but he did not say so
4492-8907-0052	train-other-500	My reflections Doctor you must not come here any more They begin to think it a farce already I say you must come no more
none	none	 There don t be angry with me 
4492-8907-0053	train-other-500	and she jumped up pressed his hand and looked anxiously at him It is necessary It is best for both you and me
none	none	 But said Fitzpiers gloomily what have we done 
4492-8907-0054	train-other-500	Done we have done nothing Perhaps we have thought the more However it is all vexation I am going away to Middleton Abbey near Shottsford where a relative of my late husband lives who is confined to her bed
4492-8907-0055	train-other-500	The engagement was made in London and I can t get out of it Perhaps it is for the best that I go there till all this is past When are you going to enter on your new practice and leave Hintock behind forever with your pretty wife on your arm
4492-8907-0056	train-other-500	I have refused the opportunity I love this place too well to depart You HAVE
none	none	 she said regarding him with wild uncertainty Why do you ruin yourself in that way Great Heaven what have I done 
4492-8907-0057	train-other-500	Nothing Besides you are going away
none	none	 Oh yes but 
4492-8907-0058	train-other-500	only to Middleton Abbey for a month or two Yet perhaps I shall gain strength there particularly strength of mind I require it And when I come back I shall be a new woman and you can come and see me safely then and bring your wife with you
4492-8907-0059	train-other-500	and we ll be friends she and I Oh how this shutting up of one s self does lead to indulgence in idle sentiments I shall not wish you to give your attendance to me after to day
none	none	 But I am glad that you are not going away if your remaining does not injure your prospects at all As soon as he had left the room the mild friendliness she had preserved in her tone at parting the playful sadness with which she had conversed with him equally departed from her She became as heavy as lead just as she had been before he arrived 
4492-8907-0060	train-other-500	Her whole being seemed to dissolve in a sad powerlessness to do anything and the sense of it made her lips tremulous
none	none	 and her closed eyes wet His footsteps again startled her and she turned round 
4492-8907-0061	train-other-500	I returned for a moment to tell you that the evening is going to be fine The sun is shining so do open your curtains and put out those lights Shall I do it for you
none	none	 Please if you don t mind 
4492-8907-0062	train-other-500	He drew back the window curtains whereupon the red glow of the lamp and the two candle flames became almost invisible with the flood of late autumn sunlight that poured in Shall I come round to you he asked her back being towards him No
none	none	 she replied Why not Because I am crying and I don t want to see you He stood a moment irresolute and regretted that he had killed the rosy passionate lamplight by opening the curtains and letting in garish day 
4492-8907-0063	train-other-500	Then I am going he said Very well she answered stretching one hand round to him and patting her eyes with a handkerchief held in the other
none	none	 Shall I write a line to you at 
4492-8907-0064	train-other-500	No no A gentle reasonableness came into her tone as she added It must not be you know It won t do Very well Good by The next moment he was gone
4492-8907-0065	train-other-500	In the evening with listless adroitness she encouraged the maid who dressed her for dinner to speak of doctor Fitzpiers s marriage missus Fitzpiers was once supposed to favor mister Winterborne said the young woman
4492-8907-0066	train-other-500	And why didn t she marry him said missus Charmond Because you see ma am he lost his houses Lost his houses
none	none	 How came he to do that The houses were held on lives and the lives dropped and your agent wouldn t renew them though it is said that mister Winterborne had a very good claim That s as I ve heard it ma am and it was through it that the match was broke off Being just then distracted by a dozen emotions missus Charmond sunk into a mood of dismal self reproach 
4492-8907-0067	train-other-500	In refusing that poor man his reasonable request she said to herself I foredoomed my rejuvenated girlhood s romance Who would have thought such a business matter could have nettled my own heart like this
4492-8907-0068	train-other-500	Now for a winter of regrets and agonies and useless wishes till I forget him in the spring Oh I am glad I am going away She left her chamber and went down to dine with a sigh
none	none	 On the stairs she stood opposite the large window for a moment and looked out upon the lawn It was not yet quite dark 
4492-8907-0069	train-other-500	Half way up the steep green slope confronting her stood old Timothy Tangs who was shortening his way homeward by clambering here where there was no road and in opposition to express orders that no path was to be made there
4492-8907-0070	train-other-500	Tangs had momentarily stopped to take a pinch of snuff but observing missus Charmond gazing at him he hastened to get over the top out of hail
none	none	 His precipitancy made him miss his footing and he rolled like a barrel to the bottom his snuffbox rolling in front of him Her indefinite idle impossible passion for Fitzpiers her constitutional cloud of misery the sorrowful drops that still hung upon her eyelashes all made way for the incursive mood started by the spectacle She burst into an immoderate fit of laughter her very gloom of the previous hour seeming to render it the more uncontrollable It had not died out of her when she reached the dining room and even here before the servants her shoulders suddenly shook as the scene returned upon her and the tears of her hilarity mingled with the remnants of those engendered by her grief She resolved to be sad no more She drank two glasses of champagne and a little more still after those and amused herself in the evening with singing little amatory songs I must do something for that poor man Winterborne however she said CHAPTER XXVIII A week had passed and missus Charmond had left Hintock House Middleton Abbey the place of her sojourn was about twenty miles distant by road eighteen by bridle paths and footways Grace observed for the first time that her husband was restless that at moments he even was disposed to avoid her The scrupulous civility of mere acquaintanceship crept into his manner yet when sitting at meals he seemed hardly to hear her remarks Her little doings interested him no longer while towards her father his bearing was not far from supercilious It was plain that his mind was entirely outside her life whereabouts outside it she could not tell in some region of science possibly or of psychological literature But her hope that he was again immersing himself in those lucubrations which before her marriage had made his light a landmark in Hintock was founded simply on the slender fact that he often sat up late One evening she discovered him leaning over a gate on Rub Down Hill the gate at which Winterborne had once been standing and which opened on the brink of a steep slanting down directly into Blackmoor Vale or the Vale of the White Hart extending beneath the eye at this point to a distance of many miles His attention was fixed on the landscape far away and Grace s approach was so noiseless that he did not hear her When she came close she could see his lips moving unconsciously as to some impassioned visionary theme She spoke and Fitzpiers started What are you looking at she asked Oh I was contemplating our old place of Buckbury in my idle way he said It had seemed to her that he was looking much to the right of that cradle and tomb of his ancestral dignity but she made no further observation and taking his arm walked home beside him almost in silence She did not know that Middleton Abbey lay in the direction of his gaze Are you going to have out Darling this afternoon she asked presently Darling being the light gray mare which Winterborne had bought for Grace and which Fitzpiers now constantly used the animal having turned out a wonderful bargain in combining a perfect docility with an almost human intelligence moreover she was not too young Fitzpiers was unfamiliar with horses and he valued these qualities Yes he replied but not to drive I am riding her I practise crossing a horse as often as I can now for I find that I can take much shorter cuts on horseback He had in fact taken these riding exercises for about a week only since missus Charmond s absence his universal practice hitherto having been to drive Some few days later Fitzpiers started on the back of this horse to see a patient in the aforesaid Vale It was about five o clock in the evening when he went away and at bedtime he had not reached home There was nothing very singular in this though she was not aware that he had any patient more than five or six miles distant in that direction The clock had struck one before Fitzpiers entered the house and he came to his room softly as if anxious not to disturb her The next morning she was stirring considerably earlier than he In the yard there was a conversation going on about the mare the man who attended to the horses Darling included insisted that the latter was hag rid for when he had arrived at the stable that morning she was in such a state as no horse could be in by honest riding It was true that the doctor had stabled her himself when he got home so that she was not looked after as she would have been if he had groomed and fed her but that did not account for the appearance she presented if mister Fitzpiers s journey had been only where he had stated The phenomenal exhaustion of Darling as thus related was sufficient to develop a whole series of tales about riding witches and demons the narration of which occupied a considerable time Grace returned in doors In passing through the outer room she picked up her husband s overcoat which he had carelessly flung down across a chair A turnpike ticket fell out of the breast pocket and she saw that it had been issued at Middleton Gate He had therefore visited Middleton the previous night a distance of at least five and thirty miles on horseback there and back During the day she made some inquiries and learned for the first time that missus Charmond was staying at Middleton Abbey She could not resist an inference strange as that inference was A few days later he prepared to start again at the same time and in the same direction She knew that the state of the cottager who lived that way was a mere pretext she was quite sure he was going to missus Charmond Grace was amazed at the mildness of the passion which the suspicion engendered in her She was but little excited and her jealousy was languid even to death It told tales of the nature of her affection for him In truth her antenuptial regard for Fitzpiers had been rather of the quality of awe towards a superior being than of tender solicitude for a lover It had been based upon mystery and strangeness the mystery of his past of his knowledge of his professional skill of his beliefs When this structure of ideals was demolished by the intimacy of common life and she found him as merely human as the Hintock people themselves a new foundation was in demand for an enduring and stanch affection a sympathetic interdependence wherein mutual weaknesses were made the grounds of a defensive alliance Fitzpiers had furnished none of that single minded confidence and truth out of which alone such a second union could spring hence it was with a controllable emotion that she now watched the mare brought round I ll walk with you to the hill if you are not in a great hurry she said rather loath after all to let him go Do there s plenty of time replied her husband Accordingly he led along the horse and walked beside her impatient enough nevertheless Thus they proceeded to the turnpike road and ascended Rub Down Hill to the gate he had been leaning over when she surprised him ten days before This was the end of her excursion Fitzpiers bade her adieu with affection even with tenderness and she observed that he looked weary eyed Why do you go to night she said You have been called up two nights in succession already I must go he answered almost gloomily Don t wait up for me With these words he mounted his horse passed through the gate which Grace held open for him and ambled down the steep bridle track to the valley She closed the gate and watched his descent and then his journey onward His way was east the evening sun which stood behind her back beaming full upon him as soon as he got out from the shade of the hill Notwithstanding this untoward proceeding she was determined to be loyal if he proved true and the determination to love one s best will carry a heart a long way towards making that best an ever growing thing The conspicuous coat of the active though blanching mare made horse and rider easy objects for the vision Though Darling had been chosen with such pains by Winterborne for Grace she had never ridden the sleek creature but her husband had found the animal exceedingly convenient particularly now that he had taken to the saddle plenty of staying power being left in Darling yet Fitzpiers like others of his character while despising Melbury and his station did not at all disdain to spend Melbury s money or appropriate to his own use the horse which belonged to Melbury s daughter And so the infatuated young surgeon went along through the gorgeous autumn landscape of White Hart Vale surrounded by orchards lustrous with the reds of apple crops berries and foliage the whole intensified by the gilding of the declining sun The earth this year had been prodigally bountiful and now was the supreme moment of her bounty In the poorest spots the hedges were bowed with haws and blackberries acorns cracked underfoot and the burst husks of chestnuts lay exposing their auburn contents as if arranged by anxious sellers in a fruit market In all this proud show some kernels were unsound as her own situation and she wondered if there were one world in the universe where the fruit had no worm and marriage no sorrow Herr Tannhauser still moved on his plodding steed rendering him distinctly visible yet Could she have heard Fitzpiers s voice at that moment she would have found him murmuring Towards the loadstar of my one desire I flitted even as a dizzy moth in the owlet light But he was a silent spectacle to her now Soon he rose out of the valley and skirted a high plateau of the chalk formation on his right which rested abruptly upon the fruity district of loamy clay the character and herbage of the two formations being so distinct that the calcareous upland appeared but as a deposit of a few years antiquity upon the level vale He kept along the edge of this high unenclosed country and the sky behind him being deep violet she could still see white Darling in relief upon it a mere speck now a Wouvermans eccentricity reduced to microscopic dimensions Upon this high ground he gradually disappeared Thus she had beheld the pet animal purchased for her own use in pure love of her by one who had always been true impressed to convey her husband away from her to the side of a new found idol While she was musing on the vicissitudes of horses and wives she discerned shapes moving up the valley towards her quite near at hand though till now hidden by the hedges Surely they were Giles Winterborne with his two horses and cider apparatus conducted by Robert Creedle Up upward they crept a stray beam of the sun alighting every now and then like a star on the blades of the pomace shovels which had been converted to steel mirrors by the action of the malic acid She opened the gate when he came close and the panting horses rested as they achieved the ascent How do you do Giles said she under a sudden impulse to be familiar with him He replied with much more reserve You are going for a walk missus Fitzpiers he added It is pleasant just now No I am returning said she The vehicles passed through the gate slammed and Winterborne walked by her side in the rear of the apple mill He looked and smelt like Autumn s very brother his face being sunburnt to wheat color his eyes blue as corn flowers his boots and leggings dyed with fruit stains his hands clammy with the sweet juice of apples his hat sprinkled with pips and everywhere about him that atmosphere of cider which at its first return each season has such an indescribable fascination for those who have been born and bred among the orchards Her heart rose from its late sadness like a released spring her senses revelled in the sudden lapse back to nature unadorned The consciousness of having to be genteel because of her husband s profession the veneer of artificiality which she had acquired at the fashionable schools were thrown off and she became the crude country girl of her latent earliest instincts Nature was bountiful she thought No sooner had she been starved off by Edgar Fitzpiers than another being impersonating bare and undiluted manliness had arisen out of the earth ready to hand This was an excursion of the imagination which she did not encourage and she said suddenly to disguise the confused regard which had followed her thoughts Did you meet my husband Winterborne with some hesitation Yes Where did you meet him At Calfhay Cross I come from Middleton Abbey I have been making there for the last week Haven t they a mill of their own Yes but it s out of repair I think I heard that missus Charmond had gone there to stay Yes I have seen her at the windows once or twice Grace waited an interval before she went on Did mister Fitzpiers take the way to Middleton Yes I met him on Darling As she did not reply he added with a gentler inflection You know why the mare was called that Oh yes of course she answered quickly They had risen so far over the crest of the hill that the whole west sky was revealed Between the broken clouds they could see far into the recesses of heaven the eye journeying on under a species of golden arcades and past fiery obstructions fancied cairns logan stones stalactites and stalagmite of topaz Deeper than this their gaze passed thin flakes of incandescence till it plunged into a bottomless medium of soft green fire Her abandonment to the luscious time after her sense of ill usage her revolt for the nonce against social law her passionate desire for primitive life may have showed in her face Winterborne was looking at her his eyes lingering on a flower that she wore in her bosom Almost with the abstraction of a somnambulist he stretched out his hand and gently caressed the flower She drew back What are you doing Giles Winterborne she exclaimed with a look of severe surprise The evident absence of all premeditation from the act however speedily led her to think that it was not necessary to stand upon her dignity here and now You must bear in mind Giles she said kindly that we are not as we were and some people might have said that what you did was taking a liberty It was more than she need have told him his action of forgetfulness had made him so angry with himself that he flushed through his tan I don t know what I am coming to he exclaimed savagely Ah I was not once like this Tears of vexation were in his eyes No now it was nothing I was too reproachful It would not have occurred to me if I had not seen something like it done elsewhere at Middleton lately he said thoughtfully after a while By whom Don t ask it She scanned him narrowly I know quite well enough she returned indifferently It was by my husband and the woman was missus Charmond Association of ideas reminded you when you saw me Giles tell me all you know about that please do Giles But no I won t hear it Let the subject cease And as you are my friend say nothing to my father They reached a place where their ways divided Winterborne continued along the highway which kept outside the copse and Grace opened a gate that entered it CHAPTER XXIX She walked up the soft grassy ride screened on either hand by nut bushes just now heavy with clusters of twos and threes and fours A little way on the track she pursued was crossed by a similar one at right angles Here Grace stopped some few yards up the transverse ride the buxom Suke Damson was visible her gown tucked up high through her pocket hole and no bonnet on her head in the act of pulling down boughs from which she was gathering and eating nuts with great rapidity her lover Tim Tangs standing near her engaged in the same pleasant meal Crack crack went Suke s jaws every second or two By an automatic chain of thought Grace s mind reverted to the tooth drawing scene described by her husband and for the first time she wondered if that narrative were really true Susan s jaws being so obviously sound and strong Grace turned up towards the nut gatherers and conquered her reluctance to speak to the girl who was a little in advance of Tim Good evening Susan she said Good evening Miss Melbury crack missus Fitzpiers Oh yes ma am missus Fitzpiers said Suke with a peculiar smile Grace not to be daunted continued Take care of your teeth Suke That accounts for the toothache I don t know what an ache is either in tooth ear or head thank the Lord crack Nor the loss of one either See for yourself ma am She parted her red lips and exhibited the whole double row full up and unimpaired You have never had one drawn Never So much the better for your stomach said missus Fitzpiers in an altered voice And turning away quickly she went on As her husband s character thus shaped itself under the touch of time Grace was almost startled to find how little she suffered from that jealous excitement which is conventionally attributed to all wives in such circumstances But though possessed by none of that feline wildness which it was her moral duty to experience she did not fail to know that she had made a frightful mistake in her marriage Acquiescence in her father s wishes had been degradation to herself People are not given premonitions for nothing she should have obeyed her impulse on that early morning and steadfastly refused her hand Oh that plausible tale which her then betrothed had told her about Suke the dramatic account of her entreaties to him to draw the aching enemy and the fine artistic touch he had given to the story by explaining that it was a lovely molar without a flaw She traced the remainder of the woodland track dazed by the complications of her position If his protestations to her before their marriage could be believed her husband had felt affection of some sort for herself and this woman simultaneously and was now again spreading the same emotion over missus Charmond and herself conjointly his manner being still kind and fond at times But surely rather than that he must have played the hypocrite towards her in each case with elaborate completeness and the thought of this sickened her for it involved the conjecture that if he had not loved her his only motive for making her his wife must have been her little fortune Yet here Grace made a mistake for the love of men like Fitzpiers is unquestionably of such quality as to bear division and transference He had indeed once declared though not to her that on one occasion he had noticed himself to be possessed by five distinct infatuations at the same time Therein it differed from the highest affection as the lower orders of the animal world differ from advanced organisms partition causing not death but a multiplied existence He had loved her sincerely and had by no means ceased to love her now But such double and treble barrelled hearts were naturally beyond her conception Of poor Suke Damson Grace thought no more She had had her day If he does not love me I will not love him said Grace proudly And though these were mere words it was a somewhat formidable thing for Fitzpiers that her heart was approximating to a state in which it might be possible to carry them out That very absence of hot jealousy which made his courses so easy and on which indeed he congratulated himself meant unknown to either wife or husband more mischief than the inconvenient watchfulness of a jaundiced eye Her sleep that night was nervous The wing allotted to her and her husband had never seemed so lonely At last she got up put on her dressing gown and went down stairs Her father who slept lightly heard her descend and came to the stair head Is that you Grace What s the matter he said Nothing more than that I am restless Edgar is detained by a case at Owlscombe in White Hart Vale But how s that I saw the woman s husband at Great Hintock just afore bedtime and she was going on well and the doctor gone then Then he s detained somewhere else said Grace Never mind me he will soon be home I expect him about one She went back to her room and dozed and woke several times One o clock had been the hour of his return on the last occasion but it passed now by a long way and Fitzpiers did not come Just before dawn she heard the men stirring in the yard and the flashes of their lanterns spread every now and then through her window blind She remembered that her father had told her not to be disturbed if she noticed them as they would be rising early to send off four loads of hurdles to a distant sheep fair Peeping out she saw them bustling about the hollow turner among the rest he was loading his wares wooden bowls dishes spigots spoons cheese vats funnels and so on upon one of her father s wagons who carried them to the fair for him every year out of neighborly kindness The scene and the occasion would have enlivened her but that her husband was still absent though it was now five o clock She could hardly suppose him whatever his infatuation to have prolonged to a later hour than ten an ostensibly professional call on missus Charmond at Middleton and he could have ridden home in two hours and a half What then had become of him That he had been out the greater part of the two preceding nights added to her uneasiness She dressed herself descended and went out the weird twilight of advancing day chilling the rays from the lanterns and making the men s faces wan As soon as Melbury saw her he came round showing his alarm Edgar is not come she said And I have reason to know that he s not attending anybody He has had no rest for two nights before this I was going to the top of the hill to look for him I ll come with you said Melbury She begged him not to hinder himself but he insisted for he saw a peculiar and rigid gloom in her face over and above her uneasiness and did not like the look of it Telling the men he would be with them again soon he walked beside her into the turnpike road and partly up the hill whence she had watched Fitzpiers the night before across the Great White Hart or Blackmoor Valley They halted beneath a half dead oak hollow and disfigured with white tumors its roots spreading out like accipitrine claws grasping the ground A chilly wind circled round them upon whose currents the seeds of a neighboring lime tree supported parachute wise by the wing attached flew out of the boughs downward like fledglings from their nest The vale was wrapped in a dim atmosphere of unnaturalness and the east was like a livid curtain edged with pink There was no sign nor sound of Fitzpiers It is no use standing here said her father He may come home fifty ways why look here here be Darling s tracks turned homeward and nearly blown dry and hard He must have come in hours ago without your seeing him He has not done that said she They went back hastily On entering their own gates they perceived that the men had left the wagons and were standing round the door of the stable which had been appropriated to the doctor s use Is there anything the matter cried Grace Oh no ma am All s well that ends well said old Timothy Tangs I ve heard of such things before among workfolk though not among your gentle people that s true They entered the stable and saw the pale shape of Darling standing in the middle of her stall with Fitzpiers on her back sound asleep Darling was munching hay as well as she could with the bit in her month and the reins which had fallen from Fitzpiers s hand hung upon her neck Grace went and touched his hand shook it before she could arouse him He moved started opened his eyes and exclaimed Ah Felice Oh it s Grace I could not see in the gloom What am I in the saddle Yes said she How do you come here He collected his thoughts and in a few minutes stammered I was riding along homeward through the vale very very sleepy having been up so much of late When I came opposite Holywell spring the mare turned her head that way as if she wanted to drink I let her go in and she drank I thought she would never finish While she was drinking the clock of Owlscombe Church struck twelve I distinctly remember counting the strokes From that moment I positively recollect nothing till I saw you here by my side The name If it had been any other horse he d have had a broken neck murmured Melbury Tis wonderful sure how a quiet hoss will bring a man home at such times said John Upjohn And what s more wonderful than keeping your seat in a deep slumbering sleep I ve knowed men drowze off walking home from randies where the mead and other liquors have gone round well and keep walking for more than a mile on end without waking Well doctor I don t care who the man is tis a mercy you wasn t a drownded or a splintered or a hanged up to a tree like Absalom also a handsome gentleman like yerself as the prophets say True murmured old Timothy From the soul of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him Or leastwise you might ha been a wownded into tatters a most and no doctor to jine your few limbs together within seven mile While this grim address was proceeding Fitzpiers had dismounted and taking Grace s arm walked stiffly in doors with her Melbury stood staring at the horse which in addition to being very weary was spattered with mud There was no mud to speak of about the Hintocks just now only in the clammy hollows of the vale beyond Owlscombe the stiff soil of which retained moisture for weeks after the uplands were dry While they were rubbing down the mare Melbury s mind coupled with the foreign quality of the mud the name he had heard unconsciously muttered by the surgeon when Grace took his hand Felice Who was Felice Why missus Charmond and she as he knew was staying at Middleton Melbury had indeed pounced upon the image that filled Fitzpiers s half awakened soul wherein there had been a picture of a recent interview on a lawn with a capriciously passionate woman who had begged him not to come again in tones whose vibration incited him to disobey What are you doing here Why do you pursue me Another belongs to you If they were to see you they would seize you as a thief And she had turbulently admitted to his wringing questions that her visit to Middleton had been undertaken less because of the invalid relative than in shamefaced fear of her own weakness if she remained near his home A triumph then it was to Fitzpiers poor and hampered as he had become to recognize his real conquest of this beauty delayed so many years His was the selfish passion of Congreve s Millamont to whom love s supreme delight lay in that heart which others bleed for bleed for me When the horse had been attended to Melbury stood uneasily here and there about his premises he was rudely disturbed in the comfortable views which had lately possessed him on his domestic concerns It is true that he had for some days discerned that Grace more and more sought his company preferred supervising his kitchen and bakehouse with her step mother to occupying herself with the lighter details of her own apartments She seemed no longer able to find in her own hearth an adequate focus for her life and hence like a weak queen bee after leading off to an independent home had hovered again into the parent hive But he had not construed these and other incidents of the kind till now Something was wrong in the dove cot A ghastly sense that he alone would be responsible for whatever unhappiness should be brought upon her for whom he almost solely lived whom to retain under his roof he had faced the numerous inconveniences involved in giving up the best part of his house to Fitzpiers There was no room for doubt that had he allowed events to take their natural course she would have accepted Winterborne and realized his old dream of restitution to that young man s family That Fitzpiers could allow himself to look on any other creature for a moment than Grace filled Melbury with grief and astonishment In the pure and simple life he had led it had scarcely occurred to him that after marriage a man might be faithless That he could sweep to the heights of missus Charmond s position lift the veil of Isis so to speak would have amazed Melbury by its audacity if he had not suspected encouragement from that quarter What could he and his simple Grace do to countervail the passions of such as those two sophisticated beings versed in the world s ways armed with every apparatus for victory In such an encounter the homely timber dealer felt as inferior as a bow and arrow savage before the precise weapons of modern warfare Grace came out of the house as the morning drew on The village was silent most of the folk having gone to the fair Fitzpiers had retired to bed and was sleeping off his fatigue She went to the stable and looked at poor Darling in all probability Giles Winterborne by obtaining for her a horse of such intelligence and docility had been the means of saving her husband s life She paused over the strange thought and then there appeared her father behind her She saw that he knew things were not as they ought to be from the troubled dulness of his eye and from his face different points of which had independent motions twitchings and tremblings unknown to himself and involuntary He was detained I suppose last night said Melbury Oh yes a bad case in the vale she replied calmly Nevertheless he should have stayed at home But he couldn t father Her father turned away He could hardly bear to see his whilom truthful girl brought to the humiliation of having to talk like that That night carking care sat beside Melbury s pillow and his stiff limbs tossed at its presence I can t lie here any longer he muttered Striking a light he wandered about the room What have I done what have I done for her he said to his wife who had anxiously awakened I had long planned that she should marry the son of the man I wanted to make amends to do ye mind how I told you all about it Lucy the night before she came home Ah but I was not content with doing right I wanted to do more Don t raft yourself without good need George she replied I won t quite believe that things are so much amiss I won t believe that missus Charmond has encouraged him Even supposing she has encouraged a great many she can have no motive to do it now What so likely as that she is not yet quite well and doesn t care to let another doctor come near her He did not heed Grace used to be so busy every day with fixing a curtain here and driving a tin tack there but she cares for no employment now Do you know anything of missus Charmond s past history Perhaps that would throw some light upon things Before she came here as the wife of old Charmond four or five years ago not a soul seems to have heard aught of her Why not make inquiries And then do ye wait and see more there ll be plenty of opportunity Time enough to cry when you know tis a crying matter and tis bad to meet troubles half way There was some good sense in the notion of seeing further Melbury resolved to inquire and wait hoping still but oppressed between whiles with much fear CHAPTER XXX Examine Grace as her father might she would admit nothing For the present therefore he simply watched The suspicion that his darling child was being slighted wrought almost a miraculous change in Melbury s nature No man so furtive for the time as the ingenuous countryman who finds that his ingenuousness has been abused Melbury s heretofore confidential candor towards his gentlemanly son in law was displaced by a feline stealth that did injury to his every action thought and mood He knew that a woman once given to a man for life took as a rule her lot as it came and made the best of it without external interference but for the first time he asked himself why this so generally should be so Moreover this case was not he argued like ordinary cases Leaving out the question of Grace being anything but an ordinary woman her peculiar situation as it were in mid air between two planes of society together with the loneliness of Hintock made a husband s neglect a far more tragical matter to her than it would be to one who had a large circle of friends to fall back upon Wisely or unwisely and whatever other fathers did he resolved to fight his daughter s battle still missus Charmond had returned But Hintock House scarcely gave forth signs of life so quietly had she reentered it He went to church at Great Hintock one afternoon as usual there being no service at the smaller village A few minutes before his departure he had casually heard Fitzpiers who was no church goer tell his wife that he was going to walk in the wood Melbury entered the building and sat down in his pew the parson came in then missus Charmond then mister Fitzpiers The service proceeded and the jealous father was quite sure that a mutual consciousness was uninterruptedly maintained between those two he fancied that more than once their eyes met At the end Fitzpiers so timed his movement into the aisle that it exactly coincided with Felice Charmond s from the opposite side and they walked out with their garments in contact the surgeon being just that two or three inches in her rear which made it convenient for his eyes to rest upon her cheek The cheek warmed up to a richer tone This was a worse feature in the flirtation than he had expected If she had been playing with him in an idle freak the game might soon have wearied her but the smallest germ of passion and women of the world do not change color for nothing was a threatening development The mere presence of Fitzpiers in the building after his statement was wellnigh conclusive as far as he was concerned but Melbury resolved yet to watch He had to wait long Autumn drew shiveringly to its end One day something seemed to be gone from the gardens the tenderer leaves of vegetables had shrunk under the first smart frost and hung like faded linen rags then the forest leaves which had been descending at leisure descended in haste and in multitudes and all the golden colors that had hung overhead were now crowded together in a degraded mass underfoot where the fallen myriads got redder and hornier and curled themselves up to rot The only suspicious features in missus Charmond s existence at this season were two the first that she lived with no companion or relative about her which considering her age and attractions was somewhat unusual conduct for a young widow in a lonely country house the other that she did not as in previous years start from Hintock to winter abroad In Fitzpiers the only change from his last autumn s habits lay in his abandonment of night study his lamp never shone from his new dwelling as from his old If the suspected ones met it was by such adroit contrivances that even Melbury s vigilance could not encounter them together A simple call at her house by the doctor had nothing irregular about it and that he had paid two or three such calls was certain What had passed at those interviews was known only to the parties themselves but that Felice Charmond was under some one s influence Melbury soon had opportunity of perceiving Winter had come on Owls began to be noisy in the mornings and evenings and flocks of wood pigeons made themselves prominent again One day in February about six months after the marriage of Fitzpiers Melbury was returning from Great Hintock on foot through the lane when he saw before him the surgeon also walking Melbury would have overtaken him but at that moment Fitzpiers turned in through a gate to one of the rambling drives among the trees at this side of the wood which led to nowhere in particular and the beauty of whose serpentine curves was the only justification of their existence Felice almost simultaneously trotted down the lane towards the timber dealer in a little basket carriage which she sometimes drove about the estate unaccompanied by a servant She turned in at the same place without having seen either Melbury or apparently Fitzpiers Melbury was soon at the spot despite his aches and his sixty years missus Charmond had come up with the doctor who was standing immediately behind the carriage She had turned to him her arm being thrown carelessly over the back of the seat They looked in each other s faces without uttering a word an arch yet gloomy smile wreathing her lips Fitzpiers clasped her hanging hand and while she still remained in the same listless attitude looking volumes into his eyes he stealthily unbuttoned her glove and stripped her hand of it by rolling back the gauntlet over the fingers so that it came off inside out He then raised her hand to his month she still reclining passively watching him as she might have watched a fly upon her dress At last she said Well sir what excuse for this disobedience I make none Then go your way and let me go mine She snatched away her hand touched the pony with the whip and left him standing there holding the reversed glove Melbury s first impulse was to reveal his presence to Fitzpiers and upbraid him bitterly But a moment s thought was sufficient to show him the futility of any such simple proceeding There was not after all so much in what he had witnessed as in what that scene might be the surface and froth of probably a state of mind on which censure operates as an aggravation rather than as a cure Moreover he said to himself that the point of attack should be the woman if either He therefore kept out of sight and musing sadly even tearfully for he was meek as a child in matters concerning his daughter continued his way towards Hintock The insight which is bred of deep sympathy was never more finely exemplified than in this instance Through her guarded manner her dignified speech her placid countenance he discerned the interior of Grace s life only too truly hidden as were its incidents from every outer eye These incidents had become painful enough Fitzpiers had latterly developed an irritable discontent which vented itself in monologues when Grace was present to hear them The early morning of this day had been dull after a night of wind and on looking out of the window Fitzpiers had observed some of Melbury s men dragging away a large limb which had been snapped off a beech tree Everything was cold and colorless My good Heaven he said as he stood in his dressing gown This is life He did not know whether Grace was awake or not and he would not turn his head to ascertain Ah fool he went on to himself to clip your own wings when you were free to soar But I could not rest till I had done it Why do I never recognize an opportunity till I have missed it nor the good or ill of a step till it is irrevocable I fell in love Love indeed Love s but the frailty of the mind When tis not with ambition joined A sickly flame which if not fed expires And feeding wastes in self consuming fires Ah old author of The Way of the World you knew you knew Grace moved He thought she had heard some part of his soliloquy He was sorry though he had not taken any precaution to prevent her He expected a scene at breakfast but she only exhibited an extreme reserve It was enough however to make him repent that he should have done anything to produce discomfort for he attributed her manner entirely to what he had said But Grace s manner had not its cause either in his sayings or in his doings She had not heard a single word of his regrets Something even nearer home than her husband s blighted prospects if blighted they were was the origin of her mood a mood that was the mere continuation of what her father had noticed when he would have preferred a passionate jealousy in her as the more natural She had made a discovery one which to a girl of honest nature was almost appalling She had looked into her heart and found that her early interest in Giles Winterborne had become revitalized into luxuriant growth by her widening perceptions of what was great and little in life His homeliness no longer offended her acquired tastes his comparative want of so called culture did not now jar on her intellect his country dress even pleased her eye his exterior roughness fascinated her Having discovered by marriage how much that was humanly not great could company exist with attainments of an exceptional order there was a revulsion in her sentiments from all that she had formerly clung to in this kind honesty goodness manliness tenderness devotion for her only existed in their purity now in the breasts of unvarnished men and here was one who had manifested them towards her from his youth up There was further that never ceasing pity in her soul for Giles as a man whom she had wronged a man who had been unfortunate in his worldly transactions while not without a touch of sublimity he had like Horatio borne himself throughout his scathing As one in suffering all that suffers nothing It was these perceptions and no subtle catching of her husband s murmurs that had bred the abstraction visible in her When her father approached the house after witnessing the interview between Fitzpiers and missus Charmond Grace was looking out of her sitting room window as if she had nothing to do or think of or care for He stood still Ah Grace he said regarding her fixedly Yes father she murmured Waiting for your dear husband he inquired speaking with the sarcasm of pitiful affection Oh no not especially He has a great many patients to see this afternoon Melbury came quite close Grace what s the use of talking like that when you know Here come down and walk with me out in the garden child He unfastened the door in the ivy laced wall and waited This apparent indifference alarmed him He would far rather that she had rushed in all the fire of jealousy to Hintock House regardless of conventionality confronted and attacked Felice Charmond unguibus et rostro and accused her even in exaggerated shape of stealing away her husband Such a storm might have cleared the air She emerged in a minute or two and they went inside together You know as well as I do he resumed that there is something threatening mischief to your life and yet you pretend you do not Do you suppose I don t see the trouble in your face every day I am very sure that this quietude is wrong conduct in you You should look more into matters I am quiet because my sadness is not of a nature to stir me to action Melbury wanted to ask her a dozen questions did she not feel jealous was she not indignant but a natural delicacy restrained him You are very tame and let alone I am bound to say he remarked pointedly I am what I feel father she repeated He glanced at her and there returned upon his mind the scene of her offering to wed Winterborne instead of Fitzpiers in the last days before her marriage and he asked himself if it could be the fact that she loved Winterborne now that she had lost him more than she had ever done when she was comparatively free to choose him What would you have me do she asked in a low voice He recalled his mind from the retrospective pain to the practical matter before them I would have you go to missus Charmond he said Go to missus Charmond what for said she Well if I must speak plain dear Grace to ask her appeal to her in the name of your common womanhood and your many like sentiments on things not to make unhappiness between you and your husband It lies with her entirely to do one or the other that I can see Grace s face had heated at her father s words and the very rustle of her skirts upon the box edging bespoke hauteur I shall not think of going to her father of course I could not she answered Why don t ee want to be happier than you be at present said Melbury more moved on her account than she was herself I don t wish to be more humiliated If I have anything to bear I can bear it in silence But my dear maid you are too young you don t know what the present state of things may lead to Just see the harm done a ready Your husband would have gone away to Budmouth to a bigger practice if it had not been for this Although it has gone such a little way it is poisoning your future even now missus Charmond is thoughtlessly bad not bad by calculation and just a word to her now might save ee a peck of woes Ah I loved her once said Grace with a broken articulation and she would not care for me then Now I no longer love her Let her do her worst I don t care You ought to care You have got into a very good position to start with You have been well educated well tended and you have become the wife of a professional man of unusually good family Surely you ought to make the best of your position I don t see that I ought I wish I had never got into it I wish you had never never thought of educating me I wish I worked in the woods like Marty South I hate genteel life and I want to be no better than she Why said her amazed father Because cultivation has only brought me inconveniences and troubles I say again I wish you had never sent me to those fashionable schools you set your mind on It all arose out of that father If I had stayed at home I should have married She closed up her mouth suddenly and was silent and he saw that she was not far from crying Melbury was much grieved What and would you like to have grown up as we be here in Hintock knowing no more and with no more chance of seeing good life than we have here Yes I have never got any happiness outside Hintock that I know of and I have suffered many a heartache at being sent away Oh the misery of those January days when I had got back to school and left you all here in the wood so happy I used to wonder why I had to bear it And I was always a little despised by the other girls at school because they knew where I came from and that my parents were not in so good a station as theirs Her poor father was much hurt at what he thought her ingratitude and intractability He had admitted to himself bitterly enough that he should have let young hearts have their way or rather should have helped on her affection for Winterborne and given her to him according to his original plan but he was not prepared for her deprecation of those attainments whose completion had been a labor of years and a severe tax upon his purse Very well he said with much heaviness of spirit If you don t like to go to her I don t wish to force you And so the question remained for him still how should he remedy this perilous state of things For days he sat in a moody attitude over the fire a pitcher of cider standing on the hearth beside him and his drinking horn inverted upon the top of it He spent a week and more thus composing a letter to the chief offender which he would every now and then attempt to complete and suddenly crumple up in his hand CHAPTER XXXI As February merged in March and lighter evenings broke the gloom of the woodmen s homeward journey the Hintocks Great and Little began to have ears for a rumor of the events out of which had grown the timber dealer s troubles It took the form of a wide sprinkling of conjecture wherein no man knew the exact truth Tantalizing phenomena at once showing and concealing the real relationship of the persons concerned caused a diffusion of excited surprise Honest people as the woodlanders were it was hardly to be expected that they could remain immersed in the study of their trees and gardens amid such circumstances or sit with their backs turned like the good burghers of Coventry at the passage of the beautiful lady Rumor for a wonder exaggerated little There were in fact in this case as in thousands the well worn incidents old as the hills which with individual variations made a mourner of Ariadne a by word of Vashti and a corpse of the Countess Amy There were rencounters accidental and contrived stealthy correspondence sudden misgivings on one side sudden self reproaches on the other The inner state of the twain was one as of confused noise that would not allow the accents of calmer reason to be heard Determinations to go in this direction and headlong plunges in that dignified safeguards undignified collapses not a single rash step by deliberate intention and all against judgment It was all that Melbury had expected and feared It was more for he had overlooked the publicity that would be likely to result as it now had done What should he do appeal to missus Charmond himself since Grace would not He bethought himself of Winterborne and resolved to consult him feeling the strong need of some friend of his own sex to whom he might unburden his mind He had entirely lost faith in his own judgment That judgment on which he had relied for so many years seemed recently like a false companion unmasked to have disclosed unexpected depths of hypocrisy and speciousness where all had seemed solidity He felt almost afraid to form a conjecture on the weather or the time or the fruit promise so great was his self abasement It was a rimy evening when he set out to look for Giles The woods seemed to be in a cold sweat beads of perspiration hung from every bare twig the sky had no color and the trees rose before him as haggard gray phantoms whose days of substantiality were passed Melbury seldom saw Winterborne now but he believed him to be occupying a lonely hut just beyond the boundary of missus Charmond s estate though still within the circuit of the woodland The timber merchant s thin legs stalked on through the pale damp scenery his eyes on the dead leaves of last year while every now and then a hasty Ay escaped his lips in reply to some bitter proposition His notice was attracted by a thin blue haze of smoke behind which arose sounds of voices and chopping bending his steps that way he saw Winterborne just in front of him It just now happened that Giles after being for a long time apathetic and unemployed had become one of the busiest men in the neighborhood It is often thus fallen friends lost sight of we expect to find starving we discover them going on fairly well Without any solicitation or desire for profit on his part he had been asked to execute during that winter a very large order for hurdles and other copse ware for which purpose he had been obliged to buy several acres of brushwood standing He was now engaged in the cutting and manufacture of the same proceeding with the work daily like an automaton The hazel tree did not belie its name to day The whole of the copse wood where the mist had cleared returned purest tints of that hue amid which Winterborne himself was in the act of making a hurdle the stakes being driven firmly into the ground in a row over which he bent and wove the twigs Beside him was a square compact pile like the altar of Cain formed of hurdles already finished which bristled on all sides with the sharp points of their stakes At a little distance the men in his employ were assisting him to carry out his contract Rows of copse wood lay on the ground as it had fallen under the axe and a shelter had been constructed near at hand in front of which burned the fire whose smoke had attracted him The air was so dank that the smoke hung heavy and crept away amid the bushes without rising from the ground After wistfully regarding Winterborne a while Melbury drew nearer and briefly inquired of Giles how he came to be so busily engaged with an undertone of slight surprise that Winterborne could seem so thriving after being deprived of Grace Melbury was not without emotion at the meeting for Grace s affairs had divided them and ended their intimacy of old times Winterborne explained just as briefly without raising his eyes from his occupation of chopping a bough that he held in front of him Twill be up in April before you get it all cleared said Melbury Yes there or thereabouts said Winterborne a chop of the billhook jerking the last word into two pieces There was another interval Melbury still looked on a chip from Winterborne s hook occasionally flying against the waistcoat and legs of his visitor who took no heed Ah Giles you should have been my partner You should have been my son in law the old man said at last It would have been far better for her and for me Winterborne saw that something had gone wrong with his former friend and throwing down the switch he was about to interweave he responded only too readily to the mood of the timber dealer Is she ill he said hurriedly No no Melbury stood without speaking for some minutes and then as though he could not bring himself to proceed turned to go away Winterborne told one of his men to pack up the tools for the night and walked after Melbury Heaven forbid that I should seem too inquisitive sir he said especially since we don t stand as we used to stand to one another but I hope it is well with them all over your way No said Melbury no He stopped and struck the smooth trunk of a young ash tree with the flat of his hand I would that his ear had been where that rind is he exclaimed I should have treated him to little compared wi what he deserves Now said Winterborne don t be in a hurry to go home I ve put some cider down to warm in my shelter here and we ll sit and drink it and talk this over Melbury turned unresistingly as Giles took his arm and they went back to where the fire was and sat down under the screen the other woodmen having gone He drew out the cider mug from the ashes and they drank together Giles you ought to have had her as I said just now repeated Melbury I ll tell you why for the first time He thereupon told Winterborne as with great relief the story of how he won away Giles s father s chosen one by nothing worse than a lover s cajoleries it is true but by means which except in love would certainly have been pronounced cruel and unfair He explained how he had always intended to make reparation to Winterborne the father by giving Grace to Winterborne the son till the devil tempted him in the person of Fitzpiers and he broke his virtuous vow How highly I thought of that man to be sure Who d have supposed he d have been so weak and wrong headed as this You ought to have had her Giles and there s an end on t Winterborne knew how to preserve his calm under this unconsciously cruel tearing of a healing wound to which Melbury s concentration on the more vital subject had blinded him The young man endeavored to make the best of the case for Grace s sake She would hardly have been happy with me he said in the dry unimpassioned voice under which he hid his feelings I was not well enough educated too rough in short I couldn t have surrounded her with the refinements she looked for anyhow at all Nonsense you are quite wrong there said the unwise old man doggedly She told me only this day that she hates refinements and such like All that my trouble and money bought for her in that way is thrown away upon her quite She d fain be like Marty South think o that That s the top of her ambition Perhaps she s right Giles she loved you under the rind and what s more she loves ye still worse luck for the poor maid If Melbury only had known what fires he was recklessly stirring up he might have held his peace Winterborne was silent a long time The darkness had closed in round them and the monotonous drip of the fog from the branches quickened as it turned to fine rain Oh she never cared much for me Giles managed to say as he stirred the embers with a brand She did and does I tell ye said the other obstinately However all that s vain talking now What I come to ask you about is a more practical matter how to make the best of things as they are I am thinking of a desperate step of calling on the woman Charmond I am going to appeal to her since Grace will not Tis she who holds the balance in her hands not he While she s got the will to lead him astray he will follow poor unpractical lofty notioned dreamer and how long she ll do it depends upon her whim Did ye ever hear anything about her character before she came to Hintock She s been a bit of a charmer in her time I believe replied Giles with the same level quietude as he regarded the red coals One who has smiled where she has not loved and loved where she has not married Before mister Charmond made her his wife she was a play actress Hey But how close you have kept all this Giles What besides mister Charmond was a rich man engaged in the iron trade in the north twenty or thirty years older than she He married her and retired and came down here and bought this property as they do nowadays Yes yes I know all about that but the other I did not know I fear it bodes no good For how can I go and appeal to the forbearance of a woman in this matter who has made cross loves and crooked entanglements her trade for years I thank ye Giles for finding it out but it makes my plan the harder that she should have belonged to that unstable tribe Another pause ensued and they looked gloomily at the smoke that beat about the hurdles which sheltered them through whose weavings a large drop of rain fell at intervals and spat smartly into the fire missus Charmond had been no friend to Winterborne but he was manly and it was not in his heart to let her be condemned without a trial She is said to be generous he answered You might not appeal to her in vain It shall be done said Melbury rising For good or for evil to missus Charmond I ll go

2149_8912_000003_000000	train-clean-360	At nine o clock the next morning Melbury dressed himself up in shining broadcloth creased with folding and smelling of camphor and started for Hintock House 
none	none	He was the more impelled to go at once by the absence of his son in law in London for a few days to attend really or ostensibly some professional meetings 
2149_8912_000003_000002	train-clean-360	He said nothing of his destination either to his wife or to Grace fearing that they might entreat him to abandon so risky a project and went out unobserved 
2149_8912_000003_000003	train-clean-360	He had chosen his time with a view as he supposed of conveniently catching missus Charmond when she had just finished her breakfast before any other business people should be about if any came 
2149_8912_000003_000004	train-clean-360	Plodding thoughtfully onward he crossed a glade lying between Little Hintock Woods and the plantation which abutted on the park and the spot being open he was discerned there by Winterborne from the copse on the next hill where he and his men were working 
2149_8912_000003_000005	train-clean-360	Knowing his mission the younger man hastened down from the copse and managed to intercept the timber merchant 
2149_8912_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 I have been thinking of this sir he said and I am of opinion that it would be best to put off your visit for the present 
2149_8912_000005_000000	train-clean-360	But Melbury would not even stop to hear him 
2149_8912_000005_000001	train-clean-360	His mind was made up the appeal was to be made and Winterborne stood and watched him sadly till he entered the second plantation and disappeared 
2149_8912_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Melbury rang at the tradesmen s door of the manor house and was at once informed that the lady was not yet visible as indeed he might have guessed had he been anybody but the man he was 
none	none	Melbury said he would wait whereupon the young man informed him in a neighborly way that between themselves she was in bed and asleep
2149_8912_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Never mind said Melbury retreating into the court I ll stand about here Charged so fully with his mission he shrank from contact with anybody 
2149_8912_000008_000000	train-clean-360	But he walked about the paved court till he was tired and still nobody came to him 
none	none	At last he entered the house and sat down in a small waiting room from which he got glimpses of the kitchen corridor and of the white capped maids flitting jauntily hither and thither 
2149_8912_000008_000002	train-clean-360	They had heard of his arrival but had not seen him enter and imagining him still in the court discussed freely the possible reason of his calling 
none	none	They marvelled at his temerity for though most of the tongues which had been let loose attributed the chief blame worthiness to Fitzpiers these of her household preferred to regard their mistress as the deeper sinner 
2149_8912_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Melbury sat with his hands resting on the familiar knobbed thorn walking stick whose growing he had seen before he enjoyed its use The scene to him was not the material environment of his person but a tragic vision that travelled with him like an envelope 
none	none	Through this vision the incidents of the moment but gleamed confusedly here and there as an outer landscape through the high colored scenes of a stained window 
2149_8912_000009_000002	train-clean-360	He waited thus an hour an hour and a half two hours He began to look pale and ill whereupon the butler who came in asked him to have a glass of wine 
2149_8912_000009_000003	train-clean-360	Melbury roused himself and said No no Is she almost ready 
none	none	She is just finishing breakfast said the butler She will soon see you now 
2149_8912_000010_000002	train-clean-360	I am just going up to tell her you are here 
2149_8912_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 What haven t you told her before said Melbury 
2149_8912_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh no said the other 
2149_8912_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 You see you came so very early 
2149_8912_000013_000000	train-clean-360	At last the bell rang missus Charmond could see him 
2149_8912_000013_000001	train-clean-360	She was not in her private sitting room when he reached it but in a minute he heard her coming from the front staircase and she entered where he stood 
none	none	At this time of the morning missus Charmond looked her full age and more She might almost have been taken for the typical femme de trente ans though she was really not more than seven or eight and twenty There being no fire in the room she came in with a shawl thrown loosely round her shoulders and obviously without the least suspicion that Melbury had called upon any other errand than timber Felice was indeed the only woman in the parish who had not heard the rumor of her own weaknesses she was at this moment living in a fool s paradise in respect of that rumor though not in respect of the weaknesses themselves which if the truth be told caused her grave misgivings
2149_8912_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Do sit down mister Melbury 
2149_8912_000015_000001	train-clean-360	You have felled all the trees that were to be purchased by you this season except the oaks I believe 
2149_8912_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said Melbury 
none	none	How very nice 
2149_8912_000017_000001	train-clean-360	It must be so charming to work in the woods just now 
none	none	She was too careless to affect an interest in an extraneous person s affairs so consummately as to deceive in the manner of the perfect social machine 
2149_8912_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Hence her words very nice so charming were uttered with a perfunctoriness that made them sound absurdly unreal 
2149_8912_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes yes said Melbury in a reverie 
2149_8912_000019_000001	train-clean-360	He did not take a chair and she also remained standing 
2149_8912_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Resting upon his stick he began missus Charmond I have called upon a more serious matter at least to me than tree throwing 
2149_8912_000019_000003	train-clean-360	And whatever mistakes I make in my manner of speaking upon it to you madam do me the justice to set em down to my want of practice and not to my want of care 
none	none	missus Charmond looked ill at ease 
2149_8912_000020_000001	train-clean-360	She might have begun to guess his meaning but apart from that she had such dread of contact with anything painful harsh or even earnest that his preliminaries alone were enough to distress her 
2149_8912_000020_000002	train-clean-360	 Yes what is it she said 
2149_8912_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 I am an old man said Melbury whom somewhat late in life God thought fit to bless with one child and she a daughter 
2149_8912_000021_000001	train-clean-360	Her mother was a very dear wife to me but she was taken away from us when the child was young and the child became precious as the apple of my eye to me for she was all I had left to love 
none	none	For her sake entirely I married as second wife a homespun woman who had been kind as a mother to her In due time the question of her education came on and I said I will educate the maid well if I live upon bread to do it Of her possible marriage I could not bear to think for it seemed like a death that she should cleave to another man and grow to think his house her home rather than mine 
2149_8912_000021_000004	train-clean-360	But I saw it was the law of nature that this should be and that it was for the maid s happiness that she should have a home when I was gone and I made up my mind without a murmur to help it on for her sake 
none	none	In my youth I had wronged my dead friend and to make amends I determined to give her my most precious possession to my friend s son seeing that they liked each other well 
2149_8912_000021_000006	train-clean-360	Things came about which made me doubt if it would be for my daughter s happiness to do this inasmuch as the young man was poor and she was delicately reared 
2149_8912_000021_000007	train-clean-360	Another man came and paid court to her one her equal in breeding and accomplishments in every way it seemed to me that he only could give her the home which her training had made a necessity almost I urged her on and she married him 
2149_8912_000021_000008	train-clean-360	But ma am a fatal mistake was at the root of my reckoning 
none	none	I found that this well born gentleman I had calculated on so surely was not stanch of heart and that therein lay a danger of great sorrow for my daughter Madam he saw you and you know the rest I have come to make no demands to utter no threats I have come simply as a father in great grief about this only child and I beseech you to deal kindly with my daughter and to do nothing which can turn her husband s heart away from her forever Forbid him your presence ma am and speak to him on his duty as one with your power over him well can do and I am hopeful that the rent between them may be patched up For it is not as if you would lose by so doing your course is far higher than the courses of a simple professional man and the gratitude you would win from me and mine by your kindness is more than I can say missus Charmond had first rushed into a mood of indignation on comprehending Melbury s story hot and cold by turns she had murmured Leave me leave me But as he seemed to take no notice of this his words began to influence her and when he ceased speaking she said with hurried hot breath What has led you to think this of me Who says I have won your daughter s husband away from her

none	none	CHAPTER XXXIII There was agitation to day in the lives of all whom these matters concerned It was not till the Hintock dinner time one o clock that Grace discovered her father s absence from the house after a departure in the morning under somewhat unusual conditions By a little reasoning and inquiry she was able to come to a conclusion on his destination and to divine his errand Her husband was absent and her father did not return He had in truth gone on to Sherton after the interview but this Grace did not know In an indefinite dread that something serious would arise out of Melbury s visit by reason of the inequalities of temper and nervous irritation to which he was subject something possibly that would bring her much more misery than accompanied her present negative state of mind she left the house about three o clock and took a loitering walk in the woodland track by which she imagined he would come home This track under the bare trees and over the cracking sticks screened and roofed in from the outer world of wind and cloud by a net work of boughs led her slowly on till in time she had left the larger trees behind her and swept round into the coppice where Winterborne and his men were clearing the undergrowth Had Giles s attention been concentrated on his hurdles he would not have seen her but ever since Melbury s passage across the opposite glade in the morning he had been as uneasy and unsettled as Grace herself and her advent now was the one appearance which since her father s avowal could arrest him more than Melbury s return with his tidings Fearing that something might be the matter he hastened up to her She had not seen her old lover for a long time and too conscious of the late pranks of her heart she could not behold him calmly I am only looking for my father she said in an unnecessarily apologetic intonation I was looking for him too said Giles I think he may perhaps have gone on farther Then you knew he was going to the House Giles she said turning her large tender eyes anxiously upon him Did he tell you what for Winterborne glanced doubtingly at her and then softly hinted that her father had visited him the evening before and that their old friendship was quite restored on which she guessed the rest Oh I am glad indeed that you two are friends again she cried And then they stood facing each other fearing each other troubling each other s souls Grace experienced acute misery at the sight of these wood cutting scenes because she had estranged herself from them craving even to its defects and inconveniences that homely sylvan life of her father which in the best probable succession of events would shortly be denied her At a little distance on the edge of the clearing Marty South was shaping spar gads to take home for manufacture during the evenings While Winterborne and missus Fitzpiers stood looking at her in their mutual embarrassment at each other s presence they beheld approaching the girl a lady in a dark fur mantle and a black hat having a white veil tied picturesquely round it She spoke to Marty who turned and courtesied and the lady fell into conversation with her It was missus Charmond On leaving her house missus Charmond had walked on and onward under the fret and fever of her mind with more vigor than she was accustomed to show in her normal moods a fever which the solace of a cigarette did not entirely allay Reaching the coppice she listlessly observed Marty at work threw away her cigarette and came near Chop chop chop went Marty s little billhook with never more assiduity till missus Charmond spoke Who is that young lady I see talking to the woodman yonder she asked missus Fitzpiers ma am said Marty Oh said missus Charmond with something like a start for she had not recognized Grace at that distance And the man she is talking to That s mister Winterborne A redness stole into Marty s face as she mentioned Giles s name which missus Charmond did not fail to notice informed her of the state of the girl s heart Are you engaged to him she asked softly No ma am said Marty SHE was once and I think But Marty could not possibly explain the complications of her thoughts on this matter which were nothing less than one of extraordinary acuteness for a girl so young and inexperienced namely that she saw danger to two hearts naturally honest in Grace being thrown back into Winterborne s society by the neglect of her husband missus Charmond however with the almost supersensory means to knowledge which women have on such occasions quite understood what Marty had intended to convey and the picture thus exhibited to her of lives drifting away involving the wreck of poor Marty s hopes prompted her to more generous resolves than all Melbury s remonstrances had been able to stimulate Full of the new feeling she bade the girl good afternoon and went on over the stumps of hazel to where Grace and Winterborne were standing They saw her approach and Winterborne said She is coming to you it is a good omen She dislikes me so I ll go away He accordingly retreated to where he had been working before Grace came and Grace s formidable rival approached her each woman taking the other s measure as she came near Dear missus Fitzpiers said Felice Charmond with some inward turmoil which stopped her speech I have not seen you for a long time She held out her hand tentatively while Grace stood like a wild animal on first confronting a mirror or other puzzling product of civilization Was it really missus Charmond speaking to her thus If it was she could no longer form any guess as to what it signified I want to talk with you said missus Charmond imploringly for the gaze of the young woman had chilled her through Can you walk on with me till we are quite alone Sick with distaste Grace nevertheless complied as by clockwork and they moved evenly side by side into the deeper recesses of the woods They went farther much farther than missus Charmond had meant to go but she could not begin her conversation and in default of it kept walking I have seen your father she at length resumed And I am much troubled by what he told me What did he tell you I have not been admitted to his confidence on anything he may have said to you Nevertheless why should I repeat to you what you can easily divine True true returned Grace mournfully Why should you repeat what we both know to be in our minds already missus Fitzpiers your husband The moment that the speaker s tongue touched the dangerous subject a vivid look of self consciousness flashed over her in which her heart revealed as by a lightning gleam what filled it to overflowing So transitory was the expression that none but a sensitive woman and she in Grace s position would have had the power to catch its meaning Upon her the phase was not lost Then you DO love him she exclaimed in a tone of much surprise What do you mean my young friend Why cried Grace I thought till now that you had only been cruelly flirting with my husband to amuse your idle moments a rich lady with a poor professional gentleman whom in her heart she despised not much less than her who belongs to him But I guess from your manner that you love him desperately and I don t hate you as I did before Yes indeed continued missus Fitzpiers with a trembling tongue since it is not playing in your case at all but REAL Oh I do pity you more than I despise you for you will s s suffer most missus Charmond was now as much agitated as Grace I ought not to allow myself to argue with you she exclaimed I demean myself by doing it But I liked you once and for the sake of that time I try to tell you how mistaken you are Much of her confusion resulted from her wonder and alarm at finding herself in a sense dominated mentally and emotionally by this simple school girl I do not love him she went on with desperate untruth It was a kindness my making somewhat more of him than one usually does of one s doctor I was lonely I talked well I trifled with him I am very sorry if such child s playing out of pure friendship has been a serious matter to you Who could have expected it But the world is so simple here Oh that s affectation said Grace shaking her head It is no use you love him I can see in your face that in this matter of my husband you have not let your acts belie your feelings During these last four or six months you have been terribly indiscreet but you have not been insincere and that almost disarms me I HAVE been insincere if you will have the word I mean I HAVE coquetted and do NOT love him But Grace clung to her position like a limpet You may have trifled with others but him you love as you never loved another man Oh well I won t argue said missus Charmond laughing faintly And you come to reproach me for it child No said Grace magnanimously You may go on loving him if you like I don t mind at all You ll find it let me tell you a bitterer business for yourself than for me in the end He ll get tired of you soon as tired as can be you don t know him so well as I and then you may wish you had never seen him missus Charmond had grown quite pale and weak under this prophecy It was extraordinary that Grace whom almost every one would have characterized as a gentle girl should be of stronger fibre than her interlocutor You exaggerate cruel silly young woman she reiterated writhing with little agonies It is nothing but playful friendship nothing It will be proved by my future conduct I shall at once refuse to see him more since it will make no difference to my heart and much to my name I question if you will refuse to see him again said Grace dryly as with eyes askance she bent a sapling down But I am not incensed against you as you are against me she added abandoning the tree to its natural perpendicular Before I came I had been despising you for wanton cruelty now I only pity you for misplaced affection When Edgar has gone out of the house in hope of seeing you at seasonable hours and unseasonable when I have found him riding miles and miles across the country at midnight and risking his life and getting covered with mud to get a glimpse of you I have called him a foolish man the plaything of a finished coquette I thought that what was getting to be a tragedy to me was a comedy to you But now I see that tragedy lies on YOUR side of the situation no less than on MINE and more that if I have felt trouble at my position you have felt anguish at yours that if I have had disappointments you have had despairs Heaven may fortify me God help you I cannot attempt to reply to your raving eloquence returned the other struggling to restore a dignity which had completely collapsed My acts will be my proofs In the world which you have seen nothing of friendships between men and women are not unknown and it would have been better both for you and your father if you had each judged me more respectfully and left me alone As it is I wish never to see or speak to you madam any more Grace bowed and missus Charmond turned away The two went apart in directly opposite courses and were soon hidden from each other by their umbrageous surroundings and by the shadows of eve In the excitement of their long argument they had walked onward and zigzagged about without regarding direction or distance All sound of the woodcutters had long since faded into remoteness and even had not the interval been too great for hearing them they would have been silent and homeward bound at this twilight hour But Grace went on her course without any misgiving though there was much underwood here with only the narrowest passages for walking across which brambles hung She had not however traversed this the wildest part of the wood since her childhood and the transformation of outlines had been great old trees which once were landmarks had been felled or blown down and the bushes which then had been small and scrubby were now large and overhanging She soon found that her ideas as to direction were vague that she had indeed no ideas as to direction at all If the evening had not been growing so dark and the wind had not put on its night moan so distinctly Grace would not have minded but she was rather frightened now and began to strike across hither and thither in random courses Denser grew the darkness more developed the wind voices and still no recognizable spot or outlet of any kind appeared nor any sound of the Hintocks floated near though she had wandered probably between one and two hours and began to be weary She was vexed at her foolishness since the ground she had covered if in a straight line must inevitably have taken her out of the wood to some remote village or other but she had wasted her forces in countermarches and now in much alarm wondered if she would have to pass the night here She stood still to meditate and fancied that between the soughing of the wind she heard shuffling footsteps on the leaves heavier than those of rabbits or hares Though fearing at first to meet anybody on the chance of his being a friend she decided that the fellow night rambler even if a poacher would not injure her and that he might possibly be some one sent to search for her She accordingly shouted a rather timid Hoi The cry was immediately returned by the other person and Grace running at once in the direction whence it came beheld an indistinct figure hastening up to her as rapidly They were almost in each other s arms when she recognized in her vis a vis the outline and white veil of her whom she had parted from an hour and a half before missus Charmond I have lost my way I have lost my way cried that lady Oh is it indeed you I am so glad to meet you or anybody I have been wandering up and down ever since we parted and am nearly dead with terror and misery and fatigue So am I said Grace What shall we shall we do You won t go away from me asked her companion anxiously No indeed Are you very tired I can scarcely move and I am scratched dreadfully about the ankles Grace reflected Perhaps as it is dry under foot the best thing for us to do would be to sit down for half an hour and then start again when we have thoroughly rested By walking straight we must come to a track leading somewhere before the morning They found a clump of bushy hollies which afforded a shelter from the wind and sat down under it some tufts of dead fern crisp and dry that remained from the previous season forming a sort of nest for them But it was cold nevertheless on this March night particularly for Grace who with the sanguine prematureness of youth in matters of dress had considered it spring time and hence was not so warmly clad as missus Charmond who still wore her winter fur But after sitting a while the latter lady shivered no less than Grace as the warmth imparted by her hasty walking began to go off and they felt the cold air drawing through the holly leaves which scratched their backs and shoulders Moreover they could hear some drops of rain falling on the trees though none reached the nook in which they had ensconced themselves If we were to cling close together said missus Charmond we should keep each other warm But she added in an uneven voice I suppose you won t come near me for the world Why not Because well you know Yes I will I don t hate you at all They consequently crept up to one another and being in the dark lonely and weary did what neither had dreamed of doing beforehand clasped each other closely missus Charmond s furs consoling Grace s cold face and each one s body as she breathed alternately heaving against that of her companion When a few minutes had been spent thus missus Charmond said I am so wretched in a heavy emotional whisper You are frightened said Grace kindly But there is nothing to fear I know these woods well I am not at all frightened at the wood but I am at other things missus Charmond embraced Grace more and more tightly and the younger woman could feel her neighbor s breathings grow deeper and more spasmodic as though uncontrollable feelings were germinating After I had left you she went on I regretted something I had said I have to make a confession I must make it she whispered brokenly the instinct to indulge in warmth of sentiment which had led this woman of passions to respond to Fitzpiers in the first place leading her now to find luxurious comfort in opening her heart to his wife I said to you I could give him up without pain or deprivation that he had only been my pastime That was untrue it was said to deceive you I could not do it without much pain and what is more dreadful I cannot give him up even if I would of myself alone Why Because you love him you mean Felice Charmond denoted assent by a movement I knew I was right said Grace exaltedly But that should not deter you she presently added in a moral tone Oh do struggle against it and you will conquer You are so simple so simple cried Felice You think because you guessed my assumed indifference to him to be a sham that you know the extremes that people are capable of going to But a good deal more may have been going on than you have fathomed with all your insight I CANNOT give him up until he chooses to give up me But surely you are the superior in station and in every way and the cut must come from you Tchut Must I tell verbatim you simple child Oh I suppose I must I shall eat away my heart if I do not let out all after meeting you like this and finding how guileless you are She thereupon whispered a few words in the girl s ear and burst into a violent fit of sobbing Grace started roughly away from the shelter of the fur and sprang to her feet Oh my God she exclaimed thunderstruck at a revelation transcending her utmost suspicion Can it be can it be She turned as if to hasten away But Felice Charmond s sobs came to her ear deep darkness circled her about the funereal trees rocked and chanted their diriges and placebos around her and she did not know which way to go After a moment of energy she felt mild again and turned to the motionless woman at her feet Are you rested she asked in what seemed something like her own voice grown ten years older Without an answer missus Charmond slowly rose You mean to betray me she said from the bitterest depths of her soul Oh fool fool I No said Grace shortly I mean no such thing But let us be quick now We have a serious undertaking before us Think of nothing but going straight on They walked on in profound silence pulling back boughs now growing wet and treading down woodbine but still keeping a pretty straight course Grace began to be thoroughly worn out and her companion too when on a sudden they broke into the deserted highway at the hill top on which the Sherton man had waited for missus Dollery s van Grace recognized the spot as soon as she looked around her How we have got here I cannot tell she said with cold civility We have made a complete circuit of Little Hintock The hazel copse is quite on the other side Now we have only to follow the road They dragged themselves onward turned into the lane passed the track to Little Hintock and so reached the park Here I turn back said Grace in the same passionless voice You are quite near home missus Charmond stood inert seeming appalled by her late admission I have told you something in a moment of irresistible desire to unburden my soul which all but a fool would have kept silent as the grave she said I cannot help it now Is it to be a secret or do you mean war A secret certainly said Grace mournfully How can you expect war from such a helpless wretched being as I And I ll do my best not to see him I am his slave but I ll try Grace was naturally kind but she could not help using a small dagger now Pray don t distress yourself she said with exquisitely fine scorn You may keep him for me Had she been wounded instead of mortified she could not have used the words but Fitzpiers s hold upon her heart was slight They parted thus and there and Grace went moodily homeward Passing Marty s cottage she observed through the window that the girl was writing instead of chopping as usual and wondered what her correspondence could be Directly afterwards she met people in search of her and reached the house to find all in serious alarm She soon explained that she had lost her way and her general depression was attributed to exhaustion on that account Could she have known what Marty was writing she would have been surprised The rumor which agitated the other folk of Hintock had reached the young girl and she was penning a letter to Fitzpiers to tell him that missus Charmond wore her hair It was poor Marty s only card and she played it knowing nothing of fashion and thinking her revelation a fatal one for a lover CHAPTER XXXIV It was at the beginning of April a few days after the meeting between Grace and missus Charmond in the wood that Fitzpiers just returned from London was travelling from Sherton Abbas to Hintock in a hired carriage In his eye there was a doubtful light and the lines of his refined face showed a vague disquietude He appeared now like one of those who impress the beholder as having suffered wrong in being born His position was in truth gloomy and to his appreciative mind it seemed even gloomier than it was His practice had been slowly dwindling of late and now threatened to die out altogether the irrepressible old doctor Jones capturing patients up to Fitzpiers s very door Fitzpiers knew only too well the latest and greatest cause of his unpopularity and yet so illogical is man the second branch of his sadness grew out of a remedial measure proposed for the first a letter from Felice Charmond imploring him not to see her again To bring about their severance still more effectually she added she had decided during his absence upon almost immediate departure for the Continent The time was that dull interval in a woodlander s life which coincides with great activity in the life of the woodland itself a period following the close of the winter tree cutting and preceding the barking season when the saps are just beginning to heave with the force of hydraulic lifts inside all the trunks of the forest Winterborne s contract was completed and the plantations were deserted It was dusk there were no leaves as yet the nightingales would not begin to sing for a fortnight and the Mother of the Months was in her most attenuated phase starved and bent to a mere bowed skeleton which glided along behind the bare twigs in Fitzpiers s company When he reached home he went straight up to his wife s sitting room He found it deserted and without a fire He had mentioned no day for his return nevertheless he wondered why she was not there waiting to receive him On descending to the other wing of the house and inquiring of missus Melbury he learned with much surprise that Grace had gone on a visit to an acquaintance at Shottsford Forum three days earlier that tidings had on this morning reached her father of her being very unwell there in consequence of which he had ridden over to see her Fitzpiers went up stairs again and the little drawing room now lighted by a solitary candle was not rendered more cheerful by the entrance of Grammer Oliver with an apronful of wood which she threw on the hearth while she raked out the grate and rattled about the fire irons with a view to making things comfortable Fitzpiers considered that Grace ought to have let him know her plans more accurately before leaving home in a freak like this He went desultorily to the window the blind of which had not been pulled down and looked out at the thin fast sinking moon and at the tall stalk of smoke rising from the top of Suke Damson s chimney signifying that the young woman had just lit her fire to prepare supper He became conscious of a discussion in progress on the opposite side of the court Somebody had looked over the wall to talk to the sawyers and was telling them in a loud voice news in which the name of missus Charmond soon arrested his ears Grammer don t make so much noise with that grate said the surgeon at which Grammer reared herself upon her knees and held the fuel suspended in her hand while Fitzpiers half opened the casement She is off to foreign lands again at last hev made up her mind quite sudden like and it is thoughted she ll leave in a day or two She s been all as if her mind were low for some days past with a sort of sorrow in her face as if she reproached her own soul She s the wrong sort of woman for Hintock hardly knowing a beech from a woak that I own But I don t care who the man is she s been a very kind friend to me Well the day after to morrow is the Sabbath day and without charity we are but tinkling simples but this I do say that her going will be a blessed thing for a certain married couple who remain The fire was lighted and Fitzpiers sat down in front of it restless as the last leaf upon a tree A sort of sorrow in her face as if she reproached her own soul Poor Felice How Felice s frame must be pulsing under the conditions of which he had just heard the caricature how her fair temples must ache what a mood of wretchedness she must be in But for the mixing up of his name with hers and her determination to sunder their too close acquaintance on that account she would probably have sent for him professionally She was now sitting alone suffering perhaps wishing that she had not forbidden him to come again Unable to remain in this lonely room any longer or to wait for the meal which was in course of preparation he made himself ready for riding descended to the yard stood by the stable door while Darling was being saddled and rode off down the lane He would have preferred walking but was weary with his day s travel As he approached the door of Marty South s cottage which it was necessary to pass on his way she came from the porch as if she had been awaiting him and met him in the middle of the road holding up a letter Fitzpiers took it without stopping and asked over his shoulder from whom it came Marty hesitated From me she said shyly though with noticeable firmness This letter contained in fact Marty s declaration that she was the original owner of missus Charmond s supplementary locks and enclosed a sample from the native stock which had grown considerably by this time It was her long contemplated apple of discord and much her hand trembled as she handed the document up to him But it was impossible on account of the gloom for Fitzpiers to read it then while he had the curiosity to do so and he put it in his pocket His imagination having already centred itself on Hintock House in his pocket the letter remained unopened and forgotten all the while that Marty was hopefully picturing its excellent weaning effect upon him He was not long in reaching the precincts of the Manor House He drew rein under a group of dark oaks commanding a view of the front and reflected a while His entry would not be altogether unnatural in the circumstances of her possible indisposition but upon the whole he thought it best to avoid riding up to the door By silently approaching he could retreat unobserved in the event of her not being alone Thereupon he dismounted hitched Darling to a stray bough hanging a little below the general browsing line of the trees and proceeded to the door on foot In the mean time Melbury had returned from Shottsford Forum The great court or quadrangle of the timber merchant s house divided from the shady lane by an ivy covered wall was entered by two white gates one standing near each extremity of the wall It so happened that at the moment when Fitzpiers was riding out at the lower gate on his way to the Manor House Melbury was approaching the upper gate to enter it Fitzpiers being in front of Melbury was seen by the latter but the surgeon never turning his head did not observe his father in law ambling slowly and silently along under the trees though his horse too was a gray one How is Grace said his wife as soon as he entered Melbury looked gloomy She is not at all well he said I don t like the looks of her at all I couldn t bear the notion of her biding away in a strange place any longer and I begged her to let me get her home At last she agreed to it but not till after much persuading I was then sorry that I rode over instead of driving but I have hired a nice comfortable carriage the easiest going I could get and she ll be here in a couple of hours or less I rode on ahead to tell you to get her room ready but I see her husband has come back Yes said missus Melbury She expressed her concern that her husband had hired a carriage all the way from Shottsford What it will cost she said I don t care what it costs he exclaimed testily I was determined to get her home Why she went away I can t think She acts in a way that is not at all likely to mend matters as far as I can see Grace had not told her father of her interview with missus Charmond and the disclosure that had been whispered in her startled ear Since Edgar is come he continued he might have waited in till I got home to ask me how she was if only for a compliment I saw him go out where is he gone missus Melbury did not know positively but she told her husband that there was not much doubt about the place of his first visit after an absence She had in fact seen Fitzpiers take the direction of the Manor House Melbury said no more It was exasperating to him that just at this moment when there was every reason for Fitzpiers to stay indoors or at any rate to ride along the Shottsford road to meet his ailing wife he should be doing despite to her by going elsewhere The old man went out of doors again and his horse being hardly unsaddled as yet he told Upjohn to retighten the girths when he again mounted and rode off at the heels of the surgeon By the time that Melbury reached the park he was prepared to go any lengths in combating this rank and reckless errantry of his daughter s husband He would fetch home Edgar Fitzpiers to night by some means rough or fair in his view there could come of his interference nothing worse than what existed at present And yet to every bad there is a worse He had entered by the bridle gate which admitted to the park on this side and cantered over the soft turf almost in the tracks of Fitzpiers s horse till he reached the clump of trees under which his precursor had halted The whitish object that was indistinctly visible here in the gloom of the boughs he found to be Darling as left by Fitzpiers D n him why did he not ride up to the house in an honest way said Melbury He profited by Fitzpiers s example dismounting he tied his horse under an adjoining tree and went on to the house on foot as the other had done He was no longer disposed to stick at trifles in his investigation and did not hesitate to gently open the front door without ringing The large square hall with its oak floor staircase and wainscot was lighted by a dim lamp hanging from a beam Not a soul was visible He went into the corridor and listened at a door which he knew to be that of the drawing room there was no sound and on turning the handle he found the room empty A fire burning low in the grate was the sole light of the apartment its beams flashed mockingly on the somewhat showy Versaillese furniture and gilding here in style as unlike that of the structural parts of the building as it was possible to be and probably introduced by Felice to counteract the fine old English gloom of the place Disappointed in his hope of confronting his son in law here he went on to the dining room this was without light or fire and pervaded by a cold atmosphere which signified that she had not dined there that day By this time Melbury s mood had a little mollified Everything here was so pacific so unaggressive in its repose that he was no longer incited to provoke a collision with Fitzpiers or with anybody The comparative stateliness of the apartments influenced him to an emotion rather than to a belief that where all was outwardly so good and proper there could not be quite that delinquency within which he had suspected It occurred to him too that even if his suspicion were justified his abrupt if not unwarrantable entry into the house might end in confounding its inhabitant at the expense of his daughter s dignity and his own Any ill result would be pretty sure to hit Grace hardest in the long run He would after all adopt the more rational course and plead with Fitzpiers privately as he had pleaded with missus Charmond He accordingly retreated as silently as he had come Passing the door of the drawing room anew he fancied that he heard a noise within which was not the crackling of the fire Melbury gently reopened the door to a distance of a few inches and saw at the opposite window two figures in the act of stepping out a man and a woman in whom he recognized the lady of the house and his son in law In a moment they had disappeared amid the gloom of the lawn He returned into the hall and let himself out by the carriage entrance door coming round to the lawn front in time to see the two figures parting at the railing which divided the precincts of the house from the open park missus Charmond turned to hasten back immediately that Fitzpiers had left her side and he was speedily absorbed into the duskiness of the trees Melbury waited till missus Charmond had re entered the drawing room and then followed after Fitzpiers thinking that he would allow the latter to mount and ride ahead a little way before overtaking him and giving him a piece of his mind His son in law might possibly see the second horse near his own but that would do him no harm and might prepare him for what he was to expect The event however was different from the plan On plunging into the thick shade of the clump of oaks he could not perceive his horse Blossom anywhere but feeling his way carefully along he by and by discerned Fitzpiers s mare Darling still standing as before under the adjoining tree For a moment Melbury thought that his own horse being young and strong had broken away from her fastening but on listening intently he could hear her ambling comfortably along a little way ahead and a creaking of the saddle which showed that she had a rider Walking on as far as the small gate in the corner of the park he met a laborer who in reply to Melbury s inquiry if he had seen any person on a gray horse said that he had only met doctor Fitzpiers It was just what Melbury had begun to suspect Fitzpiers had mounted the mare which did not belong to him in mistake for his own an oversight easily explicable in a man ever unwitting in horse flesh by the darkness of the spot and the near similarity of the animals in appearance though Melbury s was readily enough seen to be the grayer horse by day He hastened back and did what seemed best in the circumstances got upon old Darling and rode rapidly after Fitzpiers Melbury had just entered the wood and was winding along the cart way which led through it channelled deep in the leaf mould with large ruts that were formed by the timber wagons in fetching the spoil of the plantations when all at once he descried in front at a point where the road took a turning round a large chestnut tree the form of his own horse Blossom at which Melbury quickened Darling s pace thinking to come up with Fitzpiers Nearer view revealed that the horse had no rider At Melbury s approach it galloped friskily away under the trees in a homeward direction Thinking something was wrong the timber merchant dismounted as soon as he reached the chestnut and after feeling about for a minute or two discovered Fitzpiers lying on the ground Here help cried the latter as soon as he felt Melbury s touch I have been thrown off but there s not much harm done I think Since Melbury could not now very well read the younger man the lecture he had intended and as friendliness would be hypocrisy his instinct was to speak not a single word to his son in law He raised Fitzpiers into a sitting posture and found that he was a little stunned and stupefied but as he had said not otherwise hurt How this fall had come about was readily conjecturable Fitzpiers imagining there was only old Darling under him had been taken unawares by the younger horse s sprightliness Melbury was a traveller of the old fashioned sort having just come from Shottsford Forum he still had in his pocket the pilgrim s flask of rum which he always carried on journeys exceeding a dozen miles though he seldom drank much of it He poured it down the surgeon s throat with such effect that he quickly revived Melbury got him on his legs but the question was what to do with him He could not walk more than a few steps and the other horse had gone away With great exertion Melbury contrived to get him astride Darling mounting himself behind and holding Fitzpiers round his waist with one arm Darling being broad straight backed and high in the withers was well able to carry double at any rate as far as Hintock and at a gentle pace CHAPTER XXXV The mare paced along with firm and cautious tread through the copse where Winterborne had worked and into the heavier soil where the oaks grew past Great Willy the largest oak in the wood and thence towards Nellcombe Bottom intensely dark now with overgrowth and popularly supposed to be haunted by the spirits of the fratricides exorcised from Hintock House By this time Fitzpiers was quite recovered as to physical strength But he had eaten nothing since making a hasty breakfast in London that morning his anxiety about Felice having hurried him away from home before dining as a consequence the old rum administered by his father in law flew to the young man s head and loosened his tongue without his ever having recognized who it was that had lent him a kindly hand He began to speak in desultory sentences Melbury still supporting him I ve come all the way from London to day said Fitzpiers Ah that s the place to meet your equals I live at Hintock worse at Little Hintock and I am quite lost there There s not a man within ten miles of Hintock who can comprehend me I tell you Farmer What s your name that I m a man of education I know several languages the poets and I are familiar friends I used to read more in metaphysics than anybody within fifty miles and since I gave that up there s nobody can match me in the whole county of Wessex as a scientist Yet I an doomed to live with tradespeople in a miserable little hole like Hintock Indeed muttered Melbury Fitzpiers increasingly energized by the alcohol here reared himself up suddenly from the bowed posture he had hitherto held thrusting his shoulders so violently against Melbury s breast as to make it difficult for the old man to keep a hold on the reins People don t appreciate me here the surgeon exclaimed lowering his voice he added softly and slowly except one except one A passionate soul as warm as she is clever as beautiful as she is warm and as rich as she is beautiful I say old fellow those claws of yours clutch me rather tight rather like the eagle s you know that ate out the liver of Pro Pre the man on Mount Caucasus People don t appreciate me I say except HER Ah gods I am an unlucky man She would have been mine she would have taken my name but unfortunately it cannot be so I stooped to mate beneath me and now I rue it The position was becoming a very trying one for Melbury corporeally and mentally He was obliged to steady Fitzpiers with his left arm and he began to hate the contact He hardly knew what to do It was useless to remonstrate with Fitzpiers in his intellectual confusion from the rum and from the fall He remained silent his hold upon his companion however being stern rather than compassionate You hurt me a little farmer though I am much obliged to you for your kindness People don t appreciate me I say Between ourselves I am losing my practice here and why Because I see matchless attraction where matchless attraction is both in person and position I mention no names so nobody will be the wiser But I have lost her in a legitimate sense that is If I were a free man now things have come to such a pass that she could not refuse me while with her fortune which I don t covet for itself I should have a chance of satisfying an honorable ambition a chance I have never had yet and now never never shall have probably Melbury his heart throbbing against the other s backbone and his brain on fire with indignation ventured to mutter huskily Why The horse ambled on some steps before Fitzpiers replied Because I am tied and bound to another by law as tightly as I am to you by your arm not that I complain of your arm I thank you for helping me Well where are we Not nearly home yet Home say I It is a home When I might have been at the other house over there In a stupefied way he flung his hand in the direction of the park I was just two months too early in committing myself Had I only seen the other first Here the old man s arm gave Fitzpiers a convulsive shake What are you doing continued the latter Keep still please or put me down I was saying that I lost her by a mere little two months There is no chance for me now in this world and it makes me reckless reckless Unless indeed anything should happen to the other one She is amiable enough but if anything should happen to her and I hear she is ill well if it should I should be free and my fame my happiness would be insured These were the last words that Fitzpiers uttered in his seat in front of the timber merchant Unable longer to master himself Melbury the skin of his face compressed whipped away his spare arm from Fitzpiers s waist and seized him by the collar You heartless villain after all that we have done for ye he cried with a quivering lip And the money of hers that you ve had and the roof we ve provided to shelter ye It is to me George Melbury that you dare to talk like that The exclamation was accompanied by a powerful swing from the shoulder which flung the young man head long into the road Fitzpiers fell with a heavy thud upon the stumps of some undergrowth which had been cut during the winter preceding Darling continued her walk for a few paces farther and stopped God forgive me Melbury murmured repenting of what he had done He tried me too sorely and now perhaps I ve murdered him He turned round in the saddle and looked towards the spot on which Fitzpiers had fallen To his great surprise he beheld the surgeon rise to his feet with a bound as if unhurt and walk away rapidly under the trees Melbury listened till the rustle of Fitzpiers s footsteps died away It might have been a crime but for the mercy of Providence in providing leaves for his fall he said to himself And then his mind reverted to the words of Fitzpiers and his indignation so mounted within him that he almost wished the fall had put an end to the young man there and then He had not ridden far when he discerned his own gray mare standing under some bushes Leaving Darling for a moment Melbury went forward and easily caught the younger animal now disheartened at its freak He then made the pair of them fast to a tree and turning back endeavored to find some trace of Fitzpiers feeling pitifully that after all he had gone further than he intended with the offender But though he threaded the wood hither and thither his toes ploughing layer after layer of the little horny scrolls that had once been leaves he could not find him He stood still listening and looking round The breeze was oozing through the network of boughs as through a strainer the trunks and larger branches stood against the light of the sky in the forms of writhing men gigantic candelabra pikes halberds lances and whatever besides the fancy chose to make of them Giving up the search Melbury came back to the horses and walked slowly homeward leading one in each hand It happened that on this self same evening a boy had been returning from Great to Little Hintock about the time of Fitzpiers s and Melbury s passage home along that route A horse collar that had been left at the harness mender s to be repaired was required for use at five o clock next morning and in consequence the boy had to fetch it overnight He put his head through the collar and accompanied his walk by whistling the one tune he knew as an antidote to fear The boy suddenly became aware of a horse trotting rather friskily along the track behind him and not knowing whether to expect friend or foe prudence suggested that he should cease his whistling and retreat among the trees till the horse and his rider had gone by a course to which he was still more inclined when he found how noiselessly they approached and saw that the horse looked pale and remembered what he had read about Death in the Revelation He therefore deposited the collar by a tree and hid himself behind it The horseman came on and the youth whose eyes were as keen as telescopes to his great relief recognized the doctor As Melbury surmised Fitzpiers had in the darkness taken Blossom for Darling and he had not discovered his mistake when he came up opposite the boy though he was somewhat surprised at the liveliness of his usually placid mare The only other pair of eyes on the spot whose vision was keen as the young carter s were those of the horse and with that strongly conservative objection to the unusual which animals show Blossom on eying the collar under the tree quite invisible to Fitzpiers exercised none of the patience of the older horse but shied sufficiently to unseat so second rate an equestrian as the surgeon He fell and did not move lying as Melbury afterwards found him The boy ran away salving his conscience for the desertion by thinking how vigorously he would spread the alarm of the accident when he got to Hintock which he uncompromisingly did incrusting the skeleton event with a load of dramatic horrors Grace had returned and the fly hired on her account though not by her husband at the Crown Hotel Shottsford Forum had been paid for and dismissed The long drive had somewhat revived her her illness being a feverish intermittent nervousness which had more to do with mind than body and she walked about her sitting room in something of a hopeful mood missus Melbury had told her as soon as she arrived that her husband had returned from London He had gone out she said to see a patient as she supposed and he must soon be back since he had had no dinner or tea Grace would not allow her mind to harbor any suspicion of his whereabouts and her step mother said nothing of missus Charmond s rumored sorrows and plans of departure So the young wife sat by the fire waiting silently She had left Hintock in a turmoil of feeling after the revelation of missus Charmond and had intended not to be at home when her husband returned But she had thought the matter over and had allowed her father s influence to prevail and bring her back and now somewhat regretted that Edgar s arrival had preceded hers By and by missus Melbury came up stairs with a slight air of flurry and abruptness I have something to tell some bad news she said But you must not be alarmed as it is not so bad as it might have been Edgar has been thrown off his horse We don t think he is hurt much It happened in the wood the other side of Nellcombe Bottom where tis said the ghosts of the brothers walk She went on to give a few of the particulars but none of the invented horrors that had been communicated by the boy I thought it better to tell you at once she added in case he should not be very well able to walk home and somebody should bring him missus Melbury really thought matters much worse than she represented and Grace knew that she thought so She sat down dazed for a few minutes returning a negative to her step mother s inquiry if she could do anything for her But please go into the bedroom Grace said on second thoughts and see if all is ready there in case it is serious missus Melbury thereupon called Grammer and they did as directed supplying the room with everything they could think of for the accommodation of an injured man Nobody was left in the lower part of the house Not many minutes passed when Grace heard a knock at the door a single knock not loud enough to reach the ears of those in the bedroom She went to the top of the stairs and said faintly Come up knowing that the door stood as usual in such houses wide open Retreating into the gloom of the broad landing she saw rise up the stairs a woman whom at first she did not recognize till her voice revealed her to be Suke Damson in great fright and sorrow A streak of light from the partially closed door of Grace s room fell upon her face as she came forward and it was drawn and pale Oh Miss Melbury I would say missus Fitzpiers she said wringing her hands This terrible news Is he dead Is he hurted very bad Tell me I couldn t help coming please forgive me Miss Melbury missus Fitzpiers I would say Grace sank down on the oak chest which stood on the landing and put her hands to her now flushed face and head Could she order Suke Damson down stairs and out of the house Her husband might be brought in at any moment and what would happen But could she order this genuinely grieved woman away There was a dead silence of half a minute or so till Suke said Why don t ye speak Is he here Is he dead If so why can t I see him would it be so very wrong Before Grace had answered somebody else came to the door below a foot fall light as a roe s There was a hurried tapping upon the panel as if with the impatient tips of fingers whose owner thought not whether a knocker were there or no Without a pause and possibly guided by the stray beam of light on the landing the newcomer ascended the staircase as the first had done Grace was sufficiently visible and the lady for a lady it was came to her side I could make nobody hear down stairs said Felice Charmond with lips whose dryness could almost be heard and panting as she stood like one ready to sink on the floor with distress What is the matter tell me the worst Can he live She looked at Grace imploringly without perceiving poor Suke who dismayed at such a presence had shrunk away into the shade missus Charmond s little feet were covered with mud she was quite unconscious of her appearance now I have heard such a dreadful report she went on I came to ascertain the truth of it Is he killed She won t tell us he s dying he s in that room burst out Suke regardless of consequences as she heard the distant movements of missus Melbury and Grammer in the bedroom at the end of the passage Where said missus Charmond and on Suke pointing out the direction she made as if to go thither Grace barred the way He is not there she said I have not seen him any more than you I have heard a report only not so bad as you think It must have been exaggerated to you Please do not conceal anything let me know all said Felice doubtingly You shall know all I know you have a perfect right to know who can have a better than either of you said Grace with a delicate sting which was lost upon Felice Charmond now I repeat I have only heard a less alarming account than you have heard how much it means and how little I cannot say I pray God that it means not much in common humanity You probably pray the same for other reasons She regarded them both there in the dim light a while They stood dumb in their trouble not stinging back at her not heeding her mood A tenderness spread over Grace like a dew It was well very well conventionally to address either one of them in the wife s regulation terms of virtuous sarcasm as woman creature or thing for losing their hearts to her husband But life what was it and who was she She had like the singer of the psalm of Asaph been plagued and chastened all the day long but could she by retributive words in order to please herself the individual offend against the generation as he would not He is dying perhaps blubbered Suke Damson putting her apron to her eyes In their gestures and faces there were anxieties affection agony of heart all for a man who had wronged them had never really behaved towards either of them anyhow but selfishly Neither one but would have wellnigh sacrificed half her life to him even now The tears which his possibly critical situation could not bring to her eyes surged over at the contemplation of these fellow women She turned to the balustrade bent herself upon it and wept Thereupon Felice began to cry also without using her handkerchief and letting the tears run down silently While these three poor women stood together thus pitying another though most to be pitied themselves the pacing of a horse or horses became audible in the court and in a moment Melbury s voice was heard calling to his stableman Grace at once started up ran down the stairs and out into the quadrangle as her father crossed it towards the door Father what is the matter with him she cried Who Edgar said Melbury abruptly Matter Nothing What my dear and have you got home safe Why you are better already But you ought not to be out in the air like this But he has been thrown off his horse I know I know I saw it He got up again and walked off as well as ever A fall on the leaves didn t hurt a spry fellow like him He did not come this way he added significantly I suppose he went to look for his horse I tried to find him but could not But after seeing him go away under the trees I found the horse and have led it home for safety So he must walk Now don t you stay out here in this night air She returned to the house with her father When she had again ascended to the landing and to her own rooms beyond it was a great relief to her to find that both Petticoat the First and Petticoat the Second of her Bien aime had silently disappeared They had in all probability heard the words of her father and departed with their anxieties relieved Presently her parents came up to Grace and busied themselves to see that she was comfortable Perceiving soon that she would prefer to be left alone they went away Grace waited on The clock raised its voice now and then but her husband did not return At her father s usual hour for retiring he again came in to see her Do not stay up she said as soon as he entered I am not at all tired I will sit up for him I think it will be useless Grace said Melbury slowly Why I have had a bitter quarrel with him and on that account I hardly think he will return to night A quarrel Was that after the fall seen by the boy Melbury nodded an affirmative without taking his eyes off the candle Yes it was as we were coming home together he said Something had been swelling up in Grace while her father was speaking How could you want to quarrel with him she cried suddenly Why could you not let him come home quietly if he were inclined to He is my husband and now you have married me to him surely you need not provoke him unnecessarily First you induce me to accept him and then you do things that divide us more than we should naturally be divided How can you speak so unjustly to me Grace said Melbury with indignant sorrow I divide you from your husband indeed You little think He was inclined to say more to tell her the whole story of the encounter and that the provocation he had received had lain entirely in hearing her despised But it would have greatly distressed her and he forbore You had better lie down You are tired he said soothingly Good night The household went to bed and a silence fell upon the dwelling broken only by the occasional skirr of a halter in Melbury s stables Despite her father s advice Grace still waited up But nobody came It was a critical time in Grace s emotional life that night She thought of her husband a good deal and for the nonce forgot Winterborne How these unhappy women must have admired Edgar she said to herself How attractive he must be to everybody and indeed he is attractive The possibility is that piqued by rivalry these ideas might have been transformed into their corresponding emotions by a show of the least reciprocity in Fitzpiers There was in truth a love bird yearning to fly from her heart and it wanted a lodging badly But no husband came The fact was that Melbury had been much mistaken about the condition of Fitzpiers People do not fall headlong on stumps of underwood with impunity Had the old man been able to watch Fitzpiers narrowly enough he would have observed that on rising and walking into the thicket he dropped blood as he went that he had not proceeded fifty yards before he showed signs of being dizzy and raising his hands to his head reeled and fell down CHAPTER XXXVI Grace was not the only one who watched and meditated in Hintock that night Felice Charmond was in no mood to retire to rest at a customary hour and over her drawing room fire at the Manor House she sat as motionless and in as deep a reverie as Grace in her little apartment at the homestead Having caught ear of Melbury s intelligence while she stood on the landing at his house and been eased of much of her mental distress her sense of personal decorum returned upon her with a rush She descended the stairs and left the door like a ghost keeping close to the walls of the building till she got round to the gate of the quadrangle through which she noiselessly passed almost before Grace and her father had finished their discourse Suke Damson had thought it well to imitate her superior in this respect and descending the back stairs as Felice descended the front went out at the side door and home to her cottage Once outside Melbury s gates missus Charmond ran with all her speed to the Manor House without stopping or turning her head and splitting her thin boots in her haste She entered her own dwelling as she had emerged from it by the drawing room window In other circumstances she would have felt some timidity at undertaking such an unpremeditated excursion alone but her anxiety for another had cast out her fear for herself Everything in her drawing room was just as she had left it the candles still burning the casement closed and the shutters gently pulled to so as to hide the state of the window from the cursory glance of a servant entering the apartment She had been gone about three quarters of an hour by the clock and nobody seemed to have discovered her absence Tired in body but tense in mind she sat down palpitating round eyed bewildered at what she had done She had been betrayed by affrighted love into a visit which now that the emotion instigating it had calmed down under her belief that Fitzpiers was in no danger was the saddest surprise to her This was how she had set about doing her best to escape her passionate bondage to him Somehow in declaring to Grace and to herself the unseemliness of her infatuation she had grown a convert to its irresistibility If Heaven would only give her strength but Heaven never did One thing was indispensable she must go away from Hintock if she meant to withstand further temptation The struggle was too wearying too hopeless while she remained It was but a continual capitulation of conscience to what she dared not name By degrees as she sat Felice s mind helped perhaps by the anticlimax of learning that her lover was unharmed after all her fright about him grew wondrously strong in wise resolve For the moment she was in a mood in the words of missus Elizabeth Montagu to run mad with discretion and was so persuaded that discretion lay in departure that she wished to set about going that very minute Jumping up from her seat she began to gather together some small personal knick knacks scattered about the room to feel that preparations were really in train While moving here and there she fancied that she heard a slight noise out of doors and stood still Surely it was a tapping at the window A thought entered her mind and burned her cheek He had come to that window before yet was it possible that he should dare to do so now All the servants were in bed and in the ordinary course of affairs she would have retired also Then she remembered that on stepping in by the casement and closing it she had not fastened the window shutter so that a streak of light from the interior of the room might have revealed her vigil to an observer on the lawn How all things conspired against her keeping faith with Grace The tapping recommenced light as from the bill of a little bird her illegitimate hope overcame her vow she went and pulled back the shutter determining however to shake her head at him and keep the casement securely closed What she saw outside might have struck terror into a heart stouter than a helpless woman s at midnight In the centre of the lowest pane of the window close to the glass was a human face which she barely recognized as the face of Fitzpiers It was surrounded with the darkness of the night without corpse like in its pallor and covered with blood As disclosed in the square area of the pane it met her frightened eyes like a replica of the Sudarium of saint Veronica He moved his lips and looked at her imploringly Her rapid mind pieced together in an instant a possible concatenation of events which might have led to this tragical issue She unlatched the casement with a terrified hand and bending down to where he was crouching pressed her face to his with passionate solicitude She assisted him into the room without a word to do which it was almost necessary to lift him bodily Quickly closing the window and fastening the shutters she bent over him breathlessly Are you hurt much much she cried faintly Oh oh how is this Rather much but don t be frightened he answered in a difficult whisper and turning himself to obtain an easier position if possible A little water please She ran across into the dining room and brought a bottle and glass from which he eagerly drank He could then speak much better and with her help got upon the nearest couch Are you dying Edgar she said Do speak to me I am half dead said Fitzpiers But perhaps I shall get over it It is chiefly loss of blood But I thought your fall did not hurt you said she Who did this Felice my father in law I have crawled to you more than a mile on my hands and knees God I thought I should never have got here I have come to you be cause you are the only friend I have in the world now I can never go back to Hintock never to the roof of the Melburys Not poppy nor mandragora will ever medicine this bitter feud If I were only well again Let me bind your head now that you have rested Yes but wait a moment it has stopped bleeding fortunately or I should be a dead man before now While in the wood I managed to make a tourniquet of some half pence and my handkerchief as well as I could in the dark But listen dear Felice Can you hide me till I am well Whatever comes I can be seen in Hintock no more My practice is nearly gone you know and after this I would not care to recover it if I could By this time Felice s tears began to blind her Where were now her discreet plans for sundering their lives forever To administer to him in his pain and trouble and poverty was her single thought The first step was to hide him and she asked herself where A place occurred to her mind She got him some wine from the dining room which strengthened him much Then she managed to remove his boots and as he could now keep himself upright by leaning upon her on one side and a walking stick on the other they went thus in slow march out of the room and up the stairs At the top she took him along a gallery pausing whenever he required rest and thence up a smaller staircase to the least used part of the house where she unlocked a door Within was a lumber room containing abandoned furniture of all descriptions built up in piles which obscured the light of the windows and formed between them nooks and lairs in which a person would not be discerned even should an eye gaze in at the door The articles were mainly those that had belonged to the previous owner of the house and had been bought in by the late mister Charmond at the auction but changing fashion and the tastes of a young wife had caused them to be relegated to this dungeon Here Fitzpiers sat on the floor against the wall till she had hauled out materials for a bed which she spread on the floor in one of the aforesaid nooks She obtained water and a basin and washed the dried blood from his face and hands and when he was comfortably reclining fetched food from the larder While he ate her eyes lingered anxiously on his face following its every movement with such loving kindness as only a fond woman can show He was now in better condition and discussed his position with her What I fancy I said to Melbury must have been enough to enrage any man if uttered in cold blood and with knowledge of his presence But I did not know him and I was stupefied by what he had given me so that I hardly was aware of what I said Well the veil of that temple is rent in twain As I am not going to be seen again in Hintock my first efforts must be directed to allay any alarm that may be felt at my absence before I am able to get clear away Nobody must suspect that I have been hurt or there will be a country talk about me Felice I must at once concoct a letter to check all search for me I think if you can bring me a pen and paper I may be able to do it now I could rest better if it were done Poor thing how I tire her with running up and down She fetched writing materials and held up the blotting book as a support to his hand while he penned a brief note to his nominal wife The animosity shown towards me by your father he wrote in this coldest of marital epistles is such that I cannot return again to a roof which is his even though it shelters you A parting is unavoidable as you are sure to be on his side in this division I am starting on a journey which will take me a long way from Hintock and you must not expect to see me there again for some time He then gave her a few directions bearing upon his professional engagements and other practical matters concluding without a hint of his destination or a notion of when she would see him again He offered to read the note to Felice before he closed it up but she would not hear or see it that side of his obligations distressed her beyond endurance She turned away from Fitzpiers and sobbed bitterly If you can get this posted at a place some miles away he whispered exhausted by the effort of writing at Shottsford or Port Bredy or still better Budmouth it will divert all suspicion from this house as the place of my refuge I will drive to one or other of the places myself anything to keep it unknown she murmured her voice weighted with vague foreboding now that the excitement of helping him had passed away Fitzpiers told her that there was yet one thing more to be done In creeping over the fence on to the lawn he said I made the rail bloody and it shows rather much on the white paint I could see it in the dark At all hazards it should be washed off Could you do that also Felice What will not women do on such devoted occasions weary as she was she went all the way down the rambling staircases to the ground floor then to search for a lantern which she lighted and hid under her cloak then for a wet sponge and next went forth into the night The white railing stared out in the darkness at her approach and a ray from the enshrouded lantern fell upon the blood just where he had told her it would be found She shuddered It was almost too much to bear in one day but with a shaking hand she sponged the rail clean and returned to the house The time occupied by these several proceedings was not much less than two hours When all was done and she had smoothed his extemporized bed and placed everything within his reach that she could think of she took her leave of him and locked him in CHAPTER XXXVII When her husband s letter reached Grace s hands bearing upon it the postmark of a distant town it never once crossed her mind that Fitzpiers was within a mile of her still She felt relieved that he did not write more bitterly of the quarrel with her father whatever its nature might have been but the general frigidity of his communication quenched in her the incipient spark that events had kindled so shortly before From this centre of information it was made known in Hintock that the doctor had gone away and as none but the Melbury household was aware that he did not return on the night of his accident no excitement manifested itself in the village Thus the early days of May passed by None but the nocturnal birds and animals observed that late one evening towards the middle of the month a closely wrapped figure with a crutch under one arm and a stick in his hand crept out from Hintock House across the lawn to the shelter of the trees taking thence a slow and laborious walk to the nearest point of the turnpike road The mysterious personage was so disguised that his own wife would hardly have known him Felice Charmond was a practised hand at make ups as well she might be and she had done her utmost in padding and painting Fitzpiers with the old materials of her art in the recesses of the lumber room In the highway he was met by a covered carriage which conveyed him to Sherton Abbas whence he proceeded to the nearest port on the south coast and immediately crossed the Channel But it was known to everybody that three days after this time missus Charmond executed her long deferred plan of setting out for a long term of travel and residence on the Continent She went off one morning as unostentatiously as could be and took no maid with her having she said engaged one to meet her at a point farther on in her route After that Hintock House so frequently deserted was again to be let Spring had not merged in summer when a clinching rumor founded on the best of evidence reached the parish and neighborhood missus Charmond and Fitzpiers had been seen together in Baden in relations which set at rest the question that had agitated the little community ever since the winter Melbury had entered the Valley of Humiliation even farther than Grace His spirit seemed broken But once a week he mechanically went to market as usual and here as he was passing by the conduit one day his mental condition expressed largely by his gait he heard his name spoken by a voice formerly familiar He turned and saw a certain Fred Beaucock once a promising lawyer s clerk and local dandy who had been called the cleverest fellow in Sherton without whose brains the firm of solicitors employing him would be nowhere But later on Beaucock had fallen into the mire He was invited out a good deal sang songs at agricultural meetings and burgesses dinners in sum victualled himself with spirits more frequently than was good for the clever brains or body either He lost his situation and after an absence spent in trying his powers elsewhere came back to his native town where at the time of the foregoing events in Hintock he gave legal advice for astonishingly small fees mostly carrying on his profession on public house settles in whose recesses he might often have been overheard making country people s wills for half a crown calling with a learned voice for pen and ink and a halfpenny sheet of paper on which he drew up the testament while resting it in a little space wiped with his hand on the table amid the liquid circles formed by the cups and glasses An idea implanted early in life is difficult to uproot and many elderly tradespeople still clung to the notion that Fred Beaucock knew a great deal of law It was he who had called Melbury by name You look very down mister Melbury very if I may say as much he observed when the timber merchant turned But I know I know A very sad case very I was bred to the law as you know and am professionally no stranger to such matters Well missus Fitzpiers has her remedy How what a remedy said Melbury Under the new law sir A new court was established last year and under the new statute twenty and twenty one Vic cap eighty five unmarrying is as easy as marrying No more Acts of Parliament necessary no longer one law for the rich and another for the poor But come inside I was just going to have a nibleykin of rum hot I ll explain it all to you The intelligence amazed Melbury who saw little of newspapers And though he was a severely correct man in his habits and had no taste for entering a tavern with Fred Beaucock nay would have been quite uninfluenced by such a character on any other matter in the world such fascination lay in the idea of delivering his poor girl from bondage that it deprived him of the critical faculty He could not resist the ex lawyer s clerk and entered the inn Here they sat down to the rum which Melbury paid for as a matter of course Beaucock leaning back in the settle with a legal gravity which would hardly allow him to be conscious of the spirits before him though they nevertheless disappeared with mysterious quickness How much of the exaggerated information on the then new divorce laws which Beaucock imparted to his listener was the result of ignorance and how much of dupery was never ascertained But he related such a plausible story of the ease with which Grace could become a free woman that her father was irradiated with the project and though he scarcely wetted his lips Melbury never knew how he came out of the inn or when or where he mounted his gig to pursue his way homeward But home he found himself his brain having all the way seemed to ring sonorously as a gong in the intensity of its stir Before he had seen Grace he was accidentally met by Winterborne who found his face shining as if he had like the Law giver conversed with an angel He relinquished his horse and took Winterborne by the arm to a heap of rendlewood as barked oak was here called which lay under a privet hedge Giles he said when they had sat down upon the logs there s a new law in the land Grace can be free quite easily I only knew it by the merest accident I might not have found it out for the next ten years She can get rid of him d ye hear get rid of him Think of that my friend Giles He related what he had learned of the new legal remedy A subdued tremulousness about the mouth was all the response that Winterborne made and Melbury added My boy you shall have her yet if you want her His feelings had gathered volume as he said this and the articulate sound of the old idea drowned his sight in mist Are you sure about this new law asked Winterborne so disquieted by a gigantic exultation which loomed alternately with fearful doubt that he evaded the full acceptance of Melbury s last statement Melbury said that he had no manner of doubt for since his talk with Beaucock it had come into his mind that he had seen some time ago in the weekly paper an allusion to such a legal change but having no interest in those desperate remedies at the moment he had passed it over But I m not going to let the matter rest doubtful for a single day he continued I am going to London Beaucock will go with me and we shall get the best advice as soon as we possibly can Beaucock is a thorough lawyer nothing the matter with him but a fiery palate I knew him as the stay and refuge of Sherton in knots of law at one time Winterborne s replies were of the vaguest The new possibility was almost unthinkable by him at the moment He was what was called at Hintock a solid going fellow he maintained his abeyant mood not from want of reciprocity but from a taciturn hesitancy taught by life as he knew it But continued the timber merchant a temporary crease or two of anxiety supplementing those already established in his forehead by time and care Grace is not at all well Nothing constitutional you know but she has been in a low nervous state ever since that night of fright I don t doubt but that she will be all right soon I wonder how she is this evening He rose with the words as if he had too long forgotten her personality in the excitement of her previsioned career They had sat till the evening was beginning to dye the garden brown and now went towards Melbury s house Giles a few steps in the rear of his old friend who was stimulated by the enthusiasm of the moment to outstep the ordinary walking of Winterborne He felt shy of entering Grace s presence as her reconstituted lover which was how her father s manner would be sure to present him before definite information as to her future state was forthcoming it seemed too nearly like the act of those who rush in where angels fear to tread A chill to counterbalance all the glowing promise of the day was prompt enough in coming No sooner had he followed the timber merchant in at the door than he heard Grammer inform him that missus Fitzpiers was still more unwell than she had been in the morning Old doctor Jones being in the neighborhood they had called him in and he had instantly directed them to get her to bed They were not however to consider her illness serious a feverish nervous attack the result of recent events was what she was suffering from and she would doubtless be well in a few days Winterborne therefore did not remain and his hope of seeing her that evening was disappointed Even this aggravation of her morning condition did not greatly depress Melbury He knew he said that his daughter s constitution was sound enough It was only these domestic troubles that were pulling her down Once free she would be blooming again Melbury diagnosed rightly as parents usually do He set out for London the next morning Jones having paid another visit and assured him that he might leave home without uneasiness especially on an errand of that sort which would the sooner put an end to her suspense The timber merchant had been away only a day or two when it was told in Hintock that mister Fitzpiers s hat had been found in the wood Later on in the afternoon the hat was brought to Melbury and by a piece of ill fortune into Grace s presence It had doubtless lain in the wood ever since his fall from the horse but it looked so clean and uninjured the summer weather and leafy shelter having much favored its preservation that Grace could not believe it had remained so long concealed A very little of fact was enough to set her fevered fancy at work at this juncture she thought him still in the neighborhood she feared his sudden appearance and her nervous malady developed consequences so grave that doctor Jones began to look serious and the household was alarmed It was the beginning of June and the cuckoo at this time of the summer scarcely ceased his cry for more than two or three hours during the night The bird s note so familiar to her ears from infancy was now absolute torture to the poor girl On the Friday following the Wednesday of Melbury s departure and the day after the discovery of Fitzpiers s hat the cuckoo began at two o clock in the morning with a sudden cry from one of Melbury s apple trees not three yards from the window of Grace s room Oh he is coming she cried and in her terror sprang clean from the bed out upon the floor These starts and frights continued till noon and when the doctor had arrived and had seen her and had talked with missus Melbury he sat down and meditated That ever present terror it was indispensable to remove from her mind at all hazards and he thought how this might be done Without saying a word to anybody in the house or to the disquieted Winterborne waiting in the lane below doctor Jones went home and wrote to mister Melbury at the London address he had obtained from his wife The gist of his communication was that missus Fitzpiers should be assured as soon as possible that steps were being taken to sever the bond which was becoming a torture to her that she would soon be free and was even then virtually so If you can say it AT ONCE it may be the means of averting much harm he said Write to herself not to me On Saturday he drove over to Hintock and assured her with mysterious pacifications that in a day or two she might expect to receive some assuring news So it turned out When Sunday morning came there was a letter for Grace from her father It arrived at seven o clock the usual time at which the toddling postman passed by Hintock at eight Grace awoke having slept an hour or two for a wonder and missus Melbury brought up the letter Can you open it yourself said she Oh yes yes said Grace with feeble impatience She tore the envelope unfolded the sheet and read when a creeping blush tinctured her white neck and cheek Her father had exercised a bold discretion He informed her that she need have no further concern about Fitzpiers s return that she would shortly be a free woman and therefore if she should desire to wed her old lover which he trusted was the case since it was his own deep wish she would be in a position to do so In this Melbury had not written beyond his belief But he very much stretched the facts in adding that the legal formalities for dissolving her union were practically settled The truth was that on the arrival of the doctor s letter poor Melbury had been much agitated and could with difficulty be prevented by Beaucock from returning to her bedside What was the use of his rushing back to Hintock Beaucock had asked him The only thing that could do her any good was a breaking of the bond Though he had not as yet had an interview with the eminent solicitor they were about to consult he was on the point of seeing him and the case was clear enough Thus the simple Melbury urged by his parental alarm at her danger by the representations of his companion and by the doctor s letter had yielded and sat down to tell her roundly that she was virtually free And you d better write also to the gentleman suggested Beaucock who scenting notoriety and the germ of a large practice in the case wished to commit Melbury to it irretrievably to effect which he knew that nothing would be so potent as awakening the passion of Grace for Winterborne so that her father might not have the heart to withdraw from his attempt to make her love legitimate when he discovered that there were difficulties in the way The nervous impatient Melbury was much pleased with the idea of starting them at once as he called it To put his long delayed reparative scheme in train had become a passion with him now He added to the letter addressed to his daughter a passage hinting that she ought to begin to encourage Winterborne lest she should lose him altogether and he wrote to Giles that the path was virtually open for him at last Life was short he declared there were slips betwixt the cup and the lip her interest in him should be reawakened at once that all might be ready when the good time came for uniting them CHAPTER XXXVIII At these warm words Winterborne was not less dazed than he was moved in heart The novelty of the avowal rendered what it carried with it inapprehensible by him in its entirety Only a few short months ago completely estranged from this family beholding Grace going to and fro in the distance clothed with the alienating radiance of obvious superiority the wife of the then popular and fashionable Fitzpiers hopelessly outside his social boundary down to so recent a time that flowers then folded were hardly faded yet he was now asked by that jealously guarding father of hers to take courage to get himself ready for the day when he should be able to claim her The old times came back to him in dim procession How he had been snubbed how Melbury had despised his Christmas party how that sweet coy Grace herself had looked down upon him and his household arrangements and poor Creedle s contrivances Well he could not believe it Surely the adamantine barrier of marriage with another could not be pierced like this It did violence to custom Yet a new law might do anything But was it at all within the bounds of probability that a woman who over and above her own attainments had been accustomed to those of a cultivated professional man could ever be the wife of such as he Since the date of his rejection he had almost grown to see the reasonableness of that treatment He had said to himself again and again that her father was right that the poor ceorl Giles Winterborne would never have been able to make such a dainty girl happy Yet now that she had stood in a position farther removed from his own than at first he was asked to prepare to woo her He was full of doubt Nevertheless it was not in him to show backwardness To act so promptly as Melbury desired him to act seemed indeed scarcely wise because of the uncertainty of events Giles knew nothing of legal procedure but he did know that for him to step up to Grace as a lover before the bond which bound her was actually dissolved was simply an extravagant dream of her father s overstrained mind He pitied Melbury for his almost childish enthusiasm and saw that the aging man must have suffered acutely to be weakened to this unreasoning desire Winterborne was far too magnanimous to harbor any cynical conjecture that the timber merchant in his intense affection for Grace was courting him now because that young lady when disunited would be left in an anomalous position to escape which a bad husband was better than none He felt quite sure that his old friend was simply on tenterhooks of anxiety to repair the almost irreparable error of dividing two whom Nature had striven to join together in earlier days and that in his ardor to do this he was oblivious of formalities The cautious supervision of his past years had overleaped itself at last Hence Winterborne perceived that in this new beginning the necessary care not to compromise Grace by too early advances must be exercised by himself Perhaps Winterborne was not quite so ardent as heretofore There is no such thing as a stationary love men are either loving more or loving less But Giles himself recognized no decline in his sense of her dearness If the flame did indeed burn lower now than when he had fetched her from Sherton at her last return from school the marvel was small He had been laboring ever since his rejection and her marriage to reduce his former passion to a docile friendship out of pure regard to its expediency and their separation may have helped him to a partial success A week and more passed and there was no further news of Melbury But the effect of the intelligence he had already transmitted upon the elastic nerved daughter of the woods had been much what the old surgeon Jones had surmised It had soothed her perturbed spirit better than all the opiates in the pharmacopoeia She had slept unbrokenly a whole night and a day The new law was to her a mysterious beneficent godlike entity lately descended upon earth that would make her as she once had been without trouble or annoyance Her position fretted her its abstract features rousing an aversion which was even greater than her aversion to the personality of him who had caused it It was mortifying productive of slights undignified Him she could forget her circumstances she had always with her She saw nothing of Winterborne during the days of her recovery and perhaps on that account her fancy wove about him a more romantic tissue than it could have done if he had stood before her with all the specks and flaws inseparable from corporeity He rose upon her memory as the fruit god and the wood god in alternation sometimes leafy and smeared with green lichen as she had seen him among the sappy boughs of the plantations sometimes cider stained and with apple pips in the hair of his arms as she had met him on his return from cider making in White Hart Vale with his vats and presses beside him In her secret heart she almost approximated to her father s enthusiasm in wishing to show Giles once for all how she still regarded him The question whether the future would indeed bring them together for life was a standing wonder with her She knew that it could not with any propriety do so just yet But reverently believing in her father s sound judgment and knowledge as good girls are wont to do she remembered what he had written about her giving a hint to Winterborne lest there should be risk in delay and her feelings were not averse to such a step so far as it could be done without danger at this early stage of the proceedings From being a frail phantom of her former equable self she returned in bounds to a condition of passable philosophy She bloomed again in the face in the course of a few days and was well enough to go about as usual One day missus Melbury proposed that for a change she should be driven in the gig to Sherton market whither Melbury s man was going on other errands Grace had no business whatever in Sherton but it crossed her mind that Winterborne would probably be there and this made the thought of such a drive interesting On the way she saw nothing of him but when the horse was walking slowly through the obstructions of Sheep Street she discerned the young man on the pavement She thought of that time when he had been standing under his apple tree on her return from school and of the tender opportunity then missed through her fastidiousness Her heart rose in her throat She abjured all such fastidiousness now Nor did she forget the last occasion on which she had beheld him in that town making cider in the court yard of the Earl of Wessex Hotel while she was figuring as a fine lady in the balcony above Grace directed the man to set her down there in the midst and immediately went up to her lover Giles had not before observed her and his eyes now suppressedly looked his pleasure without the embarrassment that had formerly marked him at such meetings When a few words had been spoken she said archly I have nothing to do Perhaps you are deeply engaged I Not a bit My business now at the best of times is small I am sorry to say Well then I am going into the Abbey Come along with me The proposition had suggested itself as a quick escape from publicity for many eyes were regarding her She had hoped that sufficient time had elapsed for the extinction of curiosity but it was quite otherwise The people looked at her with tender interest as the deserted girl wife without obtrusiveness and without vulgarity but she was ill prepared for scrutiny in any shape They walked about the Abbey aisles and presently sat down Not a soul was in the building save themselves She regarded a stained window with her head sideways and tentatively asked him if he remembered the last time they were in that town alone He remembered it perfectly and remarked You were a proud miss then and as dainty as you were high Perhaps you are now Grace slowly shook her head Affliction has taken all that out of me she answered impressively Perhaps I am too far the other way now As there was something lurking in this that she could not explain she added so quickly as not to allow him time to think of it Has my father written to you at all Yes said Winterborne She glanced ponderingly up at him Not about me Yes His mouth was lined with charactery which told her that he had been bidden to take the hint as to the future which she had been bidden to give The unexpected discovery sent a scarlet pulsation through Grace for the moment However it was only Giles who stood there of whom she had no fear and her self possession returned He said I was to sound you with a view to what you will understand if you care to continued Winterborne in a low voice Having been put on this track by herself he was not disposed to abandon it in a hurry They had been children together and there was between them that familiarity as to personal affairs which only such acquaintanceship can give You know Giles she answered speaking in a very practical tone that that is all very well but I am in a very anomalous position at present and I cannot say anything to the point about such things as those No he said with a stray air as regarded the subject He was looking at her with a curious consciousness of discovery He had not been imagining that their renewed intercourse would show her to him thus For the first time he realized an unexpectedness in her which after all should not have been unexpected She before him was not the girl Grace Melbury whom he used to know Of course he might easily have prefigured as much but it had never occurred to him She was a woman who had been married she had moved on and without having lost her girlish modesty she had lost her girlish shyness The inevitable change though known to him had not been heeded and it struck him into a momentary fixity The truth was that he had never come into close comradeship with her since her engagement to Fitzpiers with the brief exception of the evening encounter on Rubdown Hill when she met him with his cider apparatus and that interview had been of too cursory a kind for insight Winterborne had advanced too He could criticise her Times had been when to criticise a single trait in Grace Melbury would have lain as far beyond his powers as to criticise a deity This thing was sure it was a new woman in many ways whom he had come out to see a creature of more ideas more dignity and above all more assurance than the original Grace had been capable of He could not at first decide whether he were pleased or displeased at this But upon the whole the novelty attracted him She was so sweet and sensitive that she feared his silence betokened something in his brain of the nature of an enemy to her What are you thinking of that makes those lines come in your forehead she asked I did not mean to offend you by speaking of the time being premature as yet Touched by the genuine loving kindness which had lain at the foundation of these words and much moved Winterborne turned his face aside as he took her by the hand He was grieved that he had criticised her You are very good dear Grace he said in a low voice You are better much better than you used to be How He could not very well tell her how and said with an evasive smile You are prettier which was not what he really had meant He then remained still holding her right hand in his own right so that they faced in opposite ways and as he did not let go she ventured upon a tender remonstrance I think we have gone as far as we ought to go at present and far enough to satisfy my poor father that we are the same as ever You see Giles my case is not settled yet and if Oh suppose I NEVER get free there should be any hitch or informality She drew a catching breath and turned pale The dialogue had been affectionate comedy up to this point The gloomy atmosphere of the past and the still gloomy horizon of the present had been for the interval forgotten Now the whole environment came back the due balance of shade among the light was restored It is sure to be all right I trust she resumed in uneasy accents What did my father say the solicitor had told him Oh that all is sure enough The case is so clear nothing could be clearer But the legal part is not yet quite done and finished as is natural Oh no of course not she said sunk in meek thought But father said it was ALMOST did he not Do you know anything about the new law that makes these things so easy Nothing except the general fact that it enables ill assorted husbands and wives to part in a way they could not formerly do without an Act of Parliament Have you to sign a paper or swear anything Is it something like that Yes I believe so How long has it been introduced About six months or a year the lawyer said I think To hear these two poor Arcadian innocents talk of imperial law would have made a humane person weep who should have known what a dangerous structure they were building up on their supposed knowledge They remained in thought like children in the presence of the incomprehensible Giles she said at last it makes me quite weary when I think how serious my situation is or has been Shall we not go out from here now as it may seem rather fast of me our being so long together I mean if anybody were to see us I am almost sure she added uncertainly that I ought not to let you hold my hand yet knowing that the documents or whatever it may be have not been signed so that I am still as married as ever or almost My dear father has forgotten himself Not that I feel morally bound to any one else after what has taken place no woman of spirit could now too that several months have passed But I wish to keep the proprieties as well as I can Yes yes Still your father reminds us that life is short I myself feel that it is that is why I wished to understand you in this that we have begun At times dear Grace since receiving your father s letter I am as uneasy and fearful as a child at what he said If one of us were to die before the formal signing and sealing that is to release you have been done if we should drop out of the world and never have made the most of this little short but real opportunity I should think to myself as I sunk down dying Would to my God that I had spoken out my whole heart given her one poor little kiss when I had the chance to give it But I never did although she had promised to be mine some day and now I never can That s what I should think She had begun by watching the words from his lips with a mournful regard as though their passage were visible but as he went on she dropped her glance Yes she said I have thought that too And because I have thought it I by no means meant in speaking of the proprieties to be reserved and cold to you who loved me so long ago or to hurt your heart as I used to do at that thoughtless time Oh not at all indeed But ought I to allow you oh it is too quick surely Her eyes filled with tears of bewildered alarmed emotion Winterborne was too straightforward to influence her further against her better judgment Yes I suppose it is he said repentantly I ll wait till all is settled What did your father say in that last letter He meant about his progress with the petition but she mistaking him frankly spoke of the personal part He said what I have implied Should I tell more plainly Oh no don t if it is a secret Not at all I will tell every word straight out Giles if you wish He said I was to encourage you There But I cannot obey him further to day Come let us go now She gently slid her hand from his and went in front of him out of the Abbey I was thinking of getting some dinner said Winterborne changing to the prosaic as they walked And you too must require something Do let me take you to a place I know Grace was almost without a friend in the world outside her father s house her life with Fitzpiers had brought her no society had sometimes indeed brought her deeper solitude and inconsideration than any she had ever known before Hence it was a treat to her to find herself again the object of thoughtful care But she questioned if to go publicly to dine with Giles Winterborne were not a proposal due rather to his unsophistication than to his discretion She said gently that she would much prefer his ordering her lunch at some place and then coming to tell her it was ready while she remained in the Abbey porch Giles saw her secret reasoning thought how hopelessly blind to propriety he was beside her and went to do as she wished He was not absent more than ten minutes and found Grace where he had left her It will be quite ready by the time you get there he said and told her the name of the inn at which the meal had been ordered which was one that she had never heard of I ll find it by inquiry said Grace setting out And shall I see you again Oh yes come to me there It will not be like going together I shall want you to find my father s man and the gig for me He waited on some ten minutes or a quarter of an hour till he thought her lunch ended and that he might fairly take advantage of her invitation to start her on her way home He went straight to The Three Tuns a little tavern in a side street scrupulously clean but humble and inexpensive On his way he had an occasional misgiving as to whether the place had been elegant enough for her and as soon as he entered it and saw her ensconced there he perceived that he had blundered Grace was seated in the only dining room that the simple old hostelry could boast of which was also a general parlor on market days a long low apartment with a sanded floor herring boned with a broom a wide red curtained window to the street and another to the garden Grace had retreated to the end of the room looking out upon the latter the front part being full of a mixed company which had dropped in since he was there She was in a mood of the greatest depression On arriving and seeing what the tavern was like she had been taken by surprise but having gone too far to retreat she had heroically entered and sat down on the well scrubbed settle opposite the narrow table with its knives and steel forks tin pepper boxes blue salt cellars and posters advertising the sale of bullocks against the wall The last time that she had taken any meal in a public place it had been with Fitzpiers at the grand new Earl of Wessex Hotel in that town after a two months roaming and sojourning at the gigantic hotels of the Continent How could she have expected any other kind of accommodation in present circumstances than such as Giles had provided And yet how unprepared she was for this change The tastes that she had acquired from Fitzpiers had been imbibed so subtly that she hardly knew she possessed them till confronted by this contrast The elegant Fitzpiers in fact at that very moment owed a long bill at the above mentioned hotel for the luxurious style in which he used to put her up there whenever they drove to Sherton But such is social sentiment that she had been quite comfortable under those debt impending conditions while she felt humiliated by her present situation which Winterborne had paid for honestly on the nail He had noticed in a moment that she shrunk from her position and all his pleasure was gone It was the same susceptibility over again which had spoiled his Christmas party long ago But he did not know that this recrudescence was only the casual result of Grace s apprenticeship to what she was determined to learn in spite of it a consequence of one of those sudden surprises which confront everybody bent upon turning over a new leaf She had finished her lunch which he saw had been a very mincing performance and he brought her out of the house as soon as he could Now he said with great sad eyes you have not finished at all well I know Come round to the Earl of Wessex I ll order a tea there I did not remember that what was good enough for me was not good enough for you Her face faded into an aspect of deep distress when she saw what had happened Oh no Giles she said with extreme pathos certainly not Why do you say that when you know better You EVER will misunderstand me Indeed that s not so missus Fitzpiers Can you deny that you felt out of place at The Three Tuns I don t know Well since you make me speak I do not deny it And yet I have felt at home there these twenty years Your husband used always to take you to the Earl of Wessex did he not Yes she reluctantly admitted How could she explain in the street of a market town that it was her superficial and transitory taste which had been offended and not her nature or her affection Fortunately or unfortunately at that moment they saw Melbury s man driving vacantly along the street in search of her the hour having passed at which he had been told to take her up Winterborne hailed him and she was powerless then to prolong the discourse She entered the vehicle sadly and the horse trotted away CHAPTER XXXIX All night did Winterborne think over that unsatisfactory ending of a pleasant time forgetting the pleasant time itself He feared anew that they could never be happy together even should she be free to choose him She was accomplished he was unrefined It was the original difficulty which he was too sensitive to recklessly ignore as some men would have done in his place He was one of those silent unobtrusive beings who want little from others in the way of favor or condescension and perhaps on that very account scrutinize those others behavior too closely He was not versatile but one in whom a hope or belief which had once had its rise meridian and decline seldom again exactly recurred as in the breasts of more sanguine mortals He had once worshipped her laid out his life to suit her wooed her and lost her Though it was with almost the same zest it was with not quite the same hope that he had begun to tread the old tracks again and allowed himself to be so charmed with her that day Move another step towards her he would not He would even repulse her as a tribute to conscience It would be sheer sin to let her prepare a pitfall for her happiness not much smaller than the first by inveigling her into a union with such as he Her poor father was now blind to these subtleties which he had formerly beheld as in noontide light It was his own duty to declare them for her dear sake Grace too had a very uncomfortable night and her solicitous embarrassment was not lessened the next morning when another letter from her father was put into her hands Its tenor was an intenser strain of the one that had preceded it After stating how extremely glad he was to hear that she was better and able to get out of doors he went on This is a wearisome business the solicitor we have come to see being out of town I do not know when I shall get home My great anxiety in this delay is still lest you should lose Giles Winterborne I cannot rest at night for thinking that while our business is hanging fire he may become estranged or go away from the neighborhood I have set my heart upon seeing him your husband if you ever have another Do then Grace give him some temporary encouragement even though it is over early For when I consider the past I do think God will forgive me and you for being a little forward I have another reason for this my dear I feel myself going rapidly downhill and late affairs have still further helped me that way And until this thing is done I cannot rest in peace He added a postscript I have just heard that the solicitor is to be seen to morrow Possibly therefore I shall return in the evening after you get this The paternal longing ran on all fours with her own desire and yet in forwarding it yesterday she had been on the brink of giving offence While craving to be a country girl again just as her father requested to put off the old Eve the fastidious miss or rather madam completely her first attempt had been beaten by the unexpected vitality of that fastidiousness Her father on returning and seeing the trifling coolness of Giles would be sure to say that the same perversity which had led her to make difficulties about marrying Fitzpiers was now prompting her to blow hot and cold with poor Winterborne If the latter had been the most subtle hand at touching the stops of her delicate soul instead of one who had just bound himself to let her drift away from him again if she would on the wind of her estranging education he could not have acted more seductively than he did that day He chanced to be superintending some temporary work in a field opposite her windows She could not discover what he was doing but she read his mood keenly and truly she could see in his coming and going an air of determined abandonment of the whole landscape that lay in her direction Oh how she longed to make it up with him Her father coming in the evening which meant she supposed that all formalities would be in train her marriage virtually annulled and she be free to be won again how could she look him in the face if he should see them estranged thus It was a fair green evening in June She was seated in the garden in the rustic chair which stood under the laurel bushes made of peeled oak branches that came to Melbury s premises as refuse after barking time The mass of full juiced leafage on the heights around her was just swayed into faint gestures by a nearly spent wind which even in its enfeebled state did not reach her shelter All day she had expected Giles to call to inquire how she had got home or something or other but he had not come And he still tantalized her by going athwart and across that orchard opposite She could see him as she sat A slight diversion was presently created by Creedle bringing him a letter She knew from this that Creedle had just come from Sherton and had called as usual at the post office for anything that had arrived by the afternoon post of which there was no delivery at Hintock She pondered on what the letter might contain particularly whether it were a second refresher for Winterborne from her father like her own of the morning But it appeared to have no bearing upon herself whatever Giles read its contents and almost immediately turned away to a gap in the hedge of the orchard if that could be called a hedge which owing to the drippings of the trees was little more than a bank with a bush upon it here and there He entered the plantation and was no doubt going that way homeward to the mysterious hut he occupied on the other side of the woodland The sad sands were running swiftly through Time s glass she had often felt it in these latter days and like Giles she felt it doubly now after the solemn and pathetic reminder in her father s communication Her freshness would pass the long suffering devotion of Giles might suddenly end might end that very hour Men were so strange The thought took away from her all her former reticence and made her action bold She started from her seat If the little breach quarrel or whatever it might be called of yesterday was to be healed up it must be done by her on the instant She crossed into the orchard and clambered through the gap after Giles just as he was diminishing to a faun like figure under the green canopy and over the brown floor Grace had been wrong very far wrong in assuming that the letter had no reference to herself because Giles had turned away into the wood after its perusal It was sad to say because the missive had so much reference to herself that he had thus turned away He feared that his grieved discomfiture might be observed The letter was from Beaucock written a few hours later than Melbury s to his daughter It announced failure Giles had once done that thriftless man a good turn and now was the moment when Beaucock had chosen to remember it in his own way During his absence in town with Melbury the lawyer s clerk had naturally heard a great deal of the timber merchant s family scheme of justice to Giles and his communication was to inform Winterborne at the earliest possible moment that their attempt had failed in order that the young man should not place himself in a false position towards Grace in the belief of its coming success The news was in sum that Fitzpiers s conduct had not been sufficiently cruel to Grace to enable her to snap the bond She was apparently doomed to be his wife till the end of the chapter Winterborne quite forgot his superficial differences with the poor girl under the warm rush of deep and distracting love for her which the almost tragical information engendered To renounce her forever that was then the end of it for him after all There was no longer any question about suitability or room for tiffs on petty tastes The curtain had fallen again between them She could not be his The cruelty of their late revived hope was now terrible How could they all have been so simple as to suppose this thing could be done It was at this moment that hearing some one coming behind him he turned and saw her hastening on between the thickets He perceived in an instant that she did not know the blighting news Giles why didn t you come across to me she asked with arch reproach Didn t you see me sitting there ever so long Oh yes he said in unprepared extemporized tones for her unexpected presence caught him without the slightest plan of behavior in the conjuncture His manner made her think that she had been too chiding in her speech and a mild scarlet wave passed over her as she resolved to soften it I have had another letter from my father she hastened to continue He thinks he may come home this evening And in view of his hopes it will grieve him if there is any little difference between us Giles There is none he said sadly regarding her from the face downward as he pondered how to lay the cruel truth bare Still I fear you have not quite forgiven me about my being uncomfortable at the inn I have Grace I m sure But you speak in quite an unhappy way she returned coming up close to him with the most winning of the many pretty airs that appertained to her Don t you think you will ever be happy Giles He did not reply for some instants When the sun shines on the north front of Sherton Abbey that s when my happiness will come to me said he staring as it were into the earth But then that means that there is something more than my offending you in not liking The Three Tuns If it is because I did not like to let you kiss me in the Abbey well you know Giles that it was not on account of my cold feelings but because I did certainly just then think it was rather premature in spite of my poor father That was the true reason the sole one But I do not want to be hard God knows I do not she said her voice fluctuating And perhaps as I am on the verge of freedom I am not right after all in thinking there is any harm in your kissing me Oh God said Winterborne within himself His head was turned askance as he still resolutely regarded the ground For the last several minutes he had seen this great temptation approaching him in regular siege and now it had come The wrong the social sin of now taking advantage of the offer of her lips had a magnitude in the eyes of one whose life had been so primitive so ruled by purest household laws as Giles s which can hardly be explained Did you say anything she asked timidly Oh no only that You mean that it must BE settled since my father is coming home she said gladly Winterborne though fighting valiantly against himself all this while though he would have protected Grace s good repute as the apple of his eye was a man and as Desdemona said men are not gods In face of the agonizing seductiveness shown by her in her unenlightened school girl simplicity about the laws and ordinances he betrayed a man s weakness Since it was so since it had come to this that Grace deeming herself free to do it was virtually asking him to demonstrate that he loved her since he could demonstrate it only too truly since life was short and love was strong he gave way to the temptation notwithstanding that he perfectly well knew her to be wedded irrevocably to Fitzpiers Indeed he cared for nothing past or future simply accepting the present and what it brought desiring once in his life to clasp in his arms her he had watched over and loved so long She started back suddenly from his embrace influenced by a sort of inspiration Oh I suppose she stammered that I am really free that this is right Is there REALLY a new law Father cannot have been too sanguine in saying He did not answer and a moment afterwards Grace burst into tears in spite of herself Oh why does not my father come home and explain she sobbed and let me know clearly what I am It is too trying this to ask me to and then to leave me so long in so vague a state that I do not know what to do and perhaps do wrong Winterborne felt like a very Cain over and above his previous sorrow How he had sinned against her in not telling her what he knew He turned aside the feeling of his cruelty mounted higher and higher How could he have dreamed of kissing her He could hardly refrain from tears Surely nothing more pitiable had ever been known than the condition of this poor young thing now as heretofore the victim of her father s well meant but blundering policy Even in the hour of Melbury s greatest assurance Winterborne had harbored a suspicion that no law new or old could undo Grace s marriage without her appearance in public though he was not sufficiently sure of what might have been enacted to destroy by his own words her pleasing idea that a mere dash of the pen on her father s testimony was going to be sufficient But he had never suspected the sad fact that the position was irremediable Poor Grace perhaps feeling that she had indulged in too much fluster for a mere kiss calmed herself at finding how grave he was I am glad we are friends again anyhow she said smiling through her tears Giles if you had only shown half the boldness before I married that you show now you would have carried me off for your own first instead of second If we do marry I hope you will never think badly of me for encouraging you a little but my father is SO impatient you know as his years and infirmities increase that he will wish to see us a little advanced when he comes That is my only excuse To Winterborne all this was sadder than it was sweet How could she so trust her father s conjectures He did not know how to tell her the truth and shame himself And yet he felt that it must be done We may have been wrong he began almost fearfully in supposing that it can all be carried out while we stay here at Hintock I am not sure but that people may have to appear in a public court even under the new Act and if there should be any difficulty and we cannot marry after all Her cheeks became slowly bloodless Oh Giles she said grasping his arm you have heard something What cannot my father conclude it there and now Surely he has done it Oh Giles Giles don t deceive me What terrible position am I in He could not tell her try as he would The sense of her implicit trust in his honor absolutely disabled him I cannot inform you he murmured his voice as husky as that of the leaves underfoot Your father will soon be here Then we shall know I will take you home Inexpressibly dear as she was to him he offered her his arm with the most reserved air as he added correctingly I will take you at any rate into the drive Thus they walked on together Grace vibrating between happiness and misgiving It was only a few minutes walk to where the drive ran and they had hardly descended into it when they heard a voice behind them cry Take out that arm For a moment they did not heed and the voice repeated more loudly and hoarsely Take out that arm It was Melbury s He had returned sooner than they expected and now came up to them Grace s hand had been withdrawn like lightning on her hearing the second command I don t blame you I don t blame you he said in the weary cadence of one broken down with scourgings But you two must walk together no more I have been surprised I have been cruelly deceived Giles don t say anything to me but go away He was evidently not aware that Winterborne had known the truth before he brought it and Giles would not stay to discuss it with him then When the young man had gone Melbury took his daughter in doors to the room he used as his office There he sat down and bent over the slope of the bureau her bewildered gaze fixed upon him When Melbury had recovered a little he said You are now as ever Fitzpiers s wife I was deluded He has not done you ENOUGH harm You are still subject to his beck and call Then let it be and never mind father she said with dignified sorrow I can bear it It is your trouble that grieves me most She stooped over him and put her arm round his neck which distressed Melbury still more I don t mind at all what comes to me Grace continued whose wife I am or whose I am not I do love Giles I cannot help that and I have gone further with him than I should have done if I had known exactly how things were But I do not reproach you Then Giles did not tell you said Melbury No said she He could not have known it His behavior to me proved that he did not know Her father said nothing more and Grace went away to the solitude of her chamber Her heavy disquietude had many shapes and for a time she put aside the dominant fact to think of her too free conduct towards Giles His love making had been brief as it was sweet but would he on reflection contemn her for forwardness How could she have been so simple as to suppose she was in a position to behave as she had done Thus she mentally blamed her ignorance and yet in the centre of her heart she blessed it a little for what it had momentarily brought her CHAPTER XL Life among the people involved in these events seemed to be suppressed and hide bound for a while Grace seldom showed herself outside the house never outside the garden for she feared she might encounter Giles Winterborne and that she could not bear This pensive intramural existence of the self constituted nun appeared likely to continue for an indefinite time She had learned that there was one possibility in which her formerly imagined position might become real and only one that her husband s absence should continue long enough to amount to positive desertion But she never allowed her mind to dwell much upon the thought still less did she deliberately hope for such a result Her regard for Winterborne had been rarefied by the shock which followed its avowal into an ethereal emotion that had little to do with living and doing As for Giles he was lying or rather sitting ill at his hut A feverish indisposition which had been hanging about him for some time the result of a chill caught the previous winter seemed to acquire virulence with the prostration of his hopes But not a soul knew of his languor and he did not think the case serious enough to send for a medical man After a few days he was better again and crept about his home in a great coat attending to his simple wants as usual with his own hands So matters stood when the limpid inertion of Grace s pool like existence was disturbed as by a geyser She received a letter from Fitzpiers Such a terrible letter it was in its import though couched in the gentlest language In his absence Grace had grown to regard him with toleration and her relation to him with equanimity till she had almost forgotten how trying his presence would be He wrote briefly and unaffectedly he made no excuses but informed her that he was living quite alone and had been led to think that they ought to be together if she would make up her mind to forgive him He therefore purported to cross the Channel to Budmouth by the steamer on a day he named which she found to be three days after the time of her present reading He said that he could not come to Hintock for obvious reasons which her father would understand even better than herself As the only alternative she was to be on the quay to meet the steamer when it arrived from the opposite coast probably about half an hour before midnight bringing with her any luggage she might require join him there and pass with him into the twin vessel which left immediately the other entered the harbor returning thus with him to his continental dwelling place which he did not name He had no intention of showing himself on land at all The troubled Grace took the letter to her father who now continued for long hours by the fireless summer chimney corner as if he thought it were winter the pitcher of cider standing beside him mostly untasted and coated with a film of dust After reading it he looked up You sha n t go said he I had felt I would not she answered But I did not know what you would say If he comes and lives in England not too near here and in a respectable way and wants you to come to him I am not sure that I ll oppose him in wishing it muttered Melbury I d stint myself to keep you both in a genteel and seemly style But go abroad you never shall with my consent There the question rested that day Grace was unable to reply to her husband in the absence of an address and the morrow came and the next day and the evening on which he had requested her to meet him Throughout the whole of it she remained within the four walls of her room The sense of her harassment carking doubt of what might be impending hung like a cowl of blackness over the Melbury household They spoke almost in whispers and wondered what Fitzpiers would do next It was the hope of every one that finding she did not arrive he would return again to France and as for Grace she was willing to write to him on the most kindly terms if he would only keep away The night passed Grace lying tense and wide awake and her relatives in great part likewise When they met the next morning they were pale and anxious though neither speaking of the subject which occupied all their thoughts The day passed as quietly as the previous ones and she began to think that in the rank caprice of his moods he had abandoned the idea of getting her to join him as quickly as it was formed All on a sudden some person who had just come from Sherton entered the house with the news that mister Fitzpiers was on his way home to Hintock He had been seen hiring a carriage at the Earl of Wessex Hotel Her father and Grace were both present when the intelligence was announced Now said Melbury we must make the best of what has been a very bad matter The man is repenting the partner of his shame I hear is gone away from him to Switzerland so that chapter of his life is probably over If he chooses to make a home for ye I think you should not say him nay Grace Certainly he cannot very well live at Hintock without a blow to his pride but if he can bear that and likes Hintock best why there s the empty wing of the house as it was before Oh father said Grace turning white with dismay Why not said he a little of his former doggedness returning He was in truth disposed to somewhat more leniency towards her husband just now than he had shown formerly from a conviction that he had treated him over roughly in his anger Surely it is the most respectable thing to do he continued I don t like this state that you are in neither married nor single It hurts me and it hurts you and it will always be remembered against us in Hintock There has never been any scandal like it in the family before He will be here in less than an hour murmured Grace The twilight of the room prevented her father seeing the despondent misery of her face The one intolerable condition the condition she had deprecated above all others was that of Fitzpiers s reinstatement there Oh I won t I won t see him she said sinking down She was almost hysterical Try if you cannot he returned moodily Oh yes I will I will she went on inconsequently I ll try and jumping up suddenly she left the room In the darkness of the apartment to which she flew nothing could have been seen during the next half hour but from a corner a quick breathing was audible from this impressible creature who combined modern nerves with primitive emotions and was doomed by such coexistence to be numbered among the distressed and to take her scourgings to their exquisite extremity The window was open On this quiet late summer evening whatever sound arose in so secluded a district the chirp of a bird a call from a voice the turning of a wheel extended over bush and tree to unwonted distances Very few sounds did arise But as Grace invisibly breathed in the brown glooms of the chamber the small remote noise of light wheels came in to her accompanied by the trot of a horse on the turnpike road There seemed to be a sudden hitch or pause in the progress of the vehicle which was what first drew her attention to it She knew the point whence the sound proceeded the hill top over which travellers passed on their way hitherward from Sherton Abbas the place at which she had emerged from the wood with missus Charmond Grace slid along the floor and bent her head over the window sill listening with open lips The carriage had stopped and she heard a man use exclamatory words Then another said What the devil is the matter with the horse She recognized the voice as her husband s The accident such as it had been was soon remedied and the carriage could be heard descending the hill on the Hintock side soon to turn into the lane leading out of the highway and then into the drong which led out of the lane to the house where she was A spasm passed through Grace The Daphnean instinct exceptionally strong in her as a girl had been revived by her widowed seclusion and it was not lessened by her affronted sentiments towards the comer and her regard for another man She opened some little ivory tablets that lay on the dressing table scribbled in pencil on one of them I am gone to visit one of my school friends gathered a few toilet necessaries into a hand bag and not three minutes after that voice had been heard her slim form hastily wrapped up from observation might have been seen passing out of the back door of Melbury s house Thence she skimmed up the garden path through the gap in the hedge and into the mossy cart track under the trees which led into the depth of the woods The leaves overhead were now in their latter green so opaque that it was darker at some of the densest spots than in winter time scarce a crevice existing by which a ray could get down to the ground But in open places she could see well enough Summer was ending in the daytime singing insects hung in every sunbeam vegetation was heavy nightly with globes of dew and after showers creeping damps and twilight chills came up from the hollows The plantations were always weird at this hour of eve more spectral far than in the leafless season when there were fewer masses and more minute lineality The smooth surfaces of glossy plants came out like weak lidless eyes there were strange faces and figures from expiring lights that had somehow wandered into the canopied obscurity while now and then low peeps of the sky between the trunks were like sheeted shapes and on the tips of boughs sat faint cloven tongues But Grace s fear just now was not imaginative or spiritual and she heeded these impressions but little She went on as silently as she could avoiding the hollows wherein leaves had accumulated and stepping upon soundless moss and grass tufts She paused breathlessly once or twice and fancied that she could hear above the beat of her strumming pulse the vehicle containing Fitzpiers turning in at the gate of her father s premises She hastened on again The Hintock woods owned by missus Charmond were presently left behind and those into which she next plunged were divided from the latter by a bank from whose top the hedge had long ago perished starved for want of sun It was with some caution that Grace now walked though she was quite free from any of the commonplace timidities of her ordinary pilgrimages to such spots She feared no lurking harms but that her effort would be all in vain and her return to the house rendered imperative She had walked between three and four miles when that prescriptive comfort and relief to wanderers in woods a distant light broke at last upon her searching eyes It was so very small as to be almost sinister to a stranger but to her it was what she sought She pushed forward and the dim outline of a dwelling was disclosed The house was a square cot of one story only sloping up on all sides to a chimney in the midst It had formerly been the home of a charcoal burner in times when that fuel was still used in the county houses Its only appurtenance was a paled enclosure there being no garden the shade of the trees preventing the growth of vegetables She advanced to the window whence the rays of light proceeded and the shutters being as yet unclosed she could survey the whole interior through the panes The room within was kitchen parlor and scullery all in one the natural sandstone floor was worn into hills and dales by long treading so that none of the furniture stood level and the table slanted like a desk A fire burned on the hearth in front of which revolved the skinned carcass of a rabbit suspended by a string from a nail Leaning with one arm on the mantle shelf stood Winterborne his eyes on the roasting animal his face so rapt that speculation could build nothing on it concerning his thoughts more than that they were not with the scene before him She thought his features had changed a little since she saw them last The fire light did not enable her to perceive that they were positively haggard Grace s throat emitted a gasp of relief at finding the result so nearly as she had hoped She went to the door and tapped lightly He seemed to be accustomed to the noises of woodpeckers squirrels and such small creatures for he took no notice of her tiny signal and she knocked again This time he came and opened the door When the light of the room fell upon her face he started and hardly knowing what he did crossed the threshold to her placing his hands upon her two arms while surprise joy alarm sadness chased through him by turns With Grace it was the same even in this stress there was the fond fact that they had met again Thus they stood Long tears upon their faces waxen white With extreme sad delight He broke the silence by saying in a whisper Come in No no Giles she answered hurriedly stepping yet farther back from the door I am passing by and I have called on you I won t enter Will you help me I am afraid I want to get by a roundabout way to Sherton and so to Exbury I have a school fellow there but I cannot get to Sherton alone Oh if you will only accompany me a little way Don t condemn me Giles and be offended I was obliged to come to you because I have no other help here Three months ago you were my lover now you are only my friend The law has stepped in and forbidden what we thought of It must not be But we can act honestly and yet you can be my friend for one little hour I have no other She could get no further Covering her eyes with one hand by an effort of repression she wept a silent trickle without a sigh or sob Winterborne took her other hand What has happened he said He has come There was a stillness as of death till Winterborne asked You mean this Grace that I am to help you to get away Yes said she Appearance is no matter when the reality is right I have said to myself I can trust you Giles knew from this that she did not suspect his treachery if it could be called such earlier in the summer when they met for the last time as lovers and in the intensity of his contrition for that tender wrong he determined to deserve her faith now at least and so wipe out that reproach from his conscience I ll come at once he said I ll light a lantern He unhooked a dark lantern from a nail under the eaves and she did not notice how his hand shook with the slight strain or dream that in making this offer he was taxing a convalescence which could ill afford such self sacrifice The lantern was lit and they started CHAPTER XLI The first hundred yards of their course lay under motionless trees whose upper foliage began to hiss with falling drops of rain By the time that they emerged upon a glade it rained heavily This is awkward said Grace with an effort to hide her concern Winterborne stopped Grace he said preserving a strictly business manner which belied him you cannot go to Sherton to night But I must Why It is nine miles from here It is almost an impossibility in this rain True WHY she replied mournfully at the end of a silence What is reputation to me Now hearken said Giles You won t go back to your No no no Don t make me she cried piteously Then let us turn They slowly retraced their steps and again stood before his door Now this house from this moment is yours and not mine he said deliberately I have a place near by where I can stay very well Her face had drooped Oh she murmured as she saw the dilemma What have I done There was a smell of something burning within and he looked through the window The rabbit that he had been cooking to coax a weak appetite was beginning to char Please go in and attend to it he said Do what you like Now I leave You will find everything about the hut that is necessary But Giles your supper she exclaimed An out house would do for me anything till to morrow at day break He signified a negative I tell you to go in you may catch agues out here in your delicate state You can give me my supper through the window if you feel well enough I ll wait a while He gently urged her to pass the door way and was relieved when he saw her within the room sitting down Without so much as crossing the threshold himself he closed the door upon her and turned the key in the lock Tapping at the window he signified that she should open the casement and when she had done this he handed in the key to her You are locked in he said and your own mistress Even in her trouble she could not refrain from a faint smile at his scrupulousness as she took the door key Do you feel better he went on If so and you wish to give me some of your supper please do If not it is of no importance I can get some elsewhere The grateful sense of his kindness stirred her to action though she only knew half what that kindness really was At the end of some ten minutes she again came to the window pushed it open and said in a whisper Giles He at once emerged from the shade and saw that she was preparing to hand him his share of the meal upon a plate I don t like to treat you so hardly she murmured with deep regret in her words as she heard the rain pattering on the leaves But I suppose it is best to arrange like this Oh yes he said quickly I feel that I could never have reached Sherton It was impossible Are you sure you have a snug place out there With renewed misgiving Quite Have you found everything you want I am afraid it is rather rough accommodation Can I notice defects I have long passed that stage and you know it Giles or you ought to His eyes sadly contemplated her face as its pale responsiveness modulated through a crowd of expressions that showed only too clearly to what a pitch she was strung If ever Winterborne s heart fretted his bosom it was at this sight of a perfectly defenceless creature conditioned by such circumstances He forgot his own agony in the satisfaction of having at least found her a shelter He took his plate and cup from her hands saying Now I ll push the shutter to and you will find an iron pin on the inside which you must fix into the bolt Do not stir in the morning till I come and call you She expressed an alarmed hope that he would not go very far away Oh no I shall be quite within hail said Winterborne She bolted the window as directed and he retreated His snug place proved to be a wretched little shelter of the roughest kind formed of four hurdles thatched with brake fern Underneath were dry sticks hay and other litter of the sort upon which he sat down and there in the dark tried to eat his meal But his appetite was quite gone He pushed the plate aside and shook up the hay and sacks so as to form a rude couch on which he flung himself down to sleep for it was getting late But sleep he could not for many reasons of which not the least was thought of his charge He sat up and looked towards the cot through the damp obscurity With all its external features the same as usual he could scarcely believe that it contained the dear friend he would not use a warmer name who had come to him so unexpectedly and he could not help admitting so rashly He had not ventured to ask her any particulars but the position was pretty clear without them Though social law had negatived forever their opening paradise of the previous June it was not without stoical pride that he accepted the present trying conjuncture There was one man on earth in whom she believed absolutely and he was that man That this crisis could end in nothing but sorrow was a view for a moment effaced by this triumphant thought of her trust in him and the purity of the affection with which he responded to that trust rendered him more than proof against any frailty that besieged him in relation to her The rain which had never ceased now drew his attention by beginning to drop through the meagre screen that covered him He rose to attempt some remedy for this discomfort but the trembling of his knees and the throbbing of his pulse told him that in his weakness he was unable to fence against the storm and he lay down to bear it as best he might He was angry with himself for his feebleness he who had been so strong It was imperative that she should know nothing of his present state and to do that she must not see his face by daylight for its color would inevitably betray him The next morning accordingly when it was hardly light he rose and dragged his stiff limbs about the precincts preparing for her everything she could require for getting breakfast within On the bench outside the window sill he placed water wood and other necessaries writing with a piece of chalk beside them It is best that I should not see you Put my breakfast on the bench At seven o clock he tapped at her window as he had promised retreating at once that she might not catch sight of him But from his shelter under the boughs he could see her very well when in response to his signal she opened the window and the light fell upon her face The languid largeness of her eyes showed that her sleep had been little more than his own and the pinkness of their lids that her waking hours had not been free from tears She read the writing seemed he thought disappointed but took up the materials he had provided evidently thinking him some way off Giles waited on assured that a girl who in spite of her culture knew what country life was would find no difficulty in the simple preparation of their food Within the cot it was all very much as he conjectured though Grace had slept much longer than he After the loneliness of the night she would have been glad to see him but appreciating his feeling when she read the writing she made no attempt to recall him She found abundance of provisions laid in his plan being to replenish his buttery weekly and this being the day after the victualling van had called from Sherton When the meal was ready she put what he required outside as she had done with the supper and notwithstanding her longing to see him withdrew from the window promptly and left him to himself It had been a leaden dawn and the rain now steadily renewed its fall As she heard no more of Winterborne she concluded that he had gone away to his daily work and forgotten that he had promised to accompany her to Sherton an erroneous conclusion for he remained all day by force of his condition within fifty yards of where she was The morning wore on and in her doubt when to start and how to travel she lingered yet keeping the door carefully bolted lest an intruder should discover her Locked in this place she was comparatively safe at any rate and doubted if she would be safe elsewhere The humid gloom of an ordinary wet day was doubled by the shade and drip of the leafage Autumn this year was coming in with rains Gazing in her enforced idleness from the one window of the living room she could see various small members of the animal community that lived unmolested there creatures of hair fluff and scale the toothed kind and the billed kind underground creatures jointed and ringed circumambulating the hut under the impression that Giles having gone away nobody was there and eying it inquisitively with a view to winter quarters Watching these neighbors who knew neither law nor sin distracted her a little from her trouble and she managed to while away some portion of the afternoon by putting Giles s home in order and making little improvements which she deemed that he would value when she was gone Once or twice she fancied that she heard a faint noise amid the trees resembling a cough but as it never came any nearer she concluded that it was a squirrel or a bird At last the daylight lessened and she made up a larger fire for the evenings were chilly As soon as it was too dark which was comparatively early to discern the human countenance in this place of shadows there came to the window to her great delight a tapping which she knew from its method to be Giles s She opened the casement instantly and put out her hand to him though she could only just perceive his outline He clasped her fingers and she noticed the heat of his palm and its shakiness He has been walking fast in order to get here quickly she thought How could she know that he had just crawled out from the straw of the shelter hard by and that the heat of his hand was feverishness My dear good Giles she burst out impulsively Anybody would have done it for you replied Winterborne with as much matter of fact as he could summon About my getting to Exbury she said I have been thinking responded Giles with tender deference that you had better stay where you are for the present if you wish not to be caught I need not tell you that the place is yours as long as you like and perhaps in a day or two finding you absent he will go away At any rate in two or three days I could do anything to assist such as make inquiries or go a great way towards Sherton Abbas with you for the cider season will soon be coming on and I want to run down to the Vale to see how the crops are and I shall go by the Sherton road But for a day or two I am busy here He was hoping that by the time mentioned he would be strong enough to engage himself actively on her behalf I hope you do not feel over much melancholy in being a prisoner She declared that she did not mind it but she sighed From long acquaintance they could read each other s heart symptoms like books of large type I fear you are sorry you came said Giles and that you think I should have advised you more firmly than I did not to stay Oh no dear dear friend answered Grace with a heaving bosom Don t think that that is what I regret What I regret is my enforced treatment of you dislodging you excluding you from your own house Why should I not speak out You know what I feel for you what I have felt for no other living man what I shall never feel for a man again But as I have vowed myself to somebody else than you and cannot be released I must behave as I do behave and keep that vow I am not bound to him by any divine law after what he has done but I have promised and I will pay The rest of the evening was passed in his handing her such things as she would require the next day and casual remarks thereupon an occupation which diverted her mind to some degree from pathetic views of her attitude towards him and of her life in general The only infringement if infringement it could be called of his predetermined bearing towards her was an involuntary pressing of her hand to his lips when she put it through the casement to bid him good night He knew she was weeping though he could not see her tears She again entreated his forgiveness for so selfishly appropriating the cottage But it would only be for a day or two more she thought since go she must He replied yearningly I I don t like you to go away Oh Giles said she I know I know But I am a woman and you are a man I cannot speak more plainly Whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are of good report you know what is in my mind because you know me so well Yes Grace yes I do not at all mean that the question between us has not been settled by the fact of your marriage turning out hopelessly unalterable I merely meant well a feeling no more In a week at the outside I should be discovered if I stayed here and I think that by law he could compel me to return to him Yes perhaps you are right Go when you wish dear Grace His last words that evening were a hopeful remark that all might be well with her yet that mister Fitzpiers would not intrude upon her life if he found that his presence cost her so much pain Then the window was closed the shutters folded and the rustle of his footsteps died away No sooner had she retired to rest that night than the wind began to rise and after a few prefatory blasts to be accompanied by rain The wind grew more violent and as the storm went on it was difficult to believe that no opaque body but only an invisible colorless thing was trampling and climbing over the roof making branches creak springing out of the trees upon the chimney popping its head into the flue and shrieking and blaspheming at every corner of the walls As in the old story the assailant was a spectre which could be felt but not seen She had never before been so struck with the devilry of a gusty night in a wood because she had never been so entirely alone in spirit as she was now She seemed almost to be apart from herself a vacuous duplicate only The recent self of physical animation and clear intentions was not there Sometimes a bough from an adjoining tree was swayed so low as to smite the roof in the manner of a gigantic hand smiting the mouth of an adversary to be followed by a trickle of rain as blood from the wound To all this weather Giles must be more or less exposed how much she did not know At last Grace could hardly endure the idea of such a hardship in relation to him Whatever he was suffering it was she who had caused it he vacated his house on account of her She was not worth such self sacrifice she should not have accepted it of him And then as her anxiety increased with increasing thought there returned upon her mind some incidents of her late intercourse with him which she had heeded but little at the time The look of his face what had there been about his face which seemed different from its appearance as of yore Was it not thinner less rich in hue less like that of ripe autumn s brother to whom she had formerly compared him And his voice she had distinctly noticed a change in tone And his gait surely it had been feebler stiffer more like the gait of a weary man That slight occasional noise she had heard in the day and attributed to squirrels it might have been his cough after all Thus conviction took root in her perturbed mind that Winterborne was ill or had been so and that he had carefully concealed his condition from her that she might have no scruples about accepting a hospitality which by the nature of the case expelled her entertainer My own own true l my dear kind friend she cried to herself Oh it shall not be it shall not be She hastily wrapped herself up and obtained a light with which she entered the adjoining room the cot possessing only one floor Setting down the candle on the table here she went to the door with the key in her hand and placed it in the lock Before turning it she paused her fingers still clutching it and pressing her other hand to her forehead she fell into agitating thought A tattoo on the window caused by the tree droppings blowing against it brought her indecision to a close She turned the key and opened the door The darkness was intense seeming to touch her pupils like a substance She only now became aware how heavy the rainfall had been and was the dripping of the eaves splashed like a fountain She stood listening with parted lips and holding the door in one hand till her eyes growing accustomed to the obscurity discerned the wild brandishing of their boughs by the adjoining trees At last she cried loudly with an effort Giles you may come in There was no immediate answer to her cry and overpowered by her own temerity Grace retreated quickly shut the door and stood looking on the floor But it was not for long She again lifted the latch and with far more determination than at first Giles Giles she cried with the full strength of her voice and without any of the shamefacedness that had characterized her first cry Oh come in come in Where are you I have been wicked I have thought too much of myself Do you hear I don t want to keep you out any longer I cannot bear that you should suffer so Gi i iles A reply It was a reply Through the darkness and wind a voice reached her floating upon the weather as though a part of it Here I am all right Don t trouble about me Don t you want to come in Are you not ill I don t mind what they say or what they think any more I am all right he repeated It is not necessary for me to come Good night good night Grace sighed turned and shut the door slowly Could she have been mistaken about his health Perhaps after all she had perceived a change in him because she had not seen him for so long Time sometimes did his ageing work in jerks as she knew Well she had done all she could He would not come in She retired to rest again CHAPTER XLII The next morning Grace was at the window early She felt determined to see him somehow that day and prepared his breakfast eagerly Eight o clock struck and she had remembered that he had not come to arouse her by a knocking as usual her own anxiety having caused her to stir The breakfast was set in its place without But he did not arrive to take it and she waited on Nine o clock arrived and the breakfast was cold and still there was no Giles A thrush that had been repeating itself a good deal on an opposite bush for some time came and took a morsel from the plate and bolted it waited looked around and took another At ten o clock she drew in the tray and sat down to her own solitary meal He must have been called away on business early the rain having cleared off Yet she would have liked to assure herself by thoroughly exploring the precincts of the hut that he was nowhere in its vicinity but as the day was comparatively fine the dread lest some stray passenger or woodman should encounter her in such a reconnoitre paralyzed her wish The solitude was further accentuated to day by the stopping of the clock for want of winding and the fall into the chimney corner of flakes of soot loosened by the rains At noon she heard a slight rustling outside the window and found that it was caused by an eft which had crept out of the leaves to bask in the last sun rays that would be worth having till the following May She continually peeped out through the lattice but could see little In front lay the brown leaves of last year and upon them some yellowish green ones of this season that had been prematurely blown down by the gale Above stretched an old beech with vast armpits and great pocket holes in its sides where branches had been amputated in past times a black slug was trying to climb it Dead boughs were scattered about like ichthyosauri in a museum and beyond them were perishing woodbine stems resembling old ropes From the other window all she could see were more trees jacketed with lichen and stockinged with moss At their roots were stemless yellow fungi like lemons and apricots and tall fungi with more stem than stool Next were more trees close together wrestling for existence their branches disfigured with wounds resulting from their mutual rubbings and blows It was the struggle between these neighbors that she had heard in the night Beneath them were the rotting stumps of those of the group that had been vanquished long ago rising from their mossy setting like decayed teeth from green gums Farther on were other tufts of moss in islands divided by the shed leaves variety upon variety dark green and pale green moss like little fir trees like plush like malachite stars like nothing on earth except moss The strain upon Grace s mind in various ways was so great on this the most desolate day she had passed there that she felt it would be well nigh impossible to spend another in such circumstances The evening came at last the sun when its chin was on the earth found an opening through which to pierce the shade and stretched irradiated gauzes across the damp atmosphere making the wet trunks shine and throwing splotches of such ruddiness on the leaves beneath the beech that they were turned to gory hues When night at last arrived and with it the time for his return she was nearly broken down with suspense The simple evening meal partly tea partly supper which Grace had prepared stood waiting upon the hearth and yet Giles did not come It was now nearly twenty four hours since she had seen him As the room grew darker and only the firelight broke against the gloom of the walls she was convinced that it would be beyond her staying power to pass the night without hearing from him or from somebody Yet eight o clock drew on and his form at the window did not appear The meal remained untasted Suddenly rising from before the hearth of smouldering embers where she had been crouching with her hands clasped over her knees she crossed the room unlocked the door and listened Every breath of wind had ceased with the decline of day but the rain had resumed the steady dripping of the night before Grace might have stood there five minutes when she fancied she heard that old sound a cough at no great distance and it was presently repeated If it were Winterborne s he must be near her why then had he not visited her A horrid misgiving that he could not visit her took possession of Grace and she looked up anxiously for the lantern which was hanging above her head To light it and go in the direction of the sound would be the obvious way to solve the dread problem but the conditions made her hesitate and in a moment a cold sweat pervaded her at further sounds from the same quarter They were low mutterings at first like persons in conversation but gradually resolving themselves into varieties of one voice It was an endless monologue like that we sometimes hear from inanimate nature in deep secret places where water flows or where ivy leaves flap against stones but by degrees she was convinced that the voice was Winterborne s Yet who could be his listener so mute and patient for though he argued so rapidly and persistently nobody replied A dreadful enlightenment spread through the mind of Grace Oh she cried in her anguish as she hastily prepared herself to go out how selfishly correct I am always too too correct Cruel propriety is killing the dearest heart that ever woman clasped to her own While speaking thus to herself she had lit the lantern and hastening out without further thought took the direction whence the mutterings had proceeded The course was marked by a little path which ended at a distance of about forty yards in a small erection of hurdles not much larger than a shock of corn such as were frequent in the woods and copses when the cutting season was going on It was too slight even to be called a hovel and was not high enough to stand upright in appearing in short to be erected for the temporary shelter of fuel The side towards Grace was open and turning the light upon the interior she beheld what her prescient fear had pictured in snatches all the way thither Upon the straw within Winterborne lay in his clothes just as she had seen him during the whole of her stay here except that his hat was off and his hair matted and wild Both his clothes and the straw were saturated with rain His arms were flung over his head his face was flushed to an unnatural crimson His eyes had a burning brightness and though they met her own she perceived that he did not recognize her Oh my Giles she cried what have I done to you But she stopped no longer even to reproach herself She saw that the first thing to be thought of was to get him indoors How Grace performed that labor she never could have exactly explained But by dint of clasping her arms round him rearing him into a sitting posture and straining her strength to the uttermost she put him on one of the hurdles that was loose alongside and taking the end of it in both her hands dragged him along the path to the entrance of the hut and after a pause for breath in at the door way It was somewhat singular that Giles in his semi conscious state acquiesced unresistingly in all that she did But he never for a moment recognized her continuing his rapid conversation to himself and seeming to look upon her as some angel or other supernatural creature of the visionary world in which he was mentally living The undertaking occupied her more than ten minutes but by that time to her great thankfulness he was in the inner room lying on the bed his damp outer clothing removed Then the unhappy Grace regarded him by the light of the candle There was something in his look which agonized her in the rush of his thoughts accelerating their speed from minute to minute He seemed to be passing through the universe of ideas like a comet erratic inapprehensible untraceable Grace s distraction was almost as great as his In a few moments she firmly believed he was dying Unable to withstand her impulse she knelt down beside him kissed his hands and his face and his hair exclaiming in a low voice How could I How could I Her timid morality had indeed underrated his chivalry till now though she knew him so well The purity of his nature his freedom from the grosser passions his scrupulous delicacy had never been fully understood by Grace till this strange self sacrifice in lonely juxtaposition to her own person was revealed The perception of it added something that was little short of reverence to the deep affection for him of a woman who herself had more of Artemis than of Aphrodite in her constitution All that a tender nurse could do Grace did and the power to express her solicitude in action unconscious though the sufferer was brought her mournful satisfaction She bathed his hot head wiped his perspiring hands moistened his lips cooled his fiery eyelids sponged his heated skin and administered whatever she could find in the house that the imagination could conceive as likely to be in any way alleviating That she might have been the cause or partially the cause of all this interfused misery with her sorrow Six months before this date a scene almost similar in its mechanical parts had been enacted at Hintock House It was between a pair of persons most intimately connected in their lives with these Outwardly like as it had been it was yet infinite in spiritual difference though a woman s devotion had been common to both Grace rose from her attitude of affection and bracing her energies saw that something practical must immediately be done Much as she would have liked in the emotion of the moment to keep him entirely to herself medical assistance was necessary while there remained a possibility of preserving him alive Such assistance was fatal to her own concealment but even had the chance of benefiting him been less than it was she would have run the hazard for his sake The question was where should she get a medical man competent and near There was one such man and only one within accessible distance a man who if it were possible to save Winterborne s life had the brain most likely to do it If human pressure could bring him that man ought to be brought to the sick Giles s side The attempt should be made Yet she dreaded to leave her patient and the minutes raced past and yet she postponed her departure At last when it was after eleven o clock Winterborne fell into a fitful sleep and it seemed to afford her an opportunity She hastily made him as comfortable as she could put on her things cut a new candle from the bunch hanging in the cupboard and having set it up and placed it so that the light did not fall upon his eyes she closed the door and started The spirit of Winterborne seemed to keep her company and banish all sense of darkness from her mind The rains had imparted a phosphorescence to the pieces of touchwood and rotting leaves that lay about her path which as scattered by her feet spread abroad like spilt milk She would not run the hazard of losing her way by plunging into any short unfrequented track through the denser parts of the woodland but followed a more open course which eventually brought her to the highway Once here she ran along with great speed animated by a devoted purpose which had much about it that was stoical and it was with scarcely any faltering of spirit that after an hour s progress she passed over Rubdown Hill and onward towards that same Hintock and that same house out of which she had fled a few days before in irresistible alarm But that had happened which above all other things of chance and change could make her deliberately frustrate her plan of flight and sink all regard of personal consequences One speciality of Fitzpiers s was respected by Grace as much as ever his professional skill In this she was right Had his persistence equalled his insight instead of being the spasmodic and fitful thing it was fame and fortune need never have remained a wish with him His freedom from conventional errors and crusted prejudices had indeed been such as to retard rather than accelerate his advance in Hintock and its neighborhood where people could not believe that nature herself effected cures and that the doctor s business was only to smooth the way It was past midnight when Grace arrived opposite her father s house now again temporarily occupied by her husband unless he had already gone away Ever since her emergence from the denser plantations about Winterborne s residence a pervasive lightness had hung in the damp autumn sky in spite of the vault of cloud signifying that a moon of some age was shining above its arch The two white gates were distinct and the white balls on the pillars and the puddles and damp ruts left by the recent rain had a cold corpse eyed luminousness She entered by the lower gate and crossed the quadrangle to the wing wherein the apartments that had been hers since her marriage were situate till she stood under a window which if her husband were in the house gave light to his bedchamber She faltered and paused with her hand on her heart in spite of herself Could she call to her presence the very cause of all her foregoing troubles Alas old Jones was seven miles off Giles was possibly dying what else could she do It was in a perspiration wrought even more by consciousness than by exercise that she picked up some gravel threw it at the panes and waited to see the result The night bell which had been fixed when Fitzpiers first took up his residence there still remained but as it had fallen into disuse with the collapse of his practice and his elopement she did not venture to pull it now Whoever slept in the room had heard her signal slight as it was In half a minute the window was opened and a voice said Yes inquiringly Grace recognized her husband in the speaker at once Her effort was now to disguise her own accents Doctor she said in as unusual a tone as she could command a man is dangerously ill in One chimney Hut out towards Delborough and you must go to him at once in all mercy I will readily The alacrity surprise and pleasure expressed in his reply amazed her for a moment But in truth they denoted the sudden relief of a man who having got back in a mood of contrition from erratic abandonment to fearful joys found the soothing routine of professional practice unexpectedly opening anew to him The highest desire of his soul just now was for a respectable life of painstaking If this his first summons since his return had been to attend upon a cat or dog he would scarcely have refused it in the circumstances Do you know the way she asked Yes said he One chimney Hut she repeated And immediately Yes yes said Fitzpiers Grace remained no longer She passed out of the white gate without slamming it and hastened on her way back Her husband then had re entered her father s house How he had been able to effect a reconciliation with the old man what were the terms of the treaty between them she could not so much as conjecture Some sort of truce must have been entered into that was all she could say But close as the question lay to her own life there was a more urgent one which banished it and she traced her steps quickly along the meandering track ways Meanwhile Fitzpiers was preparing to leave the house The state of his mind over and above his professional zeal was peculiar At Grace s first remark he had not recognized or suspected her presence but as she went on he was awakened to the great resemblance of the speaker s voice to his wife s He had taken in such good faith the statement of the household on his arrival that she had gone on a visit for a time because she could not at once bring her mind to be reconciled to him that he could not quite actually believe this comer to be she It was one of the features of Fitzpiers s repentant humor at this date that on receiving the explanation of her absence he had made no attempt to outrage her feelings by following her though nobody had informed him how very shortly her departure had preceded his entry and of all that might have been inferred from her precipitancy Melbury after much alarm and consideration had decided not to follow her either He sympathized with her flight much as he deplored it moreover the tragic color of the antecedent events that he had been a great means of creating checked his instinct to interfere He prayed and trusted that she had got into no danger on her way as he supposed to Sherton and thence to Exbury if that were the place she had gone to forbearing all inquiry which the strangeness of her departure would have made natural A few months before this time a performance by Grace of one tenth the magnitude of this would have aroused him to unwonted investigation It was in the same spirit that he had tacitly assented to Fitzpiers s domicilation there The two men had not met face to face but missus Melbury had proposed herself as an intermediary who made the surgeon s re entrance comparatively easy to him Everything was provisional and nobody asked questions Fitzpiers had come in the performance of a plan of penitence which had originated in circumstances hereafter to be explained his self humiliation to the very bass string was deliberate and as soon as a call reached him from the bedside of a dying man his desire was to set to work and do as much good as he could with the least possible fuss or show He therefore refrained from calling up a stableman to get ready any horse or gig and set out for One chimney Hut on foot as Grace had done CHAPTER XLIII She re entered the hut flung off her bonnet and cloak and approached the sufferer He had begun anew those terrible mutterings and his hands were cold As soon as she saw him there returned to her that agony of mind which the stimulus of her journey had thrown off for a time Could he really be dying She bathed him kissed him forgot all things but the fact that lying there before her was he who had loved her more than the mere lover would have loved had martyred himself for her comfort cared more for her self respect than she had thought of caring This mood continued till she heard quick smart footsteps without she knew whose footsteps they were Grace sat on the inside of the bed against the wall holding Giles s hand so that when her husband entered the patient lay between herself and him He stood transfixed at first noticing Grace only Slowly he dropped his glance and discerned who the prostrate man was Strangely enough though Grace s distaste for her husband s company had amounted almost to dread and culminated in actual flight at this moment her last and least feeling was personal Sensitive femininity was eclipsed by self effacing purpose and that it was a husband who stood there was forgotten The first look that possessed her face was relief satisfaction at the presence of the physician obliterated thought of the man which only returned in the form of a sub consciousness that did not interfere with her words Is he dying is there any hope she cried Grace said Fitzpiers in an indescribable whisper more than invocating if not quite deprecatory He was arrested by the spectacle not so much in its intrinsic character though that was striking enough to a man who called himself the husband of the sufferer s friend and nurse but in its character as the counterpart of one that had its hour many months before in which he had figured as the patient and the woman had been Felice Charmond Is he in great danger can you save him she cried again Fitzpiers aroused himself came a little nearer and examined Winterborne as he stood His inspection was concluded in a mere glance Before he spoke he looked at her contemplatively as to the effect of his coming words He is dying he said with dry precision What said she Nothing can be done by me or any other man It will soon be all over The extremities are dead already His eyes still remained fixed on her the conclusion to which he had come seeming to end his interest professional and otherwise in Winterborne forever But it cannot be He was well three days ago Not well I suspect This seems like a secondary attack which has followed some previous illness possibly typhoid it may have been months ago or recently Ah he was not well you are right He was ill he was ill when I came There was nothing more to do or say She crouched down at the side of the bed and Fitzpiers took a seat Thus they remained in silence and long as it lasted she never turned her eyes or apparently her thoughts at all to her husband He occasionally murmured with automatic authority some slight directions for alleviating the pain of the dying man which she mechanically obeyed bending over him during the intervals in silent tears Winterborne never recovered consciousness of what was passing and that he was going became soon perceptible also to her In less than an hour the delirium ceased then there was an interval of somnolent painlessness and soft breathing at the end of which Winterborne passed quietly away Then Fitzpiers broke the silence Have you lived here long said he Grace was wild with sorrow with all that had befallen her with the cruelties that had attacked her with life with Heaven She answered at random Yes By what right do you ask Don t think I claim any right said Fitzpiers sadly It is for you to do and say what you choose I admit quite as much as you feel that I am a vagabond a brute not worthy to possess the smallest fragment of you But here I am and I have happened to take sufficient interest in you to make that inquiry He is everything to me said Grace hardly heeding her husband and laying her hand reverently on the dead man s eyelids where she kept it a long time pressing down their lashes with gentle touches as if she were stroking a little bird He watched her a while and then glanced round the chamber where his eyes fell upon a few dressing necessaries that she had brought Grace if I may call you so he said I have been already humiliated almost to the depths I have come back since you refused to join me elsewhere I have entered your father s house and borne all that that cost me without flinching because I have felt that I deserved humiliation But is there a yet greater humiliation in store for me You say you have been living here that he is everything to you Am I to draw from that the obvious the extremest inference Triumph at any price is sweet to men and women especially the latter It was her first and last opportunity of repaying him for the cruel contumely which she had borne at his hands so docilely Yes she answered and there was that in her subtly compounded nature which made her feel a thrill of pride as she did so Yet the moment after she had so mightily belied her character she half repented Her husband had turned as white as the wall behind him It seemed as if all that remained to him of life and spirit had been abstracted at a stroke Yet he did not move and in his efforts at self control closed his mouth together as a vice His determination was fairly successful though she saw how very much greater than she had expected her triumph had been Presently he looked across at Winterborne Would it startle you to hear he said as if he hardly had breath to utter the words that she who was to me what he was to you is dead also Dead SHE dead exclaimed Grace Yes Felice Charmond is where this young man is Never said Grace vehemently He went on without heeding the insinuation And I came back to try to make it up with you but Fitzpiers rose and moved across the room to go away looking downward with the droop of a man whose hope was turned to apathy if not despair In going round the door his eye fell upon her once more She was still bending over the body of Winterborne her face close to the young man s Have you been kissing him during his illness asked her husband Yes Since his fevered state set in Yes On his lips Yes Then you will do well to take a few drops of this in water as soon as possible He drew a small phial from his pocket and returned to offer it to her Grace shook her head If you don t do as I tell you you may soon be like him I don t care I wish to die I ll put it here said Fitzpiers placing the bottle on a ledge beside him The sin of not having warned you will not be upon my head at any rate among my other sins I am now going and I will send somebody to you Your father does not know that you are here so I suppose I shall be bound to tell him Certainly Fitzpiers left the cot and the stroke of his feet was soon immersed in the silence that pervaded the spot Grace remained kneeling and weeping she hardly knew how long and then she sat up covered poor Giles s features and went towards the door where her husband had stood No sign of any other comer greeted her ear the only perceptible sounds being the tiny cracklings of the dead leaves which like a feather bed had not yet done rising to their normal level where indented by the pressure of her husband s receding footsteps It reminded her that she had been struck with the change in his aspect the extremely intellectual look that had always been in his face was wrought to a finer phase by thinness and a care worn dignity had been superadded She returned to Winterborne s side and during her meditations another tread drew near the door entered the outer room and halted at the entrance of the chamber where Grace was What Marty said Grace Yes I have heard said Marty whose demeanor had lost all its girlishness under the stroke that seemed almost literally to have bruised her He died for me murmured Grace heavily Marty did not fully comprehend and she answered He belongs to neither of us now and your beauty is no more powerful with him than my plainness I have come to help you ma am He never cared for me and he cared much for you but he cares for us both alike now Oh don t don t Marty Marty said no more but knelt over Winterborne from the other side Did you meet my hus mister Fitzpiers Then what brought you here I come this way sometimes I have got to go to the farther side of the wood this time of the year and am obliged to get there before four o clock in the morning to begin heating the oven for the early baking I have passed by here often at this time Grace looked at her quickly Then did you know I was here Yes ma am Did you tell anybody No I knew you lived in the hut that he had gied it up to ye and lodged out himself Did you know where he lodged No That I couldn t find out Was it at Delborough No It was not there Marty Would it had been It would have saved saved To check her tears she turned and seeing a book on the window bench took it up Look Marty this is a Psalter He was not an outwardly religious man but he was pure and perfect in his heart Shall we read a psalm over him Oh yes we will with all my heart Grace opened the thin brown book which poor Giles had kept at hand mainly for the convenience of whetting his pen knife upon its leather covers She began to read in that rich devotional voice peculiar to women only on such occasions When it was over Marty said I should like to pray for his soul So should I said her companion But we must not Why Nobody would know Grace could not resist the argument influenced as she was by the sense of making amends for having neglected him in the body and their tender voices united and filled the narrow room with supplicatory murmurs that a Calvinist might have envied They had hardly ended when now and more numerous foot falls were audible also persons in conversation one of whom Grace recognized as her father She rose and went to the outer apartment in which there was only such light as beamed from the inner one Melbury and missus Melbury were standing there I don t reproach you Grace said her father with an estranged manner and in a voice not at all like his old voice What has come upon you and us is beyond reproach beyond weeping and beyond wailing Perhaps I drove you to it But I am hurt I am scourged I am astonished In the face of this there is nothing to be said Without replying Grace turned and glided back to the inner chamber Marty she said quickly I cannot look my father in the face until he knows the true circumstances of my life here Go and tell him what you have told me what you saw that he gave up his house to me She sat down her face buried in her hands and Marty went and after a short absence returned Then Grace rose and going out asked her father if he had met her husband Yes said Melbury And you know all that has happened I do Forgive me Grace for suspecting ye of worse than rashness I ought to know ye better Are you coming with me to what was once your home No I stay here with HIM Take no account of me any more The unwonted perplexing agitating relations in which she had stood to Winterborne quite lately brought about by Melbury s own contrivance could not fail to soften the natural anger of a parent at her more recent doings My daughter things are bad he rejoined But why do you persevere to make em worse What good can you do to Giles by staying here with him Mind I ask no questions I don t inquire why you decided to come here or anything as to what your course would have been if he had not died though I know there s no deliberate harm in ye As for me I have lost all claim upon you and I make no complaint But I do say that by coming back with me now you will show no less kindness to him and escape any sound of shame But I don t wish to escape it If you don t on your own account cannot you wish to on mine and hers Nobody except our household knows that you have left home Then why should you by a piece of perverseness bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave If it were not for my husband she began moved by his words But how can I meet him there How can any woman who is not a mere man s creature join him after what has taken place He would go away again rather than keep you out of my house How do you know that father We met him on our way here and he told us so said missus Melbury He had said something like it before He seems very much upset altogether He declared to her when he came to our house that he would wait for time and devotion to bring about his forgiveness said her husband That was it wasn t it Lucy Yes That he would not intrude upon you Grace till you gave him absolute permission missus Melbury added This antecedent considerateness in Fitzpiers was as welcome to Grace as it was unexpected and though she did not desire his presence she was sorry that by her retaliatory fiction she had given him a different reason for avoiding her She made no further objections to accompanying her parents taking them into the inner room to give Winterborne a last look and gathering up the two or three things that belonged to her While she was doing this the two women came who had been called by Melbury and at their heels poor Creedle Forgive me but I can t rule my mourning nohow as a man should mister Melbury he said I ha n t seen him since Thursday se night and have wondered for days and days where he s been keeping There was I expecting him to come and tell me to wash out the cider barrels against the making and here was he Well I ve knowed him from table high I knowed his father used to bide about upon two sticks in the sun afore he died and now I ve seen the end of the family which we can ill afford to lose wi such a scanty lot of good folk in Hintock as we ve got And now Robert Creedle will be nailed up in parish boards a b lieve and noboby will glutch down a sigh for he They started for home Marty and Creedle remaining behind For a time Grace and her father walked side by side without speaking It was just in the blue of the dawn and the chilling tone of the sky was reflected in her cold wet face The whole wood seemed to be a house of death pervaded by loss to its uttermost length and breadth Winterborne was gone and the copses seemed to show the want of him those young trees so many of which he had planted and of which he had spoken so truly when he said that he should fall before they fell were at that very moment sending out their roots in the direction that he had given them with his subtle hand One thing made it tolerable to us that your husband should come back to the house said Melbury at last the death of missus Charmond Ah yes said Grace arousing slightly to the recollection he told me so Did he tell you how she died It was no such death as Giles s She was shot by a disappointed lover It occurred in Germany The unfortunate man shot himself afterwards He was that South Carolina gentleman of very passionate nature who used to haunt this place to force her to an interview and followed her about everywhere So ends the brilliant Felice Charmond once a good friend to me but no friend to you I can forgive her said Grace absently Did Edgar tell you of this No but he put a London newspaper giving an account of it on the hall table folded in such a way that we should see it It will be in the Sherton paper this week no doubt To make the event more solemn still to him he had just before had sharp words with her and left her He told Lucy this as nothing about him appears in the newspaper And the cause of the quarrel was of all people she we ve left behind us Do you mean Marty Grace spoke the words but perfunctorily For pertinent and pointed as Melbury s story was she had no heart for it now Yes Marty South Melbury persisted in his narrative to divert her from her present grief if possible Before he went away she wrote him a letter which he kept in his pocket a long while before reading He chanced to pull it out in missus Charmond s presence and read it out loud It contained something which teased her very much and that led to the rupture She was following him to make it up when she met with her terrible death Melbury did not know enough to give the gist of the incident which was that Marty South s letter had been concerning a certain personal adornment common to herself and missus Charmond Her bullet reached its billet at last The scene between Fitzpiers and Felice had been sharp as only a scene can be which arises out of the mortification of one woman by another in the presence of a lover True Marty had not effected it by word of mouth the charge about the locks of hair was made simply by Fitzpiers reading her letter to him aloud to Felice in the playfully ironical tones of one who had become a little weary of his situation and was finding his friend in the phrase of George Herbert a flat delight He had stroked those false tresses with his hand many a time without knowing them to be transplanted and it was impossible when the discovery was so abruptly made to avoid being finely satirical despite her generous disposition That was how it had begun and tragedy had been its end On his abrupt departure she had followed him to the station but the train was gone and in travelling to Baden in search of him she had met his rival whose reproaches led to an altercation and the death of both Of that precipitate scene of passion and crime Fitzpiers had known nothing till he saw an account of it in the papers where fortunately for himself no mention was made of his prior acquaintance with the unhappy lady nor was there any allusion to him in the subsequent inquiry the double death being attributed to some gambling losses though in point of fact neither one of them had visited the tables Melbury and his daughter drew near their house having seen but one living thing on their way a squirrel which did not run up its tree but dropping the sweet chestnut which it carried cried chut chut chut and stamped with its hind legs on the ground When the roofs and chimneys of the homestead began to emerge from the screen of boughs Grace started and checked herself in her abstracted advance You clearly understand she said to her step mother some of her old misgiving returning that I am coming back only on condition of his leaving as he promised Will you let him know this that there may be no mistake missus Melbury who had some long private talks with Fitzpiers assured Grace that she need have no doubts on that point and that he would probably be gone by the evening Grace then entered with them into Melbury s wing of the house and sat down listlessly in the parlor while her step mother went to Fitzpiers The prompt obedience to her wishes which the surgeon showed did honor to him if anything could Before missus Melbury had returned to the room Grace who was sitting on the parlor window bench saw her husband go from the door under the increasing light of morning with a bag in his hand While passing through the gate he turned his head The firelight of the room she sat in threw her figure into dark relief against the window as she looked through the panes and he must have seen her distinctly In a moment he went on the gate fell to and he disappeared At the hut she had declared that another had displaced him and now she had banished him CHAPTER XLIV Fitzpiers had hardly been gone an hour when Grace began to sicken The next day she kept her room Old Jones was called in he murmured some statements in which the words feverish symptoms occurred 
3845-8924-0000	train-other-500	Grace heard them and guessed the means by which she had brought this visitation upon herself One day while she still lay there with her head throbbing wondering if she were really going to join him who had gone before Grammer Oliver came to her bedside
none	none	 I don t know whe r this is meant for you to take ma am she said but I have found it on the table 
3845-8924-0001	train-other-500	It was left by Marty I think when she came this morning Grace turned her hot eyes upon what Grammer held up
none	none	 It was the phial left at the hut by her husband when he had begged her to take some drops of its contents 
3845-8924-0002	train-other-500	if she wished to preserve herself from falling a victim to the malady which had pulled down Winterborne She examined it as well as she could
none	none	 The liquid was of an opaline 
3845-8924-0003	train-other-500	hue and bore a label with an inscription in Italian He had probably got it in his wanderings abroad She knew but little Italian but could understand that the cordial was a febrifuge of some sort
3845-8924-0004	train-other-500	Her father her mother and all the household were anxious for her recovery and she resolved to obey her husband s directions Whatever the risk if any she was prepared to run it A glass of water was brought and the drops dropped in
3845-8924-0005	train-other-500	The effect though not miraculous was remarkable In less than an hour she felt calmer cooler better able to reflect less inclined to fret and chafe and wear herself away She took a few drops more
3845-8924-0006	train-other-500	From that time the fever retreated and went out like a damped conflagration How clever he is she said regretfully
none	none	 Why could he not have had more principle 
3845-8924-0007	train-other-500	so as to turn his great talents to good account Perhaps he has saved my useless life But he doesn t know it and doesn t care whether he has saved it or not and on that account will never be told by me
3845-8924-0008	train-other-500	Probably he only gave it to me in the arrogance of his skill to show the greatness of his resources beside mine as Elijah drew down fire from heaven
none	none	 As soon as she had quite recovered 
3845-8924-0009	train-other-500	from this foiled attack upon her life Grace went to Marty South s cottage The current of her being had again set towards the lost Giles Winterborne Marty she said we both loved him We will go to his grave together
none	none	 Great Hintock church stood at the upper part of the village and could be reached without passing through the street In the dusk of the late September day they went thither by secret ways walking mostly in silence side by side each busied with her own thoughts Grace had a trouble exceeding Marty s that haunting sense of having put out the light of his life by her own hasty doings She had tried to persuade herself that he might have died of his illness 
3845-8924-0010	train-other-500	even if she had not taken possession of his house Sometimes she succeeded in her attempt sometimes she did not They stood by the grave together and though the sun had gone down
none	none	 they could see over the woodland for miles and down to the vale in which 
3845-8924-0011	train-other-500	he had been accustomed to descend every year with his portable mill and press
none	none	 to make cider about this time 
3845-8924-0012	train-other-500	Perhaps Grace s first grief the discovery that if he had lived he could never have claimed her had some power in softening this the second On Marty s part there was the same consideration never would she have been his
3845-8924-0013	train-other-500	As no anticipation of gratified affection had been in existence while he was with them
none	none	 there was none to be disappointed now that he had gone 
3845-8924-0014	train-other-500	Grace was abased when by degrees she found that she had never understood Giles as Marty had done Marty South alone of all the women in Hintock
3845-8924-0015	train-other-500	and the world had approximated to Winterborne s level of intelligent intercourse with nature In that respect she had formed the complement to him in the other sex had lived as his counterpart had subjoined her thought to his as a corollary
3845-8924-0016	train-other-500	The casual glimpses which the ordinary population bestowed upon that wondrous world of sap and leaves called the Hintock woods had been with these two Giles and Marty a clear gaze They had been possessed of its finer mysteries
3845-8924-0017	train-other-500	as of commonplace knowledge had been able to read its hieroglyphs as ordinary writing to them the sights and sounds of night winter wind storm amid those dense boughs which had to Grace a touch of the uncanny and even the supernatural
3845-8924-0018	train-other-500	were simple occurrences whose origin continuance and laws they foreknew They had planted together and together they had felled together they had with the run of the years mentally collected those remoter signs and symbols
3845-8924-0019	train-other-500	which seen in few were of runic obscurity but all together made an alphabet
none	none	 From the light lashing of the twigs upon their faces when brushing through them in the dark 
3845-8924-0020	train-other-500	they could pronounce upon the species of the tree whence they stretched from the quality of the wind s murmur through a bough they could in like manner name its sort afar off They knew by a glance at a trunk if its heart were sound
3845-8924-0021	train-other-500	or tainted with incipient decay and by the state of its upper twigs the stratum that had been reached by its roots The artifices of the seasons were seen by them from the conjuror s own point of view and not from that of the spectator s
none	none	 He ought to have married YOU Marty and nobody else in the world said Grace with conviction after thinking somewhat in the above strain Marty shook her head In all our out door days and years together ma am she replied the one thing he never spoke of to me was love 
3845-8924-0022	train-other-500	nor I to him Yet you and he could speak in a tongue that nobody else knew not even my father though he came nearest knowing
none	none	 the tongue of the trees and fruits and flowers themselves 
3845-8924-0023	train-other-500	She could indulge in mournful fancies like this to Marty
none	none	 but the hard core to her grief 
3845-8924-0024	train-other-500	which Marty s had not remained
none	none	 Had she been sure that Giles s death resulted entirely from his exposure 
3845-8924-0025	train-other-500	it would have driven her well nigh to insanity but there was always that bare possibility that his exposure had only precipitated what was inevitable She longed to believe that it had not done even this
none	none	 There was only one man whose opinion on the circumstances she would be at all disposed to trust 
3845-8924-0026	train-other-500	Her husband was that man Yet to ask him it would be necessary to detail the true conditions in which she and Winterborne had lived during these three or four critical days that followed her flight
none	none	 and in withdrawing her original defiant announcement on that point there seemed a weakness she did not care to show 
3845-8924-0027	train-other-500	She never doubted that Fitzpiers would believe her if she made a clean confession of the actual situation but to volunteer the correction would seem like signalling for a truce and that
none	none	 in her present frame of mind 
3845-8924-0028	train-other-500	was what she did not feel the need of It will probably not appear a surprising statement
none	none	 after what has been already declared of Fitzpiers 
3845-8924-0029	train-other-500	that the man whom Grace s fidelity could not keep faithful was stung into passionate throbs of interest concerning her by her avowal of the contrary
none	none	 He declared to himself that he had never known her dangerously full compass if she were capable of such a reprisal and melancholy as it may be to admit the fact his own humiliation and regret engendered a smouldering admiration of her 
3845-8924-0030	train-other-500	He passed a month or two of great misery at Exbury the place to which he had retired quite as much misery indeed as Grace
none	none	 could she have known of it would have been inclined to inflict upon any living creature how much soever he might have wronged her Then a sudden hope dawned upon him he wondered if her affirmation were true He asked himself whether it were not the act of a woman whose natural purity and innocence had blinded her to the contingencies of such an announcement 
3845-8924-0031	train-other-500	His wide experience of the sex had taught him that in many cases women who ventured on hazardous matters did so because they lacked an imagination sensuous enough to feel their full force
3845-8924-0032	train-other-500	In this light Grace s bold avowal might merely have denoted the desperation of one who was a child to the realities of obliquity Fitzpiers s mental sufferings
none	none	 and suspense led him at last to take a melancholy journey to the neighborhood of Little Hintock 
3845-8924-0033	train-other-500	and here he hovered for hours around the scene of the purest emotional experiences that he had ever known in his life He walked about the woods that surrounded Melbury s house
none	none	 keeping out of sight like a criminal 
3845-8924-0034	train-other-500	It was a fine evening and on his way homeward he passed near Marty South s cottage As usual she had lighted her candle without closing her shutters he saw her within as he had seen her many times before
3845-8924-0035	train-other-500	She was polishing tools and though he had not wished to show himself he could not resist speaking in to her through the half open door What are you doing that for Marty
none	none	 Because I want to clean them They are not mine 
3845-8924-0036	train-other-500	He could see indeed that they were not hers for one was a spade large and heavy and another was a bill hook which she could only have used with both hands The spade
none	none	 though not a new one had been so completely burnished that it was bright as silver 
3845-8924-0037	train-other-500	Fitzpiers somehow divined that they were Giles Winterborne s and he put the question to her She replied in the affirmative I am going to keep em she said but I can t get his apple mill and press
none	none	 I wish could 
3845-8924-0038	train-other-500	it is going to be sold they say Then I will buy it for you said Fitzpiers That will be making you a return for a kindness you did me His glance fell upon the girl s rare colored hair which had grown again Oh Marty
3845-8924-0039	train-other-500	those locks of yours and that letter But it was a kindness to send it nevertheless
none	none	 he added musingly After this there was confidence between them such confidence as there had never been before Marty was shy indeed of speaking about the letter and her motives in writing it but she thanked him warmly for his promise of the cider press 
3845-8924-0040	train-other-500	She would travel with it in the autumn season as he had done she said She would be quite strong enough with old Creedle as an assistant Ah there was one nearer to him than you said Fitzpiers referring to Winterborne One who lived where he lived
3845-8924-0041	train-other-500	and was with him when he died Then Marty suspecting that he did not know the true circumstances from the fact that missus Fitzpiers and himself were living apart
none	none	 told him of Giles s generosity to Grace in giving up his house to her at the risk and possibly the sacrifice 
3845-8924-0042	train-other-500	of his own life When the surgeon heard it he almost envied Giles his chivalrous character He expressed a wish to Marty that his visit to her should be kept secret and went home thoughtful
none	none	 feeling that in more that one sense his journey to Hintock had not been in vain He would have given much to win Grace s forgiveness then But whatever he dared hope for in that kind from the future there was nothing to be done yet while Giles Winterborne s memory was green To wait was imperative A little time might melt her frozen thoughts and lead her to look on him with toleration if not with love CHAPTER XLV Weeks and months of mourning for Winterborne had been passed by Grace in the soothing monotony of the memorial act to which she and Marty had devoted themselves Twice a week the pair went in the dusk to Great Hintock and like the two mourners in Cymbeline sweetened his sad grave with their flowers and their tears Sometimes Grace thought that it was a pity neither one of them had been his wife for a little while and given the world a copy of him who was so valuable in their eyes Nothing ever had brought home to her with such force as this death how little acquirements and culture weigh beside sterling personal character While her simple sorrow for his loss took a softer edge with the lapse of the autumn and winter seasons her self reproach at having had a possible hand in causing it knew little abatement Little occurred at Hintock during these months of the fall and decay of the leaf Discussion of the almost contemporaneous death of missus Charmond abroad had waxed and waned Fitzpiers had had a marvellous escape from being dragged into the inquiry which followed it through the accident of their having parted just before under the influence of Marty South s letter the tiny instrument of a cause deep in nature Her body was not brought home It seemed to accord well with the fitful fever of that impassioned woman s life that she should not have found a native grave She had enjoyed but a life interest in the estate which after her death passed to a relative of her husband s one who knew not Felice one whose purpose seemed to be to blot out every vestige of her On a certain day in February the cheerful day of saint Valentine in fact a letter reached missus Fitzpiers which had been mentally promised her for that particular day a long time before It announced that Fitzpiers was living at some midland town where he had obtained a temporary practice as assistant to some local medical man whose curative principles were all wrong though he dared not set them right He had thought fit to communicate with her on that day of tender traditions to inquire if in the event of his obtaining a substantial practice that he had in view elsewhere she could forget the past and bring herself to join him There the practical part ended he then went on My last year of experience has added ten years to my age dear Grace and dearest wife that ever erring man undervalued You may be absolutely indifferent to what I say but let me say it I have never loved any woman alive or dead as I love respect and honor you at this present moment What you told me in the pride and haughtiness of your heart I never believed this by the way was not strictly true but even if I had believed it it could never have estranged me from you Is there any use in telling you no there is not that I dream of your ripe lips more frequently than I say my prayers that the old familiar rustle of your dress often returns upon my mind till it distracts me If you could condescend even only to see me again you would be breathing life into a corpse My pure pure Grace modest as a turtledove how came I ever to possess you For the sake of being present in your mind on this lovers day I think I would almost rather have you hate me a little than not think of me at all You may call my fancies whimsical but remember sweet lost one that nature is one in love and where tis fine it sends some instance of itself I will not intrude upon you further now Make me a little bit happy by sending back one line to say that you will consent at any rate to a short interview I will meet you and leave you as a mere acquaintance if you will only afford me this slight means of making a few explanations and of putting my position before you Believe me in spite of all you may do or feel Your lover always once your husband E It was oddly enough the first occasion or nearly the first on which Grace had ever received a love letter from him his courtship having taken place under conditions which rendered letter writing unnecessary Its perusal therefore had a certain novelty for her She thought that upon the whole he wrote love letters very well But the chief rational interest of the letter to the reflective Grace lay in the chance that such a meeting as he proposed would afford her of setting her doubts at rest one way or the other on her actual share in Winterborne s death The relief of consulting a skilled mind the one professional man who had seen Giles at that time would be immense As for that statement that she had uttered in her disdainful grief which at the time she had regarded as her triumph she was quite prepared to admit to him that his belief was the true one for in wronging herself as she did when she made it she had done what to her was a far more serious thing wronged Winterborne s memory Without consulting her father or any one in the house or out of it Grace replied to the letter She agreed to meet Fitzpiers on two conditions of which the first was that the place of meeting should be the top of Rubdown Hill the second that he would not object to Marty South accompanying her Whatever part much or little there may have been in Fitzpiers s so called valentine to his wife he felt a delight as of the bursting of spring when her brief reply came It was one of the few pleasures that he had experienced of late years at all resembling those of his early youth He promptly replied that he accepted the conditions and named the day and hour at which he would be on the spot she mentioned A few minutes before three on the appointed day found him climbing the well known hill which had been the axis of so many critical movements in their lives during his residence at Hintock The sight of each homely and well remembered object swelled the regret that seldom left him now Whatever paths might lie open to his future the soothing shades of Hintock were forbidden him forever as a permanent dwelling place He longed for the society of Grace But to lay offerings on her slighted altar was his first aim and until her propitiation was complete he would constrain her in no way to return to him The least reparation that he could make in a case where he would gladly have made much would be to let her feel herself absolutely free to choose between living with him and without him Moreover a subtlist in emotions he cultivated as under glasses strange and mournful pleasures that he would not willingly let die just at present To show any forwardness in suggesting a modus vivendi to Grace would be to put an end to these exotics To be the vassal of her sweet will for a time he demanded no more and found solace in the contemplation of the soft miseries she caused him Approaching the hill top with a mind strung to these notions Fitzpiers discerned a gay procession of people coming over the crest and was not long in perceiving it to be a wedding party Though the wind was keen the women were in light attire and the flowered waistcoats of the men had a pleasing vividness of pattern Each of the gentler ones clung to the arm of her partner so tightly as to have with him one step rise swing gait almost one centre of gravity In the buxom bride Fitzpiers recognized no other than Suke Damson who in her light gown looked a giantess the small husband beside her he saw to be Tim Tangs Fitzpiers could not escape for they had seen him though of all the beauties of the world whom he did not wish to meet Suke was the chief But he put the best face on the matter that he could and came on the approaching company evidently discussing him and his separation from missus Fitzpiers As the couples closed upon him he expressed his congratulations We be just walking round the parishes to show ourselves a bit said Tim First we het across to Delborough then athwart to here and from here we go to Rubdown and Millshot and then round by the cross roads home Home says I but it won t be that long We be off next month Indeed Where to Tim informed him that they were going to New Zealand Not but that he would have been contented with Hintock but his wife was ambitious and wanted to leave so he had given way Then good by said Fitzpiers I may not see you again He shook hands with Tim and turned to the bride Good by Suke he said taking her hand also I wish you and your husband prosperity in the country you have chosen With this he left them and hastened on to his appointment The wedding party re formed and resumed march likewise But in restoring his arm to Suke Tim noticed that her full and blooming countenance had undergone a change Holloa me dear what s the matter said Tim Nothing to speak o said she But to give the lie to her assertion she was seized with lachrymose twitches that soon produced a dribbling face How what the devil s this about exclaimed the bridegroom She s a little wee bit overcome poor dear said the first bridesmaid unfolding her handkerchief and wiping Suke s eyes I never did like parting from people said Suke as soon as she could speak Why him in particular Well he s such a clever doctor that tis a thousand pities we sha n t see him any more There ll be no such clever doctor as he in New Zealand if I should require one and the thought o t got the better of my feelings They walked on but Tim s face had grown rigid and pale for he recalled slight circumstances disregarded at the time of their occurrence The former boisterous laughter of the wedding party at the groomsman s jokes was heard ringing through the woods no more By this time Fitzpiers had advanced on his way to the top of the hill where he saw two figures emerging from the bank on the right hand These were the expected ones Grace and Marty South who had evidently come there by a short and secret path through the wood Grace was muffled up in her winter dress and he thought that she had never looked so seductive as at this moment in the noontide bright but heatless sun and the keen wind and the purplish gray masses of brushwood around Fitzpiers continued to regard the nearing picture till at length their glances met for a moment when she demurely sent off hers at a tangent and gave him the benefit of her three quarter face while with courteous completeness of conduct he lifted his hat in a large arc Marty dropped behind and when Fitzpiers held out his hand Grace touched it with her fingers I have agreed to be here mostly because I wanted to ask you something important said missus Fitzpiers her intonation modulating in a direction that she had not quite wished it to take I am most attentive said her husband Shall we take to the wood for privacy Grace demurred and Fitzpiers gave in and they kept the public road At any rate she would take his arm This also was gravely negatived the refusal being audible to Marty Why not he inquired Oh mister Fitzpiers how can you ask Right right said he his effusiveness shrivelled up As they walked on she returned to her inquiry It is about a matter that may perhaps be unpleasant to you But I think I need not consider that too carefully Not at all said Fitzpiers heroically She then took him back to the time of poor Winterborne s death and related the precise circumstances amid which his fatal illness had come upon him particularizing the dampness of the shelter to which he had betaken himself his concealment from her of the hardships that he was undergoing all that he had put up with all that he had done for her in his scrupulous considerateness The retrospect brought her to tears as she asked him if he thought that the sin of having driven him to his death was upon her Fitzpiers could hardly help showing his satisfaction at what her narrative indirectly revealed the actual harmlessness of an escapade with her lover which had at first by her own showing looked so grave and he did not care to inquire whether that harmlessness had been the result of aim or of accident With regard to her question he declared that in his judgment no human being could answer it He thought that upon the whole the balance of probabilities turned in her favor Winterborne s apparent strength during the last months of his life must have been delusive It had often occurred that after a first attack of that insidious disease a person s apparent recovery was a physiological mendacity The relief which came to Grace lay almost as much in sharing her knowledge of the particulars with an intelligent mind as in the assurances Fitzpiers gave her Well then to put this case before you and obtain your professional opinion was chiefly why I consented to come here to day said she when he had reached the aforesaid conclusion For no other reason at all he asked ruefully It was nearly the whole They stood and looked over a gate at twenty or thirty starlings feeding in the grass and he started the talk again by saying in a low voice And yet I love you more than ever I loved you in my life Grace did not move her eyes from the birds and folded her delicate lips as if to keep them in subjection It is a different kind of love altogether said he Less passionate more profound It has nothing to do with the material conditions of the object at all much to do with her character and goodness as revealed by closer observation Love talks with better knowledge and knowledge with dearer love That s out of Measure for Measure said she slyly Oh yes I meant it as a citation blandly replied Fitzpiers Well then why not give me a very little bit of your heart again The crash of a felled tree in the remote depths of the wood recalled the past at that moment and all the homely faithfulness of Winterborne Don t ask it My heart is in the grave with Giles she replied stanchly Mine is with you in no less deep a grave I fear according to that I am very sorry but it cannot be helped How can you be sorry for me when you wilfully keep open the grave Oh no that s not so returned Grace quickly and moved to go away from him But dearest Grace said he you have condescended to come and I thought from it that perhaps when I had passed through a long state of probation you would be generous But if there can be no hope of our getting completely reconciled treat me gently wretch though I am I did not say you were a wretch nor have I ever said so But you have such a contemptuous way of looking at me that I fear you think so Grace s heart struggled between the wish not to be harsh and the fear that she might mislead him I cannot look contemptuous unless I feel contempt she said evasively And all I feel is lovelessness I have been very bad I know he returned But unless you can really love me again Grace I would rather go away from you forever I don t want you to receive me again for duty s sake or anything of that sort If I had not cared more for your affection and forgiveness than my own personal comfort I should never have come back here I could have obtained a practice at a distance and have lived my own life without coldness or reproach But I have chosen to return to the one spot on earth where my name is tarnished to enter the house of a man from whom I have had worse treatment than from any other man alive all for you This was undeniably true and it had its weight with Grace who began to look as if she thought she had been shockingly severe Before you go he continued I want to know your pleasure about me what you wish me to do or not to do You are independent of me and it seems a mockery to ask that Far be it from me to advise But I will think it over I rather need advice myself than stand in a position to give it YOU don t need advice wisest dearest woman that ever lived If you did Would you give it to me Would you act upon what I gave That s not a fair inquiry said she smiling despite her gravity I don t mind hearing it what you do really think the most correct and proper course for me It is so easy for me to say and yet I dare not for it would be provoking you to remonstrances Knowing of course what the advice would be she did not press him further and was about to beckon Marty forward and leave him when he interrupted her with Oh one moment dear Grace you will meet me again She eventually agreed to see him that day fortnight Fitzpiers expostulated at the interval but the half alarmed earnestness with which she entreated him not to come sooner made him say hastily that he submitted to her will that he would regard her as a friend only anxious for his reform and well being till such time as she might allow him to exceed that privilege All this was to assure her it was only too clear that he had not won her confidence yet It amazed Fitzpiers and overthrew all his deductions from previous experience to find that this girl though she had been married to him could yet be so coy Notwithstanding a certain fascination that it carried with it his reflections were sombre as he went homeward he saw how deep had been his offence to produce so great a wariness in a gentle and once unsuspicious soul He was himself too fastidious to care to coerce her To be an object of misgiving or dislike to a woman who shared his home was what he could not endure the thought of Life as it stood was more tolerable When he was gone Marty joined missus Fitzpiers She would fain have consulted Marty on the question of Platonic relations with her former husband as she preferred to regard him But Marty showed no great interest in their affairs so Grace said nothing They came onward and saw Melbury standing at the scene of the felling which had been audible to them when telling Marty that she wished her meeting with mister Fitzpiers to be kept private she left the girl to join her father At any rate she would consult him on the expediency of occasionally seeing her husband Her father was cheerful and walked by her side as he had done in earlier days I was thinking of you when you came up he said I have considered that what has happened is for the best Since your husband is gone away and seems not to wish to trouble you why let him go and drop out of your life Many women are worse off You can live here comfortably enough and he can emigrate or do what he likes for his good I wouldn t mind sending him the further sum of money he might naturally expect to come to him so that you may not be bothered with him any more He could hardly have gone on living here without speaking to me or meeting me and that would have been very unpleasant on both sides These remarks checked her intention There was a sense of weakness in following them by saying that she had just met her husband by appointment Then you would advise me not to communicate with him she observed I shall never advise ye again You are your own mistress do as you like But my opinion is that if you don t live with him you had better live without him and not go shilly shallying and playing bopeep You sent him away and now he s gone Very well trouble him no more Grace felt a guiltiness she hardly knew why and made no confession CHAPTER XLVI The woods were uninteresting and Grace stayed in doors a great deal She became quite a student reading more than she had done since her marriage But her seclusion was always broken for the periodical visit to Winterborne s grave with Marty which was kept up with pious strictness for the purpose of putting snow drops primroses and other vernal flowers thereon as they came One afternoon at sunset she was standing just outside her father s garden which like the rest of the Hintock enclosures abutted into the wood A slight foot path led along here forming a secret way to either of the houses by getting through its boundary hedge Grace was just about to adopt this mode of entry when a figure approached along the path and held up his hand to detain her It was her husband I am delighted he said coming up out of breath and there seemed no reason to doubt his words I saw you some way off I was afraid you would go in before I could reach you It is a week before the time said she reproachfully I said a fortnight from the last meeting My dear you don t suppose I could wait a fortnight without trying to get a glimpse of you even though you had declined to meet me Would it make you angry to know that I have been along this path at dusk three or four times since our last meeting Well how are you She did not refuse her hand but when he showed a wish to retain it a moment longer than mere formality required she made it smaller so that it slipped away from him with again that same alarmed look which always followed his attempts in this direction He saw that she was not yet out of the elusive mood not yet to be treated presumingly and he was correspondingly careful to tranquillize her His assertion had seemed to impress her somewhat I had no idea you came so often she said How far do you come from From Exbury I always walk from Sherton Abbas for if I hire people will know that I come and my success with you so far has not been great enough to justify such overtness Now my dear one as I MUST call you I put it to you will you see me a little oftener as the spring advances Grace lapsed into unwonted sedateness and avoiding the question said I wish you would concentrate on your profession and give up those strange studies that used to distract you so much I am sure you would get on It is the very thing I am doing I was going to ask you to burn or at least get rid of all my philosophical literature It is in the bookcases in your rooms The fact is I never cared much for abstruse studies I am so glad to hear you say that And those other books those piles of old plays what good are they to a medical man None whatever he replied cheerfully Sell them at Sherton for what they will fetch And those dreadful old French romances with their horrid spellings of filz and ung and ilz and mary and ma foy You haven t been reading them Grace Oh no I just looked into them that was all Make a bonfire of em directly you get home I meant to do it myself I can t think what possessed me ever to collect them I have only a few professional hand books now and am quite a practical man I am in hopes of having some good news to tell you soon and then do you think you could come to me again I would rather you did not press me on that just now she replied with some feeling You have said you mean to lead a new useful effectual life but I should like to see you put it in practice for a little while before you address that query to me Besides I could not live with you Why not Grace was silent a few instants I go with Marty to Giles s grave We swore we would show him that devotion And I mean to keep it up Well I wouldn t mind that at all I have no right to expect anything else and I will not wish you to keep away I liked the man as well as any I ever knew In short I would accompany you a part of the way to the place and smoke a cigar on the stile while I waited till you came back Then you haven t given up smoking Well ahem no I have thought of doing so but His extreme complacence had rather disconcerted Grace and the question about smoking had been to effect a diversion Presently she said firmly and with a moisture in her eye that he could not see as her mind returned to poor Giles s frustrate ghost I don t like you to speak lightly on that subject if you did speak lightly To be frank with you quite frank I think of him as my betrothed lover still I cannot help it So that it would be wrong for me to join you Fitzpiers was now uneasy You say your betrothed lover still he rejoined When then were you betrothed to him or engaged as we common people say When you were away How could that be Grace would have avoided this but her natural candor led her on It was when I was under the impression that my marriage with you was about to be annulled and that he could then marry me So I encouraged him to love me Fitzpiers winced visibly and yet upon the whole she was right in telling it Indeed his perception that she was right in her absolute sincerity kept up his affectionate admiration for her under the pain of the rebuff Time had been when the avowal that Grace had deliberately taken steps to replace him would have brought him no sorrow But she so far dominated him now that he could not bear to hear her words although the object of her high regard was no more It is rough upon me that he said bitterly Oh Grace I did not know you tried to get rid of me I suppose it is of no use but I ask cannot you hope to find a little love in your heart for me again If I could I would oblige you but I fear I cannot she replied with illogical ruefulness And I don t see why you should mind my having had one lover besides yourself in my life when you have had so many But I can tell you honestly that I love you better than all of them put together and that s what you will not tell me I am sorry but I fear I cannot she said sighing again I wonder if you ever will He looked musingly into her indistinct face as if he would read the future there Now have pity and tell me will you try To love you again Yes if you can I don t know how to reply she answered her embarrassment proving her truth Will you promise to leave me quite free as to seeing you or not seeing you Certainly Have I given any ground for you to doubt my first promise in that respect She was obliged to admit that he had not Then I think that you might get your heart out of that grave said he with playful sadness It has been there a long time She faintly shook her head but said I ll try to think of you more if I can With this Fitzpiers was compelled to be satisfied and he asked her when she would meet him again As we arranged in a fortnight If it must be a fortnight it must This time at least I ll consider by the day I see you again if I can shorten the interval Well be that as it may I shall come at least twice a week to look at your window You must do as you like about that Good night Say husband She seemed almost inclined to give him the word but exclaiming No no I cannot slipped through the garden hedge and disappeared Fitzpiers did not exaggerate when he told her that he should haunt the precincts of the dwelling But his persistence in this course did not result in his seeing her much oftener than at the fortnightly interval which she had herself marked out as proper At these times however she punctually appeared and as the spring wore on the meetings were kept up though their character changed but little with the increase in their number The small garden of the cottage occupied by the Tangs family father son and now son s wife aligned with the larger one of the timber dealer at its upper end and when young Tim after leaving work at Melbury s stood at dusk in the little bower at the corner of his enclosure to smoke a pipe he frequently observed the surgeon pass along the outside track before mentioned Fitzpiers always walked loiteringly pensively looking with a sharp eye into the gardens one after another as he proceeded for Fitzpiers did not wish to leave the now absorbing spot too quickly after travelling so far to reach it hoping always for a glimpse of her whom he passionately desired to take to his arms anew Now Tim began to be struck with these loitering progresses along the garden boundaries in the gloaming and wondered what they boded It was naturally quite out of his power to divine the singular sentimental revival in Fitzpiers s heart the fineness of tissue which could take a deep emotional almost also an artistic pleasure in being the yearning inamorato of a woman he once had deserted would have seemed an absurdity to the young sawyer mister and missus Fitzpiers were separated therefore the question of affection as between them was settled But his Suke had since that meeting on their marriage day repentantly admitted to the urgency of his questioning a good deal concerning her past levities Putting all things together he could hardly avoid connecting Fitzpiers s mysterious visits to this spot with Suke s residence under his roof But he made himself fairly easy the vessel in which they were about to emigrate sailed that month and then Suke would be out of Fitzpiers s way forever The interval at last expired and the eve of their departure arrived They were pausing in the room of the cottage allotted to them by Tim s father after a busy day of preparation which left them weary In a corner stood their boxes crammed and corded their large case for the hold having already been sent away The firelight shone upon Suke s fine face and form as she stood looking into it and upon the face of Tim seated in a corner and upon the walls of his father s house which he was beholding that night almost for the last time Tim Tangs was not happy This scheme of emigration was dividing him from his father for old Tangs would on no account leave Hintock and had it not been for Suke s reputation and his own dignity Tim would at the last moment have abandoned the project As he sat in the back part of the room he regarded her moodily and the fire and the boxes One thing he had particularly noticed this evening she was very restless fitful in her actions unable to remain seated and in a marked degree depressed Sorry that you be going after all Suke he said She sighed involuntarily I don t know but that I be she answered Tis natural isn t it when one is going away But you wasn t born here as I was No There s folk left behind that you d fain have with ee I reckon Why do you think that I ve seen things and I ve heard things and Suke I say twill be a good move for me to get ee away I don t mind his leavings abroad but I do mind em at home Suke s face was not changed from its aspect of listless indifference by the words She answered nothing and shortly after he went out for his customary pipe of tobacco at the top of the garden The restlessness of Suke had indeed owed its presence to the gentleman of Tim s suspicions but in a different and it must be added in justice to her more innocent sense than he supposed judging from former doings She had accidentally discovered that Fitzpiers was in the habit of coming secretly once or twice a week to Hintock and knew that this evening was a favorite one of the seven for his journey As she was going next day to leave the country Suke thought there could be no great harm in giving way to a little sentimentality by obtaining a glimpse of him quite unknown to himself or to anybody and thus taking a silent last farewell Aware that Fitzpiers s time for passing was at hand she thus betrayed her feeling No sooner therefore had Tim left the room than she let herself noiselessly out of the house and hastened to the corner of the garden whence she could witness the surgeon s transit across the scene if he had not already gone by Her light cotton dress was visible to Tim lounging in the arbor of the opposite corner though he was hidden from her He saw her stealthily climb into the hedge and so ensconce herself there that nobody could have the least doubt her purpose was to watch unseen for a passer by He went across to the spot and stood behind her Suke started having in her blundering way forgotten that he might be near She at once descended from the hedge So he s coming to night said Tim laconically And we be always anxious to see our dears He IS coming to night she replied with defiance And we BE anxious for our dears Then will you step in doors where your dear will soon jine ee We ve to mouster by half past three to morrow and if we don t get to bed by eight at latest our faces will be as long as clock cases all day She hesitated for a minute but ultimately obeyed going slowly down the garden to the house where he heard the door latch click behind her Tim was incensed beyond measure His marriage had so far been a total failure a source of bitter regret and the only course for improving his case that of leaving the country was a sorry and possibly might not be a very effectual one Do what he would his domestic sky was likely to be overcast to the end of the day Thus he brooded and his resentment gathered force He craved a means of striking one blow back at the cause of his cheerless plight while he was still on the scene of his discomfiture For some minutes no method suggested itself and then he had an idea Coming to a sudden resolution he hastened along the garden and entered the one attached to the next cottage which had formerly been the dwelling of a game keeper Tim descended the path to the back of the house where only an old woman lived at present and reaching the wall he stopped Owing to the slope of the ground the roof eaves of the linhay were here within touch and he thrust his arm up under them feeling about in the space on the top of the wall plate Ah I thought my memory didn t deceive me he lipped silently With some exertion he drew down a cobwebbed object curiously framed in iron which clanked as he moved it It was about three feet in length and half as wide Tim contemplated it as well as he could in the dying light of day and raked off the cobwebs with his hand That will spoil his pretty shins for n I reckon he said It was a man trap CHAPTER XLVII Were the inventors of automatic machines to be ranged according to the excellence of their devices for producing sound artistic torture the creator of the man trap would occupy a very respectable if not a very high place It should rather however be said the inventor of the particular form of man trap of which this found in the keeper s out house was a specimen For there were other shapes and other sizes instruments which if placed in a row beside one of the type disinterred by Tim would have worn the subordinate aspect of the bears wild boars or wolves in a travelling menagerie as compared with the leading lion or tiger In short though many varieties had been in use during those centuries which we are accustomed to look back upon as the true and only period of merry England in the rural districts more especially and onward down to the third decade of the nineteenth century this model had borne the palm and had been most usually followed when the orchards and estates required new ones There had been the toothless variety used by the softer hearted landlords quite contemptible in their clemency The jaws of these resembled the jaws of an old woman to whom time has left nothing but gums There were also the intermediate or half toothed sorts probably devised by the middle natured squires or those under the influence of their wives two inches of mercy two inches of cruelty two inches of mere nip two inches of probe and so on through the whole extent of the jaws 
4236_8927_000004_000003	train-clean-360	There were also as a class apart the bruisers which did not lacerate the flesh but only crushed the bone 
none	none	The sight of one of these gins when set produced a vivid impression that it was endowed with life It exhibited the combined aspects of a s
4236_8927_000015_000002	train-clean-360	hark 
none	none	a crocodile and a scorpion Each tooth was in the form of a tapering spine two and a quarter inches long which when the jaws were closed stood in alternation from this side and from that When they were open the two halves formed a complete circle between two and three feet in diameter the plate or treading place in the midst being about a foot square while from beneath extended in opposite directions the soul of the apparatus the pair of springs each one being of a stiffness to render necessary a lever or the whole weight of the body when forcing it down There were men at this time still living at Hintock who remembered when the gin and others like it were in use Tim Tangs s great uncle had endured a night of six hours in this very trap which lamed him for life Once a keeper of Hintock woods set it on the track of a poacher and afterwards coming back that way forgetful of what he had done walked into it himself 
4236_8927_000006_000003	train-clean-360	The wound brought on lockjaw of which he died 
none	none	This event occurred during the thirties and by the year eighteen forty the use of such implements was well nigh discontinued in the neighborhood But being made entirely of iron they by no means disappeared and in almost every village one could be found in some nook or corner as readily as this was found by Tim It had indeed been a fearful amusement of Tim and other Hintock lads especially those who had a dim sense of becoming renowned poachers when they reached their prime to drag out this trap from its hiding set it and throw it with billets of wood which were penetrated by the teeth to the depth of near an inch As soon as he had examined the trap and found that the hinges and springs were still perfect he shouldered it without more ado and returned with his burden to his own garden passing on through the hedge to the path immediately outside the boundary Here by the help of a stout stake he set the trap and laid it carefully behind a bush while he went forward to reconnoitre As has been stated nobody passed this way for days together sometimes but there was just a possibility that some other pedestrian than the one in request might arrive and it behooved Tim to be careful as to the identity of his victim Going about a hundred yards along the rising ground to the right he reached a ridge whereon a large and thick holly grew Beyond this for some distance the wood was more open and the course which Fitzpiers must pursue to reach the point if he came to night was visible a long way forward For some time there was no sign of him or of anybody Then there shaped itself a spot out of the dim mid distance between the masses of brushwood on either hand And it enlarged and Tim could hear the brushing of feet over the tufts of sour grass The airy gait revealed Fitzpiers even before his exact outline could be seen Tim Tangs turned about and ran down the opposite side of the hill till he was again at the head of his own garden It was the work of a few moments to drag out the man trap very gently that the plate might not be disturbed sufficiently to throw it to a space between a pair of young oaks which rooted in contiguity grew apart upward forming a V shaped opening between and being backed up by bushes left this as the only course for a foot passenger In it he laid the trap with the same gentleness of handling locked the chain round one of the trees and finally slid back the guard which was placed to keep the gin from accidentally catching the arms of him who set it or to use the local and better word toiled it Having completed these arrangements Tim sprang through the adjoining hedge of his father s garden ran down the path and softly entered the house Obedient to his order Suke had gone to bed and as soon as he had bolted the door Tim unlaced and kicked off his boots at the foot of the stairs and retired likewise without lighting a candle His object seemed to be to undress as soon as possible Before however he had completed the operation a long cry resounded without penetrating but indescribable
4236_8927_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 What s that said Suke starting up in bed 
none	none	Sounds as if somebody had caught a hare in his gin Oh no said she It was not a hare twas louder Hark Do ee get to sleep said Tim How be you going to wake at half past three else She lay down and was silent Tim stealthily opened the window and listened Above the low harmonies produced by the instrumentation of the various species of trees around the premises he could hear the twitching of a chain from the spot whereon he had set the man trap But further human sound there was none 
4236_8927_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Tim was puzzled 
none	none	In the haste of his project he had not calculated upon a cry but if one why not more He soon ceased to essay an answer for Hintock was dead to him already In half a dozen hours he would be out of its precincts for life on his way to the antipodes He closed the window and lay down The hour which had brought these movements of Tim to birth had been operating actively elsewhere Awaiting in her father s house the minute of her appointment with her husband Grace Fitzpiers deliberated on many things Should she inform her father before going out that the estrangement of herself and Edgar was not so complete as he had imagined and deemed desirable for her happiness If she did so she must in some measure become the apologist of her husband and she was not prepared to go so far As for him he kept her in a mood of considerate gravity He certainly had changed He had at his worst times always been gentle in his manner towards her Could it be that she might make of him a true and worthy husband yet She had married him there was no getting over that and ought she any longer to keep him at a distance His suave deference to her lightest whim on the question of his comings and goings when as her lawful husband he might show a little independence was a trait in his character as unexpected as it was engaging If she had been his empress and he her thrall he could not have exhibited a more sensitive care to avoid intruding upon her against her will Impelled by a remembrance she took down a prayer book and turned to the marriage service Reading it slowly through she became quite appalled at her recent off handedness when she rediscovered what awfully solemn promises she had made him at those chancel steps not so very long ago She became lost in long ponderings on how far a person s conscience might be bound by vows made without at the time a full recognition of their force That particular sentence beginning Whom God hath joined together was a staggerer for a gentlewoman of strong devotional sentiment She wondered whether God really did join them together Before she had done deliberating the time of her engagement drew near and she went out of the house almost at the moment that Tim Tangs retired to his own The position of things at that critical juncture was briefly as follows Two hundred yards to the right of the upper end of Tangs s garden Fitzpiers was still advancing having now nearly reached the summit of the wood clothed ridge the path being the actual one which further on passed between the two young oaks 
4236_8927_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Thus far it was according to Tim s conjecture 
none	none	But about two hundred yards to the left or rather less was arising a condition which he had not divined the emergence of Grace as aforesaid from the upper corner of her father s garden with the view of meeting Tim s intended victim Midway between husband and wife was the diabolical trap silent open ready Fitzpiers s walk that night had been cheerful for he was convinced that the slow and gentle method he had adopted was promising success The very restraint that he was obliged to exercise upon himself so as not to kill the delicate bud of returning confidence fed his flame He walked so much more rapidly than Grace that if they continued advancing as they had begun he would reach the trap a good half minute before she could reach the same spot But here a new circumstance came in to escape the unpleasantness of being watched or listened to by lurkers naturally curious by reason of their strained relations they had arranged that their meeting for to night should be at the holm tree on the ridge above named So soon accordingly as Fitzpiers reached the tree he stood still to await her He had not paused under the prickly foliage more than two minutes when he thought he heard a scream from the other side of the ridge Fitzpiers wondered what it could mean but such wind as there was just now blew in an adverse direction and his mood was light He set down the origin of the sound to one of the superstitious freaks or frolicsome scrimmages between sweethearts that still survived in Hintock from old English times and waited on where he stood till ten minutes had passed Feeling then a little uneasy his mind reverted to the scream and he went forward over the summit and down the embowered incline till he reached the pair of sister oaks with the narrow opening between them Fitzpiers stumbled and all but fell Stretching down his hand to ascertain the obstruction it came in contact with a confused mass of silken drapery and iron work that conveyed absolutely no explanatory idea to his mind at all It was but the work of a moment to strike a match and then he saw a sight which congealed his blood 
4236_8927_000029_000000	train-clean-360	The man trap was thrown and between its jaws was part of a woman s clothing a patterned silk skirt gripped with such violence that the iron teeth had passed through it skewering its tissue in a score of places 
none	none	He immediately recognized the skirt as that of one of his wife s gowns the gown that she had worn when she met him on the very last occasion Fitzpiers had often studied the effect of these instruments when examining the collection at Hintock House and the conception instantly flashed through him that Grace had been caught taken out mangled by some chance passer and carried home some of her clothes being left behind in the difficulty of getting her free The shock of this conviction striking into the very current of high hope was so great that he cried out like one in corporal agony and in his misery bowed himself down to the ground Of all the degrees and qualities of punishment that Fitzpiers had undergone since his sins against Grace first began not any even approximated in intensity to this Oh my own my darling Oh cruel Heaven it is too much this he cried writhing and rocking himself over the sorry accessaries of her he deplored The voice of his distress was sufficiently loud to be audible to any one who might have been there to hear it and one there was 
4236_8927_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Right and left of the narrow pass between the oaks were dense bushes and now from behind these a female figure glided whose appearance even in the gloom was though graceful in outline noticeably strange 
none	none	She was in white up to the waist and figured above She was in short Grace his wife lacking the portion of her dress which the gin retained Don t be grieved about me don t dear Edgar she exclaimed rushing up and bending over him I am not hurt a bit I was coming on to find you after I had released myself but I heard footsteps and I hid away because I was without some of my clothing and I did not know who the person might be Fitzpiers had sprung to his feet and his next act was no less unpremeditated by him than it was irresistible by her and would have been so by any woman not of Amazonian strength He clasped his arms completely round pressed her to his breast and kissed her passionately You are not dead you are not hurt Thank God thank God he said almost sobbing in his delight and relief from the horror of his apprehension Grace my wife my love how is this what has happened I was coming on to you she said as distinctly as she could in the half smothered state of her face against his I was trying to be as punctual as possible and as I had started a minute late I ran along the path very swiftly fortunately for myself Just when I had passed between these trees I felt something clutch at my dress from behind with a noise and the next moment I was pulled backward by it and fell to the ground I screamed with terror thinking it was a man lying down there to murder me but the next moment I discovered it was iron and that my clothes were caught in a trap I pulled this way and that but the thing would not let go drag it as I would and I did not know what to do I did not want to alarm my father or anybody as I wished nobody to know of these meetings with you so I could think of no other plan than slipping off my skirt meaning to run on and tell you what a strange accident had happened to me But when I had just freed myself by leaving the dress behind I heard steps and not being sure it was you I did not like to be seen in such a pickle so I hid away It was only your speed that saved you One or both of your legs would have been broken if you had come at ordinary walking pace Or yours if you had got here first said she beginning to realize the whole ghastliness of the possibility Oh Edgar there has been an Eye watching over us to night and we should be thankful indeed He continued to press his face to hers You are mine mine again now She gently owned that she supposed she was I heard what you said when you thought I was injured she went on shyly and I know that a man who could suffer as you were suffering must have a tender regard for me But how does this awful thing come here I suppose it has something to do with poachers Fitzpiers was still so shaken by the sense of her danger that he was obliged to sit awhile and it was not until Grace said If I could only get my skirt out nobody would know anything about it that he bestirred himself By their united efforts each standing on one of the springs of the trap they pressed them down sufficiently to insert across the jaws a billet which they dragged from a faggot near at hand and it was then possible to extract the silk mouthful from the monster s bite creased and pierced with many holes but not torn Fitzpiers assisted her to put it on again and when her customary contours were thus restored they walked on together Grace taking his arm till he effected an improvement by clasping it round her waist The ice having been broken in this unexpected manner she made no further attempt at reserve I would ask you to come into the house she said but my meetings with you have been kept secret from my father and I should like to prepare him Never mind dearest I could not very well have accepted the invitation I shall never live here again as much for your sake as for mine I have news to tell you on this very point but my alarm had put it out of my head I have bought a practice or rather a partnership in the Midlands and I must go there in a week to take up permanent residence My poor old great aunt died about eight months ago and left me enough to do this I have taken a little furnished house for a time till we can get one of our own He described the place and the surroundings and the view from the windows and Grace became much interested But why are you not there now she said Because I cannot tear myself away from here till I have your promise Now darling you will accompany me there will you not To night has settled that Grace s tremblings had gone off and she did not say nay They went on together The adventure and the emotions consequent upon the reunion which that event had forced on combined to render Grace oblivious of the direction of their desultory ramble till she noticed they were in an encircled glade in the densest part of the wood whereon the moon that had imperceptibly added its rays to the scene shone almost vertically It was an exceptionally soft balmy evening for the time of year which was just that transient period in the May month when beech trees have suddenly unfolded large limp young leaves of the softness of butterflies wings Boughs bearing such leaves hung low around and completely enclosed them so that it was as if they were in a great green vase which had moss for its bottom and leaf sides The clouds having been packed in the west that evening so as to retain the departing glare a long while the hour had seemed much earlier than it was But suddenly the question of time occurred to her I must go back she said and without further delay they set their faces towards Hintock As they walked he examined his watch by the aid of the now strong moonlight By the gods I think I have lost my train said Fitzpiers Dear me whereabouts are we said she Two miles in the direction of Sherton Then do you hasten on Edgar I am not in the least afraid I recognize now the part of the wood we are in and I can find my way back quite easily I ll tell my father that we have made it up I wish I had not kept our meetings so private for it may vex him a little to know I have been seeing you He is getting old and irritable that was why I did not Good by But as I must stay at the Earl of Wessex to night for I cannot possibly catch the train I think it would be safer for you to let me take care of you But what will my father think has become of me He does not know in the least where I am he thinks I only went into the garden for a few minutes He will surely guess somebody has seen me for certain I ll go all the way back with you to morrow But that newly done up place the Earl of Wessex If you are so very particular about the publicity I will stay at the Three Tuns Oh no it is not that I am particular but I haven t a brush or comb or anything CHAPTER XLVIII All the evening Melbury had been coming to his door saying I wonder where in the world that girl is Never in all my born days did I know her bide out like this She surely said she was going into the garden to get some parsley Melbury searched the garden the parsley bed and the orchard but could find no trace of her and then he made inquiries at the cottages of such of his workmen as had not gone to bed avoiding Tangs s because he knew the young people were to rise early to leave In these inquiries one of the men s wives somewhat incautiously let out the fact that she had heard a scream in the wood though from which direction she could not say This set Melbury s fears on end He told the men to light lanterns and headed by himself they started Creedle following at the last moment with quite a burden of grapnels and ropes which he could not be persuaded to leave behind and the company being joined by the hollow turner and the man who kept the cider house as they went along They explored the precincts of the village and in a short time lighted upon the man trap Its discovery simply added an item of fact without helping their conjectures but Melbury s indefinite alarm was greatly increased when holding a candle to the ground he saw in the teeth of the instrument some frayings from Grace s clothing No intelligence of any kind was gained till they met a woodman of Delborough who said that he had seen a lady answering to the description her father gave of Grace walking through the wood on a gentleman s arm in the direction of Sherton Was he clutching her tight said Melbury Well rather said the man Did she walk lame Well tis true her head hung over towards him a bit Creedle groaned tragically Melbury not suspecting the presence of Fitzpiers coupled this account with the man trap and the scream he could not understand what it all meant but the sinister event of the trap made him follow on Accordingly they bore away towards the town shouting as they went and in due course emerged upon the highway Nearing Sherton Abbas the previous information was confirmed by other strollers though the gentleman s supporting arm had disappeared from these later accounts At last they were so near Sherton that Melbury informed his faithful followers that he did not wish to drag them farther at so late an hour since he could go on alone and inquire if the woman who had been seen were really Grace But they would not leave him alone in his anxiety and trudged onward till the lamplight from the town began to illuminate their fronts At the entrance to the High Street they got fresh scent of the pursued but coupled with the new condition that the lady in the costume described had been going up the street alone Faith I believe she s mesmerized or walking in her sleep said Melbury However the identity of this woman with Grace was by no means certain but they plodded along the street Percombe the hair dresser who had despoiled Marty of her tresses was standing at his door and they duly put inquiries to him Ah how s Little Hintock folk by now he said before replying Never have I been over there since one winter night some three year ago and then I lost myself finding it How can ye live in such a one eyed place Great Hintock is bad enough hut Little Hintock the bats and owls would drive me melancholy mad It took two days to raise my sperrits to their true pitch again after that night I went there mister Melbury sir as a man s that put by money why not retire and live here and see something of the world The responses at last given by him to their queries guided them to the building that offered the best accommodation in Sherton having been enlarged contemporaneously with the construction of the railway namely the Earl of Wessex Hotel Leaving the others without Melbury made prompt inquiry here His alarm was lessened though his perplexity was increased when he received a brief reply that such a lady was in the house Do you know if it is my daughter asked Melbury The waiter did not Do you know the lady s name Of this too the household was ignorant the hotel having been taken by brand new people from a distance They knew the gentleman very well by sight and had not thought it necessary to ask him to enter his name Oh the gentleman appears again now said Melbury to himself Well I want to see the lady he declared A message was taken up and after some delay the shape of Grace appeared descending round the bend of the stair case looking as if she lived there but in other respects rather guilty and frightened Why what the name began her father I thought you went out to get parsley Oh yes I did but it is all right said Grace in a flurried whisper I am not alone here I am here with Edgar It is entirely owing to an accident father Edgar An accident How does he come here I thought he was two hundred mile off Yes so he is I mean he has got a beautiful practice two hundred miles off he has bought it with his own money some that came to him But he travelled here and I was nearly caught in a man trap and that s how it is I am here We were just thinking of sending a messenger to let you know Melbury did not seem to be particularly enlightened by this explanation You were caught in a man trap Yes my dress was That s how it arose Edgar is up stairs in his own sitting room she went on He would not mind seeing you I am sure Oh faith I don t want to see him I have seen him too often a ready I ll see him another time perhaps if tis to oblige ee He came to see me he wanted to consult me about this large partnership I speak of as it is very promising Oh I am glad to hear it said Melbury dryly A pause ensued during which the inquiring faces and whity brown clothes of Melbury s companions appeared in the door way Then bain t you coming home with us he asked I I think not said Grace blushing H m very well you are your own mistress he returned in tones which seemed to assert otherwise Good night and Melbury retreated towards the door Don t be angry father she said following him a few steps I have done it for the best I am not angry though it is true I have been a little misled in this However good night I must get home along He left the hotel not without relief for to be under the eyes of strangers while he conversed with his lost child had embarrassed him much His search party too had looked awkward there having rushed to the task of investigation some in their shirt sleeves others in their leather aprons and all much stained just as they had come from their work of barking and not in their Sherton marketing attire while Creedle with his ropes and grapnels and air of impending tragedy had added melancholy to gawkiness Now neighbors said Melbury on joining them as it is getting late we ll leg it home again as fast as we can I ought to tell you that there has been some mistake some arrangement entered into between mister and missus Fitzpiers which I didn t quite understand an important practice in the Midland counties has come to him which made it necessary for her to join him to night so she says That s all it was and I m sorry I dragged you out Well said the hollow turner here be we six mile from home and night time and not a hoss or four footed creeping thing to our name I say we ll have a mossel and a drop o summat to strengthen our nerves afore we vamp all the way back again My throat s as dry as a kex What d ye say so s They all concurred in the need for this course and proceeded to the antique and lampless back street in which the red curtain of the Three Tuns was the only radiant object As soon as they had stumbled down into the room Melbury ordered them to be served when they made themselves comfortable by the long table and stretched out their legs upon the herring boned sand of the floor Melbury himself restless as usual walked to the door while he waited for them and looked up and down the street I d gie her a good shaking if she were my maid pretending to go out in the garden and leading folk a twelve mile traipse that have got to get up at five o clock to morrow said a bark ripper who not working regularly for Melbury could afford to indulge in strong opinions I don t speak so warm as that said the hollow turner but if tis right for couples to make a country talk about their separating and excite the neighbors and then make fools of em like this why I haven t stood upon one leg for five and twenty year All his listeners knew that when he alluded to his foot lathe in these enigmatic terms the speaker meant to be impressive and Creedle chimed in with Ah young women do wax wanton in these days Why couldn t she ha bode with her father and been faithful Poor Creedle was thinking of his old employer But this deceiving of folks is nothing unusual in matrimony said Farmer Bawtree I knowed a man and wife faith I don t mind owning as there s no strangers here that the pair were my own relations they d be at it that hot one hour that you d hear the poker and the tongs and the bellows and the warming pan flee across the house with the movements of their vengeance and the next hour you d hear em singing The Spotted Cow together as peaceable as two holy twins yes and very good voices they had and would strike in like professional ballet singers to one another s support in the high notes And I knowed a woman and the husband o her went away for four and twenty year said the bark ripper And one night he came home when she was sitting by the fire and thereupon he sat down himself on the other side of the chimney corner Well says she have ye got any news Don t know as I have says he have you No says she except that my daughter by my second husband was married last month which was a year after I was made a widow by him Oh Anything else he says No says she And there they sat one on each side of that chimney corner and were found by their neighbors sound asleep in their chairs not having known what to talk about at all Well I don t care who the man is said Creedle they required a good deal to talk about and that s true It won t be the same with these No He is such a projick you see And she is a wonderful scholar too What women do know nowadays observed the hollow turner You can t deceive em as you could in my time What they knowed then was not small said John Upjohn Always a good deal more than the men Why when I went courting my wife that is now the skilfulness that she would show in keeping me on her pretty side as she walked was beyond all belief Perhaps you ve noticed that she s got a pretty side to her face as well as a plain one I can t say I ve noticed it particular much said the hollow turner blandly Well continued Upjohn not disconcerted she has All women under the sun be prettier one side than t other And as I was saying the pains she would take to make me walk on the pretty side were unending I warrant that whether we were going with the sun or against the sun uphill or downhill in wind or in lewth that wart of hers was always towards the hedge and that dimple towards me There was I too simple to see her wheelings and turnings and she so artful though two years younger that she could lead me with a cotton thread like a blind ram for that was in the third climate of our courtship No I don t think the women have got cleverer for they was never otherwise How many climates may there be in courtship mister Upjohn inquired a youth the same who had assisted at Winterborne s Christmas party Five from the coolest to the hottest leastwise there was five in mine Can ye give us the chronicle of em mister Upjohn Yes I could I could certainly But tis quite unnecessary They ll come to ye by nater young man too soon for your good At present missus Fitzpiers can lead the doctor as your mis ess could lead you the hollow turner remarked She s got him quite tame But how long twill last I can t say I happened to be setting a wire on the top of my garden one night when he met her on the other side of the hedge and the way she queened it and fenced and kept that poor feller at a distance was enough to freeze yer blood I should never have supposed it of such a girl Melbury now returned to the room and the men having declared themselves refreshed they all started on the homeward journey which was by no means cheerless under the rays of the high moon Having to walk the whole distance they came by a foot path rather shorter than the highway though difficult except to those who knew the country well This brought them by way of Great Hintock and passing the church yard they observed as they talked a motionless figure standing by the gate I think it was Marty South said the hollow turner parenthetically I think twas a was always a lonely maid said Upjohn And they passed on homeward and thought of the matter no more It was Marty as they had supposed That evening had been the particular one of the week upon which Grace and herself had been accustomed to privately deposit flowers on Giles s grave and this was the first occasion since his death eight months earlier on which Grace had failed to keep her appointment Marty had waited in the road just outside Little Hintock where her fellow pilgrim had been wont to join her till she was weary and at last thinking that Grace had missed her and gone on alone she followed the way to Great Hintock but saw no Grace in front of her It got later and Marty continued her walk till she reached the church yard gate but still no Grace Yet her sense of comradeship would not allow her to go on to the grave alone and still thinking the delay had been unavoidable she stood there with her little basket of flowers in her clasped hands and her feet chilled by the damp ground till more than two hours had passed She then heard the footsteps of Melbury s men who presently passed on their return from the search In the silence of the night Marty could not help hearing fragments of their conversation from which she acquired a general idea of what had occurred and where missus Fitzpiers then was Immediately they had dropped down the hill she entered the church yard going to a secluded corner behind the bushes where rose the unadorned stone that marked the last bed of Giles Winterborne As this solitary and silent girl stood there in the moonlight a straight slim figure clothed in a plaitless gown the contours of womanhood so undeveloped as to be scarcely perceptible the marks of poverty and toil effaced by the misty hour she touched sublimity at points and looked almost like a being who had rejected with indifference the attribute of sex for the loftier quality of abstract humanism She stooped down and cleared away the withered flowers that Grace and herself had laid there the previous week and put her fresh ones in their place Now my own own love she whispered you are mine and on y mine for she has forgot ee at last although for her you died But I whenever I get up I ll think of ee and whenever I lie down I ll think of ee Whenever I plant the young larches I ll think that none can plant as you planted and whenever I split a gad and whenever I turn the cider wring I ll say none could do it like you If ever I forget your name let me forget home and Heaven But no no my love I never can forget ee for you was a GOOD man and did good things End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Woodlanders by Thomas Hardy END OF THIS PROJECT
