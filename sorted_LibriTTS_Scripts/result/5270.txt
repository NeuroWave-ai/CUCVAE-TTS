none	none	I called you so urgently Before us lay the body of the girl remarkably beautiful even as she lay motionless in death Her masses of golden hair disheveled added to the soft contours of her features Her wonderfully large blue gray eyes with their rare gift for delicate shades of expression were closed but long curling lashes swept her cheeks still and it was hard to believe that this was anything more than sleep It was inconceivable that Stella Lamar idol of the screen beloved of millions could have been taken from the world which worshiped her I felt keenly for the district attorney He was a portly little man of the sort prone to emphasize his own importance and so true to type he had been upset completely by a case of genuine magnitude It was as though visiting royalty had dropped dead within his jurisdiction I doubt whether the assassination of a McKinley or a Lincoln could have unsettled him as much because in such an event he would have had the whole weight of the Federal government behind him There was no question but that Stella Lamar enjoyed a country wide popularity known by few of our Presidents Her sudden death was a national tragedy Apparently Mackay had appealed to Kennedy the moment he learned the identity of Stella the moment he realized there was any question about the circumstances surrounding the affair Over the telephone the little man had been almost incoherent He had heard of Kennedy s work and was feverishly anxious to enlist his aid at any price All we knew as we took the train on the New York Central was that Stella was playing a part in a picture to be called The Black Terror that the producer was Manton Pictures Incorporated and that she had dropped dead suddenly and without warning in the middle of a scene being photographed in the library at the home of Emery Phelps I was singularly elated at the thought of accompanying Kennedy on this particular case It was not that the tragic end of a film star whose work I had learned to love was not horrible to me but rather because for once I thought Kennedy actually confronted a situation where his knowledge of a given angle of life was hardly sufficient for his usual analysis of the facts involved Walter he had exclaimed as I burst into the laboratory in response to a hurried message here s where I need your help You know all about moving pictures so if you ll phone your city editor and ask him to let you cover a case for the Star we ll just about catch a train at One Hundred and Twenty fifth Street Because the film world had fascinated me always I had made a point of being posted on its people and their activities I remembered the very first appearance of Stella Lamar back in the days of General Film when pictures were either Licensed or Independent when only two companies manufactured worth while screen dramas when any subject longer than a reel had to be of rare excellence such as the art films imported from France for the Licensed program In those days Stella rose rapidly to prominence Her large wistful eyes had set the hearts of many of us to beating at staccato rate Then came Lloyd Manton her present manager and the first of a new type of business man to enter the picture field Manton was essentially a promoter His predecessors had been men carried to success by the growth of the new art Old Pop Belman for instance had been a fifth rate oculist who rented and sold stereopticons as a side line With blind luck he had grasped the possibilities of Edison s new invention Just before the break up of General Film he had become many times a millionaire and it was then that he had sent a wave of laughter over the entire country by an actual cable to William Shakespeare address London asking for all screen rights to the plays written by that gentleman Manton represented a secondary phase in film finance Continent Films his first corporation was a stockjobbing concern Grasping the immense popularity of Stella Lamar he had coaxed her away from the old studio out in Flatbush where all her early successes had been photographed With the magic of her name he sold thousands of shares of stock to a public already fed up on the stories of the fortunes to be made in moving pictures When much of the money so raised had been dissipated when Continent s quotation on the curb sank to an infinitesimal fraction then it developed that Stella s contract was with Manton personally Manton Pictures Incorporated was formed to exploit her The stock of this company was not offered to outside investors Stella s popularity had in no way suffered from the business methods of her manager Manton at the least had displayed rare foresight in his estimation of public taste Except for a few attempts with established stage favorites photographed generally in screen versions of theatrical classics and backed by affiliations with the producers of the legitimate stage Continent Films was the first concern to make the five reel feature Stella as a Continent player was the very first feature star Under the banner of Manton Pictures she had never surrendered her position of pre eminence Also scandal somehow had failed to touch her Those initiated to the inner gossip of the film world like myself were under no illusions The relations between Stella and Manton were an open secret Yet the picture fans in their blind worship believed her to be as they saw her upon the screen To them the wide and wistful innocence of her remarkably large eyes could not be anything but genuine The artlessness of the soft curves of her mouth was proof to them of the reality of an ingenuous and very girlish personality Even her divorce had helped rather than harmed her It seemed irony to me that she should have obtained the decree instead of her husband and in New York too where the only grounds are unfaithfulness The testimony in the case had been sealed so that no one knew whom she had named as corespondent At the time I wondered what pressure had been exerted upon Millard to prevent the filing of a cross suit Surely he should have been able to substantiate the rumors of her association with Lloyd Manton Lawrence Millard author and playwright and finally scenario writer had been as much responsible for the success of his wife as Manton and in a much less spectacular way It was Millard who had written her first great Continent success who had developed the peculiar type of story best suited for her back in the early days of the one reel and General Film It is commonly known in picture circles that an actress who screens well even if she is only a moderately

none	none	artist can be made a star with one or two or three good stories and that conversely a star may be ruined by a succession of badly written or badly produced vehicles Those of us not blinded by an idolatrous worship for the girl condemned her severely for throwing her husband aside at the height of her success The public displayed their sympathy for her by a burst of renewed interest The receipts at the box office whenever her films were shown probably delighted both Manton and Stella herself I had wondered as Kennedy and I occupied a seat in the train and as he left me to my thoughts whether there could be any connection between the tragedy and the divorce The decree I knew was not yet final Could it be possible that Millard was unwilling after all to surrender her Could he prefer deliberate murder to granting her her freedom I was compelled to drop that line of thought since it offered no explanation of his previous failure to contest her suit or to start counter action Then my reflections had strayed away from Kennedy s sphere the solving of the mystery to my own the news value of her death and the events following The Star as always had been only too glad to assign me to any case where Craig Kennedy was concerned my phone message to the city editor the first intimation to any New York paper of Stella s death already had resulted without doubt in scare heads and an extra edition The thought of the prominence given the personal affairs of picture players and theatrical folk had disgusted me There are stars against whom there is not the slightest breath of gossip even among the studio scandal mongers Any number of girls and men go about their work sanely and seriously concerned in nothing but their success and the pursuit of normal pleasures As a matter of fact it had struck me on the train that this was about the first time Craig Kennedy had ever been called in upon a case even remotely connected with the picture field I knew he would be confronted with a tangled skein of idle talk from everybody about everybody and mostly without justification I hoped he would not fall into the popular error of assuming all film players bad all studios schools of immorality I was glad I was able to accompany him on that account The arrival at Tarrytown had ended my reflections and Kennedy s whatever they may have been Mackay himself had met us at the station and with a few words to cover his nervousness had whisked us out to the house As we approached Kennedy had taken quick note of the surroundings the location of the home itself the arrangement of the grounds There was a spreading lawn on all four sides unbroken by plant or bush or tree sheer prodigality of space the better to display a rambling but most artistic pile of gray granite Masking the road and the adjoining grounds was thick impenetrable shrubbery a ring of miniature forest land about the estate There was a garage set back and tennis courts and a practice golf green In the center of a garden in a far corner a summerhouse was placed so as to reflect itself in the surface of a glistening swimming pool As we pulled up under the porte cochere Emery Phelps the banker greeted us Perhaps it was my imagination but it seemed to me that there was a repressed animosity in his manner as though he resented the intrusion of Kennedy and myself yet felt powerless to prevent it In contrast to his manner was the cordiality of Lloyd Manton just inside the door Manton was childishly eager in his welcome so much so that I was able to detect a shade of suspicion in Kennedy s face The others of the company were clustered in the living room through which we passed to reach the library I found small opportunity to study them in the rather dim light Mackay beckoned to a man standing in a window presenting him to Kennedy as Doctor Blake Then we entered the long paneled chamber which had been the scene of the tragedy Now I stood rather awed with the motionless figure of Stella Lamar before me in her last pitiable close up For I have never lost the sense of solemnity on entering the room of a tragedy in spite of the long association I have had with Kennedy in the scientific detection of crime Particularly did I have the feeling in this case The death of a man is tragic but I know nothing more affecting than the sudden and violent death of a beautiful woman unless it be that of a child I recalled a glimpse of Stella as I had seen her in her most recent release as the diaphragm opened on her receiving a box of chocolates sent by her lover and playfully feeding one of them to her beautiful collie Laddie as he romped about upon a divan and almost smothered her with affection The vivacity and charm of the scene were in sad contrast with what lay before me As I looked more carefully I saw now that her full well rounded face was contorted with either pain or fear perhaps both Even through the make up one could see that her face was blotched and swollen Also the muscles were contorted the eyes looked as if they might be bulging under the lids and there was a bluish tinge to her skin Evidently death had come quickly but it had not been painless Even the coroner has not disturbed the body Mackay hastened to explain to Kennedy The players the camera men all were sent out of the room the moment Doctor Blake was certain something more than a natural cause lay behind her death mister Phelps telephoned to me and upon my arrival I ordered the doors and windows closed posted my deputies to prevent any interference with anything in the room left my instructions that everyone was to be detained then got in touch with you as quickly as I could Kennedy turned to him Something in the tone of his voice showed that he meant his compliment I m glad Mackay to be called in by some one who knows enough not to destroy evidence who realizes that perhaps the slightest disarrangement of a rug for instance may be the only clue to a murder It s it s rare The little district attorney beamed If he had found it necessary to walk across the floor just then he would have strutted I smiled because I wanted Kennedy to show again his marvelous skill in tracing a crime to its perpetrator I was anxious that nothing should be done to hamper him II THE TINY SCRATCH Kennedy before his own examination of the body turned to Doctor Blake Tell me just what you found when you arrived he directed The physician whose practice embraced most of the wealthy families in and around Tarrytown was an unusually tall iron gray haired man of evident competency It was very plain that he resented his unavoidable connection with the case She was still alive he responded thoughtfully although breathing with difficulty Nearly everyone had clustered about her so that she was getting little air and the room was stuffy from the lights they had been using in taking the scene They told me she dropped unconscious and that they couldn t revive her but at first it did not occur to me that it might be serious I thought perhaps the heat You saw nothing suspicious interrupted Kennedy nothing in the actions or manner of anyone in the room No when I first entered I didn t suspect anything out of the way I had them send everyone into the next room except Manton and Phelps and had the doors and windows thrown open to give her air Then when I examined her I detected what seemed to me to be both a muscular and nervous paralysis which by that time had proceeded pretty far As I touched her she opened her eyes but she was unable to speak She was breathing with difficulty her heart action was weakening so rapidly that I had little opportunity to apply restorative measures What do you think caused the death So far I can make no satisfactory explanation The doctor shrugged his shoulders very slightly That is why I advised an immediate investigation I did not care to write a death certificate You have no hypothesis If she died from any natural organic disorder the signs were lacking by which I could trace it Everything indicates the opposite however It would be hard for me to say whether the paralysis of respiration or of the heart actually caused her death If it was due to poison Well to me the whole affair is shrouded in mystery The symptoms indicated nothing I could recognize with any degree of certainty Kennedy stooped over making a superficial examination of the girl I saw that some faint odor caught his nostrils for he remained poised a moment inhaling reflectively his eyes clouded in thought Then he went to the windows raising the shades an additional few inches each but that did not seem to give him the light he wished In the room were the portable arcs used in the making of scenes in an actual interior setting The connections ran to heavy insulated junction boxes at the ends of two lines of stiff black stage cable Near the door the circuits were joined and a single lead of the big duplex cord ran out along the polished hardwood floor carried presumably to the house circuit at a fuse box where sufficient amperage was available Kennedy s eyes followed out the wires quickly Then motioning to me to help he wheeled one of the heavy stands around and adjusted the hood so that the full strength of the light would be cast upon Stella The arc in place he threw the switch and in the sputtering flood of illumination dropped to his knees taking a powerful pocket lens from his waistcoat and beginning an inch by inch examination of her skin I gained a fresh realization of the beauty of the star as she lay under the dazzling electric glow and in particular I noticed the small amount of make up she had used and the natural firmness of her flesh She was dressed in a modish informal dinner dress of embroidered satin cut fairly low at front and back and with sleeves of some gauzelike material reaching not halfway to her elbow hardly sleeves at all in fact Kennedy with his glass went over her features with extreme care I saw that he drew her hair back and that then he parted it to examine her scalp and I wondered what infinitesimal clue might be the object of his search I had learned however never to question him while he was at work With his eye glued to his lens he made his way about and around her neck and down and over her throat and chest so far as it remained unprotected by the silk of her gown With the aid of Mackay he turned her over to examine her back Next he returned the body to its former position and began to inspect the arms Very suddenly something caught his eye on the inside of her right forearm He grunted with satisfaction straightened pulled the switch of the arc wiped his eyes which were watering Find anything mister Kennedy Doctor Blake seemed to understand to some extent the purpose of the examination Kennedy did not answer probably preoccupied with theories which I could see were forming in his mind The library was a huge room of greater length than breadth At one end were wide French windows looking out upon the garden and summer house The door to the hallway and living room was very broad with heavy sliding panels and rich portieres of a velours almost the tint of the wood work Between the door situated in the side wall near the opposite end and the windows was a magnificent stone fireplace with charred logs testifying to its frequent use The couch where Stella lay had been drawn back from its normal position before the fire together with a huge table of carved walnut The other two walls were an unbroken succession of shelves reaching to the ceiling and literally packed with books Facing the windows and the door so as to include the fireplace and the wide sweep of the room within range were two cameras still set up the legs of their tripods nested probably left exactly as they were at the moment of Stella s collapse I touched the handle of one a Bell Howell and saw that it was threaded that the film had not been disturbed The lights staggered and falling away from the camera lines were arranged to focus their illumination on the action of the scenes There were four arcs and two small portable banks of Cooper Hewitts the latter used to cut the sharp shadows and give a greater evenness to the photography Also there were diffusers constructed of sheets of white cloth stretched taut on frames These reflected light upward upon the faces of the actors softening the lower features and so valuable in adding to the attractiveness of the women in particular All this I had learned from visits to a studio with the Star s photoplay editor I was anxious to impress my knowledge upon Kennedy He gave me no opportunity however but wheeled upon Mackay suddenly Send in the electrician he ordered Keep everyone else out until I m ready to examine them While the district attorney hurried to the sliding doors guarded on their farther side by one of the amateur deputies he had impressed into service Kennedy swung the stand of the arc he had used back into the place unaided I noticed that Doctor Blake was nervously interested in spite of his professional poise I certainly was bursting with curiosity to know what Kennedy had found The electrician a wizened veteran of the studios with a bald head which glistened rather ridiculously entered as though he expected to be held for the death of the star on the spot I don t know nothin he began before anyone could start to question him I was outside when they yelled honest I was seeing whether m lead was getting hot and I heard em call to douse the glim an Put on all your lights Kennedy was unusually sharp although it was plain he held no suspicion of this man as he added just as you had them As the electrician went from stand to stand sulkily there was a sputter from the arcs almost deafening in the confines of the room and quite a bit of fine white smoke But in a moment the corner of the library constituting the set was brilliantly dazzlingly lighted To me it was quite like being transported into one of the big studios in the city Is this the largest portion of the room they used Kennedy asked Did you have your stands any farther back This was the biggest lay out sir replied the man Were all the scenes in which Miss Lamar appeared before her death in this corner of the room Yes sir And this was the way you had the scene lighted when she dropped unconscious Yes sir I pulled m lights an an they lifted her up and put her right there where she is sir Kennedy paid no attention to the last in fact I doubt whether he heard it Dropping to hands and knees immediately he began a search of the floor and carpet as minutely painstaking as the inspection he had given Stella s own person Instinctively I drew back to be out of his way as did Doctor Blake and Mackay The electrician I noticed seemed to grasp now the reason for the summons which undoubtedly had frightened him badly He gave his attention to his lights stroking a refractory Cooper Hewitt tube for all the world as if some minor scene in the story were being photographed It was hard to realize that it was not another picture scene but that Craig Kennedy in my opinion the founder of the scientific school of modern detectives was searching out in this strange environment the clue to a real murder so mysterious that the very cause of death was as yet undetermined I was hoping for a display of the remarkable brilliance Craig had shown in so many of the cases brought to his attention I half expected to see him rise from the floor with some tiny something in his hand some object overlooked by everyone else some tangible evidence which would lead to the immediate apprehension of the perpetrator of the crime That Stella Lamar had met her death by foul means I did not doubt for an instant and so I waited feverishly for the conclusion of Kennedy s search As it happened this was not destined to be one of his cases cleared up in a brief few hours of intensive effort He covered every inch of the floor within the illuminated area then he turned his attention to the walls and furniture and the rest of the room in somewhat more perfunctory but no less skillful manner Fully fifteen minutes elapsed but I knew from his expression that he had discovered nothing In a wringing perspiration from the heat of the arcs but nevertheless glad to have had the intense light at his disposal he motioned to the electrician to turn them off and to leave the room Find anything mister Kennedy queried the physician once more Kennedy beckoned all of us to the side of the ill fated actress Lifting the right arm finding the spot which had caused his exclamation before he handed his pocket lens to Doctor Blake After a moment a low whistle escaped the lips of the physician Next it was my turn As I stooped over I caught above the faint scent of imported perfume which she affected a peculiar putrescent odor This it was which had caught Kennedy s nostrils Then through the glass I could detect upon her forearm the tiniest possible scratch ending in an almost invisible puncture such as might have been made by a very sharp needle or the point of an incredibly fine hypodermic syringe Drawing back I glanced again at her face which I had already noted was blotched and somewhat swollen beneath the make up Again I thought that the muscles were contorted that the eyes were bulging slightly that there was a bluish tinge to her skin such as in cyanosis or asphyxiation It may have been imagination but I was now sure that her expression revealed pain or fear or both When I looked at her first I had been unable to forget my impression of years Before me there had been the once living form of Stella Lamar whom I had dreamed of meeting and whom I had never viewed in actual life I had lacked the penetration to see beneath the glamour But to Kennedy there had been signs of the poisoning at once Doctor Blake had searched merely for the evidences of the commoner drugs or the usual diseases such as cause sudden death I recalled the cyanides I thought of curare or woorali the South American arrow poison with which Kennedy once had dealt Had Stella received an injection of some new and curious substance Mackay glanced up from his inspection of the mark on the arm It s an awfully tiny scratch he exclaimed Kennedy smiled Yet Mackay it probably was the cause of her death How That that is the problem before us When we learn just exactly how she scratched herself or was scratched Kennedy paced up and down in front of the fireplace Then he confronted each of us in turn suddenly serious Not a word of what I have discovered he warned III TANGLED MOTIVES Do you wish to examine the people now Mackay asked Kennedy hesitated First I want to make sure of the evidence concerning her actual death Can you arrange to have the clothes she has on and those she brought with her all of them bundled up and sent in to my laboratory together with samples of her body fluids as soon as the coroner can supply you Mackay nodded This pleased him This seemed to be tangible action promising tangible results Again Kennedy glanced about in thought I knew that the scratch was worrying him Did she change her clothes out here he inquired The district attorney brightened She dressed in a small den just off the living room I have a man posted and the door closed Nothing has been disturbed He started to lead the way without further word from Kennedy proud to have been able once more to demonstrate his foresight As we left the library entering the living room there was an appreciable hush Here were grouped the others of the party brought out by the picture company a constrained gathering of folk who had little in common beyond the highly specialized needs of the new art of the screen an assembly of souls who had been forced to wait during all the time required for the trip of Kennedy and myself out from New York who were compelled to wait now until he should be ready to examine them I picked out the electrician in the semi gloom and with him his fellow members of the technical staff needed in the taking of the scenes in the library The camera men I guessed and a property boy and an assistant director The last at any event of all those in the huge room had summoned up sufficient nonchalance to bend his mind to details of his work I saw that he was thumbing a copy of the scenario or detailed working manuscript of the story making notations in some kind of little book and it was that which enabled me to establish his identity at a glance In a different corner were the principals two men and a girl still in make up and with them the director and Manton and Phelps Apart from everyone else in a sort of social ostracism common to the studios the two five dollar a day extras waited a butler and a maid also in make up Oddly enough the total number of these material witnesses to the tragedy was just thirteen and I wondered if they had noticed the fact Doctor Blake turned to Kennedy the moment we left the library Do you feel it is necessary for me to remain any longer he asked He was apologetic yet distinctly impatient I have neglected several very important calls as it is Kennedy and Mackay both hastened to assure the physician that they appreciated his company operation and that they would spare him as much notoriety and inconvenience as possible Then the three of us hurried across and to the little den which had been converted into a dressing room for Stella s use Here were all the evidences of femininity the little touches which a woman can impart to the smallest corner in a few brief moments of occupancy It was a tiny alcove shut off from the rest of the living room by heavy silk hangings drawn now and pinned together so as to assure her the privacy she wished The one window was high and fitted with leaded glass but it was raised and afforded the maximum of light Stella s traveling bag sprawled wide open with many of her effects strewn about in attractive disarray Her suit in which she had made the trip to Tarrytown was thrown carelessly over the back of a chair Her mirror was fastened up ruthlessly upon a handsome woven Oriental hanging with a long hatpin Powder was spilled upon the couch cover another Oriental fabric and her little box of rouge lay face downward on the floor As we pulled the curtains aside I caught the perfume which still clung to her clothes in the library beyond As Mackay sniffed also Kennedy smiled Coty s Jacqueminot rose he remarked With his usual swift and practiced certainty Kennedy then inspected the extemporized dressing room He seemed to satisfy himself that no subtle attack had been made upon the girl here although I doubt that he had held any such supposition seriously in the first place In my association of several years with Kennedy following our first intimacy of college days I had learned that his success as a scientific detective was the result wholly of his thoroughness of method To watch him had become a never ending delight even in the dull preliminary work of a case as baffling as this one Mackay also seemed content just to enact the role of spectator Kennedy thumbed through the delicate intimacies of her traveling bag with the keen impersonal manner which always distinguished him then he found her beaded handbag and proceeded to rummage through that Suddenly he paused as he unfolded a piece of note paper and we gathered around to read MY DEAR STELLA Have something very important to tell you Will you lunch Tuesday at the P G tearoom LARRY Tuesday murmured Kennedy And this is Monday Who who is Larry I wonder I hastened to answer the question for him It was my first opportunity to display my knowledge of the picture players Larry that s Lawrence Lawrence Millard I exclaimed Then I went on to tell him of the divorce and the circumstances surrounding Stella s life as I knew it It it looks I concluded as if they might have been on the point of composing their differences after all Kennedy nodded I could see however that he made a mental note of his intention to question the girl s former husband All at once another thought struck me and I became eager It was a possible explanation of the mystery Listen Craig I began Suppose Millard wanted to make up and she didn t Suppose that she refused to see him or to meet him Suppose that in a jealous fit he No Walter Kennedy headed me off with a smile This wasn t an ordinary murder of passion This was well thought out and well executed Not one medical examiner in a thousand would have found that tiny scratch It may be very difficult yet to determine the exact cause of death This my dear Jameson it was playful irony is a scientific crime But Millard Of course Anyone may be the culprit Yet you tell me Millard did not contest her divorce and that it would have been very easy for him to file a counter suit because everyone knew of her relationship with Manton That offhand shows no ill will on his part And now we find this note from him which at least is friendly in tone I shrugged my shoulders It was the same blind alley in which my thoughts had strayed upon the train on our way out It s too early to begin to try to fasten the guilt upon anyone Kennedy added as we returned to the library through the living room Then he turned to Mackay Have you succeeded in gleaning any facts about the life of Miss Lamar he asked Anything which might point to a motive so that I can approach the case from both directions If you ask me the little district attorney rejoined it s a matter of tangled motives throughout I I had no sword to cut the Gordian knot and so graciously I sent for you What do you mean by tangled motives Kennedy ignored the other s compliment Well Mackay indicated me mister Jameson explained about her divorce No one heard whom she named as corespondent That s an unknown woman in the case although it may not mean anything at all Then there s Lloyd Manton and all the talk about his affair with Miss Lamar Some one told one of my men that Manton s wife has left him on that account Did you question Manton No I thought I ought to leave all that to you I was afraid I might put them on their guard Good Kennedy was pleased Did you learn anything else This deputy of mine obtained all these things by gossiping with the girl who plays the maid and so they may not be reliable But among the players it is reported that Werner the director was having an affair with Stella also and that Merle Shirley the heavy man was seen with her a great deal recently and that Jack Gordon the leading man who was engaged to marry her as soon as her decree was final was jealous as a consequence and that Miss Loring playing the vampire In the story and engaged to Shirley was even more bitter against the deceased than Gordon Miss Lamar s fiance That made eight people with possible motives for the crime When I got that far I gave it up In fact Mackay lowered his voice suddenly I don t like the attitude of Emery Phelps This is his house you know and he is the financial backer of Manton Pictures yet there seems to be an undercurrent of friction between Manton and himself I I wanted him to show me some detail of the arrangement of things in the library but he wouldn t come into the room He said he didn t want to look at Miss Lamar There there was something and I don t know If he is concerned in any way that would make nine You think Miss Lamar and Phelps Mackay shook his head I don t know Kennedy turned to me expression really serious Is this the way they carry on in the picture world Walter he asked Is this the usual thing or or an exception I flushed It s very much an exception I insisted The film people are just like other people some good and some bad Probably three quarters of all this is gossip I hope so He straightened The only thing to do is to go after them one at a time and disentangle all the conflicting threads It looks as though there will be any number of possible false leads and so we must be careful and deliberate I think I ll question each in turn here He walked over to the fireplace stopping for just a moment to glance at the body of Stella Then he pulled the blinds down halfway so that the room seemed somber and gruesome He drew a chair so that the different individuals as he examined them would be unable to lose sight of the dead woman His arrangements completed he faced the district attorney Manton first he directed In an instant I caught the psychology of it the now darkened library the beautiful body still lying on the davenport the quiet and quick arrival of ourselves If anything could be extracted from these people surely it would be betrayed under these surroundings IV THE FATAL SCRIPT I had no real opportunity to study Manton when he greeted us upon our arrival and at that time neither Kennedy nor I possessed even a passing realization of the problem before us Now I felt that I was ready to grasp at any possible motive for the crime I was prepared to suspect any or all of the nine people enumerated by Mackay so far as I could speak for myself and at the very least I was certain that this was one of the most baffling cases ever brought to Craig s attention Yet I was sure he would solve it I waited most impatiently for the outcome of his examination of Lloyd Manton The producer promoter was a well set up man just approaching middle age About him was a certain impression of great physical strength of bulk without flabbiness and in particular I noticed the formation of his head the square broad development which indicated his intellectual power and I found too a fascinating quality about his eyes deeply placed and of a warm dark gray brown which seemed to hold a fundamental sincerity which I imagined made the man almost irresistible in a business deal His weakness so far as I could ascertain it was revealed by his mouth and chin and by a certain nervousness of his hands hands where a square practical palm was belied by the slight tapering of his fingers the mark of the dreamer His mouth was unquestionably sensuous with the lips full and now and then revealing out of the studied practiced calm of his face an almost imperceptible twitching as though to betray a flash of emotion or fear His chin was feminine softening his expression and showing that his feelings would overbalance the cool calculation denoted by his eyes and the rather heavy level brows above As he entered the room taking the chair indicated by Kennedy he seemed perfectly cool and his glance as it strayed to the lifeless form of Stella revealed his iron self control The little signs which I have mentioned which betrayed the real man beneath were only disclosed to me little by little as Kennedy s questioning progressed Tell me just what happened Kennedy began Well Manton responded quickly enough but then he stopped and proceeded as though he chose each word with care as if he framed each sentence so that there would be no misunderstanding no chance of wrong impression all of which pleased Kennedy In the scene we were taking he went on Stella was crouched down on the floor bending over her father who had just been murdered She was sobbing All at once the lights were to spring up The young hero was to dash through the set and she was to see him and scream out in terror The first part went all right But when the lights flashed on instead of looking up and screaming Stella sort of crumpled and collapsed on top of Werner who was playing the father I yelled to stop the cameras and rushed in We picked her up and put her on the couch Some one sent for the doctor but she died without saying a word I I haven t the slightest idea what happened At first I thought it was heart trouble Did she have heart trouble No that is not that I ever heard Kennedy hesitated Why were you taking these scenes out here It was on the tip of my tongue to answer for Manton I knew that at one time many fine interiors were actually taken in houses to save expense I was sorry that Kennedy should draw any conclusion from a fact which I thought was too well known to require explanation Manton s answer however proved a distinct surprise to me mister Phelps asked us to use his library in this picture Wouldn t it have been easier and cheaper in the long run to reproduce it in the studio Manton glanced up at Kennedy echoing my thought Had Kennedy after all some knowledge of motion pictures stored away with his vast fund of general and unusual information Yes replied the producer It would save the trip out here the loss of time the inconvenience why in an actual dollars and cents comparison with overhead and everything taken into account the building of a set like this is nothing nowadays Do you know mister Phelps s reason Manton shrugged his shoulders Just a whim and we had to humor it mister Phelps is interested in the company Yes He recently bought up all the stock except my own He is in absolute control financially What is the story you are making I mean I want to understand just exactly what happened in the scenes you were photographing today It is essential that I learn how everyone was supposed to act and how they did act I must find out every trivial little detail Do you follow me Manton s mouth set suddenly showing that it possessed a latent quality of firmness He glanced about the room then rose went to the farther end of the long table and returned with a thick sheaf of manuscript bound at the side in stiff board covers This is the scenario the script of the detailed action he explained As Kennedy took the binder Manton opened it and turned past several sheets of tabulation and lists the index to the sets and exterior locations the characters and extras the changes of clothes and other technical detail The scenes we are taking here he went on are the opening scenes of the story We left them until now because it meant the long trip out to Tarrytown and because it would take us away from the studio while they were putting up the largest two sets a banquet and a ballroom which need the entire floor space of the studio He turned over two or three pages pointing We had taken up to scene thirteen from scenes one to thirteen just as you have them in order there It it was in the unlucky thirteenth that she was it my imagination or did he tremble for just an instant violently that she died Kennedy started to read the script I hurried to his side glancing over his shoulder THE BLACK TERROR FEATURING STELLA LAMAH SCENE one LOCATION Remsen library This is a modern luxurious library set with a long table in the center of the room books around the walls French windows leading from the rear and an entrance through a hallway to the right through a pair of portieres Note E P wishes us to use his library at Tarrytown ACTION Open diaphragm slowly on darkened set as a spot of light is being played on the walls and French windows in the rear As the diaphragm opens slowly the light vanishes leaving the scene dark at times and then brightened until as the diaphragm opens full we discover that the light is that of a burglar s flash light traveling over the walls of the library When the diaphragm is fully opened we discover also a faint line of light streaming through the almost closed portieres leading to the hallway outside This ray of light striking along the floor pauses by the library table just disclosing the edge of it but not revealing anything else in the room The spotlight in the hands of a shadowy figure roves across the wall and to the portieres As it pauses there the portieres move and the fingers of a girl are seen on the edge of the silk A bare and beautiful arm is thrust through the portieres almost to the shoulder and it begins to move the portieres aside reaching upward to pull the curtains apart at the rings SCENE two LOCATION Remsen library Close foreground of portieres ACTION Our heroine parts the portieres and stands revealed in the spotlight s glare She is in dinner gown and about her throat is a peculiar locket of flashing jewels She cries out and backs away closing the portieres The spotlight retreats from the curtains leaving them dark SCENE three LOCATION Hallway Remsen house Close foreground of portieres leading to library This hallway is lighted ACTION The girl holding the portieres shut screams for help SCENE four LOCATION Foot of stairway Remsen house ACTION The butler and maid are discovered talking They hear the girl s scream and start running SCENE five LOCATION Hallway Remsen house Close foreground of portieres ACTION The girl hears help coming and glances off to indicate that she sees the butler and the maid She continues to cling to the closed curtains SCENE six LOCATION Remsen library Full shot ACTION The unknown drops the spotlight to the floor and we first see his legs crossing the rays of light on the floor Then the spotlight rolls revealing the body of an elderly man of the American millionaire type lying crumpled against the table Finally it rolls a little farther and stops directing its rays into the fireplace SCENE seven LOCATION Remsen hallway outside library ACTION The girl indicates determined resolve She throws apart the portieres with a quick motion of her arms and dashes inside The portieres close after her The butler and maid come on running and looking about SCENE eight LOCATION Remsen library Full shot ACTION The spotlight is showing into the fireplace when the girl crosses quickly into its rays She stoops into the light revealing her face and picking up the spotlight She flashes it about the room pausing as it strikes the French windows and reveals the murderer making his escape out on a balcony which is revealed in the background When the rays of light reach the murderer he deliberately turns SCENE nine LOCATION Remsen library Close foreground of French windows ACTION The intruder now in the close foreground pauses as he is about to shut the window and blinks deliberately into the rays of light then laughs and closes the French windows SCENE ten LOCATION Hallway Remsen home Close foreground of portieres to library ACTION The butler and maid look around hopelessly A young man the exact counterpart of the man who in the previous scene looked into the spotlight at the French windows comes up to the butler and demands to know what has happened The butler explains hurriedly that he heard his mistress cry out for help The young man steps to the portieres and pauses SCENE eleven LOCATION Remsen library Full shot ACTION The girl using the spotlight flashes it about the room and down on the floor seeing for the first time the body of the American millionaire SCENE twelve LOCATION Exterior Remsen house Night tint ACTION The murderer scrambles down a column from the upper porch and leaps to the ground darting across the lawn out of the picture SCENE thirteen LOCATION Remsen library Full shot ACTION The spotlight on the floor reveals the girl sobbing over the body of the millionaire and trying to revive him She screams and cries out The portieres are parted and from the lighted hallway we see the young man the butler and the maid who enter The young man switches on the lights and the room is revealed The three cry out in horror The young man glancing about leaps toward the partly opened French windows drawing a revolver As the girl sees him she screams again and denotes terror Finishing the thirteenth scene Kennedy closed the covers and handed the script to me Then he confronted Manton once more What became of the locket about the girl s neck In the manuscript Miss Lamar is supposed to have a peculiar pendant at her throat There was none Oh yes The promoter remained a moment in thought The doctor took it off and gave it to Bernie the prop boy who s helping the electrician Is he outside Yes Now try to remember mister Manton Kennedy leaned over very seriously Just who approached closely to Miss Lamar in the making of that thirteenth scene Who was near enough to have inflicted a wound or to have subjected her suppose we say to the fumes of some subtle poison You think that Manton started to question Kennedy but was given no encouragement Gordon the leading man passed through the scene he replied after a pause but did not go very near her Werner was playing the dead millionaire at her feet Who is Werner He s my director Because it was such a small part he played it himself He s only in the two or three scenes in the beginning and I was here to be at the camera While Kennedy was questioning Manton I had been glancing through the script of the picture My own connection with the movies had consisted largely of three attempts to sell stories of my own to the producers Needless to remark I had not succeeded in that regard falling in the class with some hundreds of thousands of my fellow citizens For everybody thinks he has at least one motion picture in him And so though I had managed to visit studios and meet a few of the players this was my very first shot at a manuscript actually in production I took advantage of Kennedy s momentary preoccupation to turn to Manton Who wrote this script mister Manton I asked Millard Lawrence Millard Millard Kennedy and I exclaimed simultaneously Why yes Millard is still under contract and he s the only man who ever could write scripts for Stella We we tried others and they all flivved Is Millard here Manton burst into laughter somehow out of place in the room where we still were in the company of death An author on the lot at the filming of his picture to bother the director and to change everything Out When the scenario s done he s through He s lucky to get his name on the screen It s not the story but the direction which counts except that
2473_155521_000010_000001	train-clean-360	 you ve got 
none	none	to have a good idea to start with and a halfway decent script to make your lay outs from Anyhow He sobered a bit perhaps realizing that he was going counter to the tendency to have the author on the lot Millard and Stella weren t on speaking terms She divorced him you know Do you know much about the personal affairs of Miss Lamar Well Manton s eyes sought the floor for a moment Like everyone else in pictures Stella was the victim of a great deal of gossip That s the experience of any girl who rises to a position of prominence and How were the relations between Miss Lamar and yourself interrupted Kennedy What do you mean by that Manton flushed quickly You have had no trouble no disagreements recently No indeed Everything has been very friendly between us in a strictly business way of course and I don t believe I ve had an unpleasant word with her since I first formed Manton Pictures to make her a star You know nothing of her difficulties with her husband Naturally not I seldom saw her except at the studio unless it was some necessary affair such as a screen ball here or perhaps in Boston or Philadelphia or some near by city where I would take her for effect Kennedy turned to Mackay Will you arrange to keep the people I have yet to question separate from the ones I have examined already As the district attorney nodded Kennedy dismissed Manton rather shortly then turned again to Mackay as the promoter drew out of earshot Bring in Bernie the property boy before anyone can tell him to hide or destroy that locket V AN EMOTIONAL MAZE Bernie proved to be as stupid a youth as any I had ever seen He possessed frightened semi liquid eyes and overshot ears and hair which might have been red beneath its accumulation of dust Without doubt the boy had been coached by the electrician because he began to affirm his innocence in similar fashion the moment he entered the door I don t know nothin honest I don t he pleaded I was out in the hall I was and I didn t come in at all until the doc came I suppose you were anxious to see if the cable was becoming hot Kennedy suggested gravely That s it sir We was lookin at it because it was on the varnish and the butler he says Where s the locket interrupted Kennedy The one Miss Lamar wore in the scenes Oh in disdain that thing With some effort Bernie fished it from the capacious depths of a pocket disentangling the sharp corners from the torn and ragged lining of his coat I glanced at it as Kennedy turned it over and over in his hands and saw that it was a palpable stage prop with glass jewels of the cheapest sort Concealing his disappointment Kennedy dropped it into his own pocket confronting the frightened Bernie once more Do you know anything about Miss Lamar s death No I don t know nothing honest All right Kennedy turned to Mackay Werner the director Of Stanley Werner I had heard a great deal through interviews character studies and other press stuff in the photoplay journals and the Sunday newspaper film sections Now I found him to be a high strung individual so extremely nervous that it seemed impossible for him to remain in one position in his chair or for him to keep his hands motionless for a single instant Although he was of moderate build with a fair suggestion of flesh there were yet the marks of the artist and of the creative temperament in the fine sloping contours of his head and in his remarkably long fingers which tapered to nails manicured immaculately Kennedy seemed to pay particular attention to his eyes which were dark soft and amazingly restless Who was in the cast mister Werner What were they playing and just exactly what was each doing at the time of Miss Lamar s collapse Well Werner s eyes shifted to mine then to Mackay s and there was a subtle lack of ease in his manner which I was hardly prepared to classify as yet Stella Lamar was playing the part of Stella Remsen the heroine and uh I see your associate has the script He paused glancing at me again When Kennedy said nothing Werner went on growing more and more nervous Jack Gordon plays Jack Daring the hero the handsome young chap who runs down the steps and encounters the butler and the maid in the hall just outside the library Wasn t it his face in the French windows of the library at the same time Kennedy asked Wasn t he the murderer of the father also No Werner smiled slightly and there was an instant s flash of the man s personality winning and it seemed to me calculated to inspire confidence That is the mystery it is a mystery plot While the parts are played by Jack in both cases now we explain in a subtitle a little later that the criminal himself the Black Terror is a master of scientific impersonation and that he changes the faces of his emissaries by means of plastic surgery and such scientific things so that they look like the characters against whom he wishes to throw suspicion So while Jack plays the part it is really an accomplice of the Black Terror who kills old Remsen Kennedy turned to me A new idea in the application of science to crime he remarked dryly Just suppose it were practicable The Black Terror Werner continued is played by Merle Shirley You ve heard of him the greatest villain ever known to the films Then there s Marilyn Loring the vampire another good trouper too She plays Zelda old Remsen s ward and it s a question whether Zelda or Stella will be the Remsen heir Marilyn herself is an awfully nice girl but oh how the fans hate her The director chuckled No Millard story is ever complete without a vamp and Marilyn s been eating them up She s been with Manton Pictures for nearly a year You played the millionaire yourself Yes I did old Remsen I realized suddenly for the first time that Werner was still in the evening clothes he had donned for the part On his face were streaks in the little make up that remained after his frequent mopping of his features with his handkerchief Too his collar was melted I could imagine his discomfort Did you have any business with Stella Kennedy asked using the stage term for the minor bits of action in the playing of a scene Did you move at all while she was going through her part No mister Kennedy I was dead man in all the scenes Show me how you lay if you will Obligingly Werner stretched out on the carpet duplicating his positions even to the exact manner in which he had placed his hands and arms Rather to my own distaste Kennedy impressed me to represent I am sure in clumsy fashion the various positions of Stella Lamar Most painstakingly Kennedy worked back from the thirteenth scene to the first referring to the script and coaxing details of memory from the mind of Werner I grasped Kennedy s purpose almost at once He was endeavoring to reproduce the action which had been photographed so as to determine just how the poison had been administered Of course he made no reference to the tiny scratch and Mackay and I were careful to give no hint of it to Werner The director however seemed most willing to assist us I certainly felt no suspicion of him now As for Kennedy his face was unrevealing When the film in the camera is developed I suggested to Kennedy suddenly He silenced me with a gesture I haven t overlooked that but the scenes will be from one angle only and in a darkened set I can determine more this way Somewhat crestfallen I continued my impersonation of the slain star not altogether willingly Soon Kennedy had completed his reconstruction of the action Who else entered the scene besides Gordon he asked The butler and the maid after the lights were flashed on I ll question the camera men he announced Who are they Harry Watkins is the head photographer Werner explained He s a crackerjack too One of the best lighting experts in the country Al Penny s grinding the other box Let s have Watkins first Kennedy nodded to Mackay to escort the director from the room Neither Watkins nor Penny were able to add anything to the facts which Kennedy had gleaned from Manton and Werner When he had finished his patient examination of the junior camera man he recalled Watkins and had both under his eyes close and seal the film cartridges which contained the photographic record of the thirteen scenes Dismissing the men he handed the two black boxes to Mackay Can you arrange to have these developed and printed quickly but in some way so neither negative nor positive will be out of your sight at any time Mackay nodded I know the owner of a laboratory in Yonkers Good Now let s have the leading man Jack Gordon immediately impressed me very unfavorably There was something about him for which I could find no word but sleek Learning much from my long association with Kennedy I observed at once that he had removed the make up from his face and that he had on a clean white collar Since the linen worn before the camera is dyed a faint tint to prevent the halation caused by pure white it was a sure sign to me that he had spruced up a bit I knew that he was engaged to Stella Here in this room she lay dead under the most mysterious circumstances There was little question in fact that she had been murdered How could he really loving her think of such things as the make up left on his face or his clothes I had to admit that he was a handsome individual Perhaps slightly less than average in height and very slender he had the close knit build of an athlete The contour of his head and the perfect regularity of rather large features made him an ideal type for the screen at any angle in close ups and foregrounds as well as full shots In actual life there were little things covered by make up in his work such as the cold gray tint of his eyes and the lines of dissipation about his mouth Kennedy questioned him first about his movements in the different scenes then asked him if he had seen or noticed anything suspicious during the taking of any of them or in the intervals between I had several changes mister Kennedy he replied Part of the time I was Jack Daring my regular role but I was also the emissary who looked like Daring I went out each time because I make up the emissary to look hard Werner wanted to fool the people a little bit but he didn t want them to be positive the emissary was Daring as would happen if both make ups were the same Did you have any opportunity to talk to Miss Lamar None at all Werner was pushing us to the limit Did she seem her usual self at the start of the scene No she seemed a little out of sorts But Gordon hesitated something had been troubling her all day She hardly would talk to me in the car on the way out at all It didn t strike me that she acted any different when she went in to take the scene You were engaged to her Yes Gordon s eyes caught the body on the davenport before him He glanced away hastily taking his lower lip between his teeth Had you been having any trouble No that is nothing to amount to anything But you had a quarrel or a misunderstanding His face flushed slowly She was to obtain her final decree early next week I wanted her to marry me then at once She refused When I reproached her for not considering my wishes she pretended to be cool and began an elaborate flirtation with Merle Shirley You say she only pretended to be cool For a few moments Gordon hesitated Then apparently his vanity loosened his tongue He wished it to be understood that he had held the love of Stella to the last Last night he volunteered we made everything up and she was as affectionate as she ever had been This morning she was cool but I could tell it was pretense and so I let her alone There has been no real trouble between you The leading man met Kennedy s gaze squarely Not a bit Kennedy turned to Mackay mister Shirley he ordered By a miscalculation on the part of the little district attorney the heavy man entered the room a moment before Gordon left They came face to face just within the portieres There was no mistaking the hostility the open hate between the two men Both Kennedy and I caught the glances Then Merle Shirley approached the fireplace taking the chair indicated by Kennedy I wasn t in any of the opening scenes he explained I remained out in the car until I got wind of the excitement By that time Stella was dead Do you know anything of a quarrel between Miss Lamar and Gordon Shirley rose clenching his fists For several moments he stood gazing down at the star with an expression on his face which I could not analyze The pause gave me an opportunity to study him however and I noticed that while he had heavier features than Gordon and was a larger man in every way ideally endowed for heavy parts there was yet a certain boyish freshness clinging to him in subtle fashion He wore his clothes in a loose sort of way which suggested the West and the open in contrast to Gordon s metropolitan sophistication and immaculate tailoring He was every inch the man and a splendid actor I knew Yet there was the touch of youth about him He seemed incapable of a crime such as this unless it was in anger or as the result of some deep running hidden passion Now whether he was angry or in the clutch of a broad disgust I could not tell Perhaps it was both Very suddenly he wheeled upon Kennedy His voice became low and vibrant with feeling Here was none of the steeled self control of Manton the deceptive outer mask which Werner used to cover his thoughts the nonchalant cold frankness of Gordon mister Kennedy the actor exclaimed I ve been a fool a fool How do you mean I mean that I allowed Stella to flatter my vanity and lead me into a flirtation which meant nothing at all to her God You are responsible for the trouble between Miss Lamar and Gordon then Never Shirley indicated the body of the star with a quick passionate sweep of his hand Now I could not tell whether he was acting or in earnest She s responsible he exclaimed She s responsible for everything Her death No Shirley sobered suddenly as if he had forgotten the mystery altogether I don t know anything at all about that nor have I any idea unless But he checked himself rather than voice an empty suspicion Just what do you mean then Kennedy was sharp impatient She made a fool of me and and I was engaged to Marilyn Loring Were engaged The engagement Marilyn broke it off last night and wouldn t listen to me even though I came to my senses and saw what a fool I had been Was Kennedy framed his question carefully was your infatuation for Miss Lamar of long duration Just a few weeks I I took her out to dinner and to the theater and and that was all I see Kennedy walked away nodding to Mackay Will you have Miss Loring next asked the district attorney Kennedy nodded Marilyn Loring was a surprise to me Stella Lamar both on the screen and in real life was a beauty In the films Marilyn was a beauty also apparently of a cold unfeeling type but in the flesh she was disclosed as a person utterly different from all my preconceived notions In the first place she was not particularly attractive except when she smiled Her coloring hair frankly and naturally red skin slightly mottled and pale produced in photography the black hair and marble white skin which distinguished her But as I studied her as she was now before she had put on any make up and while she was still dressed in a simple summer gown of organdie she looked as though she might have stepped into the room from the main street of some mid Western town In repose she was shy diffident in appearance When she smiled naturally without holding the hard lines of her vampire roles there was the slight suggestion of a dimple and she was essentially girlish When a trace of emotion or feeling came into her face the woman was evident She might have been seventeen or thirty seven To my surprise Kennedy made no effort to elicit further information concerning the personal animosities of these people Perhaps he felt it too much of an emotional maze to be straightened out in this preliminary investigation When he found Marilyn had watched the taking of the scenes he compared her account with those which he had already obtained Then he dismissed her In rapid succession for he was impatient now to follow up other methods of investigation he called in and examined the remaining possible witnesses of the tragedy These were the two extra players the butler and the maid the assistant director Phelps s house servants and Emery Phelps himself For some unknown reason he left the owner of the house to the very last Why did you wish these scenes photographed out here he asked Because I wanted to see my library in pictures Were you watching the taking of the scenes Yes Will you describe just what happened Phelps flushed He was irritated and in no mood to humor us any more than necessary A man of perhaps forty with the portly flabbiness which often accompanies success in the financial markets he was accustomed to obtaining rather than yielding obedience A bachelor he had built this house as a show place merely according to the gossip among newspaper men seldom living in it Haven t about a dozen people described it for you already he asked distinctly petulant Kennedy smiled Did you notice anything particularly out of the way anything which might be a clue to the manner in which Miss Lamar met her death Phelps s attitude became frankly malicious If I had or if any of us had we wouldn t have found it necessary to send for Prof Craig Kennedy or turning to me the representative of the New York Star Kennedy undisturbed walked to the side of Mackay I ll leave mister Phelps and his house in your care he remarked in a low voice Mackay grinned I saw that the district attorney had little love for the owner of this particular estate in Tarrytown Kennedy led the way into the living room Immediately the various people he had questioned clustered up with varying degrees of anxiety Had the mystery been solved He gave them no satisfaction but singled out Manton who seemed eager to get away Where is Millard I would like to talk to him I ll try to get him for you Suppose Manton looked at his watch I should be in at the studio he explained Everything is at a standstill probably and and so suppose you and mister Jameson ride in with me in my car Millard might be there Kennedy brightened Good Then he looked back to catch the eye of Mackay Let everyone go now he directed Don t forget to send me the samples of the body fluids and as an afterthought you d better keep a watch on the house VI THE FIRST CLUE Manton s car was a high powered expensive limousine fitted inside with every luxury of which the mind of even a prima donna could conceive painted a vivid yellow that must have made it an object of attention even on its familiar routes It was quite characteristic of its owner for Manton as we learned missed no chance to advertise himself 
2437-155505-0000	train-other-500	In the back with us was Werner while the rest of the company were left to return to the city in the two studio cars which had brought them out in the morning The director however seemed buried with his reflections He took no part in the conversation paid no attention to us upon the entire trip
2437-155505-0001	train-other-500	Manton s mind seemed to dwell rather upon the problems brought up by the death of Stella than upon the tragedy itself The Star s photoplay editor once had remarked to me that the promoter was ninety per cent bull and ten per cent efficiency I found that it was an unfair estimation
none	none	 With all his self advertisement and almost obnoxious personality 
2437-155505-0002	train-other-500	Manton was a more than capable executive in a business where efficiency and method are rare This has been a hoodoo picture from the start he exclaimed suddenly We have been jinxed with a vengeance Some one has held the Indian sign on us for sure
none	none	 Kennedy I noticed listened studying the man cautiously from the corners of his eyes but making no effort to draw him out 
2437-155505-0003	train-other-500	First there were changes to be made in the script and for those Millard took his own sweet time Then we were handed a lot of negative which had been fogged in the perforator a thing that doesn t happen once in a thousand years But it caught us just as we sent the company down to Delaware Water Gap
2437-155505-0004	train-other-500	A whole ten days work went into the developer at once Neither of the camera men caught the fog in their tests because it came in the middle of the rolls
none	none	 Everything had to be done over again 
2437-155505-0005	train-other-500	And accidents We carefully registered the principal accomplice of the Black Terror a little hunchback with a face to send chills down your back After we had him in about half the scenes of a sequence of action he was taken sick and died of influenza
2437-155505-0006	train-other-500	First we waited a few days then we had to take all that stuff over again Our payroll on this picture is staggering Stella s three thousand a week is cheap for her the old contract but it s a lot of money to throw away
2437-155505-0007	train-other-500	Two weeks when she was under the weather cost us six thousand dollars salary and there was half a week we couldn t do any work without her Gordon and Shirley and Marilyn Loring draw down seventeen hundred a week between them The director s salary is only two hundred short of that
none	none	 All told The Black Terror is costing us a hundred thousand dollars over our original estimate 
2437-155505-0008	train-other-500	And now it seemed to me that Manton literally groaned with Stella Lamar dead excuse me looking at it this way but after all it is business and I m the executive at the head of the company
none	none	 now we must find a new star 
2437-155505-0009	train-other-500	Lord knows where and we must retake every scene in which Stella appeared It it s enough to bankrupt Manton Pictures for once and all Can t you change the story about some way so you won t lose the value of her work asked Kennedy
none	none	 Impossible We ve announced the release and we ve got to go ahead 
2437-155505-0010	train-other-500	Fortunately some of the biggest sets are not taken yet The car pulled up with a flourish before the Manton studio which was an immense affair of reinforced concrete in the upper Bronx Then in response to our horn a great wide double door swung open
2437-155505-0011	train-other-500	admitting us through the building to a large courtyard around which the various departments were built Here there was little indication that the principal star of the company had just met her death under mysterious and suspicious circumstances
2437-155505-0012	train-other-500	Perhaps had I been familiar with the ordinary bustle of the establishment I might have detected a difference
none	none	 Indeed it did strike me that there were little knots of people here and there discussing the tragedy 
2437-155505-0013	train-other-500	but everything was overshadowed by the aquatic scene being filmed in the courtyard
none	none	 for some other Manton picture The cramped space about the concrete tank was alive with people 
2437-155505-0014	train-other-500	a mob of extras and stage hands and various employees a sight which held Kennedy and me for some little time I was glad when Manton led the way through a long hall to the comparative quiet of the office building In the reception room there was a decided hush
2437-155505-0015	train-other-500	Is Millard here he asked of the boy seated at the information desk No sir was the respectful reply He was here this morning and for a while yesterday You see Manton confronted Kennedy grimly This is only one of the things with which we have to contend in this business
2437-155505-0016	train-other-500	I give Millard an office but he s a law unto himself It s the artistic temperament If I interfere then he says he cannot write and he doesn t produce any manuscript Ordinarily he cannot be bothered to work at the studio But philosophically
2437-155505-0017	train-other-500	I know where to get him as a general thing He does most of his writing in his rooms downtown says there s more inspiration in the confusion of Broadway than in the wilds of the Bronx I ll phone him We followed the promoter up the stairs to the second and top floor
none	none	 Here a corridor gave access to the various executive offices 
2437-155505-0018	train-other-500	Its windows at frequent intervals looked down upon the courtyard and the present confusion Werner who had preceded us into the building now came up As Manton bustled into his own office to use the telephone the director turned to Kennedy indicating the next doorway
2437-155505-0019	train-other-500	This is my place he explained It connects with Manton on one side through his reception room You see in addition to directing Stella Lamar I have been in general charge of production and most of the casting is up to me Kennedy entered after Werner interested and I followed
2437-155505-0020	train-other-500	The door through to the reception room stood open and beyond was the one to Manton s quarters I could see the promoter at his desk receiver at his ear an impatient expression upon his face In the reception room a rather pretty girl young and of a shallow pated type I thought
2437-155505-0021	train-other-500	was busy at a clattering typewriter She rose and closed the door upon Manton so as not to disturb him The next office on this side is Millard s volunteered Werner He s the only scenario writer dignified with quarters in this building
2437-155505-0022	train-other-500	Manton has other writers hasn t he Kennedy asked Yes the scenario department is on the third floor across the court above the laboratory and cutting rooms Who else is in the building here There are six rooms on this floor Werner replied
2437-155505-0023	train-other-500	Manton the waiting room myself Millard and the two other directors Below is the general reception room the cashier the bookkeepers and stenographers As Manton probably was having trouble obtaining his connection
none	none	 and as Kennedy continued to question Werner concerning the general arrangement of the different floors in the different buildings about the quadrangle 
2437-155505-0024	train-other-500	all uninteresting to me I determined to look about a bit on my own hook
none	none	 I was still anxious to be of genuine assistance to Kennedy for once 
2437-155505-0025	train-other-500	through my greater knowledge of the film world Strolling out into the corridor I went to the door of Millard s room To my disappointment it was locked
none	none	 Continuing down the hall I stole a glance into each of the two directors quarters 
2437-155505-0026	train-other-500	but saw nothing to awaken my suspicion or justify my intrusion Beyond I discovered a washroom and aware suddenly of the immense amount of dust I had acquired in the ride in from Tarrytown I entered to freshen my hands
none	none	 and face at the least It was a stroke of luck a fortunate impulse The amount of money to be made in the movies had resulted in the case of Manton 
2437-155505-0027	train-other-500	in luxurious equipment for all the various departments of his establishment I had noticed the offices furnished with a richness worthy of a bank or some great downtown institution Now in the lavatory immaculate with its white tile and modern appointments
2437-155505-0028	train-other-500	I saw a shelf literally stacked in this day of paper with linen towels of the finest quality As I drew the water hot instantly my eye caught half in and half out of the wire basket beneath the stand one of the towels covered with peculiar yellow spots
2437-155505-0029	train-other-500	Immediately my suspicions were awakened I picked it up gingerly At close range I saw that the spots were only chrome yellow make up but there were also spots of a different nature
2437-155505-0030	train-other-500	I did not stop to think of the unlikeliness of the discovery of a real clue under these circumstances analyzed afterward by Kennedy I folded the towel hastily and hurried to rejoin him to show it to him I found him with Werner
none	none	 waiting for the results of Manton s efforts to locate Millard 
2437-155505-0031	train-other-500	Almost at the moment I rejoined the two a boy came to summon Werner to one of the sets out on the stage itself Kennedy and I were alone I showed him the towel At first he laughed You ll never make a detective Walter he remarked
2437-155505-0032	train-other-500	This is only simple coloring matter Chinese yellow to be exact And will you tell me too he became ironical how do you expect to find clues of this sort here for a murder committed in Tarrytown when all the people present were held out there and examined when we are the first to arrive back here
2437-155505-0033	train-other-500	Yellow you know photographs white Chinese yellow is used largely in studios in place of white in make up because it does not cause halation which to the picture people is the bane of their existence White is too glaring reflects rays that blur the photography sometimes
2437-155505-0034	train-other-500	If you will notice the next time you see them shooting a scene you will find the actors faces tinged with yellow Even tablecloths and napkins and white dresses are frequently colored a pale yellow
none	none	 although pale blue has the actinic qualities of white for this purpose 
2437-155505-0035	train-other-500	and is now perhaps more frequently used than yellow I was properly chastened In fact though I did not say much I almost determined to let him conduct his case himself Kennedy saw my crestfallen expression and understood
none	none	 He was about to say something encouraging as he handed back the towel 
2437-155505-0036	train-other-500	when his eye fell on the other end of it which indeed I myself had noticed He sobered instantly and studied the other spots Indeed I had not examined them closely myself They were the very faint stains of some other yellow substance
2437-155505-0037	train-other-500	a liquid which had dried and did not rub off as the make up and there were also some small round drops of dark red almost hidden in the fancy red scrollwork of the lettering on the towel
none	none	 Manton Pictures Inc 
2437-155505-0038	train-other-500	The latter had escaped me altogether Blood Kennedy exclaimed Then Look here The marks of the pale yellow liquid trailed into a slender trace of blood It looks as if some one had cleaned a needle on it he muttered
none	none	 and in a hurry I remembered his previous remark 
2437-155505-0039	train-other-500	The murder had been in Tarrytown We had just arrived here Would anyone have time to do it I asked Whoever used the towel did so in a hurry he reiterated seriously
none	none	 It may have been some one afraid to leave any sort of clue out there at Phelps s house 
2437-155505-0040	train-other-500	There were too many watchers about It might have seemed better to have run the risk of a search With no sign of a wound on Miss Lamar s person it was pretty certain that neither Mackay nor I would attempt to frisk everyone It was not as though we were looking for a revolver if she were shot
2437-155505-0041	train-other-500	or a knife if she had been stabbed And he could not resist another dig at me
none	none	 and that we should look in a washroom here for a towel was well an idea that wouldn t occur to anyone but the most amateur and blundering sort of sleuth 
2437-155505-0042	train-other-500	It s beginner s luck Walter beginner s luck I ignored the uncomplimentary part of his remarks Who could have been in the washroom just before me I asked Suddenly he hurried through the waiting room to the door to Manton s office opening it without ceremony Manton was gone
none	none	 We exchanged glances I remembered that Werner had preceded us upstairs 
2437-155505-0043	train-other-500	It means Werner or Manton himself I whispered so the girl just behind us would not hear Kennedy strode out to the hall and to a window overlooking the court After a moment he pointed I recognized both the cars used to transport the company to the home of Emery Phelps
2437-155505-0044	train-other-500	There was no sign that either had just arrived for even the chauffeurs were out of sight perhaps melted into the crowd about the tank in the corner They must have arrived immediately behind us Kennedy remarked We wasted several valuable minutes looking at that water stuff ourselves
2437-155505-0045	train-other-500	At that moment Werner s voice rose from the reception room below
none	none	 It was probable that he would be up to rejoin us again I remembered that he had not been at all at ease while Kennedy questioned him in Tarrytown that here at the studio he had been palpably anxious to remain close at our heels 
2437-155505-0046	train-other-500	I felt a surge of suspicion within me Listen Craig I muttered in low tones Manton had no opportunity to steal down the hall after the girl closed the door and Why not he interrupted contradicting me We had our backs to the door while we were talking with Werner
none	none	 Well anyhow it narrows down to Manton and Werner because that is the washroom for these offices 
2437-155505-0047	train-other-500	Sh Kennedy stopped me as Werner mounted the stairs He turned to the director with assumed nonchalance How long have the other cars been here he asked I thought we came pretty fast Werner smiled I guess those boys had enough of Tarrytown
2437-155505-0048	train-other-500	They rolled into the yard both of them while you and mister Jameson and Manton were stopping to watch the people in the water I see Kennedy gave me a side glance Where are the dressing rooms he inquired It was a random shot Werner pointed to the end of the hall toward the washroom
none	none	 In the next building on this floor that is the principals It s a rotten arrangement he added They come through sometimes and use our lavatory because it s a little more fancy and because it saves a trip down a flight of stairs Believe me it gets old Manton on his ear VII ENID FAYE Behind Werner was the assistant director to whom I had given little attention at the time of the examination of the various people in the Phelps library Even now he impressed me as one of those rare unobtrusive types of individuals who seem in spite of the possession of genuine ability and often a great deal of efficiency to lack nevertheless any outstanding personal characteristics As a class they are human machines to be neither liked nor disliked never intruding and yet always on hand when needed This is Carey Drexel my assistant Werner stated forgetting that Kennedy had questioned him at Tarrytown and so knew him There are a few people I simply must see and I m tied up therefore for perhaps half an hour and Manton s downstairs still trying to locate Millard for you But Carey s at your disposal mister Kennedy to show you the arrangement of the studio and to cooperate with you in any way if you think there s any possible chance of finding anything to bear upon Stella s death here If Werner was the man who had used the towel I could see that he was an actor and a cool villain Of course no one could know yet that we had discovered it but the very nonchalance with which it had been thrown into the basket was a mark of the nerve of the guilty man It was more than carelessness Nothing about the crime had been haphazard Kennedy thanked Werner and asked to be shown the studio floor used in the making of The Black Terror Carey led the way explaining that there were actually two studios one at each end of the quadrangle connected on both sides by the other buildings offices and dressing rooms and the costume and property departments at the side facing the street technical laboratories and all the detail of film manufacture in a four story structure to the rear Most of Werner s own picture was being made in the so called big studio reached through the dressing rooms from the end of the corridor where we stood I had been in film plants before but when we entered the huge glass roofed inclosure beyond the long hallway of dressing rooms I was impressed by the fact that here was a place of genuine magnitude with more life and bustle than anything I had ever imagined The glass had however been painted over because of late years dark stages with the even quality of artificial light had come into vogue in the Manton studios in place of stages lighted by the uneven and undependable sunlight The two big sets mentioned by Manton a banquet hall and a ballroom were being erected simultaneously Carpenters were at work sawing and hammering Werner s technical director was shouting at a group of stage hands putting a massive mirror in position at the end of the banquet hall a clever device to give the room the appearance of at least double its actual length In one corner several electricians and a camera man were experimenting with a strange looking bank of lights In the ballroom set where the flats or walls were all in place an unexcited paperhanger was busy with the paraphernalia of his craft somehow looking out of his element in this reign of pandemonium It seemed hard indeed to believe that any sort of order or system lay behind this heterogeneous activity and the incident which took Carey Drexel away from us only added to the wonder in my mind a wonder that anything tangible and definite could be accomplished Oh Carey Another assistant director or perhaps he was only a property boy rushed up frantically the moment he saw Drexel Miss Miller s on a rampage because the grand piano you promised to get for her isn t at her apartment yet and Bessie Terry s in tears because she left her parrot here overnight as you suggested and some one taught the bird to swear The intruder a youth of perhaps eighteen was in deadly earnest For the love of Mike Carey he went on tell me how to unteach that screeching thing of Bessie s or we won t get a scene today Carey Drexel looked at Kennedy helplessly With all these troubles how could he pilot us about Later we learned that this was nothing new once one gets on the inside of picture making Props or properties particularly the living ones cause almost as much disturbance as the temperamental notions of the actors and actresses Sometimes it is a question which may become the most ridiculous Kennedy seemed to be satisfied with his preliminary visit to this studio floor We can get back to Manton s office alone he told Drexel We will just keep on circling the quadrangle Relieved the assistant director pointed to the door of the manufacturing building as the four story structure in the rear was called Then he bustled off with the other youth quite unruffled himself When we passed through the heavy steel fire door we found ourselves in another long hallway of fire brick and reinforced concrete construction Unquestionably there was no danger of a serious conflagration in any part of Manton s plant despite the high inflammability of the film itself of the flimsy stage sets of practically everything used in picture manufacture Immediately we entered this building I detected a peculiar odor at which I sniffed eagerly I was reminded of the burnt almond odor of the cyanides Was this another clue I turned to Kennedy but he smiled anticipating me Banana oil Walter he explained with rather a superior manner I imagine it s used a great deal in this industry Anyway a chuckle don t expect chance to deliver clues to you in wholesale quantities You have done very well for today A sudden whirring noise from an open door down the hall attracted us and we paused This I guessed was a cutting room There were a number of steel tables with high steel chairs At the walls were cabinets of the same material Each table had two winding arrangements a handle at the operator s right hand and one at his left so that he could wind or unwind film from one reel to another passing it forward or backward in front of his eyes There were girls at the tables except nearest the hall Here a man stopped now and then to glance at the ribbon of film or to cut out a section dropping the discarded piece into a fireproof can and splicing the two ends of the main strip together again with liquid film cement from a small bottle He looked up as he sensed our presence Isn t it hell he remarked in friendly fashion I ve got to cut all of Stella Lamar out of The Black Terror so they can duplicate her scenes with another star and meanwhile we had half the negative matched and marked for colors and spliced in rolls all ready for the printer Without waiting for an answer from us or expecting one he gave one of his reels a vicious spin producing the whirring noise then grasping both reels between his fingers and bringing them to an abrupt stop so that I wondered he did not burn himself from the friction he located the next piece to be eliminated We followed the hall into the smaller studio and there found a comedy company at work Without stopping to watch the players ghastly under the light from the Cooper Hewitts and Kliegel arcs we found a precarious way back of the set around and under stage braces to the covered bridge leading once more to the corridor outside Manton s office Now the girl was absent from her place in the little waiting room Manton s door stood open Without ceremony Kennedy led the way in and dropped down at the side of the promoter s huge mahogany desk I m tired Walter he said Furthermore I think this picture world of yours is a bedlam We face a hard task How do you propose to go about things I asked I m afraid this is a case which will have to be approached entirely through psychological reactions You and I will have to become familiar with the studio and home life of all the long list of possible suspects I shall analyze the body fluids of the deceased and learn the cause of death and I will find out what it is on the towel but sighing there are so many different ramifications so many Suddenly his eye caught the corner of a piece of paper slid under the glass of Manton s desk He pulled it out then handed it to me MEMORANDUM FOR mister MANTON Have learned Enid Faye is out of Pentangle and can be engaged for about twelve hundred if you act quickly Why not cancel Lamar contract after Black Terror if she continues up stage WERNER I caught the name Lamar Kennedy explained Then an expression of gratification crept into his face Miss Lamar was up stage he mused That s a theatrical word for cussedness isn t it I paid little attention The name of Enid Faye had attracted my own interest This was the little dare devil who had breezed into the Pacific Coast film colony and had swept everything before her Not only had she displayed amazing nerve for her sex and size but she had been pretty and beautifully formed had been as much at home in a ballroom as in an Annette Kellermann bathing suit In less than six months she had learned to act and had been brought to the Eastern studios of Pentangle Now it was possible that she would be captured by Manton would be blazoned all over the country by that gentleman would become another star of his making Let s go Walter Kennedy impatient rose I noticed that he folded the little note slipping it into his pocket Out in the hall voices came to us from Werner s office After some little hesitation Kennedy opened the door unceremoniously At the table littered with blue prints and drawings and colored plates of famous home interiors was the director With him was Manton Seated facing them in rare good humor was a fascinating little lady The promoter rose Professor Kennedy I want you to meet Miss Enid Faye one of our real comers And mister Jameson Enid of the New York Star She acknowledged the introduction to Kennedy gracefully Then she turned rising and rushed to me most effusively leading me to a leather covered couch and pulling me to a seat beside her mister Jameson she purred I just love newspaper men I think they re perfectly wonderful always Tell me do you like little Enid I nodded confused and unhappy and as red as a schoolboy That s fine she went on in the best modulated and most wonderful voice I thought I had ever heard I like you and I know we re going to be the best of friends Tell me what s your first name Now Enid reproved Manton in fatherly tones you ll have plenty of time to vamp your publicity later For the present please listen to me We re talking business Shoot every hair of this old gray head she directed pertly She did not move away however I could feel the warmth of her could catch the delicacy of the perfume she used I noted the play of her slender fingers the trimness of her ankle the piquancy of a nose revealed to me in profile and nothing else This is your chance Enid Manton continued earnestly and rather eagerly You know the film will be the most talked about one this year We ve got the Merritt papers lined up and that s the best advertising in the world Everyone will know you took Stella s place and well you ll step right in She studied the tips of her boots stretching boyish limbs straight in front of her then smoothing the soft folds of her skirt Talk money to me mister Man she exclaimed Talk the shekels the golden shekels We re broke he protested A thousand She shook her head Werner broke in suddenly anxious Don t pass up the chance Enid he pleaded What can Pentangle do for you And I ve always wanted to direct you again I ll make it twelve hundred Manton interrupted if you ll make the contract personally with me Then if Manton Pictures All right She jumped to her feet extending a hand straight forward to each the right to Manton the left to Werner You re on I thought that I was forgotten A wave of jealousy swept over me After all she simply wanted me to write her up In a daze I heard Manton You re a wise little girl Enid he told her Play the game right with me and you ll climb high The sky s the limit now I ll make you make you big With a full warm smile she swung around to me and I knew I was not being slighted after all That s what Longfellow said isn t it mister Jameson What My heart began to beat like a trip hammer Excelsior Excelsior It packs them in She laughed so infectiously that we all joined in Then Manton turned to Kennedy I ve located Millard for you He s to meet us at my apartment at seven It s six thirty now And you Enid facing her if you ll come too there s another man I want you to meet and Larry of course will be there Enid studied Kennedy He was hesitating as though not sure whether to accompany Manton or not I never did learn what other course of action had occurred to him But I did notice that the little star with her pert upturned face seemed more anxious to have Kennedy go along than she was to meet the mysterious individual mentioned without name by Manton For an instant she was on the point of addressing him flippantly no doubt Then I think she was rather awed at Craig s reputation All at once she shrugged her shoulders and turned to me plucking my sleeve her expression brightening irresistibly You ll come too dimpling Jamie VIII LAWRENCE MILLARD It struck me on the trip to Manton s apartment that the film people were wholly unfeeling were even uninterested in the death of Stella Lamar except where it interfered with their business arrangements Werner excused himself and did not accompany us on the score of the complete realignment of production necessary to place Enid in Stella s part It seemed to me that he felt a certain relish in the problem that he was almost glad of the circumstances which brought Enid to him His last words to Manton were to be sure to have Millard recast the action of the scenes wherever possible so as to give Enid the better chance to display her own personality I marveled as I realized that the remains of Stella Lamar were scarcely cold before these people were figuring on the star to take her place As Manton talked the thought crossed my mind that such a man needed no publicity manager I dismissed the idea that he might be capable even of murder for publicity But at least it was an insight into some methods of the game As our car mounted to the Concourse and turned Manhattanward I was distinctly unhappy Manton monopolized Enid completely insisting upon talking over everything under the sun from the wardrobe she would need in Stella s part and the best sort of personal advertising campaign for her to the first available evening when she could go to dinner with him She sat in the rear seat between Kennedy and the promoter which did not add to my sense of comfort The only consoling feature from my viewpoint was that I was admirably placed to study her and that Manton held her so engrossed that I had every opportunity to do so unnoticed Because she had overwhelmed me so completely I did nothing of the kind I knew we were riding with the most beautiful woman in New York but I did not know the color of her hair or eyes or even the sort of hat or dress she wore In short I was movie struck We stopped at last at a huge ornate apartment house on Riverside Drive and Manton led the way through the wide Renaissance entrance and the luxurious marble hall to the elevator His quarters on the top floor facing the river were almost exotic in the lavishness and barbaric splendor of their furnishings My first impression as we entered the place was that Manton had purposely planned the dim lights of rich amber and the clinging Oriental fragrance hovering about everything so as to produce an alluring and enticing atmosphere The chairs and wide upholstered window seats the soft yielding divans in at least two corners with their miniature mountains of tiny pillows all were comfortable with the comfort one associates with lotus eating and that homeward journey soon to be forgotten There was the smoke of incense unmistakably On a taboret were cigarettes and cigars and through heavy curtains I caught a glimpse of a sideboard and decanters filled and set out very frankly A Japanese butler whom Manton called Huroki took our hats and retreated with a certain emanating effluvium of subtlety such as I had known only once before when the Oriental attendant left me on the occasion of my only visit to an opium den in Chinatown A moment later Millard who had been waiting rose to greet us I would have guessed him to be an author I believe had I met him at random anywhere in the city He affected all the professional marks and mannerisms and yet he did so gracefully I noticed in the little hall where Huroki placed our headgear a single jointed Malacca stick a dark colored and soft brimmed felt hat and a battered brief case That was Millard unquestionably The man himself was tall and loose limbed heavy with an appearance of slenderness His face was handsome rather intellectual in spite of rather than because of large horn rimmed glasses His mouth and chin showed strength and determination which was a surprise to me In fact in no way did he seem to reveal the artist Lawrence Millard was a commercial writer a dreamer never First he greeted Enid taking both of her hands in his In this one brief moment all my own little romance went glimmering for I could not blind myself to the softening of his expression the welcoming light in hers the long interval in which their fingers remained interlaced And then another thought came to me hastened fed and fattened upon my jealousy The sealed testimony in the case of Millard vs Millard Could Enid by any chance be concerned in that The next moment I dismissed the thought or at least I thought I did so I tried to picture Enid s work on the Coast to remember the short time she had been in the East It was possible Millard had known her before she went to Los Angeles but unlikely Millard next turned to Kennedy I just learned of the tragedy a short while ago Professor he exclaimed It is terrible and so amazingly sudden too It it has upset me completely Tell me have you found anything Have you discovered any possible clue Is there anything at all I can do to help I would like to ask a few questions Kennedy explained By all means He extended a hand to me and I found it damp and flabby as though he were more concerned than his manner betrayed He faced Kennedy again however immediately Stella and I didn t make a go of our married life at all he went on frankly enough I was very sorry too because I was genuinely fond of her How recently have you seen her Stella Not for over a month perhaps longer than that Manton took Enid by the arm It was evidently her first visit to the apartment and he was anxious to show her his various treasures Millard Kennedy and I found a corner affording a view out over the Hudson After Kennedy had described briefly the circumstances of Stella s death at Millard s insistence he produced the note he had found in her handbag The author recognized it at once without reading it Yes I wrote that Then just a trace of emotion crept into his voice I was too late he murmured What was it you wanted to say Kennedy inquired Millard s glance traveled to Manton and Enid a troubled something in his expression I could see that the promoter was making the most of his tete a tete with the girl but she seemed perfectly at ease and quite capable of handling the man and I certainly was more disturbed at the interest of Millard I thought there was something about the business I ought to tell Stella he answered finally Manton Pictures is pretty shaky Oh Then Manton wasn t talking for effect when he told Miss Faye that the company was broke No indeed In fact didn t Enid make her agreement with Manton personally That s what I advised her to do Kennedy nodded But is Manton himself financially sound Millard laughed Lloyd Manton always has a dozen things up his sleeve He may have a million or he may owe a million In the author s voice was no respect for his employer A touch of malice crept into his tone Manton will make money for anyone who can make money for him he added that is provided he has to do it Kennedy and I exchanged glances This was close to an assertion of downright dishonesty At that moment Huroki stole in on padded feet as noiseless as a wraith Yes Huroki His master turned inquiringly mister Leigh was the butler s announcement Show him in said Manton then he hurried over to us Courtlandt Leigh the banker you know I imagine I showed my surprise for Kennedy smiled as he caught my face Leigh was a bigger man than Phelps of the highest standing in downtown financial circles If Manton had interested Courtlandt Leigh in moving pictures he was a wizard indeed It seemed to me that the banker was hardly in the apartment before he saw Enid and from that moment the girl engrossed him to the exclusion of everything else For Enid I will say that she was a wonder She seemed to grasp the man s instant infatuation and immediately she set about to complete the conquest all without permitting him so much as to touch her You ll excuse us remarked Manton easily as he drew Phelps and Enid away See exclaimed Millard in a low voice frowning now as he watched the girl Manton s clever I ve never known him unable to raise money and that s why I wanted Enid to have her contract with him personally If Manton Pictures blows up he d put her in some other company He has more than one This seemed to puzzle Kennedy He s been interested in any number on the side Millard explained Now he s formed another but it s a secret so far You ve heard of Fortune Features perhaps Kennedy looked at me but I shook my head What is Fortune Features Kennedy asked the question of Millard Just another company in which Manton has an interest he replied casually That was why I said I advised that Enid make her contract personally with Manton If Manton Pictures goes up then he will have to swing her into Fortune Features the other Manton enterprise don t you see He paused then added By the way don t say anything outside about that It isn t generally known and as soon as anyone does hear it everybody in the film game will hear it You don t know how gossip travels in this business Kennedy asked a few personal questions about Stella but Millard s answers indicated that he had not contemplated or even hoped for a reconciliation that his interest in his former wife had become thoroughly platonic Just now however he seemed unable to keep Manton out of his mind Oh Manton s clever he said confidentially to Kennedy as he watched the promoter deftly maneuvering Leigh and Enid into a position side by side And indeed as Millard talked I began to get some inkling of how really clever was the game which Manton played Why continued Millard warming up to his story for to him above all a good story was something that had to be told whatever might result from it I have known him to pay a visit some afternoon to Wall Street go down there to beard the old lions in their den He always used to show up about the closing time of the market I ve known him to get into the office of some one like Leigh or Phelps Then he ll begin to talk about his brilliant prospects in the company he happens to be promoting at the time If you listen to Manton you re lost I know it I ve listened he added whimsically Well he continued the banker will begin to get restless after a bit not at Manton but at not getting away My car is outside Manton will say Let me drive you uptown Of course there s nothing else for the banker to do but to accept and when he gets into Manton s car he s glad he did I don t know anyone who picks out such luxurious things as he does Why that man could walk right out along Automobile Row broke and some one would GIVE him a car How does he do it I put the question to him How does a fish swim said Millard smiling He s clever I tell you Once he has the banker in the car perhaps they stop for a few moments at a club At any rate Manton usually contrives it so that as they approach his apartment he has his talk all worked up to the point where the banker is genuinely interested You know there s almost nothing people will talk to you longer about than moving pictures Well on one pretext or another Manton usually persuades the banker to step up here for a moment Poor simp It s all over with him then I ll never forget how impressed Phelps was with this place the first time There now watch this fellow Leigh He thinks this looks like a million dollars We re all here playing Manton s game We re his menagerie he s Barnum I tell you Leigh s lost lost I did not know quite what to make of Millard s cynicism Was he trying to be witty at Manton s expense I noticed that he did not smile himself Although he was talking to us his attention was not really on us He was still watching Enid Then along would happen Stella as if by chance Millard paused bitterly as though he did not quite relish the telling it but felt that Kennedy would pry it out of him or some one else finally and he might as well have it over with frankly Yes he said thoughtfully but it all wasn t really Manton s fault after all Stella liked the Bohemian sort of life too much and Manton does the Bohemian up here wonderfully It was too much for Stella Then when Phelps came along and was roped in she fell for him It was good by poor Millard I wasn t rapid enough for that crowd I almost began to sympathize with Millard in the association into which for his living s sake his art had forced him I realized too that really the banker the wise one from Wall Street was the sucker Indeed as Millard told it I could easily account for the temptation of Stella To a degree I suppose it was really her fault for she ought to have known the game shown more sense than to be taken in by the thing I wondered at the continued relations of Millard with Manton under the circumstances However I reflected if Stella had chosen to play the little fool why should Millard have allowed that to ruin his own chances What interested me now was that Millard did not seem to relish the attentions which the banker was paying to Enid Was Manton framing up the same sort of game again on Leigh However when Enid shot a quick glance at Millard in an aside of the conversation accompanied by a merry wink I saw that Millard though still doubtful was much more at ease Evidently there was a tacit understanding between the two Kennedy glanced over at me Bit by bit the checkered history of Stella Lamar s life was coming to light I began to see more clearly Deserting Millard and fascinated by Manton and his game she had been used to interest Phelps in the company In turn she had been dazzled by the glitter of the Phelps gold She had not proved loyal even to the producer and promoter Perhaps I reflected that was why Millard was so apparently complacent One could not under the circumstances have expected him to display wild emotion His attitude had been that of one who thought She almost broke me let her break some one else That however was not his attitude toward Enid now Indeed he seemed genuinely concerned that she should not follow in the same steps Later I learned that was not all of the history of Stella Fifteen hundred dollars a week of her own money besides lavish presents had been too much for her Even Phelps s money had had no over burdening attraction for her The world at least that part of it which spends money on Broadway had been open to her Jack Daring had charmed her for a while hence the engagement Of Shirley I did not even know Perhaps the masterful crime roles he played might have promised some new thrill with the possibility that they expressed something latent in his life At any rate she had dilettanted about him to the amazement and dismay of Marilyn That we knew The dinner hour was approaching and in spite of the urgent invitation of Manton Leigh was forced to excuse himself to keep a previous appointment I felt though that he would have broken it if only Enid had added her urging But she did not much to the relief of Millard Manton took it in good part Perhaps he was wise enough to reflect that many other afternoons were in the lap of the future What is Manton up to Kennedy spoke to Millard Is it off with the old and on with the new Is Phelps to be cast aside like a squeezed out lemon and Leigh taken on for a new citrus fruit Millard smiled He said nothing but the knowing glance was confirmation enough that in his opinion Kennedy had expressed the state of affairs correctly Millard hastened to the side of Enid at once and we learned then that they had a theater engagement together and that Millard had the tickets in his pocket Once more I realized it was no new or recent acquaintanceship between these two Again I wondered what woman had been named in Stella Lamar s divorce suit and again dismissed the thought that it could be Enid Kennedy took his hat and handed me mine We must eat Walter as well as the rest of them he remarked when Manton led the way to the door I was loath to leave and I suppose I showed it The truth was that little Enid Faye had captivated me It was hard to tear myself away In the entrance I hesitated wondering whether I should say good by to her She seemed engrossed with Millard A second time she took me clean off my feet While I stood there foolishly she left Millard and rushed up extending her little hand and allowing it to rest for a moment clasped in mine We didn t have a single opportunity to get acquainted mister Jameson she complained real regret in the soft cadences of her voice Won t you phone me sometime My name s in the book or I ll be at the studio I was tongue tied My glance shifting from hers because I was suddenly afraid of myself encountered the gaze of Millard from behind Now I detected the unmistakable fire of jealousy in the eyes of the author I presume I was never built to be a heavy lover Up and down my spine went a shiver of fear I dropped Enid s hand and turned away abruptly IX WHITE LIGHT SHADOWS What do you think of it I asked Kennedy when we were half through our meal at a tiny restaurant on upper Broadway

none	none	 Yes and almost any one on Mackay s list of nine suspects could have placed it in that washroom 
2488-155508-0001	train-other-500	Well I was determined to draw him out My own impressions I must confess were gloriously muddled Manton heads the list I suggested Everyone says she was mixed up with him
2488-155508-0002	train-other-500	Manton may have philandered with her undoubtedly he takes a personal interest in all his stars Kennedy I saw remembered the promoter s close attentions to Enid Faye
2488-155508-0003	train-other-500	Nevertheless Walter he is first and foremost and all the time the man of business His heart is in his dollars and Millard even suggests that he is none too scrupulous
2488-155508-0004	train-other-500	If he had an affair with Stella I rejoined and she became up stage the note you found suggested trouble you know then Manton in a burst of passion No Kennedy stopped me
2488-155508-0005	train-other-500	Don t forget that this was a cold blooded calculated crime I m not eliminating Manton yet but until we find some tangible evidence of trouble between Stella and himself we can hardly assume he would kill the girl
none	none	 who s made him perhaps a million dollars Every motive in Manton s case is a motive against the crime That eliminates Phelps then too He nearly owned the company Yes unless something happened to outweigh financial considerations in his mind also But good heavens Kennedy I protested If you go on that way you ll not eliminate anyone I can t yet he explained patiently It s just as I said 
2488-155508-0006	train-other-500	We re fishing in the dark absolutely So far we haven t a single basic fact on which to build any structure of hypothesis We must go on fishing I expect you to dig up all the facts about these people
2488-155508-0007	train-other-500	every odd bit of gossip or rumor or anything else I ll bring my science to play but there s nothing I can do except analyze Stella s stomach contents and the spots on the towel that is
2488-155508-0008	train-other-500	until we ve got a much more tangible lead than any which have developed so far Is there anything I can do to night
none	none	 Yes 
2488-155508-0009	train-other-500	He looked at his watch There are two men who were very close to Miss Lamar Jack Gordon was engaged to her
none	none	 Merle Shirley seemed to have been mixed up with her seriously All the picture people have night haunts See what you can find about these two men But I don t know where to find them offhand and 
2488-155508-0010	train-other-500	Both belong to the Goats Club probably Try that as a start
none	none	 I nodded and began to hurry my dessert But I could not resist questioning him 
2488-155508-0011	train-other-500	You think they are the most likely suspects No but they were intimately associated with Miss Lamar in her daily life and they are the two we have learned the least about Oh I was disappointed
2488-155508-0012	train-other-500	Then I rallied to the attack for a final time Who is the most likely one Just satisfy my curiosity Craig He took a folded note from his pocket opening it It was the memorandum from Manton s desk which I had mentioned
none	none	 In a flash I understood Werner I exclaimed 
2488-155508-0013	train-other-500	They said he was mixed up with her too
none	none	 He was the first back and out of the car and he had time to clean a needle on the towel had a better opportunity than anyone else More I began to get excited he was lying on the floor close to her in the scene and could have jabbed her with a needle very easily and and he was extremely nervous when you questioned him 
2488-155508-0014	train-other-500	the most nervous of all and and finally he had a motive he wanted to get Enid Faye with Manton Pictures as this note shows Very good Walter Kennedy s eyes were dancing in amusement
2488-155508-0015	train-other-500	It is true that Werner had the best motive so far as we know now but it s a fantastic one Men don t commit cold blooded murder just to create a vacancy for a movie star
2488-155508-0016	train-other-500	If Werner was going to kill Miss Lamar he never would have written this note about Miss Faye Unless to divert suspicion I suggested
none	none	 He shook his head 
2488-155508-0017	train-other-500	The whole thing s too bizarre
none	none	 Werner was close to her in the dark All the other things point to him don t they 
2488-155508-0018	train-other-500	It s too bad everyone wasn t searched at that Kennedy admitted
none	none	 Nevertheless at the time I realized that Werner had had the best opportunity for the actual performance of the crime 
2488-155508-0019	train-other-500	and I watched him very closely and made him go through every movement just so I could study him I believe he s innocent at least as far as I ve gone in the case I determined to stick to my opinion I believe it s Werner I insisted
2488-155508-0020	train-other-500	By the time you ve dug up all the gossip about Gordon and Shirley you won t be so sure Walter I was however
none	none	 Kennedy was not as familiar with the picture world as I 
2488-155508-0021	train-other-500	I had heard of too many actual happenings more strange and bizarre and wildly fantastic than anything conceivable in other walks of life
2488-155508-0022	train-other-500	People in the film game as they call it live highly seasoned lives in which everything is exaggerated The mere desire to make a place for Enid might not have actuated Werner granting he was the guilty man
2488-155508-0023	train-other-500	Nevertheless it could easily have contributed And it struck me suddenly an additional argument that Werner of all of them was the most familiar with the script He had been able to cast himself for the part of old Remsen
2488-155508-0024	train-other-500	There was not a detail which he could not have arranged very skillfully At the Goats Club I was lucky to discover a member whom I knew well enough to take into my confidence by stating my errand
2488-155508-0025	train-other-500	He was one of the Star s former special writers and an older classman of the college which had graduated Kennedy and myself Merle Shirley is not a member here he said As a matter of fact I ve only just heard the name
none	none	 But Jack Gordon s a Goat worse luck That fellow s a bad actor 
2488-155508-0026	train-other-500	in real life and a disgrace to us
none	none	 Tell me all you know about him I asked Well 
2488-155508-0027	train-other-500	to give you an example he was in here just about a week ago I was sitting in the grill eating an after theater supper when I heard the most terrible racket He and Emery Phelps the banker you know
2488-155508-0028	train-other-500	were having an honest to goodness fight right out in the lobby It took three of the men to separate them What was it all about Well Gordon owes money right and left not a few hundred or some little personal debts like that but thousands and thousands of dollars
none	none	 I got it from some of the other men here that he has been speculating on the curb downtown losing consistently More than that he s engaged to Stella Lamar you knew that and he s been blowing money on her Then they tell me his professional work is suffering that his recent screen appearances are terrible the result of late hours and worry I suppose The fight with Phelps was over money Of course I figure that he kept drawing against his salary at the studio until the film company shut down on him 
2488-155508-0029	train-other-500	Then probably he began to borrow from Phelps who s Manton s backer now until the banker shut down on him also At any rate Phelps had begun to dun him and it led to the fight That s all you know about Gordon Lord Isn t it enough
none	none	 I walked out of the club and toward Broadway 
2488-155508-0030	train-other-500	reflecting upon this information Could Gordon s debts have any bearing upon the case All at once one possibility struck me He had been borrowing from Phelps Perhaps he had borrowed from Stella also Perhaps
2488-155508-0031	train-other-500	that was the cause of their quarrel Perhaps she had threatened to make trouble
none	none	 it was a slender motive but worth bringing to the attention of Kennedy 
2488-155508-0032	train-other-500	My immediate problem however was to obtain some information about Merle Shirley At first I thought I would make the rounds of some of the better known cafes but that seemed a hopeless task Suddenly I remembered
2488-155508-0033	train-other-500	Belle Balcom formerly with the Star I recollected a previous case of Kennedy s where she and I had been great rivals in the quest of news I recalled a trip we had made to Greenwich Village together
2488-155508-0034	train-other-500	Belle knew more people about town than any other newspaper woman Now for some months she had been connected with Screenings a leading cinema fan magazine and would unquestionably be posted upon the photoplayers Luckily
2488-155508-0035	train-other-500	I caught her at home Bless your soul she told me over the phone in delight I ve just been aching for some one to take me out to night We ll go to the Midnight Fads and if Shirley isn t there the head waiter will tell you all I don t remember
none	none	 It was a glorious fight 
2488-155508-0036	train-other-500	She wouldn t say any more over the phone but I was hugely curious
none	none	 Had there been another encounter with fists And who had been involved When she met me finally at the Subway station and when we obtained an out of the way table at the Fads she explained It seemed that Shirley had met Stella there a number of times and that Gordon at last had got wind of it 
2488-155508-0037	train-other-500	Gordon first had come up himself quietly pleading with Stella
none	none	 She had been in a high humor and had refused even to listen to him 
2488-155508-0038	train-other-500	Then he had become insulting At that Shirley knocked him down The head waiter a witness of the affair ordered Gordon put out but did not request Shirley or Stella to leave because the other man had been the aggressor without any question
2488-155508-0039	train-other-500	After more than an hour Gordon returned quietly and unobtrusively with another girl From Belle s description I knew it was Marilyn Loring Taking another table Marilyn had stared at Shirley reproachfully
2488-155508-0040	train-other-500	while Gordon had glared at Stella
none	none	 Shirley put up with this for just about so long 
2488-155508-0041	train-other-500	As Belle described it his face gradually became more and more red
none	none	 and he controlled himself with increasing difficulty Stella seeing the coming of the storm tried to get him to go 
2488-155508-0042	train-other-500	He refused She threatened to leave him He paid no attention All at once he boiled over and with great strides walked over to Gordon and mauled him all over the place The leading man had no chance whatever in the hands of the irate Westerner
2488-155508-0043	train-other-500	Several waiters attempting to intervene were flung aside Only when Shirley began to cool off were they able to eject the two men Both Stella and Marilyn had left separately before that
none	none	 Neither of the men or women had been at the Fads since or at least the head waiter called over by Belle so informed us Unable to obtain any other facts of interest I returned finally to the apartment shared by Kennedy and myself First he listened to my account plainly interested Then when I had concluded he rose and faced me rather gravely 
2488-155508-0044	train-other-500	It s getting more and more complicated Walter he exclaimed
none	none	 After you left I remembered that there was one point of investigation I had failed to cover 
2488-155508-0045	train-other-500	Miss Lamar s home here in the city
none	none	 I got our old friend First Deputy O Connor on the wire and learned that at the request of Mackay from Tarrytown they had sent a man up to the place and that just an hour or less before I called they had located 
2488-155508-0046	train-other-500	and were holding her colored maid I hurried down to headquarters and questioned the girl Yes To me it sounded promising The negress didn t know a thing so far as the crime is concerned Kennedy went on but I gained quite an insight into the private life of the star
none	none	 You mean I mean I know the men who went to Miss Lamar s apartment 
2488-155508-0047	train-other-500	although beyond the fact of her receiving them I can tell nothing for she sent the maid home at night there were no maid s quarters
none	none	 Their visits may have been perfectly innocent 
2488-155508-0048	train-other-500	Of course We can only draw conclusions Who were the various callers Jack Gordon Her fiance Merle Shirley Shirley admitted it when you questioned him Manton
none	none	 Everyone knows that 
2488-155508-0049	train-other-500	Werner A side glance at me I said nothing My expression spoke for me And Emery Phelps At that I did show surprise
none	none	 Although Mackay had hinted at something of the kind I for one had not considered the banker seriously Good heavens Kennedy I exploded She was mixed up with just about every man connected with the company Exactly 
2488-155508-0050	train-other-500	As usual he seemed calm and unconcerned I could regard the case only with increasing amazement the bitter conflicting emotions of Manton and Phelps of Daring Shirley and Millard With them all Stella had been the
none	none	 pretty trouble maker How do you suppose they could all remain in the same company I showed my surprise at the situation 
2488-155508-0051	train-other-500	Kennedy pondered a moment then replied A moment s reflection ought to give you one answer I think Walter they were either under contract or they had their money in the company They couldn t break
none	none	 I suppose so What I wonder is was Marilyn as jealous of Stella as her screen character would make her in a story She s the only one we don t hear much about Kennedy did not seem at least at present to give this phase of it anything like the weight he credited to the frenzied financial relations the case was uncovering It was true as I learned later that Manton was at that very moment doing perhaps as much as anyone else ever did to discredit the picture game in Wall Street X CHEMICAL RESEARCH The following morning I found Kennedy up ahead of me and I felt certain that he had gone to the laboratory Sure enough I found him at work in the midst of the innumerable scientific devices which he had gathered during years of crime detection of every sort As usual he was surrounded by a perfect litter of test tubes beakers reagents microscopes slides and culture tubes He had cut out the curious spots from the towel I had discovered and was studying them to determine their nature From the mass of paraphernalia I knew he was neglecting no possibility which might lead to the hidden truth or produce a clue to the crime Have you learned anything yet I asked Those brownish spots were blood of course was his reply as he stopped a moment in his work In the blood I discovered some other substance though I can t seem to identify it yet It will take time I thought it might be a drug or poison but it doesn t seem to be at least nothing one might ordinarily expect How about the other spots not the Chinese yellow Another problem I haven t solved I dissolved enough of them so that I have plenty of material to study if I don t waste it But so far I haven t been able to identify the substance with anything I know There s a lot more work of elimination Walter before we re on the road to the solution of this case Whatever stained the towel was very unusual As near as I can make out the spots are of some protein composition But it s not exactly a poison although many proteins may be extremely poisonous and extremely difficult to identify because they are of organic nature I was disappointed It seemed to me that he had made comparatively little progress so far There s one thing he added Samples of the body fluids of the victim have been sent down by the coroner at Tarrytown and I have analyzed them While I haven t decided what it was that killed Stella Lamar I am at least convinced that it has something to do with these towel spots They are not exactly the same in fact I should say they were complementary or perhaps better antithetical The mark wasn t made by the needle which scratched her then That s what I thought at first that the point used had been wiped off on the towel Then I decided that the spots had nothing to do with the case at all Now I believe there is some connection after all I I don t understand it I protested It s very baffling he agreed absent mindedly If the towel wasn t used to clean the fatal needle I went on then it may have been used before they went out instead of afterward Exactly As a matter of fact if I had not been so confused yesterday by all the details of the case by the many people involved I would have noticed at a glance that the blood spots on the towel could not come from some one using it to wipe the needle And any hypothesis that it had been used out in Tarrytown was ridiculous because Miss Lamar was only scratched faintly and lost no blood If I had been a little more clever I might have been altogether too clever I might possibly have thrown the towel away because there certainly was no logical reason for connecting it with the crime Just when do you suppose Stella was pricked I asked That s a vital consideration Just now I do not know the poison and so cannot tell how quickly it acted He began to put aside his various paraphernalia Suppose we go at this thing by a process of deduction rather than from the end of scientific analysis He sat on a corner of the bench What do we find he began While I ve been working here with the test tubes and the microscope I ve been trying to reconstruct what must have happened trying to trace out every action of Stella Lamar as nearly as it is possible for us to do so I don t think we need to go back of their arrival at the house for the present They seem to have been there a long while before the taking of the particular scene since there were twelve other scenes preceding and since it requires time to put up the electric lights and make the connections as well as to set the cameras take tests rearrange the furniture and all the rest of it They arrived at the house in two automobiles with the exception of Phelps who was there already and Manton who came in his own limousine That means that Miss Lamar had company on the trip out the principals probably riding with each other in one car At the house they were all more or less together There were people about constantly and it would seem as if there was small opportunity for anyone to inflict the scratch which caused her death I don t mean that it would have been impossible to prick her I mean that she would have felt the jab of the point In all likelihood she would have cried out and glanced around Take a needle yourself sometime Walter and try to duplicate the scratch on your own arm in such a way that you would not be aware of it So you see I m counting upon some sort of exclamation from Miss Lamar If she were inoculated with the poison with other folks about it is sure some one would have remembered a cry a questioning glance a quick grasp of the forearm for the nerves are very sensitive in the skin there No one did recall anything of the kind I interrupted It is from that fact that I hope to deduce something Now let s follow her figuratively to her little dressing room This was a part of the living room where the rest waited It is not a certainty but yet rather a sure guess that if she had received a scratch behind those thin silk curtains her cry would have been heard What is even more plausible is that she would have hurried out or at least put her head out to see who had pricked her I made a very careful examination of that little alcove with the idea that some artifice might have been used It occurred to me that a poisoned point could have been inserted in her belongings in some way so that she would have brought about her own death directly To have caught herself on a needle point in her bag for instance would not have impressed her to the point of making a disturbance She might have checked her exclamation in that case because she would be blaming herself But I found nothing in her things nor did I discover anything in the library It seems to me therefore that we must look for a direct human agency A thought struck me and I hastened to suggest it Could some device have been arranged in her clothes Craig something like the poison rings of the Middle Ages a tiny metal thing to spring open and expose its point when pressed against her in the action of the scenes That occurred to me at the time That s why I asked Mackay to send all her clothes down here every stitch and rag of them I ve gone over everything already this morning Not only have I examined the various materials for stains but I ve tested each hook and eye and button and pin I ve been very careful to cover that possibility You think then she was scratched deliberately by some one during the taking of the scenes If you ve followed my line of reasoning you will see that we are driven to that assumption Perhaps later I will make tests on a given number of girls of Stella s general age and type and temperament to show that they will cry out at the unexpected prick of a fine needle It s illogical to expect that a cry from Miss Lamar even an exclamation would have passed unnoticed except during the excitement of actual picture taking Another inspiration came to me but I was almost afraid to voice it It seemed a daring theory Could death have resulted from poison administered in some other fashion by something she had eaten for instance I ventured Couldn t the scratch be coincidental Kennedy shook his head There s the value of our chemical analysis and scientific tests Her stomach contents showed nothing except as they might have been affected by her weakened condition From Doctor Blake s report and he found no ordinary symptoms remember and from my own observation too I can easily prove in court that she was killed by the mark which was so small that it escaped the physician altogether I turned away Once more Kennedy s reasoning seemed to be leading into a maze of considerations beyond me How could the deductive method produce results in a case as mysterious as this Having determined that Miss Lamar received the inoculation during the making of one of the scenes as nearly as we can do so Kennedy went on suppose we take the scenes in order one at a time from the last photographed to the first analyzing each in turn Remember that we seek a situation where there is not only an opportunity to jab her with a needle but one in which an outcry would be muffled or inaudible I now saw that Kennedy had brought in the bound script of the story The Black Terror and I wondered again as I had often before at his marvelous capacity for attention to detail The spotlight on the floor reveals the girl sobbing over the body of the millionaire he read aloud musingly H mm She screams and cries out Then the others rush in For several moments Kennedy paced the floor of the laboratory the manuscript open in his hands We rehearsed that with Werner and we questioned everyone too And remember Miss Lamar instead of crying out as she was supposed to do just crumpled up silently So thumbing over a page we work back to scene twelve She she was not in that at all Scene eleven Slowly carefully Kennedy went through each scene to the beginning Certainly a dramatic opening for a mystery picture he remarked suddenly as though his mind had wandered from his problem to other things We must admit that Millard can handle a moving picture scenario most beautifully Whether it was professional jealousy or the thought of Enid rather than the memory of my own poor attempts at screen writing I certainly was in no mood to agree with Kennedy for all that I knew he was correct Here He thrust the binder in my hands Read that first scene he directed Meanwhile I am going to phone Mackay to make sure he has had the house guarded and to make double sure no one goes near the library We re going out to Tarrytown again Walter and in the biggest kind of hurry What s the idea Craig Kennedy s occasional bursts of mysteriousness characteristic of him and often necessary when his theories were only half formed and too chaotic for explanations always piqued me He did not seem to hear Already he was at the telephone manipulating the receiver hook impatiently What a dummy I am he exclaimed with genuine feeling What what an awful dummy Knowing I would get nothing out of him just yet I turned to the scene reading as he told me At first I could not see where the detail concerned Stella Lamar in any way Then I came to the description of her introductory entrance the initial view of her in the film The lines of typewriting suddenly stood out before me in all their suggestive clearness The spotlight in the hands of a shadowy figure roves across the wall and to the portieres As it pauses there the portieres move and the fingers of a girl are seen on the edge of the silk A bare and beautiful arm is thrust through almost to the shoulder and it begins to move the portieres aside reaching upward to pull the curtains apart at the rings You think there s something about the portieres I began Then I saw that Kennedy had his connection that something disturbed him that some intelligence from the other end had caught him by surprise You say you were just trying to get me Mackay You ve something to tell me and you want me to come right out you have summoned Phelps and he s on his way from the city also What happened I asked as Kennedy hung up I don t know Walter Mackay said he didn t want to talk over the phone and that we had just time to catch the express But Hurry He glanced about as if wondering whether any of his scientific instruments would help him XI FORESTALLED On the train Kennedy left me to look through the other cars having the idea that Phelps might be aboard also But there were no signs of the banker We would reach Tarrytown first unless he had chosen to motor out Mackay was waiting at the station to meet us and to take us to the house The little district attorney was obviously excited Was the place guarded well last night asked Kennedy almost before we had shaken hands Yes that is I thought it was That s what I want to tell you After you left with Manton and Werner the rest of the company packed up and pulled out in the two studio cars I was a little in doubt what to do about Phelps but he settled it himself by announcing that he was going to town The coroner came and issued the permit to remove the body and that was taken away I think the house and the presence of the dead girl and all the rest of it got on Phelps s nerves because he was irritable and impatient unwilling to wait for his own car until finally I drove him to the station myself Was anyone any of those on our list of possible suspects at least alone in the room or in the house Not while I was there Mackay replied I took good care of that Then when everyone was gone and while Phelps was waiting for me I detailed two of my deputies to stay on guard one inside and one outside for the night I thought it sufficient precaution since you had made your preliminary examination And Kennedy nodded seeking to hurry the explanation And yet added Mackay some one entered the house last night in spite of us Kennedy fairly swore under his breath He seemed to blame himself for some omission in his investigation the previous afternoon How did it happen I asked rather excitedly It was about three o clock the guards tell me The man inside was dozing in a chair before the living room fireplace He was placed so he could command a view of the doorway to the library as well as the stairs and reception hall All at once he was awakened by a shot and a cry from outside He jumped up and ran toward the library As he did so the portieres bellied in toward him as if in stiff sudden draught or as if some one had darted into their folds quickly then out With no hesitation he drew his own weapon rushing the curtains There was no one secreted about them Then with the revolver in one hand he switched on the lights The room was empty But one pair of French windows at the farther end were wide open and it was that which had caused the current of air He ran over and found the lock had been forced It was not even an artistic job of jimmying What about the deputy posted outside prompted Kennedy That s the strange part of it He was alert enough but it s a big house to watch He swears that the first thing he knew of any trouble was the sharp metallic click which he realized later was the sound made by the intruder in forcing the catch of the French window It was pretty loud out in the quiet of a Tarrytown night He started around from the rear and then the next thing he caught was the outline of a shadowy slinking figure as a man dropped out of the library He called The intruder broke into a run darting across the open space of lawn and crashing through the shrubbery without any further effort at concealment My man called again and began to chase the stranger finally firing and missing In the shrubbery a sharp branch whipped him under the chin just as he obtained a clear view of the outlined figure of his quarry and as he raised his weapon to shoot again The revolver was knocked from his hand and he was thrown back falling to the ground and momentarily stunned Whoever broke into the library got away of course What did the intruder look like There was an eagerness in Kennedy s manner I grasped that the case was beginning to clarify itself in his mind Mackay shook his head There was no moon you know and everything happened swiftly But was he tall or short or slender or stout the deputy must have got some vague idea of him at least It was one of my amateur deputies Mackay admitted reluctantly He thought the man was hatless but couldn t even be sure of that Were there footprints or fingerprints No mister Kennedy we re out of luck again When he jumped out he fell to his hands and knees in a garden bed The foot marks were ruined because his feet slid and simply made two irregular gashes The marks of his hands indicated to me anyhow that he wore heavy gloves rubber probably Any disturbance in the library Not that I could notice That s why I phoned you at once I m hoping you ll discover something Well Kennedy sighed It was a wonderful opportunity to get to the bottom of this I haven t told you all yet mister Kennedy Mackay went on There was a second man and A second man Kennedy straightened distinctly surprised I would swear this whole thing was a one man job They weren t together the district attorney explained That s why I didn t mention them both at once But my deputy says that when he was thrown by the lash of the branch he was unable to move for a few seconds on account of the nerve shock I suppose and that while he was motionless squatted in a sort of sitting position with hands braced behind him just as he fell he was aware of a second stranger concealed in the shrubbery The second fellow was watching the first without the question of a doubt While the deputy slowly rose to his feet this other chap started to follow the man who had broken into the house But at that moment there was the sudden sound of a self starter in a car then the purr of a motor and the clatter of gears Number one spun off in the darkness of the road as pretty as you please Number two grunted in plain disgust By this time my deputy had his wind His revolver was gone but he jumped the second stranger with little enough hesitation and they battled royally for several minutes in the dark Unfortunately it was an unequal match The intruder apparently was a stocky man built with the strength of a battleship He got away also without leaving anything behind him to serve for identification You have no more description than of the first man Unfortunately not Medium height a little inclined to be stocky strong as a longshoreman that s all Are you sure your deputy isn t romancing Positively He s the son of one of our best families here a sportsman and an athlete I knew he loved a lark or a chance for adventure and so I impressed him and a companion as deputies when I met them on the street on my way up to Phelps s house just after the tragedy Kennedy lapsed into thought Who could the self constituted watcher have been Who was interested in this case other than the proper authorities Apparently some one knew more than Mackay more than Kennedy Whoever it was had made no effort to communicate with any of us This was a new angle to the mystery a mystery which became deeper as we progressed At the house Kennedy first made a careful tour of the exterior but found nothing Mackay had doubled his guards and had sent Phelps s servants away so that there could be no interference Once inside I noticed that Kennedy seemed indisposed to make another minute search of the library He went over the frame of the French window with his lens carefully for fingerprints Finding nothing he went back directly to the portieres For several moments he stood regarding them in thought Then he began a most painstaking inspection of the cloth with the pocket glass beginning at the library side I remembered that first scene in the manuscript which Kennedy had insisted I read I recalled the suspicion which had flashed to me before the message from Mackay had disturbed both Kennedy s thoughts and mine Stella Lamar had thrust her bare arm through this curtain A needle cleverly concealed in the folds might easily have inflicted the fatal scratch It was for a trace of the poison point that Kennedy searched Of that I was sure knowing his methods I glanced up and down the heavy hanging silk looking for the glint of fine sharp steel as Kennedy had done before starting his inspection with the glass The color of the silk a beautiful heavy velour was a strange dark tint very close to the grained black brown of the woodwork Both the thickness of the material and its dull shade made the portieres serve ideally for the purpose assumed now both by Kennedy and myself A tiny needle might remain secreted within their folds for days Nothing certainly caught my naked eye At last a little exclamation from Kennedy showed us that he had discovered something I moved closer as did Mackay It s lucky none of us toyed with these curtains yesterday he remarked with a slight smile of gratification There might have been more than one lying where Stella Lamar lies at the present moment With wholesome respect neither Mackay nor myself touched the silk as Kennedy pointed There were two small holes almost microscopic in the close woven material About the one there was the slightest discoloration Not a fraction of an inch away I saw two infinitesimal spots of a dark brownish red tinge What does it mean I asked although I could guess The dark spots are blood the discoloration the poison from the needle And the needle He shrugged his shoulders That s where our very scientific culprit has forestalled me Walter The needle was in these curtains all day yesterday Unfortunately I did not study the manuscript did not attach any importance to Miss Lamar s scene at the portieres The man who broke in last night Removed the needle but almost amused not the traces of it You see Walter after all the scientific detective cannot be forestalled even by the most scientific criminal There is nothing in the world which does not leave its unmistakable mark behind provided you can read it The hole in the cloth serves me quite as well as the needle itself Very suddenly a voice from behind us interrupted Find something I turned startled to see Emery Phelps There was a distinct eagerness in the banker s expression Yes Kennedy faced him undisturbed apparently not surprised His scrutiny of Phelps s face was frank and searching Yes he repeated bit by bit the guilty man is revealing himself to us XII EMERY PHELPS There there is something the matter with the curtains Phelps suggested Kennedy pointed to the two holes and the spots Miss Lamar met her death from poison introduced into her system through a tiny scratch from a prepared needle Yes Phelps was calm now and cool I wondered if it were pretense on his part What have these little marks to do with that Don t you see rejoined Kennedy If some one had come here before the scene in the picture was played had thrust a small needle perhaps a hollow needle from a hypodermic syringe through the heavy thickness of this silk thrust it in here the point sticking out here well there would be two holes left where the threads were forced apart like this Kennedy took his stickpin demonstrating How could that cause Stella s death Phelps at first quite upset apparently by Kennedy s discovery now was lapsing again into his hostile mood His question was cynical Try to recall Miss Lamar s actions Kennedy went on patiently What was she supposed to do in the very first scene The portieres move and the fingers of a girl are seen on the edge of the silk A bare and beautiful arm is thrust through almost to the shoulder and it begins to move the portieres aside reaching upward to pull the curtains apart at the rings Do you mean to tell me Phelps s eyes were very wide as he paused grasping the scheme and yet disbelieving unless it all were a bit of fine acting do you mean to tell me it is possible to calculate a thing like that How would anyone know where her arm would be It is simpler than it sounds mister Phelps Kennedy was suddenly harsh There is only one natural movement of an arm in that case The culprit was undoubtedly familiar with Miss Lamar s height and with her manner of working It is a bit of action which has to be repeated in both the long shot and close up scenes Jameson here can tell you how many times a scene is rehearsed There probably were a dozen sure chances of the needle striking the girl s bare flesh You will see from the position of the holes that it was arranged point downward and slightly turned in and on a particular fold of the curtain too showing that some one placed it there only after a nice bit of calculation Furthermore it was high enough so that there was little chance of anyone being pricked except the star whose death was intended Phelps either seemed convinced or else he felt it inadvisable to irritate Kennedy by a further pretense of skepticism A point occurred to me however Listen Craig I spoke in a low voice Remember all the emphasis you placed upon the fact that she would cry out She was not supposed to cry out in that first scene No Walter but if you ll read the second the close up you ll see that the script actually calls for a cry Now suppose she makes an exclamation in the first instead Nobody would think anything of it They would assume that she had played her action a little in advance perhaps And then consider this too Miss Lamar receiving the scratch would cry out unquestionably But she has been before the camera for years and she is trained in the idea that film must not be wasted uselessly She would not interrupt her action for a little scratch because in these circumstances any little startled movement would fit in with the action By the time the scene was over she would have forgotten the incident It would mean very little to her in the preoccupation of bringing the mythical Stella Remsen into flesh and blood existence The poison however would be putting in its deadly work Wouldn t it act before the thirteenth scene I began Not necessarily As a matter of fact an actress in the excitement of her work might resist the effects for a much longer period than some one who realizes he is sick Some day I m going to write a book on that I m going to collect hundreds of examples of people who keep plugging along because they refuse to admit anything s the matter with them It s like Napoleon s courier who didn t drop until he d delivered his message and made his last precise military salute One other thought struck me The blood spots on the curtain cannot be Miss Lamar s if as you say the scratch brought no blood How about the nocturnal visitor who removed the needle in the dark Can t you imagine him pricking himself beautifully in his hurry Good heavens I felt the chills travel up and down my spine There may be another fatality then I exclaimed Kennedy was noncommittal It would be too bad for justice to be cheated in that fashion he remarked Phelps meanwhile had been listening to us impatiently Finally he turned to Mackay Was that all you called me out here for Did you just want to show me the pinholes in those portieres Not exactly Mackay replied eyeing him sharply Some one forced his way into this library last night My guard saw him and also saw a second man who remained out in the shrubbery and seemed to be watching the first One shot was fired but both men got away An automobile was waiting perhaps two of them How does this concern me Phelps s voice rose in anger He strode into the library and over to the French windows inspecting the damage to the fine woodwork with steadily rising color Then he hurried back to the side of Mackay It s up to you District Attorney Mackay he said with a great show of his ill feeling You practically forced me out of my own house You sent my servants away You put your own guards in charge young inexperienced deputies who don t know enough to come in when it s wet Now you have me make this trip out here in business hours just to show me where a needle has been stuck in a curtain and where a pair of imported window sashes have been ruined Mackay was unruffled It is necessary mister Phelps that you look over this room and see that nothing else has been disturbed that there is no further damage Moreover I thought you might be interested might wish to help us determine the identity of the intruder If there s any way I can really help you to do that sarcastically I ll be delighted Were you here the night before the murder Mackay asked You know I seldom spend the night in Tarrytown I have quarters in New York at the club and recently I have been spending all my time in New York on account of the situation in the picture business You were not here the night before the murder then No But you were out here yesterday before the actors arrived before Manton or any of his technical staff and crew came I was out very early to make sure the servants had the house ready Phelps was red now Are you insinuating anything Mackay The little district attorney was demonstrating a certain quality of dogged perseverance Some one put the needle in the curtain before the company arrived You probably were in the house at the time or at the least your servants were Whoever did was the one who murdered Stella Lamar And also rejoined Phelps tartly was the intruder who broke in here last night and ruined my window sash If you had had better guards you might have caught him too Are you sure of your servants Are they reliable I never anticipated a murder and so I didn t question them as to their poisoning proclivities when I engaged them But you know where they are and you can examine them If I were you Mackay Gentlemen Kennedy hastened to stop the colloquy before it became an out and out quarrel Then he faced the banker mister Phelps Kennedy s voice was soft coaxing I don t think mister Mackay quite understands It would be a great service to me if you would give the house a quick general inspection You are familiar with the things here enough to state whether they have been disturbed to any appreciable degree You see we do not know the interior arrangements as they were before this unfortunate happening With rather ill grace Phelps stalked up the steps acceding to Kennedy s request but disdaining to answer Kennedy turned to Mackay as the banker disappeared out of earshot That s just to cool him off a bit I have everything I came to get right here Producing a pair of pocket scissors he cut the pierced and spotted bit of silk from the portieres ruthlessly It was necessary vandalism What was the poison mister Kennedy Mackay asked in a low voice I think that it was closely allied to the cyanide groups in its rapacious activity But you haven t identified it yet No So far I haven t the slightest idea of its true nature It seems to have a powerful affinity for important nerve centers of respiration and muscular company ordination as well as possessing a tendency to disorganize the blood I should say that it produces death by respiratory paralysis and convulsions To my mind it is an exact though perhaps less active counterpart of hydrocyanic acid But that is not what it is or I would have been able to prove it before this Mackay nodded listening in silence You ll say nothing of this Kennedy added I ll be silent of course Heavy footsteps from the rear marked the return of Phelps who had covered the upper floors descending by the back stairs so as to have a look at the kitchen Everything seems to be all right he remarked half graciously Kennedy led the way to the front porch There he seemed more interested in the weather than in the case for he studied the sky intently Glancing up I saw that the morning was still gray and cloudy with no promise that the sun would be able to struggle through the overhanging moisture I don t think we ll go back to the city that is all the way in he remarked speaking for both of us I want to go to the Manton studio first This is no day for exteriors and so they ll probably be working there He smiled at Phelps I want to see if any of our possible suspects look as though they had been engaging in nocturnal journeys Phelps had been rubbing his eyes He dropped his hand so quickly that I wanted to smile then to cover his confusion he promptly offered to drive us in Mackay at the same time volunteered his car Kennedy accepted the latter offer As he thanked the banker I wondered if any suspicion of that individual lurked in the back of his mind Phelps certainly had made a very bad impression upon me with his antagonistic attitude with his readiness to transform every question into a personal affront Just one other thing mister Phelps exclaimed Kennedy as we were about to descend to Mackay s car Why did you wish the scenes in The Black Terror actually taken in your library Kennedy had asked the question before Had he forgotten I glanced at the banker and read the same thought in his expression I I m proud of my library and I wanted to see it in pictures he replied after some hesitation and with a little rancor Not to save money It would be no appreciable saving I see Kennedy was tantalizingly deliberate How long have you held the controlling interest in Manton Pictures mister Phelps Uh in surprise nearly a year You could have had your library photographed at any time then simply by stating your request as you did in this case In that year there have been pictures which would have served the purpose as well as this better in fact because in this picture the library seems to be dark almost altogether In other stories there probably were infinitely better chances for the exhibition of the room Why did you wait for The Black Terror As a clear understanding of Kennedy s question and all it entailed filtered into the mind of Phelps he became so red and flushed with anger that I felt sure he was going to explode on the spot Because I didn t think of it before he sputtered You said the situation in the picture business made it necessary for you to stay in town Is there any trouble between Manton and yourself Not a bit Was Stella Lamar making any trouble of a business nature such as threatening to quit Manton Pictures No Phelps eyes now were narrowed to slits Are you sure With a great effort Phelps achieved a degree of self control He forced a smile His remark presumed to be a pleasantry I knew masked the true state of his feelings As sure mister Kennedy he rejoined awed by Kennedy s reputation even in the full flood of his anger as sure as I am that I d like to throw you down these steps XIII MARILYN LORING The magic of Manton s name admitted us to the studio courtyard and at once I was struck by the change since the day before Now the tank was a dry empty shallow depression of concrete The scenery all the paraphernalia assembled for the taking of water stuff was gone Except for the parked automobiles in one corner and a few loitering figures here and there the big quadrangle seemed absolutely deserted In the general reception room Kennedy asked for Millard but was told he had not been out since the previous day That was to be expected But Manton it developed was away also He had telephoned in that he would be detained until late afternoon on important business I know that I for one wondered if it were connected with Fortune Features It s just as well Kennedy remarked after convincing the boy at the desk it was Manton s wish that we have the run of the place My real object in coming was to watch the cast at work We found our way to the small studio called so in comparison with the larger one where the huge ballroom and banquet sets were being built In reality it possessed a tremendous floor space Now all the other companies had been forced to make room for The Black Terror on account of the emergency created by the death of Stella Lamar and there were any number of sets put up hastily for the retakes of the scenes in which Stella had appeared The effect of the whole upon a strange beholder was weird It was as though a cyclone had swept through a town and had gathered up and deposited slices and corners and sections of rooms and hallways and upper chambers each complete with furniture and ornaments curtains rugs and hangings Except for the artistic harmony of things within the narrow lines of the camera s view nothing in this great armory like place had any apparent relation to anything else Some of the sets were lighted with actors and technical crews at work Others were dark standing ready for use Still others were in varying states of construction or demolition Rising above every other impression was the noise It was pandemonium We saw Werner at work in a distant corner and strolled over The director was bustling about feverishly I do not doubt that the grim necessity of preparing the picture for a release date which was already announced had resulted in this haste without even a day of idleness in respect for the memory of the dead star yet it seemed cold blooded and mercenary to me I thought that success was not deserved by an enterprise so callous of human life so unappreciative of human effort Most of the cast were standing about waiting The scenes were being taken in a small room fitted as an office or private den but furnished luxuriously Later I learned it was in the home of the millionaire Remsen close off the library for which the actual room in Phelps s home was photographed Shirley and Gordon I noticed kept as far apart as possible It was quite intentional and I again caught belligerent glances between them On the other hand both Enid and Marilyn Loring were calm and self possessed Yet between these two I caught a coolness a sort of armed truce in which each felt it would be a sign of weakness to admit consciously even the near presence of the other Werner was irascible swearing roundly at the slightest provocation raging up and down at every little error Come now he shouted as we approached let s get this scene now number one twenty six Loring Gordon Shake a leg here I ll read it again Daring enters He is scarcely seated at the desk examining papers when Zelda enters in a filmy negligee Daring looks up amazed and Zelda pretends great agitation Daring is not unkind to her He tells her he has not discovered the will as yet Spoken title I am sure that I can find a will and that you are provided for Continuing scene Daring speaks the above Zelda thanks him and undulates toward the door with the well known swaying walk of the vampire Daring turns to his papers and does not watch her further She looks over her shoulder then exits registering that she will get him yet Werner dropped his copy of the script Understand he barked Make it fast now We shouldn t do this over but you were lousy before both of you Gordon extinguished a cigarette and entered the set with a scowl Marilyn rose and slipped out of a dressing gown spotted with make up and dark from its long service in the studios Underneath the wrapper the finest of silken draperies clung to her infinitely more intimate here in actuality and in the bright studio lights than it would be upon the screen I noticed the slim trimness of her figure could not help myself in fact And I saw also that she shrank back just the least little bit before stepping to her place at the door It was modesty a genuine girlish diffidence In a moment I revised my conception of her Before I had not been able to decide whether Marilyn Loring was a woman with a gift for looking young or a flapper with the baffling sophistication affected these days by so many of them Now I knew somehow that she was just all girl probably in her early twenties The brief instant of shyness had betrayed her In the scene she changed Marilyn Loring was an actress The moment she caught the click of the camera s turn there was a hardness about her mouth a faint dishonest touch to the play of her eye a shameless boldness to her movements concealed without concealment In the flash of a second she was Marilyn no longer but Zelda the ward of old Remsen an unscrupulous and willing ally of the Black Terror Werner damned the amount of footage used in the scene then turned to the next with Enid and Gordon in the same set one of the necessary retakes for which the room had been put up again Enid had not noticed me and I somehow failed to shake off the feeling of fear that the glance of Millard had given me Faint heart I was and the answer was that I had yet to win the fair lady To excuse myself I pretended she was different under the lights It was really true that as Zelda Remsen Enid was not the fascinating creature I had met in Werner s office There was too much Mascaro on her lashes too great an amount of red and blue and even bright yellow in her make up In striking contrast was the little coloring used by Stella Lamar or even Marilyn Loring Enid s scene was a close up in which the beginning of the love interest in the story was shown I noticed that as the cameras turned upon the action the girl inch by inch shifted her position almost imperceptibly until she was practically facing the lens The consequence was that Gordon playing the lover was forced to move also in order to follow her face and so was brought with his back toward the camera It was the pleasant little film trick known as taking the picture away from a fellow actor Enid was a lens hog The moment the scene was over Gordon rushed to Werner to protest The director irritated and in a hurry gave him small satisfaction Both players were called back under the lights for the next take As Werner s back was turned Enid favored Gordon with a mischievous malicious glance The leading man possessed very few friends from what I had heard The new star evidently did not propose to become one of them Let s pay our respects socially suggested Kennedy at my elbow I followed his glance and saw that Marilyn was seated alone away from the others apparently forlorn As we approached she drew her dressing robe about her smiling With the smile her face lighted It was in the rare moments just as her smile broke and spread that she was pretty strikingly so Professor Kennedy she exclaimed And mister Jameson too Sit down and watch our new star What do you think of her Kennedy asked Enid Marilyn s expression became quizzical I think she s a clever girl You mean something by that don t you prompted Kennedy She sobered No Honestly For an instant she studied him with a directness of gaze which I would have found disconcerting Don t tell me she teased again allowing the flash of a smile to illuminate her features don t tell me the renowned and celebrated Professor Kennedy suspects Enid Faye of murdering poor Stella to get her position Kennedy laughed turning to me There s the woman he remarked We may deduce and analyze and catalogue all the facts of science but he spread his palms wide expressly it is as nothing against a woman s intuition Facing Marilyn again he became frank You caught my thought exactly although it was not as bad as all that I simply wondered if Miss Faye might not have had something to do with the case Why I realized now that this Miss Loring in addition to considerable skill as an actress in addition to rare beauty on the screen possessed a brain and the power to use it She followed Kennedy with greater ease than I who knew him Why she repeated Perhaps it s the intuition of the male he began hesitatingly She shook her head A man s intuition is not dependable You see a woman gets her intuition first and fits her facts to it while a man takes a fact and then has an intuitive burst of inspiration as a result The woman puts her facts last and so is not thrown out when they re wrong as they usually are But the man I think Professor Kennedy that you have some facts about Enid stored away and that that s why you put a double meaning in my remark Am I right He smiled I surrender Miss Loring You are right What is the little fact Perhaps I can help you Miss Faye and Lawrence Millard seem to be old friends Oh Maybe you wonder at the contents of the sealed testimony in the case of Millard VS Millard Kennedy nodded Do you want to know what I think she asked Please Well I ve worked with Stella nearly a year It s my opinion she divorced Millard because he asked her to do so No no I balked at that interrupting He could have obtained the divorce himself if he had wanted it Stella Lamar and Manton That s talk she rejoined with a show of feeling That s the thing I hate about pictures It s always talk talk talk I m not saying Stella and old Papa Lloyd as we used to call him never were mixed up with each other but it s one thing to repeat a bit of gossip and quite another thing to prove it I m not one to help give currency to any rumor of immoral relationship until I m pretty dog gone sure it s true You think Miss Lamar wasn t as bad as painted asked Kennedy I m sure of it mister Kennedy I ve known Stella and I ve known others of her type Fundamentally they re the kindest truest biggest hearted people on earth When Stella and I shared a dressing room I often caught her giving away this or that frequently things she needed herself I ve known her to draw against her salary to lend money to some actor or actress whom she well knew would never repay her Stella s biggest fault was an overbalancing quality of sympathy If she ever did get mixed up with anyone you may bet it was because that person played upon her feelings Have you any theory as to who killed her It was a direct question No The answer was quick but then an amazing thing happened Marilyn suddenly colored a flush which gathered up around her eyes above the make up and made me think of a country girl She started to say something else and then bit her tongue Her confusion was surprising due probably to the unexpectedness of Kennedy s query Kennedy seemed to wish to spare her Undoubtedly her prompt negative had been the truth Some afterthought had robbed her of her self control Tell me why you said Miss Faye was a clever girl he directed Just because she puts her ambition above everything else and works hard and honestly and sincerely and will get there That s what people call being clever I see Werner s voice roaring through a megaphone announced an interval for lunch Marilyn rose laughing now but still in a high color conscious perhaps that she had revealed some strong undercurrent of feeling If you ll escort me to my dressing room she said coaxingly and wait until I slip into a skirt and waist I ll initiate both of you to McCann s across the street We all eat there players stage hands chauffeurs all but the stars who have machines to take them elsewhere Kennedy glanced at me Delighted said I We haven t much time she went on leading the way Werner s on a rampage to day He isn t usually that way It s Stella s death I guess She opened one of the steel fire doors He s always that way though when he s been out the night before I flashed a look at Kennedy Could Werner have been at Tarrytown In the long hallway of dressing rooms Marilyn stopped grasping the knob of her door It ll only take me she began Then her face went white as the concrete of the floor and that was immaculate An expression which might have been fear or horror or hate or all three spread over her features transforming her Following the direction of her stare I saw Shirley down the hall just as he stopped at his own door He caught her glance suddenly and his own face went red I thought that his hands trembled Marilyn wheeled about lips pressed tightly together Throwing open the door she dashed into her room slamming it with a bang which echoed and re echoed up and down the little hall She had forgotten our presence altogether XIV ANOTHER CLUE Kennedy looked at me quizzically I guess we d better not wait for Miss Loring to initiate us to McCann s he remarked We found our way to the courtyard and were headed for the gate when a young man in chauffeur s cap and uniform intercepted us I had noticed him start forward from one of the cars parked in the inclosure but did not recognize him May I speak to you a moment Professor Kennedy alone mister Jameson here is associated with me is assisting me in this case if it is something concerning the death of Miss Lamar It is sir I saw you out at Tarrytown yesterday McGroarty is my name and I drove one of the cars the company went in They were pointing you out to me and I d read about you and just now I says to myself there s something I ought to tell you That s right Kennedy lighted a cigar offering one to the chauffeur I m not supernatural and often I m able to solve a mystery only with the help of all those who like myself want justice done Yes sir That s my way of looking at it Well McGroarty blew a cloud of smoke appreciatively I do a good bit of driving for these people and this morning it was cloudy and dull no good for exteriors but yet sort of so it might clear at any moment and so I was ordered I brought my car and left it standing here in the yard while I went over to McCann s the lunch room you know for a cup of coffee When I came back again the cigar there still was nothing doing and so I thought you know how it is I thought I d clean up the back of the old boat to kill time not saying it wasn t needed So I took out the cocoa mat to beat it and what do I find on the floor between the mat and the rear seat it was I guess but this He handed Kennedy some small object which glinted in the light Looking closely I saw that it was a peculiarly shaped little glass tube An ampulla Kennedy explained It s the technical name the doctors have for such a container It must have been between the mat and the rear seat the chauffeur repeated Then he discovered that his cigar was out He struck a match Kennedy turned the bit of glass over and over in his hand examining it carefully I felt rather fearful wondering if it might not contain some trace of the deadly poison which had so quickly killed Stella Lamar I even half expected to see Kennedy find some infinitesimal jagged edge or point which could have inflicted the fatal scratch Then I realized that McGroarty had handled the thing with impunity perhaps had carried it about half a day Kennedy took his scarf pin On the outside of the little tube there was no trace of a label or marking of any sort All about on the inside however the glass was spotted with dried light yellow incrustations resembling crystals and at first apt to escape even the sharpest scrutiny With the pin Kennedy scaled off one of these and put it under his pocket lens But he came to no conclusion Rather puzzled and nettled he dropped the tiny bit of substance back into the tube then replaced his pin in his scarf and stowed this latest bit of possible evidence in his pocket carefully How do you suppose it got in the car he asked Some one must have dropped it and it must have rolled in that space by the edge of the mat replied the chauffeur There was just room for it too I never would have noticed it without taking up the mat It couldn t be broken by being trampled on Nope Not a chance How long could it have been there Two or three or four days since I cleaned up last I remembered the cleverness shown by the guilty person in placing the needle in the curtain It seemed unlikely that this could be an accident Isn t it possible I suggested that this is a plant that the tube was put there deliberately to throw us off the track It s quite likely he admitted On the other hand Walter the very smartest criminal will do some foolish little thing enough to ruin the most careful plans and preparations He turned to McGroarty Who rode in your car yesterday Mine s the principals car boasted McGroarty Going out I had Miss Lamar Miss Loring mister Gordon mister Shirley and mister Werner Coming back mister Werner was with you and Miss Lamar well there was only Miss Loring and mister Gordon and mister Shirley Did you notice how they acted They never says a word to each other on all the trip back but I didn t think it strange after what happened although usually they re always joking and laughing You brought the three to the studio here Yes They had to get out of make up Did you leave the car then No I hit it right for the garage Were you away from the car at Tarrytown Sure That was a long wait Peters Manton s chauffeur and I found a couple of horseshoes and we were throwing them most of the time How long was the machine alone here in the yard this morning A couple of hours maybe I knew the old boiler was safe enough and that if they wanted me they d look over in McCann s Well Kennedy extended his hand I thank you and I won t forget you McGroarty As soon as the chauffeur was out of earshot I faced Kennedy rather eagerly to forestall him if he had arrived at the same conclusion as myself See It s just as I thought yesterday How s that Walter Werner He rode out in that machine but not back In Manton s car he was worried all the time He probably knew he had dropped the tube Then he hurried up ahead of us and wiped the needle I stopped lamely Kennedy smiled See you re jumping at conclusions too fast You remember now that we decided that the towel has nothing directly to do with the poison In a way you cannot assume that this ampulla has either although I myself feel sure on that point But in any case no one is eliminated It is true Werner did not return in the same automobile It is also true that he had little opportunity to drop it while others were in the car with him When McGroarty was away from the car anyone could have lost it or as you suggested a moment ago planted it there deliberately to divert suspicion I felt the beginnings of a headache from all these confused threads of the mystery Can t Isn t there anyone we can say is innocent at least even if we cannot begin to fasten the guilt upon somebody I pleaded Kennedy shook his head At this stage the one is as hard as the other I consider myself lucky to have collected as much material as I have for the analysis of the poison He tapped his pocket significantly Yoo hoo A frankly shrill call in a feminine voice interrupted We both turned to see Marilyn Loring hastening toward us Did you think I was going to forget you she asked almost reproachfully and much out of breath Let s hurry she added This is roast beef day We started toward the gate once more Marilyn between us vivacious and rather charming I noticed that she made no reference to the incident in the hallway the precipitate manner in which she left us and the very evident confusion of Merle Shirley Kennedy too seemed disposed to drop the matter although it was obviously significant For some reason his mind was elsewhere so that the girl was thrown upon my hands It struck me that after all she was attractive At this moment I found her distinctly good looking Why do you vamp I asked innocently You don t seem to me if you ll pardon the personal remark at all that type She laughed It s all the fault of the public They insist that I vamp I want to play girly girly parts but the public won t stand for it they won t come to see the picture They tell the exhibitor and he tells the producer and back I am at the vamping again Isn t it funny She paused a moment Take Gordon Doesn t it make you laugh what the public think he is clean cut hero and all that sort of thing Little do they know All at once Kennedy stopped abruptly We were close to the entrance just where a smart little speedster of light blue lined with white was parked at the edge of the narrow sidewalk The sun after a morning of uncertainty had just struck through the haze and it illuminated Marilyn s face and hair most delightfully as we both turned somewhat in surprise I know you ll never forgive me Miss Loring Kennedy began but the fact is that just before you came out we stumbled into a new bit of evidence in the case and I believe that Jameson and I will have to hurry in to the laboratory Much as I would like to lunch with you and perhaps chat some more during scene taking this afternoon It seemed to me that her eyes widened a bit Certainly there was a perceptible change in her face It was interest but it was also certainly more than that I felt that she would have liked to penetrate the mask of Kennedy s expression perhaps learn just what facts and theories rested in his mind Is it Suddenly she smiled realizing that Kennedy would reveal only the little which suited his purpose Is it something you can tell me she finished He shook his head His answer was tantalizing his glance searching and without concealment Only another detail concerning the chemical analysis of the poison I see If she knew of the ampulla the answer would have been intelligible to her As it was her face betrayed nothing I guess I ll hurry on over alone then she added She extended a hand to each of us Her grasp was warm and friendly and frank So long and and good luck for Stella s sake Hello folks The dancing bantering voice from behind us with silvery cadence to its laughter could belong to no one but Enid Faye I grasped that it was her car which Kennedy leaned upon I gasped a bit as I saw her directly at my side her dainty chamois motoring coat brushing my sleeve the sun which grew in strength every moment casting mottled shadows upon her face through the transparent brim of her bobbing hat in mocking answer to the mirth in her eyes For an instant she gazed after the retreating Marilyn Good by Marilyn DEAR she called mega phoning her hands The other girl made no response Laughing Enid slipped a hand under my arm the firm pressure of her fingers thrilling me She addressed Kennedy however Do you want a ride in to the city both of you Kennedy brightened That would be fine How far are you going The Burrage I have a luncheon engagement That s Forty fourth Can you drop us off at the university Surely Climb in It s a tight fit three in the seat but fun And facing me I want Jamie between us next to me As we rolled out of the studio inclosure she leaned forward on the wheel to question Kennedy What did Marilyn Loring want You seemed in deep confab She volunteered to initiate us to McCann s across the street Oh She skidded about a corner skillfully And Well we bumped into an additional piece of evidence and I thought Jameson and I ought to hurry in to my laboratory instead I bet Enid giggled readjusting her hat in the breeze I bet she wanted to know what you d found right away Didn t she Yes Kennedy s face was noncommittal Why do you say that Because she came into my room just as we were getting ready for work this morning Perhaps I m wrong but from the way she kept asking me questions about everyone from Manton down I got the idea she was quizzing me to see how much I knew Of course this is only my first day but it seems to me that Marilyn is talking a great deal without saying very much I ve come to the conclusion she knows a good deal more than she is telling anyone and that she d like to find out just how much everyone else knows Kennedy nodded almost absent mindedly without responding further Well Enid speeded up a bit not to change connections on the switchboard I think I m going to like it with Manton Pictures Will they do justice to your work Kennedy inquired putting you in a partially finished picture in this way That s where I m in luck real bang up luck Werner has directed me before and knows just exactly how to handle me What about the story That was built for Stella wasn t it Yes but they re changing it here and there to fit me Larry knows my work too That s luck again for little Enid How long have you known Millard In a flash I realized Kennedy s cleverness This was the fact he had wished to unearth The question was as natural as could be He had led up to it deliberately I was sure of that Four nearly five years she replied unsuspiciously Then suddenly she bit her lip although her expression was well masked That is she added somewhat lamely that is in a casual way like nearly everyone knows nearly everyone else in the film game Oh murmured Kennedy lapsing into silence XV I BECOME A DETECTIVE Important as it was to watch Enid and Marilyn Werner and the rest Kennedy decided that it was now much more important to hold to his expressed purpose of returning to the laboratory with our trophies of the day s crime hunt For people to whom emotion ought to be an old story in their everyday stage life I must say they feel and show plenty of it in real life I remarked as Enid set us down and drove off It does not seem to pall I don t know why the movie people buy stories remarked Craig quaintly They don t need to do it they live them When we were settled in the laboratory once more Kennedy plunged with renewed vigor into the investigation he had dropped in the morning in order to make the hurried trip to the Phelps home in Tarrytown I had hoped he would talk further of the probabilities of the connection of the various people with the crime but he had no comment even upon the admission of Enid that she had known Millard for a period long antedating the trouble with Stella Lamar It seemed that after all he was quite excited at the discovery of the ampulla and was anxious to begin the analysis of its scale like contents I was not sure but it struck me that this might be the same substance which had spotted the towel or the portieres If that were so the finding of it in this form had given him a new and tangible clue to its nature accounting for his eagerness I watched his elaborate and thorough preparations wishing I could be of assistance but knowing the limitations of my own chemical and bacteriological knowledge I grasped however that he was concentrating his study upon the spots he had cut from the portieres in particular the stain where the point of the needle had been and upon the incrustations on the inner surface of the tube He made solutions of both of these and for some little time experimented with chemical reactions Then he had recourse to several weighty technical books Though bursting with curiosity I dared not question him nor distract him in any way Finally he turned to a cage where he kept on hand always a few of those useful martyrs to science guinea pigs Taking one of the little animals and segregating him from the others he prepared to inoculate him with a tiny bit of the solution made from the stain on the piece cut from the portiere At that I knew it would be a long and tiresome analysis It seemed a waste of time to wait idly for Kennedy to reach his conclusions so I cast about in my mind for some sort of inquiry of my own which I could conduct meanwhile perhaps collecting additional facts about those we were watching at the studio Somehow I could not wholly lose my suspicions of the director Werner especially now as I marshaled the evidence against him First of all he was the only person absolutely in control of the movements of Stella Lamar If she did not bring up her arm against the curtains in a manner calculated to press the needle against her flesh it certainly would not seem out of the way for him to ask her to do it over again or even for him to direct changes in her position This he could do either in rehearsal or in retakes after the scene had actually been photographed It was not proof I knew Practically all of them were familiar with the action of the scene could guess how Werner would handle it The point was that the director next to Millard was the most thoroughly conversant with the scenes in the script had to figure out everything down to the very location and angles of the camera Another matter of course was the placing of the needle in the silk For that purpose some one had to go to Tarrytown ahead of the others or at least had to precede the others into the living room Offhand I was compelled to admit that this was easiest for Phelps Phelps the man who had insisted that the scene be taken in his library At the same time I knew it was quite possible for the director to have entered ahead of anyone else possible for him to have issued orders to his people which would keep them out of the way for the brief moment he needed A third consideration was the finding of the ampulla in McGroarty s car Stella Marilyn Jack Gordon Merle Shirley and Werner had ridden out together Werner had not returned While this fact did not indicate definitely that he might have dropped it coupled with the other considerations it pointed the suspicion of guilt at the director Then there was the finding of the towel in the washroom of the office building at the studio While Kennedy now said it was not used to wipe the needle while we now knew that the needle remained in the portieres from the morning of Stella s death until late that night yet Kennedy affirmed the connection of the towel with the crime in some subtle way It was true that members of the cast sometimes used the washroom yet it was evident that Manton Millard and Werner who had rooms on the floor were the more apt to be concerned in the attempt to dispose of it Against Manton I could see no real grounds for suspicion In a general way we had been compelled to eliminate Millard early in our investigation Again I was brought in this analysis of the mystery to Werner One other point remained the identity of the nocturnal visitor to Tarrytown In connection with that I remembered the remark of Marilyn Werner was acting as he always acted when he was out late the night before she had said While my theories offered no explanation of the second man the watcher I saw with an inner feeling of triumph that everything again pointed to the director I determined not to tell my conclusion to Kennedy yet I did not want to distract him Besides I felt he would disagree What do you think of this Craig I suggested Suppose I start out while you re busy and try to dig up some more facts about these people Excellent was his reply I can t say how much longer my analysis will keep me By all means do so Walter I shall be here or if not I ll leave a note so you can find me Accordingly I took up my search determined to go slowly and carefully not to be misled by any promising but fallacious clues I knew that Werner would be working at the studio from all we had heard in the morning I determined upon a visit to his apartment in his absence From the telephone book I discovered that he lived at the Whistler Studios not far from Central Park on the middle West Side a new building I remembered inhabited almost entirely by artists and writers As I hurried down on the Subway then turned and walked east toward the Park I racked my brain for an excuse to get in Entering the lower reception hall I learned from the boy that the director had a suite on the top floor high enough to look over the roofs of the adjoining buildings directly into the wide expanse of green and road of pond and trees beyond mister Werner isn t in though the boy added doubtfully without ringing the apartment I know it I rejoined hastily I told him I d meet him here this afternoon however On a chance I went on with a knowing smile I guess it was pretty late when he came in last night I ll say so grinned the youth friendly all of a sudden He had interpreted the remark as I intended he should He believed that Werner and I had been out together I remember he volunteered because I had to do an extra shift of duty last night worse luck It must have been after four o clock I was almost asleep when I heard the taxi at the door I wonder what company he got the taxi from I remarked casually I tried to get one uptown I paused I didn t want to get into a maze of falsehood from which I would be unable to extricate myself I don t know he replied It looked like one of the Maroon taxis from up at the Central Park Hotel on the next block but I m not sure I think I won t go upstairs yet I said finally There s another call I ought to make If mister Werner comes in tell him I ll be back I knew very well that Werner would not return but I thought that the bluff might pave the way for getting upstairs and into the apartment a little later Meanwhile I had another errand The boy nodded a good by as I passed out through the grilled iron doors to the street Less than five minutes afterward I was at the booth of the Maroon Taxi Company at the side of the main entrance of the Central Park Hotel Here the starter proved to be a loquacious individual and I caught him fortunately in the slowest part of the afternoon Removing a pipe and pushing a battered cap to the back of a bald head he pulled out the sheets of the previous day Before me were recorded all the calls for taxicab service with the names of drivers addresses of calls and destinations Although the quarters in the booth were cramped and close and made villainous by the reek of the man s pipe I began to scan the lists eagerly It had been a busy night even down to the small hours of the morning and I had quite a job As I came nearer and nearer to the end my hopes ebbed however When I was through I had failed to identify a single call that might have been Werner s Several fares had been driven to and from the Grand Central Station probably the means by which he made the trip to Tarrytown In each case the record had shown the Central Park Hotel in the other column not the Whistler Studios I was forced to give up this clue and it hurt I was not built for a detective I guess for I almost quit then and there prepared to return to the laboratory and Kennedy But I remembered my first intention and made my way back to the Whistler Studios Anyhow I reflected Werner would hardly have summoned a car from a place so near his home had he wished to keep his trip a secret It was more important for me to gain access to his quarters There it was quite possible I might find something valuable I wondered if I would be justified in breaking in or if I would succeed if I attempted it Things proved easier than I expected My first visit unquestionably had prepared the way The hallboy took me up in the elevator himself without telephoning took me to Werner s door rang the bell and spoke to the colored valet who opened it As I grasped the presence of the servant in the little suite I was glad I had not tried my hand at forcing an entrance I had quite anticipated an empty apartment The darky pleasant voiced polite and well trained bowed me into a little den and proceeded to lay out a large box of cigarettes on the table beside me as well as a humidor well filled with cigars of good quality I took one of the latter accepting a light and glancing about Certainly this was in contrast with Manton s apartment There was nothing garish ornate or spectacular here Richly lavishly furnished everything was in perfect taste revealing the hand of an artist It might have been a bit bizarre reflecting the nervous temperament of its owner Even the servant showed the touch of his master hovering about to make sure I was comfortable even to bringing a stack of the latest magazines I hope he didn t sense my thoughts for I cursed him inwardly I wanted to be alone Ordinarily I would have enjoyed this but now I had become a detective and it was necessary to rummage about and quickly The sudden ringing of the telephone took the valet out into the tiny hall of the suite and gave me the opportunity I wished Phelps apparently was calling up to leave some message for Werner which I could not get as the valet took it What I wondered was Phelps telephoning here for Why not at the studio It looked strange I lost no time in speculation over that however The moment I was left to myself I jumped up and rushed to a writing desk a carved antique which had caught my eye upon my entrance which I had studied from my place in the easy chair It was unlocked and I opened it without compunction With an alert ear to warn me the moment the colored boy hung up I first gazed rather helplessly at a huge pile of literary litter Clearly there was no time to go through all of that I gave the papers a cursory inspection without disturbing them hoping to catch some name or something which might prove to be a random clue but I was less lucky than Kennedy had been in his casual look at Manton s desk the afternoon before Still able to hear the valet at the telephone I reached down and opened the top drawer of the desk Here perhaps I might be more fortunate One glance and my heart gave a startled leap There in a compartment of the drawer I saw a hypodermic needle in fact two of them and a bottle On the desk was a fountain pen ink dropper a new one which had never been used I reached over pressed its little bulb uncorked the bottle inserted the glass point sucked up some of the contents placed the bulb right side up in my waistcoat pocket and recorked the bottle Next I took and pocketed one of the two needles both of which were alike as far as I could see Then I heard a good by in the hall I closed drawer and desk hastily As I caught the click of the receiver of the telephone on its hook I was halfway across the floor Before the colored boy could enter again I was back in my chair my head literally in a whirl What a stroke of good fortune I had no expectation of proving Werner to be the guilty man by so simple a method as this however If he were the slayer of the star he would be too clever to leave anything so incriminating about I have always quarreled with Poe s theory in The Purloined Letter believing that the obvious is no place to hide anything outside of fiction What I conceived rather was that Werner really was a dope fiend The nature of the drug Kennedy would tell me very easily from the sample Establishing Werner s possession of the needles was another point in my chain of presumptions showing that he was familiar with their use and added to that was the psychological effect upon him of the habit a habit responsible in many other cases for murders as skillfully carried out as that of Stella Lamar often too without the slightest shred of real motive I recalled Werner s habitually nervous manner and was sure now that the needles actually were used by him Was it due to the high pressure of his profession Had that constant high tension forced him to find relief in the most violent relaxation Elated I was tempted at first to crowd my luck I wondered if I could not discover another ampulla such as the chauffeur McGroarty had picked up in his car When Werner s servant almost apologetically explained that the telephone message was from a near by shop and that he would have to leave me for a matter of ten or fifteen minutes I assured him that it was all right and that I would occupy myself with a magazine The moment he was out the door I sprang to action and began a minute search of every nook and cranny of the rooms But gradually a sense of growing fear and trepidation took hold of me Suppose after all Werner should return home unexpectedly The colored boy did not seem surprised that I should wait a slight indication that it was possible Further I could never tell when the darky might not return himself breaking in upon me without warning and discovering me At the best I was not a skillful investigator I did not know just where to look for hidden evidences of poison nor was I able to work fast for fear of leaving too tangible marks of my actions behind me A great perspiration stood out on my forehead Gradually a trembling took hold of my limbs and communicated itself to my fingers After all it was essential that Werner be kept in ignorance of my suspicions granting they were correct It would be fatal if I should frighten him inadvertently so that he would take to flight Realizing my foolhardiness I returned to my chair at last picking up a magazine at random I did so not a moment too soon A slight sound caught my ear and I looked up to see the valet already halfway into the room His tread was so soft I never would have heard him I don t think I ll wait any longer I remarked rising and stretching slightly as though I had been seated all the time I ll ring up a little later perhaps come back after I get in touch with mister Werner Who shall I say was here sah the boy asked with just a trace of darky dialect Above all I didn t want to alarm Werner I could not repeat the explanation I had allowed the attendant downstairs to assume from my remark that I was a friend who had been out with the director the night before I should have to take a chance that Werner s servant and the hallboy would not compare notes and that the latter would say nothing to the director upon his arrival I m an old friend from the Coast I explained with a show of taking the negro into my confidence I wanted to surprise him and so I slipped a half dollar into a willing palm if you ll say nothing until I ve seen him He beamed Yes sah You jus count on George sah Downstairs I wondered if I could seal the tongue of the youth who had accommodated me before Then I discovered that he had gone off duty It would be extremely unlikely that he would be about until the following day I smiled and hastened out to the street Once in the open air again I realized the full extent of the risk I had taken All at once it struck me that no amount of explanation from either Kennedy or myself would serve to mollify Werner if he were innocent and learned of my visit I doubted in this moment of afterthought that I would escape censure from Kennedy who surely would not want his case jeopardized by precipitate actions upon my part I began to run to get away from the Whistler Studios as fast as possible Then I saw I had grown panicky and I checked myself But I hurried to the Subway and up to the university again and to the laboratory eager to compare notes with Kennedy If I were Alphonse Dupin he remarked calmly grasping my excitement I would deduce that you have discovered something I would also deduce that you believe it important and that you have no intention of withholding the information from me whatever it is Correct I answered grinning in spite of myself Then I handed him the needle telling him in a few brief words of my visit to Werner s apartment of the hallboy s confirmation of a nocturnal trip of some sort of my search of the desk and some other parts of the suite I fixed it so that he won t hear of my visit at least for some time He won t suspect who it was in any case Kennedy examined the hypodermic Not like the one used he murmured I thought that I explained It simply indicates he is a dope fiend and is familiar with the use of a needle Here I produced the ink filler which I had used to bring a sample of the contents of the bottle This seems to be what he uses What is it Kennedy sniffed then looked closely at the liquid through the glass of the tube It s a coca preparation he explained If Werner uses this he s unquestionably a regular drug addict Well I paused triumphantly the case against the chief director of Manton Pictures grows stronger all the time Not necessarily contradicted Kennedy perhaps to draw me out He s familiar with hypodermic syringes I repeated Which doesn t prove that no one else would use one Anyhow he was out until four A M last night and some one broke into Phelps s house to You can t establish the fact that he went out there There are plenty of other places he could have been until four in the morning But I can assume If you are going to assume anything Walter why not assume he was the second man the man who watched the actual intruder I turned away despairing of my ability to convince Kennedy As a matter of fact I had forgotten the other prowler at Tarrytown Then I noticed that the one guinea pig in the separate cage was dead In an instant I was all curiosity to know the results of Kennedy s investigations Did you make any progress I asked Yes Now I noticed for the first time that he was in fine humor I had quite finished the first stage of my analysis when you came in Then what was it What was the poison that killed Stella Lamar I glanced at the stiff prone figure of the little animal Kennedy cleared his throat Well he replied I began the study with the discovery I made which I told you that strange proteins were present He picked up the ampulla and regarded it thoughtfully Then he fingered the bit of silk cut from the portieres It is a poison more deadly more subtle than any ever concocted by man Walter Yes I was painfully eager It is snake venom XVI ENID ASSISTS A poison more subtle than any concocted by man repeated Kennedy It was a startling declaration and left me quite speechless for the moment We know next to nothing of the composition of the protein bodies in the snake venoms which have such terrific and quick physiological effects on man Kennedy went on They have been studied it is true and studied a great deal but we cannot say that there are any adequate tests by which the presence of these proteins can be recognized However everything points to the conclusion now that it was snake venom and my physiological tests on the guinea pig seem to confirm it I see no reason now to doubt that it was snake venom The fact of the matter is that the snake venoms are about the safest of poisons for the criminal to use for the reason of the difficulty they give in any chemical analysis That is only another proof of the diabolical cleverness of our guilty person whoever it may be Later I ll identify the particular kind of venom used Just now I feel it is more important to discover the actual motive for the crime In the morning I have a plan which may save me further work here in the laboratory but for to night I feel I have earned a rest and a smile I shall rest by searching out the motives of these temperamental movie folk a little more As he spoke he slipped out of his acid stained smock What do you mean As often he rather baffled me It s nearly dinner time and we re going out together Walter down to Jacques Why Jacques Because I phoned your friend Belle Balcom and she informed me that that was the place where we would be apt to find the elite of the film world dining I acquiesced of course We hurried to the apartment first for a few necessary changes and preparations then we started for the Times Square section in a taxi I never heard of the use of snake venom before I remarked settling back in the cushions that is deliberately by a criminal to poison anyone There are cases replied Craig absently Just how does the venom act I believe it is generally accepted that there are two agents present in the secretion One is a peptone and the other a globulin One is neurotoxic the other hemolytic Not only is the general nervous system attacked instantly but the coagulability of the blood is destroyed One agent in the venom attacks the nerve cells the other destroys the red corpuscles You suspected something of this kind then when you first examined Stella Lamar Exactly You see the victim of a snake bite often is unable to move or speak Doctor Blake observed that in the case of the stricken star Her nerves were affected resulting in paralysis of the muscles of the heart and lungs and giving us some symptoms of suffocation Then the blood as a result of the attack of the venom is always left dark and liquid That too I observed in the sample sent me from Tarrytown The snake Kennedy continued administers the poison by fangs more delicate than any hypodermic Nature s apparatus is more precise than the finest appliances devised for the use of a surgeon by our instrument makers The fangs are like needles with obliquely cut points and slit like outlets The poison glands correspond to the bulb of a syringe They are in reality highly modified salivary glands From them when the serpent strikes is ejected a pale straw colored half oleaginous fluid You might swallow it with impunity But once in the blood through a cut or wound it is deadly There could be no snake in this case I remarked The fangs of a serpent make two punctures don t they while here there was just the one scratch Of course there were no fangs when the deed was actually done he rejoined impatiently We ve traced everything to the needle in the portieres and it is my belief that it was part of an all glass hypodermic with a platinum iridium point It could hardly have been anything like the coarser syringe used by Werner nor do I think it possible that the point of an ordinary needle would hold sufficient venom since it would dry and form a coating like the incrustation on the inside of the ampulla McGroarty found That was the venom I asked Yes I found it in the ampulla and in the stain on the portiere where the needle had pierced through The towel though Is something else First thing in the morning we ll follow that up as I promised you Meanwhile let s concentrate on motives A long line of private cars and taxicabs outside Jacques testified to the popularity of the restaurant At the door stood a huge bulking negro resplendent in the glaring finery of his uniform It seemed to me that people literally were thronging into the place for it was cleverly advertised as a center of night life Inside the famous darky jazz band was in full swing There was lilt and rhythm to the melody produced by the grinning blacks and not a free arm or foot or shoulder or head of any of them but did not sway in time to their syncopated music We were shown to a table on a sort of gallery or mezzanine floor which extended around three sides of the interior Below in the center was the space for dancing surrounded by groups and pairs of diners Stairs led to the balcony on both sides as though the management expected none of their guests to resist the lure of the dance between courses The band I noticed was at the farther end on an elevated dais so that the contortions of the various players could be seen above the heads of those on the floor We were at the rail so that we commanded a view of the entire place a location I guessed had been maneuvered by Kennedy with a word to the head waiter The only tables invisible to us were those directly beneath but it would be a simple matter to cross around during any dance number to view them As we took our seats the lights were dimmed suddenly I realized that we had arrived in the midst of the cabaret and that it was the turn of one of the performers Kennedy however seemed to enjoy the entertainment an example of his ability to gain recreation whenever and however he wished to find relaxation under the oddest or most casual circumstances out of anything from people passing on the street to an impromptu concert of a street band In scanty garments in the glare of a multi colored spotlight the girl danced a hybrid of every dance from the earliest Grecian bacchanal to the latest alleged Apache importation from Paris I have often wondered at Jacques and places of the sort The intermingling of eating and drinking and dancing was curious What possible bearing this terpsichorean monstrosity might have upon the gastronomic inclinations of the audience it would have been difficult to fathom The lights flashed bright again and Kennedy gave our order Meanwhile I glanced about at the people below us There was no one in sight I knew until I leaned well over the rail but upon doing that I felt little chills of excitement run from the top to the bottom of my spine for I discovered in a very prominent situation at the very edge of the dance floor a party of four of whom three very much concerned us Lloyd Manton back to the polished space behind him was unmistakable in evening clothes These bunched at his neck and revealed his habitual stoop as impartially as his business suits Across from him lounging upon the table likewise but more immaculately and skillfully tailored was Lawrence Millard The writer I noticed flourished his cigarette holder fully a foot in length and emphasized his remarks to the girl on his right with a rather characteristic gesture made with the second finger of his left hand The girl was Enid quite mistress of herself in a gown little more than no gown and the remarks were obviously confidential The other girl engrossed in Manton seemed a dangerously youthful and self conscious young lady Her hair flamed Titian red and her neck of which she displayed not half as much as Enid gave her much concern Kennedy Look I reached over to attract his attention Who s the second girl I wonder He became as interested as I was With a blatant flourish of saxophone and cornet and traps the band began a jazzy fox trot Instantly there was a rush from the tables for the floor Enid jumped to her feet moving her bare shoulders in the rhythm of the music Then Millard took firm hold of her and they wove their way into the crush It seemed to me that the little star was the very incarnation of the dance I envied her partner more than I dared admit to myself Manton and his companion rose also but more leisurely On her feet the girl did not seem so young although the second impression may have been the result of the length of her skirt and the long slim lines of her gown We watched both couples through the number then gave our attention to the food we had ordered Another dance a modified waltz revealed Enid in the arms of Manton I tried to determine from her actions if she felt any preference for the producer or for Millard when again she took the floor with him It was an idle effort of course The people surged out perhaps three or four times while we were at our meal Each time the party below jumped up in response to the music At our cigars finally I took to observing the other diners wondering what we had gained by coming here Suddenly I realized that Kennedy was rising to greet some one approaching our table Turning rising also I went through all the miseries of the bashful lover It was Enid herself I caught sight of you looking over the rail while I was dancing she told Kennedy accepting a chair pulled around by the waiter I knew you saw me Also I glanced up and found that you were perfectly well aware of the location of our table So engagingly unsociable creature Why didn t you come down and say Hello or ask me for a dance Perhaps I intended to a little later Yes she exclaimed in mockery You see since Mecca won t go to the pilgrim the pilgrim has to come to Mecca Did you ever hear of Mohammed and the mountain Miss Faye Kennedy asked Of course That s the regular expression But I agree with Barnum As he said some people can be original some of the time and some people can be original all of the time and I propose to be original always like a baby with molasses Kennedy laughed for indeed she was irresistible Then she turned to me placing one of her warm little hands upon mine And Jamie she purred Have you forgotten little Enid altogether Won t won t YOU come down and dance I I can t I exploded in agony I don t know how And I thought that I would never dare trust myself with her glistening shoulders clasped close to me with her slim bare arm placed around my neck as I had watched it slip about the collar of Millard Now that the pilgrim is at Mecca Kennedy suggested interrupting cruelly as I thought Oh In an instant I sensed that I was forgotten and I was hurt There s something which came out this afternoon at the studio she began and I wonder if you know Larry that s mister Millard assures me it is true and and I think you ought to hear about it I I want to assist all I can in solving the mystery of Stella Lamar s death even though Stella s unfortunate end has meant my opportunity What is it Miss Faye Kennedy was studying her It s about Jack Gordon He s been trying to hold up the company for fifteen hundred a week which would double his salary perhaps you ve heard that Kennedy nodded although it was news to him I ve been thinking about Gordon he murmured Anyway she went on it s gone around that he s desperately in need of money and that that is why he s so insistent upon the increase It seems he owes everyone In particular he owes Phelps some huge sums and old Phelps is on his tail hollering and raising Ned Phelps you know has uses for money himself just now You had heard Again Kennedy evaded a direct answer Money is fearfully tight of course he remarked encouraging her to continue Yes she repeated Phelps is terribly hard up and after Gordon And that s not all about our handsome leading man mister Kennedy She leaned forward A certain intensity crept into her voice She began to toy with his sleeve with the slender fingers of one hand as though in that manner to compel his greater attention You know Stella Lamar really was in love with Jack Gordon In fact she was daffy over him And now I ve found out that he was borrowing money from her was taking nearly every cent she earned to sink in his speculations Do you get that Enid s eyes snapped Most certainly I understood I knew well the type of Stella She had made many men give up to her motor cars expensive furs jewelry all manner of presents But in the end she had found one man to whom she in turn was willing to yield all But what of him In the last few weeks they tell me poor Stella disposed of many of her handsome presents from men like Manton and Phelps and others all to get money to give to him At the end she even raised money on her jewelry I I think you ll find it all in pawn now if you ll investigate I don t doubt but that poor Stella died without a penny to her name I was so surprised at this information that I failed to study Kennedy s face I was completely jolted from my own rapt contemplation of the very soft curves of Enid s back For here was a motive at last Gordon was a possible suspect I had failed to take even halfway seriously Yet the leading man was desperately pressed for money had had a disgraceful fight with Phelps as we already knew and not only owed huge sums to his fiancee as Enid now explained but had quarreled with her just prior to her death according to his own admission in the investigation at Tarrytown Suddenly the music struck up once more Enid rose adjusting the straps of her gown There she exclaimed smiling abruptly I thought you ought to know that though I hate to peddle gossip Now I must hurry back I ve been away long enough But come down later and dance She swept off without further formality An instant afterward we saw her in the clasp of Millard once again We watched during the number and encore then Kennedy called for the check Let s go up to the apartment he suggested I d like to talk some of these things out with you It will help me clarify my own impressions Underneath the balcony I noticed Kennedy turn for a last glance at Manton s party I paused to look also Enid was leaning forward talking to Millard earnestly emphasizing what she had to say with characteristic movements of her head She s pumping Millard for more information about Stella Lamar I remarked Kennedy had no comment XVII AN APPEAL We strolled up Broadway resisting the attraction of a garish new motion picture palace at which Manton s previous release with Stella Lamar was now showing to capacity much to the delight of the exhibitor who greatly complimented himself on his good fortune in being able to take advantage of the newspaper sensation over the affair On we walked Kennedy mostly in silent deduction I knew until we came to the upper regions of the great thoroughfare turned off and headed toward our apartment on the Heights not far from the university We had scarcely settled ourselves for a quiet hour in our quarters when the telephone rang I answered To my amazement I found that it was Marilyn Loring Is Professor Kennedy in she asked Yes Miss Loring Just a Never mind calling him to the phone mister Jameson I ve been trying to find him all evening He was not at the laboratory although I waited over an hour Just tell him that there s something I am very anxious to consult him about Ask him if it will be all right for me to run up to see him just a few minutes I explained to Kennedy Let her come along he said as surprised as I was Then he added humorously I seem to be father confessor to night After sinking back in my seat in comfort once more I observed a quiet elation in Kennedy s manner All at once it struck me what he was doing The multitude of considerations in this case the many cross leads to be followed had confused me But now I realized that after all this was only the approved Kennedy method the mode of procedure which had never failed to produce results for him Without allowing himself to be disturbed by the great number of people concerned he had calmly started to pit them one against the other encouraging each to talk about the rest making a show of his apparent inaction and lack of haste so that they in turn would shake off the excitement immediately following the death of the girl and thereby reveal their normal selves to his keen observation Not five minutes passed before Marilyn was announced Evidently she had been seeking us eagerly for she had probably telephoned from a near by pay station mister Kennedy she began I am going to find this very hard to say Really he assured her there is no reason why you should not repose your confidence in me My only interest is to solve the mystery and to see that justice is satisfied Beyond that nothing would give me greater happiness than to be of service to you It s it s about Merle Shirley she started bravely Then all at once she broke down The strain of two days had been too much for her Kennedy lighted a fresh cigar realizing that he could best aid her to recover her composure by making no effort to do so For several moments she sobbed silently a handkerchief at her eyes Then she straightened with a half smile dabbing at the drops of moisture remaining With her wet eyes and flushed cheeks she was revealed to me again as a very genuine girl wholly unspoiled by her outward mask of sophistication Furthermore at this instant she was gloriously pretty Again why do you play vampire roles Miss Loring I asked as quickly as the thought flashed to me I think you d be an ideal ingenue About a thousand people have told me that she rejoined As she replied her smile took full possession of her features My idiotic repetition entirely out of place had served to restore her self control to her No the public won t stand for it They ve been trained to know me as a vamp and a vamp I remain Facing Kennedy she sobered Merle Shirley and I were engaged she went on That you know Then poor Stella made a fool of him She didn t mean any harm any real harm but I don t think she knew how deep he feels or just what a fiery temper he has Finally he found out that she was only playing with him He was perfectly terrible At first I thought he had killed her in a burst of passion I really thought that Yes Kennedy was interested He needed no pretense When I asked him point blank he said he didn t A very wonderful light came into Marilyn Loring s eyes at this instant Whatever else he would do Professor Kennedy he wouldn t lie to me that I know He would tell me the truth because he knows I would shield him no matter what the cost You simply want to assure me of his innocence suggested Kennedy No There was a touch of scorn to the little negative You don t believe him guilty you didn t even when I did Then But he knows something something about the murder of Stella and he won t tell me what it is I I m afraid for him He isn t sleeping at night and I believe he s watching somebody at the studio and I know it s the WOMAN S intuition Professor she emphasized the word and paused he s in danger He s in some great threatening danger What do you wish me to do Miss Loring I want you to protect him and slowly she colored up and around and about her eyes as she always did until she wasn t unlike an Indian maid and no one must know I ve been up to see you Gravely Kennedy bowed her to the door assuring her he would do all that lay in his power When he returned I was ready for him Now I exclaimed Now say it isn t Werner Here is Merle Shirley watching some one at the studio Isn t that likely to be the director And if Shirley is watching Werner you have the explanation for the second intruder at Tarrytown last night Shirley is big enough and strong enough to have given the deputy a nice swift tussle A little tall I m afraid Kennedy remarked You can t go by the deputy s impressions He didn t really remember much of anything Certainly he was unobserving Perhaps you re right Walter Kennedy smiled But how about Gordon he added There s genuine motive money Or Shirley himself I attempted to be sarcastic There s genuine motive Stella made a fool out of him It wasn t a murder of passion Kennedy reminded me No one in a white heat of rage would study up on snake venoms If it were a slow smoldering Shirley s anger wasn t that kind But good heavens As usual I arrived nowhere in an argument with Kennedy Circumstantial evidence points to Werner almost altogether You ve forgotten one point in your chain Walter What s that Whoever took the needle from the curtain last night scratched himself on it and left blood spots on the portieres tiny ones but real blood spots nevertheless That means the intruder inoculated himself with venom I doubt that the poison was so dry as to be ineffectual If it was Werner how do you account for the fact that he is still alive Do you I guess my eyes went wide do you expect to dig up a dead man somewhere Is there some one we suspect and haven t seen since yesterday He didn t answer preferring to tantalize me How do you account for it yourself I demanded somewhat hotly Let s call it a day Walter he rejoined Let s go to bed XVIII THE ANTIVENIN I slept late in the morning so that Kennedy had to wake me When we had finished breakfast he led the way to the laboratory all without making any effort to satisfy my curiosity There he started packing up the tubes and materials he had been studying in the case rather than resuming his investigations What s the idea I asked finally unable to contain myself any longer You carry this package he directed I ll take the other I obeyed somewhat sulkily I m afraid You see he added as we left the building and hurried to the taxi stand near the campus the next problem is to identify the particular kind of venom that was used Besides I want to know the nature of the spots on the towel you found They certainly were not of venom I have my suspicions what they really are He paused while we selected a vehicle and made ourselves comfortable To save time he went on I thought I d just go over to the Castleton Institute You know in their laboratories the famous Japanese investigator Doctor Nagoya has made some marvelous discoveries concerning the venom of snakes It is his specialty a matter to which he has practically devoted his life Therefore I expect that he will be able to confirm certain suspicions of mine very quickly or a shrug explode a theory which has slowly been taking form in the back of my head When we dismissed the taxi in front of the institute I realized that this would be my first visit to this institution so lavishly endowed by the multi millionaire Castleton for the advancement of experimental science Kennedy s card sent in to Doctor Nagoya brought that eminent investigator out personally to see us He was the very finest type of Oriental savant a member of the intellectual nobility of the strange Eastern land only recently made receptive to the civilization of the West When he and Kennedy chatted together in low tones for a few moments it was hard for me to grasp that each belonged to a basic race strain fundamentally different from the other East and West had met upon the plane of modern science The two were simply men of specialized knowledge the Japanese pre eminent in one field Kennedy in another Carefully and thoroughly Kennedy and Nagoya went over the results which Kennedy had already obtained After a moment Doctor Nagoya conducted us to his research room Now let me show you said the Oriental In a moment they were deep in the mysteries of an even more minute analysis than Kennedy had made before I took a turn about the room finding nothing more understandable than the study holding Kennedy s interest Though I could not grasp it curiosity kept me hovering close You see Nagoya spoke as he finished the test he was making at the moment without a doubt it is crotalin the venom of the rattlesnake Crotalus horridus There was no snake actually present I hastened to explain breaking in Then at a glance from Kennedy I stopped abashed for all this had been made clear to the scientist It is not necessary Nagoya replied turning to me with the politeness characteristic of the East Crotalin can be obtained now with fair ease It is a drug used in a new treatment of epilepsy which is being tried out at many hospitals I nodded my thanks not wanting to interrupt again Kennedy pressed on to the next point he wished established That was the spot on the portieres Now the ampulla Also crotalin Doctor Nagoya spoke positively How about this solution Kennedy took from my package the tube with the liquid made from the faint spots on the towel which I had found and which had been our first clue It is not crotalin The Japanese turned to his laboratory table Kennedy muttered some vague suggestions which were too technical for me but which seemed to enable Nagoya to eliminate a great deal of work The test progressed rapidly Finally the savant stepped back regarding the solution with a very satisfied smile It is he explained carefully some of the very anticrotalus venin which we have perfected right here in the institute Kennedy nodded I suspected as much There was great elation in his manner You see I had heard all about your wonderful work Yes Nagoya waved his hand around at the wonderfully equipped room only one detail in the many arrangements for medical research made possible by the generosity of Castleton Yes he repeated proud of his laboratory as he well might be we have made a great deal of progress in the development of protective sera antivenins we call them Are they distributed widely Kennedy asked thoughtfully All over the world We are practically the only source of supply How do you obtain the serum in quantity From horses treated with increasing doses of the snake venom A question struck me as I remembered the peculiar double action of the poison Can you tell me just how the antivenin counteracts the effects of the venom I inquired of the savant Surely he replied It neutralizes one of the two elements in the venom the nervous poison thus enabling the individual to devote all his vitality to overcoming the irritant poison It is the nervous poison that is the chief death dealing agent producing paralysis of the heart and respiration We advise all travelers to carry the protective serum if they are likely to be exposed to snake bites Kennedy picked up the tube containing the solution made from the towel spots This antivenin was your product doctor Probably so was the precise answer Then the purchasers can be identified I suggested We have no record of ordinary purchasers Nagoya explained slowly Kennedy was keenly disappointed at that and showed it However he thanked the scientist cordially and we departed Outside he turned to me Do you understand now why the night intruder at Tarrytown did not die if he is one of our suspects from the scratch of the needle You mean he had taken an injection of antivenin before Exactly We are dealing with a criminal of diabolical cleverness Not only did he make all his plans to kill Miss Lamar with the greatest possible care but he prepared against accident to himself He was taking no chances He inoculated himself with a protective serum The needle of the syringe he used for that purpose he wiped upon the towel you discovered in the washroom XIX AROUND THE CIRCLE I d like to have another talk with Millard about that Fortune Features affair remarked Kennedy It was the third morning after the death of Stella Lamar and I found him half through breakfast when I rose About him were piled moving picture and theatrical publications daily weekly and monthly At the moment I caught him he had spread wide open the inner page of the Daily Metropolitan a sheet devoted almost exclusively to sports and the amusement fields I went around to glance over his shoulder He pointed to a small item under a heading of recent plans and changes FORTUNE FEATURES It is hinted to the Metropolitan Man about Broadway by those in a position to know but who cannot yet be quoted that Fortune Features is about to absorb a number of the largest competing companies Rumors of great changes in the picture world have been current for some weeks and this is the first reliable information to be given out It is premature to give details of the new combination or to mention names but Fortune s strong backing in Wall Street will we are assured have a stabilizing influence at a critical time in the industry Seems to be a lot of hot air I said There isn t a name mentioned Everything is by those in a position to know and rumors of and it is premature to give details or mention names Bah Kennedy turned to places he had marked in several of the other periodicals and papers and I read them Each was substantially to the effect of the note in the Metropolitan although worded differently and generally printed as a news item It s a feeler Kennedy stated There s something back of it When I caught the reference to Fortune Features in the Metropolitan which I ve been reading the past two days I sent the boy out for every movie publication he could find Result half a dozen repetitions of the hint that Fortune is expanding That means that it is deliberate publicity You think this has something to do with the case I don t see the name of Manton mentioned once Manton is a man who seeks the front page on every opportunity You remember of course what Millard told us Somehow I smell a rat If nothing else develops for this morning I want to find Millard and talk to him again I believe Manton is up to something The sharp sound of our buzzer interrupted us Because I was on my feet I went to the door To my amazement I found it was Phelps who was our very early visitor I hope you ll excuse this intrusion he apologized to Kennedy pushing by me with the rudeness which seemed inherent in the man Then he recognized the sheet still spread out on the table I see you too have been reading the Metropolitan Yes Kennedy admitted languidly There is nothing about Manton Pictures though Manton Pictures hell In an instant Phelps exploded and the thin veneer of politeness was gone With a shaking finger he pointed to the item which we had just been reading and discussing Did you read that Did you see the reference to stabilizing the industry STABILIZING It ought to be spelled stable izing for they lead all the donkeys into stalls and tie them up and let them kick He stopped momentarily for sheer inability to continue I suppose you don t know Manton is behind this Fortune Features We were aware of the fact Kennedy told him quietly Phelps looked from one to the other of us keenly as if he had thought to surprise us and had been disappointed Nervously he began to pace the floor Perhaps you know also that things haven t been going just right with Manton Pictures Kennedy straightened When I asked you at Tarrytown just two mornings ago whether there was any trouble between Manton and yourself you answered that there was not Phelps flushed I didn t want to air my financial difficulties with Manton My my answer was truthful the way you meant your question Manton and I have had no words no quarrel no disagreement of a personal nature What is the trouble with Manton Pictures They are wasting money throwing it right and left That pay roll of theirs is preposterous The waste itself is beyond belief sometimes four and five cameras on a scene retakes upon the slightest provocation even sets rebuilt because some minor detail fails to suit the artistic eye of the director Werner supposed to watch all the companies doesn t half know his business In the making of a five reel film they will overtake sometimes as much as eighty or a hundred thousand feet of negative in each of two cameras when twenty thousand is enough overtake for anyone That alone is five to ten thousand dollars for negative stock almost fifteen with the sample print and developing And the cost of stock mister Kennedy is the smallest item All the extra length is long additional weeks of pay roll and overhead expense I put an auditor and a film expert on the accounts of Stella Lamar s last picture By their figures just sixty three thousand dollars was absolutely thrown away Kennedy rose folding the newspaper carefully while he collected his thoughts My dear mister Phelps he stated finally that is simply inefficiency I doubt if it is anything criminal certainly there is no connection with the death of Stella Lamar my only interest in Manton Pictures Phelps was very grave There is every connection with the death of Stella Lamar What do you mean mister Kennedy what I m going to say to you I cannot substantiate in any court of law Furthermore I m laying myself open to action for libel so I must not be quoted But I want you to understand that Stella was inescapably wound up with all of Manton s financial schemes His money maneuvers determined her social life her friends everything She was then as Enid Faye will be now his come on his decoy Manton has no scruples of any sort whatsoever He is dishonest tricky a liar and a cheat If I could prove it I would tell him so but he s too clever for me I do know however that he pulled the strings which controlled every move Stella Lamar ever made When she went to dinner with me it was because Manton wished her to do so She was his right hand his ears almost his mouth I have no doubt but that her death is the direct result of some business deal of his something directly to do with his financial necessities Kennedy did not glance up Those are very serious assertions It is a very serious matter To show how unscrupulous Manton is I can demonstrate that he is wrecking Manton Pictures deliberately I ve told you of the waste Only the other day I came into the studio Werner was putting up a great ballroom set You saw it No that isn t the one I mean I mean the first one He had it all up then some little thing didn t suit him The next day I came in again All struck sloughed every bit of it and a new one started Lloyd I said just think a minute that s my money What good did it do He even began to alter the new set He would only go on encouraging Werner and the other directors to change their sets to lose time in trying for foolish effects anything at all to pad the expense You think I am romancing but you don t understand the film world Phelps hurried on angrily Do you know that Enid Faye s contract is not with Manton Pictures but with Manton himself That means he can take her away from me after he has made her a star with my money at my expense Why should he wreck Manton Pictures you ask Do you know that bit by bit on the pretext that he needed the funds for this that or the other thing Manton has sold out his entire interest in the company to me It is all mine now I tell you complained Phelps bitterly he couldn t seem to wreck the company fast enough Why Do you realize that there isn t room both for this older company and the new Fortune Features Can you see that if Manton Pictures fails the Fortune company will be able to pick up the studio and all the equipment for a song I m the fall guy And yet Kennedy all the efforts to wreck Manton Pictures would have failed because The Black Terror was too sure a success In spite of all the expense in spite of every effort to wreck it that picture would have made half a million dollars Stella s acting and Millard s story and script would have put it over But now Millard s contract has expired and Manton has signed him for Fortune Features Enid Faye will be made a star by The Black Terror but she is not now the drawing power to put it over big as Stella would have done I tell you Kennedy the death of Stella Lamar has completed the wreck of Manton Pictures Kennedy jumped to his feet There was a hard light in his eyes I had never seen before Do I understand you Phelps he snapped Are you accusing Manton of the cold blooded murder of Stella Lamar to further various financial schemes Hardly Phelps blanched a bit and I thought that a shudder swept over him I don t mean anything like that at all What I mean is that Manton in encouraging various sorts of dissension to wreck the company inadvertently fanned the flames of passion of those about her and it resulted in her death Who killed her I don t know Grudgingly I admitted that this seemed open and frank At Tarrytown Kennedy went on I asked you if Stella Lamar was making any trouble had threatened to quit Manton Pictures and you said no Is that still your answer For several months she had been up stage That was not because she wanted to make trouble but because she had fallen in love Manton found he couldn t handle her as he had previously Do you suspect Manton of killing her himself I don t suspect anyone That is an honest answer mister Kennedy What do you know about Fortune Features The banker s eye fell on the newspaper again I know who this new Wall Street fellow is I ve got my scouts out working for me It s Leigh that s who it is And I m sore I have a right to be Phelps was getting more and more heated by the moment I tell you he almost shouted this fake movie business is the modern gold brick game all right Never again I was amazed at the Machiavellian cleverness of Manton Here he was on one hand openly working with yet secretly ruining the Manton Pictures while on the other hand he was covertly building up the competing Fortune Features Kennedy paced out into the little hall of our suite and back He faced our visitor once more Why did you come to see me this morning At our last encounter you may recall you said you wished you could throw me down the steps Phelps smiled ruefully That was a mistake It was the way I felt but I m sorry Now Again the black clouds overshadowed the features of the financier Now I want you to bring out and prove the things I ve told you The malice showed in his voice plainly for the first time I want it proved in court that Manton is a cheap crook When you uncover the murderer of Stella Lamar you will find that the moral responsibility for her death traces right back to Lloyd Manton I want him driven out of the business Kennedy s attitude changed As he escorted Phelps to the door his tones were self controlled Anything of the sort is beyond my province My task is simply to find the person who killed the girl When the financier was gone I turned to Kennedy eagerly What do you think I asked I think more than ever that we should investigate Fortune Features Let s have a look at the telephone book There was no studio of the new corporation in New York but we did find one listed in New Jersey just across the river at Fort Lee We walked from the university down the hill and over to the ferry On the other side a ten minutes street car ride took us to our destination Facing us was a huge barn like structure set down in the midst of a little park Inquiry for Manton brought no response whatever rather surprise that we should be asking for him here However I reflected that that was exactly what we ought to expect if Manton was working under cover The girl at the telephone switchboard smiling at Kennedy had a suggestion They re taking a storm exterior down in the meadow she explained Perhaps he s down there among the visitors or perhaps there s someone who will be able to give you some information I glanced outdoors at the brightly shining sun A storm I repeated incredulously Yes she smiled It might interest you to see it Following her directions we started across country leaving the studio building some distance behind and entering a broad expanse of meadow beyond a thin clump of trees At the farther end we could see a large group of people and paraphernalia which at the distance we could not make out However it was not long after we emerged from the trees that we perceived they were photographing squarely in our direction Several began waving their arms wildly at us and shouting Kennedy and I understanding turned and advanced keeping well out of the camera lines along the edge of the field Hello a voice greeted us as we approached the group standing back and watching the action To my surprise it was Millard with the spectators I looked about for Manton but did not see him nor anyone else we knew It s a storm and cyclone said Millard his attention rather on what was going on than on us For the moment we said nothing The scene before us was indeed interesting Half a dozen aeroplane engines and propellers had been set up outside the picture and anchored securely in place The wind from them was actually enough to knock a man down Rain was furnished by hose playing water into the whirling blades sending it driving into the scene with the fury of a tropical storm Back of the propellers half a dozen men were frantically at work shoveling into them sand and dirt creating an amazingly realistic cyclone We arrived in the midst of the cyclone scene as the dust storm was ending and the torrential rain succeeded For the storm a miniature village had been constructed in break away fashion partially sawed through and tricked for the proper moment Many objects were controlled by invisible wires including an actual horse and buggy which seemed to be lifted bodily and carried away Roofs flew off walls crashed in actors and actresses were knocked flat as some few of them failed to gain their cyclone cellars Altogether it was a storm of such efficiency as Nature herself could scarcely have furnished and all staged with the streaming sunlight which made photography possible Pandemonium reigned Cameras were grinding directors were bawling through megaphones all was calculated chaos Yet it took only a glance to see that some marvelous effects were being caught here At the conclusion I recognized suddenly the little leading lady It was the girl we had seen with Manton at Jacques cabaret That s the way to take a picture exclaimed Millard Everything right no expense spared I came over to see it done It s wonderful Yes was Kennedy s answer but it must be very costly It is all of that said Millard But what of it if the film makes a big clean up I wouldn t have missed this for anything Werner never staged a spectacle like this in his life Fortune Features are going to set a new mark in pictures But can they keep it up Have they the money Millard shrugged his shoulders Manton Pictures can t that s a cinch Phelps has reached the end of his rope I guess I m afraid the trouble with him was that he was thinking of too many things besides pictures There was no mistaking the meaning of the remark Millard was still cut by Stella s desertion of him for the broker I caught Kennedy s glance but neither of us cared to refer to her Where can I find Manton now Kennedy asked Did you try his office at seven hundred and twenty nine was Millard s suggestion No I wanted to see this place first Well you ll most likely find him there I ve got to go back to the city myself some scenes of The Black Terror to rewrite to fit Enid better I ll motor you across the ferry and to the Subway At the Subway station Millard left us and we proceeded to Manton s executive offices in a Seventh Avenue skyscraper built for and devoted exclusively to the film business Manton s business suite was lavishly furnished but not quite as ornate and garish as his apartment The promoter himself welcomed us for no matter how busy he was at any hour he always seemed to have time to stop and chat Well how goes it He pushed over a box of expensive cigars Have you found out anything yet Had a visit from Phelps this morning Kennedy plunged directly into the subject watching the effect Manton did not betray anything except a quiet smile Poor old Phelps he said I guess he s pretty uneasy You know he has been speculating rather heavily in the market lately There was a time when I thought Phelps had a bank roll in reserve But it seems he has been playing the game on a shoestring after all Manton casually flicked the ashes from his cigar into a highly polished cuspidor as he leaned over I happen to have learned that to make his bluff good he has been taking money from his brokerage business here he nodded sagely his customers accounts you know Leigh knows the inside of everybody s affairs in Wall Street They say a quarter of a million is short at least To tell you the truth poor Stella took a good deal of Phelps s money Certainly his Manton Pictures holdings wouldn t leave him in the hole as deep as all that I reflected that this was quite the way of the world first framing up something on a boob then deprecating the ease with which he was trimmed Was it blackmail Stella had levied on Phelps I wondered Was she taking from him to give to Gordon Had Stella broken him Was she the real cause of the tangle in his affairs And had Phelps in insane passion revenged himself on her In the conversation with Manton there was certainly no hint of answer to my queries With all his ease Manton was the true picture promoter Seldom was he betrayed into a positive statement of his own Always when necessary he gave as authority the name of some one else But the effect was the same A hurried call of some sort took Manton away from us Kennedy turned to me with a whimsical expression Let s go he remarked What do you make of it offhand I asked outside We re going about in a circle he remarked Strange group of people Each apparently suspects the other And to cover himself talks of the other fellow I added Kennedy nodded and we made our way toward the laboratory I ll bet something happens before the day is over I hazarded for no reason in particular Kennedy shrugged As we went I cast up in my mind the facts we had learned The information from Manton was disconcerting coming on top of what had already been revealed about the inner workings of his game If Phelps had secretly borrowed from the trust accounts in his charge a quarter of a million or so I saw that his situation must indeed be desperate To what lengths he might go it was difficult to determine XX THE BANQUET SCENE For once I qualified as a prophet We were hardly in our rooms when the telephone rang for Kennedy It was District Attorney Mackay calling in from Tarrytown My men have positive identification of one of the visitors to the Phelps home the night after the murder he reported Fine exclaimed Kennedy Who was it How did you uncover his trail You remember that my deputy heard the sound of a departing automobile Well we have been questioning everyone A citizen here who returned home late at just about that hour remembers seeing a taxicab tearing through the street at a reckless rate He came in to see me this morning He made a mental note of the license number at the time and while nothing stuck with him but the last three figures three sixes he was sure that it was a Maroon taxi We got busy and have located the driver who made the trip from a stand at Thirty third all the way out and back On the return he dropped his fare at the man s apartment The identification is positive Who is it Kennedy became quite excited Werner the director Werner in surprise What are you going to do Arrest him first examine him afterward I ve sworn out the warrant already and I m going to start in by car just as soon as we hang up I thought I d phone you first in case you wanted to accompany me to the studio We ll hurry there Kennedy replied and meet you Outside No up on the floor You ll be there fifteen minutes to half an hour ahead of me I hope there is no way for anyone to tip him off so he can escape We ll stop him if he attempts it Good The courtyard of the studio of Manton Pictures Incorporated was about the same as upon the occasions of our previous visits except that I detected a larger number of cars parked in the inclosure including a number of very fine ones Also it seemed to me that there was a greater absence of life than usual as though something of particular interest had taken everyone inside the buildings The gateman informed us that Werner was working the large studio We made our way up through the structure containing the dressing rooms and found the proper door without difficulty When we passed through under the big glass roof we grasped the reason for the lack of interest in the other departments about the quadrangle Here everyone was gathered to watch the taking of the banquet scene for The Black Terror The huge set was illuminated brightly and packed thronged with people It was a marvelous set in many ways To carry out the illusion of size and to aid in the deceptive additional length given by the mirrors at the farther end Werner had decided against the usual one large table arranged horseshoe like but had substituted instead a great number of individual smaller tables about which he had grouped the various guests The placing of those nearest the mirrors had been so arranged as to give no double images thus betraying the trick The waiters all the characters who walked about were kept near the front toward the cameras for the same reason It seemed as if the banquet hall was at least twice its actual size I saw that Millard had arrived ahead of us Either the changing of the scenes in his script to fit Enid had not taken him very long or else the photographing of this particular bit of action had proved sufficiently fascinating to draw him away from his work I wondered at first if he had come to the studio to use his office here an infrequent happening from Manton s account Then I realized that he was in evening dress Without doubt he planned to play a minor part in the banquet His presence was no accident Then I picked out Manton himself from our point of observation in a quiet corner selected by Kennedy for that purpose It was evident that the promoter had cleared up his business at the office rapidly since we had left him there to go to our quarters on the Heights and had departed immediately from the latter place so as to precede the District Attorney here Manton as well as Millard was in evening dress A moment later I recognized Phelps and he too wore his formal clothes In an instant I grasped that Werner actually was saving money Not only were these officials of the company present to help fill up the tables but I was able now to pick out a number of the guests who were uneasy in their make up and more or less out of place in full dress attire They certainly were not actors One girl I definitely placed as the stenographer from Manton s waiting room at the studio then other things caught my attention I could not help but doubt the stories of waste told us by Phelps as I looked over the scene before me The use of the mirrors to avoid building the full length of the floor did not seem to fit in with the theory that Manton and Werner were making every effort to wreck the company deliberately I watched the financier for several moments but did not detect anything from his manner except that he seemed to feel ill at ease and awkward in make up I picked out Millard again and this time found him talking with Enid Faye and Gordon Immediately I sensed a dramatic conflict carefully suppressed but having too many of the outward indications to fool anyone In fact a child would have observed that Lawrence Millard and the leading man needed little urging to engage in a scuffle then and there Though Stella Lamar was dead this was the heritage she had left Her touch had embittered two men beyond the point of reconciliation the husband who had been and the husband who was to be Of the two Millard had far the better control of himself however After a brief word or so Gordon left them At once I could see the relief in the expressions of both the others Again I wondered just what might be between these two It was an easy familiarity which might have been as casual as it seemed to be no more or which might have been a mask for something far deeper and more enduring the schooled outer cloak of an inner perfect understanding Werner was by far the busiest of those waiting in the stifling heat beneath the glass roof He was in evening dress prepared to take his own place before the camera and in straight make up so that he looked nothing like the slain millionaire the part he had played in the opening scenes I saw that he was a master in the art of make up I was sure that he was more nervous than usual It struck me that he needed the stimulus of the drug he used although later I knew that he must have felt intuitively the coming of events which followed close upon the attempt to photograph the action As more of the people hurried up from the offices and around from the manuscript and other departments very conscious of their formal attire and as the regular players changed and adjusted the make ups of these amateurs the banquet took on the proportions of a real affair The members of the cast were placed at the table in the foreground Enid Gordon Marilyn and a fourth man were assigned locations after which Werner proceeded to fill the seats in the rear With the exception of Millard and Phelps none of the inexperienced people were allowed to face the camera Manton whose features were familiar through published interviews in many publicity campaigns was placed to one side opposite Phelps Millard was given charge of a group containing a number of giddy extra girls in somewhat diaphanous costume and seemed to be in his element The tables themselves were prepared with perfect taste I could see that real food was being used in order to achieve a greater degree of realism for a caterer had set up a buffet some distance out of the scene from which to serve the courses called for in the script Many of the dishes were being kept hot the steam curling from beneath the covers in appetizing wisps The wine supposed to be champagne was sparkling apple juice of the best quality and I don t doubt but that before the days of prohibition Werner would have insisted upon the real fizz water In details such as these the director was showing no economy All ready now Werner called stepping back to a place at a table which he had reserved for himself All set Remember the action of the script Instantly the buzz of conversation died and everyone turned to him No no no he exclaimed in vexation Don t go dead on your feet This is a banquet You are having a good time It s not a funeral You were all in just the right state of mind before and you don t have to stop and gape to listen to me Keep right on talking and laughing My voice will carry and you can hear without getting out of your parts I turned to Kennedy to see how the picture making struck him I saw that he was watching the two girls at the forward table closely and so I faced about to follow his glance Marilyn s face was red with anger while Enid calm and rather malicious was ignoring her to devote all attention to Gordon The leading man bored and irritated made no effort to conceal a heavy scowl In the momentary interval following Werner s instructions Marilyn lost all control of herself If you will pardon me MISS Faye she cried out in a voice which carried over to us and with cutting accent upon the Miss I think that in this scene at least we should BOTH be facing the camera If I understand the scene in the script at all it is intended to show the conflict between the two women over the one man seated between them Jack Daring is to be swayed first by Stella Remsen then by Zelda At least this once I think the daughter of old Remsen and his ward are playing roles of equal importance For a moment I smiled realizing that Marilyn was not going to let Enid take the picture away from her as we had seen the new star do in one of her first scenes with the leading man Then I sobered realizing that it was the outer reflection of the deep running passion of these people The cloud of Stella s death was over them still Enid responded but in tones too low for us to hear A new flush of red in Marilyn s face however demonstrated the power in the lash of the other girl s tongue Werner hurried over to them not masking his own irritation any too well Without a word he began rearranging the table moving it slightly so that while there was no great difference in its position he had yet made a show of satisfying Marilyn In effect he pleased neither The two pretty faces closest to the camera were a study in discontent I don t wonder that moving picture directors are nervous Kennedy remarked Film manufacture must keep everyone under constant tension What do you make of the feeling between the different people I asked Did you notice Millard and Gordon and now Enid and Marilyn There s something under cover he rejoined something behind all this I get the impression that our suspects are watching one another like as many hawks At various times most of them have glanced over at us They know we are here and are conscious they may be under suspicion Therefore I particularly want to see how those two girls act when Mackay arrives to arrest Werner The director stepping back to his place took a megaphone from his assistant for use in the rehearsal Now you must act just as though this were a real banquet he shouted Try to forget that the Black Terror is lurking outside the window that an attack is coming from him Remember when the shot is fired you must all leap up as though you meant it Here You you you designating certain extra girls faint when it happens That s not until after the toast is proposed I ll propose the toast from my table and it will be the cue for Shirley outside Now don t get ahead of the action You amateurs don t turn around to see if the camera is working We ll go through the action up to the moment I propose the toast The buzz of conversation rose slightly as though an effort was being put into the gayety I glanced about at some of the people who were cast for only this one scene wishing I could read lips because I was sure many of them talked of matters wholly out of place in this setting At the same time I kept an eye on the principals and upon Werner Finally the director was satisfied after a second rehearsal All right he bellowed throwing the megaphone from the scene Shoot At the same instant he dropped to his place and apparently was a guest with no interest but in the food and wine before him At the cameras there were three of them the assistant director kept a careful watch of the general action In actual time by the watch the whole was very short a second measuring to sixteen pictures or a foot of film as I explained afterward to Kennedy The entire scene perhaps ran one hundred or one hundred and fifty feet But on the screen even to the spectators in the studio the illusion in a scene of the kind would be the duration of half an hour or even more This would be helped by close ups of the individual action especially by the byplay between the principals taken later and inserted into the long shot by the film cutter I know I was carried away by a sense of reality It seemed to me that waiters made endless trips to and fro that here and there pretty girls broke into laughter constantly or that men leaned forward every other moment to make witty remarks in fact I felt genuinely sorry I could not take part in the festivities I knew that danger in the person of the Black Terror as played by Shirley lurked just out the window I felt delicious anticipatory thrills of fear so thoroughly was I in the spirit of the thing Then I saw that Werner was about to propose the toast about to give the cue for the big action Watch him whispered Kennedy He s an actor He s taking that drink just as though he meant every drop of it Werner had raised his delicately stemmed glass as though to join his neighbor in some pledge when a new idea seemed to strike him He leaped to his feet Let s drink together Let s drink to our hero and heroine of the evening Other voices rose in acclamation The wine had been poured lavishly Glasses clinked and we could hear laughter Suddenly at the window back of everyone appeared the evil black masked figure of Shirley eyes glittering menacingly from their slits two weapons glistening blue in his hands At the same moment there was a terrible groan followed by a scream of agony Werner staggered back his left hand clutched at his breast From his right hand the glass which he had drained fell to the canvas covered floor with an ominous dull crash This was not in the script Practically everybody realized the fact for the scene instantly was in an uproar In the general consternation no one seemed to know just what to do Shirley was the first to act the first to realize what had happened Dropping his weapons reaching the side of the stricken director in one leap he supported him as he reeled drunkenly then eased him to the floor Behind us before I could look to Kennedy to see what he would do there was the gasp of a man out of breath from hurrying upstairs I turned startled It was Mackay Shall I make the collar he wheezed At the same instant he saw the gathering crowd in the set What what s happened he asked Kennedy had bounded forward only a few seconds after Shirley As I pushed through after him Mackay following I discovered him kneeling at the side of Werner Some one send for a doctor quick he commanded taking charge of things as a matter of course Hurry he repeated He s gasping for air and it ll be too late in a minute Then he saw us Walter Mackay he raised Werner s head push everyone back please Give him a chance to breathe A thousand thoughts flashed through my head as politely but firmly I widened the space about Kennedy and the director Was this a case of suicide Had Werner known we were coming for him Had he thought to bring about his own end in the most spectacular fashion possible Was this the fancy of a drug weakened brain Suddenly I realized that Werner was trying to speak One of the camera men had helped Kennedy lift him to the top of a table swept of its dishes and linen so as to make it easier for him to breathe Out in Tarrytown he muttered weakly that night I suspected and saw His voice trailed off into nothingness Even the motion of his lips was too feeble to follow In an instant I grasped the cruel injustice I had done this man in my mind It was now that I remembered in a flash Kennedy s attitude and was glad that Kennedy had not suspected him See I faced Mackay speaking in quick low tones so the others could not hear I we have been totally and absolutely wrong in suspecting Werner Instead it was he who has been playing our game trying to confirm his own suspicions I ve been entirely wrong in my deductions from the discovery of his dope and needles What do you mean Jameson The district attorney had been taken completely off his feet by the unexpected developments His eyes were rather dazed his expression baffled What do you mean Why he was out at Tarrytown that night all right don t you see but but he was the second man the man who watched Mackay still seemed unable to comprehend There were two men I went on excitedly covering my own chagrin in my impatience at the little district attorney The one your deputy struggled with was short rather than tall and very strong That s Werner Can t you see it Haven t you noticed how stockily and powerfully the director is built Werner must really have had some clue murmured Mackay dazed It left me wondering whether the stimulation of the dope might not have heightened Werner s imagination and urged him on in following something that our more sluggish minds had never even dreamed Meanwhile I saw that the doctor had arrived and that Kennedy had helped carry Werner to a dressing room where first aid could be given more conveniently Now Kennedy hurried back into the studio glancing quickly this way and that as though to catch signs of confusion or guilt upon the faces of those about us I colored Instead of making explanations to Mackay explanations which could have waited I might have used what faculties of observation I possessed to aid Kennedy while he was giving first consideration to the life of a man As it was I didn t know what had become of any of the various people upon our list of possible suspects As far as I was concerned any or every sign and clue to the attack upon Werner might have been removed or destroyed A sudden hush caused all of us to turn toward the door leading to the dressing rooms It was the physician He raised a hand for attention His voice was low but it carried to every corner of the studio mister Werner is dead he announced XXI MERLE SHIRLEY OVERACTS Appalled I wondered who it was who had to cover up one crime committed another Who had struck down an innocent man to save a guilty neck Kennedy hurried to the side of the physician and I followed What symptoms did you observe asked Kennedy quickly seeking confirmation of his own first impressions His mouth seemed dry and I should say he suffered from a quick prostration There seemed to be a complete loss of power to swallow or speak The pupils were dilated as though from paralysis of the eyes Both pharynx and larynx were affected There was respiration paralysis It seemed also as though the cranial nerves were partially paralyzed It was typically a condition due to some toxic substance which paralyzed and depressed certain areas of the body Kennedy nodded That fits in with a theory I have I thought quickly then inquired Could it be the snake venom again No Kennedy replied shaking his head there s a difference in the symptoms and there is no mark on any exposed part of the body as near as I could see in a superficial examination He turned to the physician Could you give me blood smears and some of the stomach contents at once Twice now some one has been stricken down before the very eyes of the actors This thing has gone too far to trifle with or delay a moment The doctor hurried off toward the dressing room anxious to help Kennedy and as excited I thought as any of us Next Kennedy faced me Did you watch the people at all Walter I I was too upset by the suddenness of it I stammered All seemed to have suspicion of some one else and there was a general constraint as though even the innocent feared to do or say something that might look or sound incriminating I turned All were now watching every move we made though just yet none ventured to follow us It was as though they felt that to do so was like crossing a dead line I wondered which one of them might be looking at us with inward trepidation or perhaps satisfaction if there had been any chance to remove anything incriminating Kennedy strode over toward the ill fated set Mackay and I at his heels As we moved across the floor I noticed that everyone clustered as close as he dared afraid seemingly of any action which might hinder the investigation yet unwilling to miss any detail of Kennedy s method In contrast with the clamor and racket of less than a half hour previously there was now a deathlike stillness beneath the arched ground glass roof The heat was more oppressive than ever before In the faces and expressions of the awed witnesses of death s swift hand there was horror and a growing fear No one spoke except in whispers When anybody moved it was on tiptoe cautiously Millard s creation The Black Terror could have inspired no dread greater than this Of the people we wished to study Phelps caught our eyes the first Dejected crushed utterly discouraged he was slouched down in a chair just at the edge of the supposed banquet hall I had no doubt of the nature of his thoughts There was probably only the most perfunctory sympathy for the stricken director Without question his mind ran to dollars The dollar angle to this tragedy was that the death of Werner was simply another step in the wrecking of Manton Pictures Kennedy I saw hardly gave him a passing glance Manton we observed near the door With the possible exception of Millard he seemed about the least concerned The two scenario writer and producer had counterfeited the melodrama of life so often in their productions that even the second sinister chapter in this film mystery failed to penetrate their sang froid Inwardly they may have felt as deeply as any of the rest but both maintained their outward composure On Manton s shoulders was the responsibility for the picture I could see that he was nervous irritable yet as various employees approached for their instructions in this emergency he never lost his grasp of affairs In the vibrant quiet of this studio chamber still under the shadow of tragedy we witnessed as cold blooded a bit of business generalship as has ever come to my knowledge We overheard because Manton s voice carried across to us in the stillness Kauf The name I remembered as that of the technical or art director under Werner responsible for the sets of The Black Terror Yes mister Manton Kauf was a slim stoop shouldered man gray and a dynamo of energy in a quiet subservient way He ran to Manton s side Remember once telling me you wanted to become a director that you wanted to make pictures for me Yes sir You are familiar with the script of The Black Terror aren t you You know the people and how they work and you have sets lined up How would you like to finish the direction But but To the credit of the little man he dabbed at his eyes I guess he had been fond of his immediate superior mister mister Werner is d dead he stammered Of course Manton s voice rose slightly If Werner wasn t dead I wouldn t need another director at a moment s notice Some one has to complete The Black Terror We have all these people on salary and all the studio expense and the release date s settled so that we can t stop It s your chance Kauf Do you want it Y yes sir Good I ll double your salary including all this week Now can you finish this banquet set to night while you have the people
2581_155520_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 To night Kauf s eyes went wide then he started to flush 
none	none	Well to morrow then We simply can t lay off a day Kauf All all right sir It seemed to me that everyone in the place sensed the horror of this Literally actually Werner s body could not be cold Even the police the medical examiner had not had sufficient time to make the trip out for their investigation Yet the director s successor had been appointed and told to hurry the production I glanced at Phelps He raised his head slowly his expression lifting at the thought that production was to continue without interruption In another moment however there was a change in his face His eyes sought Manton and hardened His mouth tightened Hate a deep unreasoning hate settled into his features Kennedy pausing just long enough to observe the promoter s appointment of Kauf to Werner s position continued on toward the set Now as I looked about I saw that Jack Gordon was missing as well as Marilyn Loring Presumably they had gone to their dressing rooms All the other actors and actresses were waiting ill at ease wondering at the outcome of the tragedy Suddenly Kennedy stopped and I grasped that it was the peculiar actions of Merle Shirley which had halted him The heavy man was the only one of the company actually in the fabricated banquet hall itself Clinging to him still were the grim flowing robes of the Black Terror As though he were some old fashioned tragedian he was pacing up and down hands behind his back head bowed eyes on the floor More he was mumbling to himself It was evident however that it was neither a pose nor mental aberration Shirley was searching for something out in the open without attempt at concealment swearing softly at his lack of success Kennedy pushed forward Did you lose something mister Shirley No The heavy man straightened As he drew himself up in his sinister garb I thought again of the cheap actors of a day when moving pictures had yet to pre empt the field of the lurid melodrama It seemed to me that Merle Shirley was overacting that it was impossible for him to be so wrought up over the slaying of a man who after all was only his director certainly not a close nor an intimate relationship mister Kennedy he stated ponderously there has been a second death and at the hand which struck down Stella Lamar in Tarrytown Somewhere in this banquet hall interior there is a clue to the murderer I have kept a careful watch so that nothing might be disturbed Do you suspect anyone Kennedy asked Shirley glanced away and we knew he was lying No not definitely Who has been in the set since I left with the doctor No one except myself that is Shirley wanted to make it clear no one has had any opportunity to hide or move or take or change a thing because I have been right here all the time I see Thanks and Kennedy seemed genuinely apologetic if you don t mind I would prefer to make my investigation alone Shirley turned on his heel and made for his dressing room Meanwhile I had noticed a bit of by play between Enid Faye and Lawrence Millard the only others of our possible suspects about Enid first had caught my eye because she seemed to be pleading with the writer trying to hold him I gathered from the look of disgust on Millard s face that he wanted to get Shirley out of the set before Kennedy should observe the heavy man s odd reaction to the tragedy While I had never seen Millard and Shirley together so as to establish in mind the state of their feelings toward each other this would seem to indicate that they were friendly Certainly Shirley was making a fool of himself Enid acted I guessed so as to prevent Millard s interference probably with the idea that Millard in some fashion might bring suspicion upon himself It struck me that Enid had a wholesome respect for Kennedy At any rate Millard watched the little scene between Kennedy and Shirley with a quizzical expression As Shirley left he shrugged his shoulders then he gave Enid s cheeks a playful pinch each and started out after the heavy man in leisurely fashion Just about the same moment Kennedy called me to his side Walter he pleaded in a low voice will you hurry out to the dressing room where the doctor and I took Werner and get the blood smears and sample of the stomach contents I don t want to leave this because we must work fast and get all the data we need before the police arrive With perhaps a hundred people to question they ll be apt to make a fine mess of everything This is an outlying precinct where we ll draw the amateurs you know I saw that Mackay was helping him and so I left cheerfully making my way as fast as I could toward the door through which both Shirley and Millard had passed In the hallway of the building devoted to dressing rooms I found that I did not know which one contained Werner s body This corridor was familiar Here Kennedy and I had waited for Marilyn Loring and had witnessed the scene between Shirley and herself Now I did not even remember the location of her room At last on a chance I tried a door softly From within came whispered voices of deep intensity About to close it quickly I realized suddenly that I recognized the speakers in spite of the whispers It was Marilyn and Shirley They were together Now I recollected the figured chintz which covered the wall and was to be seen through the crack made by the open door It was her room They had not heard my hand on the knob nor the catch did not know that anyone could eavesdrop You see Her tones were the more vibrant You waited I had to No I advised you to act at once I couldn t I can t even now All right Her tone became bitter Go ahead your own way But you must count the cost You may lose me again Merle Shirley How do you mean Her answer in the faintest of whispers staggered me If you have the blood of another man on your hands I m through XXII THE STEM Though my hands trembled so that I could hardly control them I managed to close the door softly and to back away down the hall without being discovered My head was spinning and I was dizzy With my own ears I had heard Marilyn Loring virtually betray the guilt of the man she loved and whom therefore she had tried to shield If you have the blood of another man on your hands What more could Kennedy want I started to run toward the studio Then recollection of my errand stopped me Kennedy wished the blood smears and stomach contents and was anxious to get them before the arrival of the police At first I thought that all such evidence would be unnecessary now after the dialogue I had overheard but it struck me as an afterthought that it might be necessary still to prove Shirley s guilt to the satisfaction of a court and jury and so I rushed to the next dressing room and to another until I located the doctor and the body of the dead man With the little package for Kennedy safely in my pocket I hurried out again into the sweltering heat beneath the glass of the big studio and to the side of Kennedy and Mackay in the banquet hall set You have a sample of each article of food now he was asking the district attorney You are sure you have missed nothing As far as possible I took my samples from the table where Werner sat Mackay explained When the prop boy gets here with an empty bottle and cork I ll have a sample of the wine I think it s the wine he added Kennedy turned to me You ve got
2473_155521_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 In my pocket I interrupted 
none	none	Then rather breathlessly I repeated the conversation I had overheard Good Lord Mackay flushed There it is Shirley s the man and I ll take him now quick without waiting for a warrant See I ejaculated to Kennedy He killed Stella because she made a fool of him and then when Werner discovered that and followed him to Tarrytown the other night it probably put him in a panic of fear and so to keep Werner from talking Easy Walter Not so fast What you overheard is insufficient ground for Shirley s conviction unless you could make him confess and I doubt you could make him do that Why This was Mackay
2473_155521_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Because I don t think he s guilty 
none	none	At least Kennedy as always was cautious in his statements not so far as anything we now know would indicate But his anger at Stella I protested and Marilyn s remark Miss Lamar s death was the result of a cool unfeeling plan not pique or anger The same cruel careful brain executed this second crime Mackay I saw was three quarters convinced by Kennedy How do you account for the dialogue Jameson overheard he asked Miss Loring told us that Shirley suspected some one and was watching and would not tell her or anyone else who it was It seems most likely to me that it is the truth Mackay In that case her remark means that she believes his silence in a way is responsible for Werner s death Oh If Shirley had taken you into his confidence for instance I might possibly have succeeded in gaining sufficient evidence for an arrest thus averting this tragedy But it is only a theory of mine I scowled It seemed to me that Kennedy was minimizing things in a way unusual for him I wondered if he really thought the heavy man innocent It s still my belief that Shirley is guilty I asserted A sound of confusion from the courtyard beneath the heavy studio windows caught Kennedy s ear and ended the colloquy From some of those near enough to look out we received the explanation The police had arrived fully three quarters of an hour after Werner s death I ll get the little bottle of wine sure Mackay murmured picking up the food samples he had wrapped and crowding the bulky package into a pocket I don t see why that would have been any easier to poison than the food was my objection Everyone was looking Very simple The food was brought in quite late Besides it was dished out by the caterer before the eyes of forty or fifty people or more and there was no telling which plate would go to Werner s place The drinks were poured last of all I remember seeing the bubbles rise and wondering whether they would register at the distance Kennedy did not look at me Did it ever occur to you he went on casually that the glasses were all set out empty at the various places long before and that there might easily have been a few drops of something if it were colorless placed in the bottom of Werner s glass with scarcely a chance of its being discovered especially by a man who had so much on his mind at the time as Werner had He must have indicated where he would sit when he arranged the camera stands and the location of the tables I had not thought of that Kennedy frowned If only I could have located more of that broken glass As he faced me I could read his disappointment Walter I ve made a most careful search of his chair and the table and everything about the space where he dropped The poison must have been in the wine but there s not a tiny sliver of that glass left nothing but a thousand bits ground into the canvas too small to hold even a drop of the liquid Just think a dried stain of the wine no matter how tiny might have served me in a chemical analysis Very suddenly there was a low exclamation from Mackay Look Quick Some one must have kicked it way over here Fully twenty feet from Werner s place in the glare of the lights was the hollow stem of a champagne glass its base intact save for a narrow segment In the stem still were a couple of drops of the wine as if in a bulb or tube Can it be the director s glass Mackay asked handing it to Kennedy Kennedy slipped it into his pocket fussing with his handkerchief so that the precious contents would not drip out I think so I doubt whether any other glass was broken Verify it quickly The police were entering now with Manton Following them was the physician Mackay and I ascertained readily that no other glass had been shattered while Kennedy searched the floor for possible signs that the stem was part of a glass broken where we had found it Unquestionably we had a sample of the actual wine quaffed by the unfortunate Werner Elated we strolled to a corner so as to give the police full charge They ll waste time questioning everyone Kennedy remarked I have the real evidence He tapped his pocket The few moments that he had had to himself had been ample for him to obtain such evidence as was destroyed in so many cases by the time he was called upon the scene A point occurred to me You don t think the poison was planted later during the excitement Hardly Our criminal is too clever to take a long chance In such a case we would know it was some one near Werner and also there would be too many people watching Foolhardiness is not boldness I took to observing the methods of the police which were highly efficient but only in the minuteness of the examination of witnesses and in the care with which they recorded names and facts and made sure that no one had slipped away to avoid the notoriety The actors and actresses who had stood rather in awe of Kennedy both here and in Kennedy s investigation at Tarrytown developed nimble tongues in their answers to the city detectives The result was a perfect maze of conflicting versions of Werner s cry and fall In fact one scene shifter insisted that Shirley as the Black Terror had reached Werner s side and had struck him before the cry while an extra girl with a faint lisp described with sobering accuracy the flight of a mysterious missile through the air I realized then why Kennedy had made no effort to question them Under the excitement of the scene the glamour of the lights the sense of illusion and the stifling heat it would have been strange for any of the people to have retained correct impressions of the event The police sergeant knew Kennedy by reputation and approached him after a visit to the dead man s body with the doctor His glance including Mackay and myself was frankly triumphant Well he exclaimed I don t suppose it occurred to any of you SCIENTIFIC guys to search the fellow now did it Kennedy smiled in good humor Searching a man isn t always the scientific method You won t find the word frisk in any scientific dictionary No The police officer s eyes twinkled There was enough of the Irish in him to enjoy an encounter of this kind Maybe not but you might find things in a chap s pocket which is better With a flourish he produced a hypodermic syringe the duplicate of the one I had appropriated and a tiny bottle The man s a dope he added I knew that replied Kennedy I examined his arm where he usually took his shots and found no fresh mark of the needle That doesn t prove anything Wait until the medical examiner gets here He ll find the fellow s heart all shot full of hop or something I guess it isn t so complicated after all He was a hop fiend all right Still there s nothing to indicate that he was a suicide Not suicide accident overdose was the sergeant s reply How could he have died from an overdose of the drug when he hasn t taken any recently Well unabashed then he croaked because he hadn t had a shot the same thing Heart failure either way Excited and all you know making the scene Maybe he forgot to use the needle at that Perhaps you re right Kennedy shrugged calmly What was the use of disputing the matter I started to protest against the detective s hypothesis The idea of any drug addict ever forgetting to take his stimulant was too preposterous But Kennedy checked me All were now keenly listening to the argument Better perhaps to let some one think that nothing was suspected than to disclose the cards in Craig s hand I saw that he wished to get away and had not spoken seriously He turned to Mackay Walter and I will have to hurry to the laboratory Would you like to come along You bet I would The district attorney showed his delight I was just going to ask if I might do so There s nothing for me in Tarrytown to day and this is out of my jurisdiction As we turned away the police sergeant saw us and called across the floor not quite concealing a touch of professional jealousy The three of you were here at the time weren t you No Kennedy answered mister Jameson and myself Well you two then You re witnesses and I ll ask you to hold yourself in readiness to appear at the hearing I thought that the policeman was particularly delighted at his position to issue orders to Kennedy and I was angered Again Craig held me in check We ll be glad to tell anything we know he replied then added a little fling a bit of sarcasm which almost went over the other s head That is he amended as eye witnesses XXIII BOTULIN TOXIN Mackay drove us to the laboratory in his little car and it was dark and we were dinnerless when we arrived Knowing Kennedy s habits I sent out for sandwiches and started in to make strong coffee upon an electric percolator The aroma tingled in my nostrils reminding me that I was genuinely hungry The district attorney too seemed more or less similarly disposed As for Kennedy he was interested in nothing but the problem before him He had been strangely quiet on the way growing more and more impatient and nervous as though the element of time had entered into the case as though haste were suddenly imperative Once the lights were on in the laboratory he hurried about his various preparations The food samples he laid out but he gave them no attention The blood smears and stomach contents he put aside for future reference His attack was upon the drop or two of liquid adhering to the stem of the broken champagne glass The entire chemical procedure seemed to be incomprehensible to Mackay and he was fascinated so that he had considerable trouble at times keeping out of the way of Kennedy s elbow Kennedy first washed the stem out carefully with a few drops of distilled water then he studied the resulting solution One after another he tried the things that occurred to him making tests wholly unproductive of results Slowly the laboratory table became littered completely with chemicals and apparatus of all sorts a veritable arsenal of glass The sandwiches arrived but Kennedy refused to drop his investigation for a moment I did succeed in making him take a cup of strong coffee and that was all Over in a corner Mackay and I did full justice to the food finishing the hot and welcome coffee and then refilling the percolator and starting it on the making of a second brew The hours lengthened and when Mackay grew tired of watching with intense admiration he joined me in the patient consumption of innumerable cigarettes Kennedy was filled with the joy of discovery I noticed that he did not stop even for the solace of tobacco It seemed to me that at times his nostrils dilated exactly like those of a hound on the scent Finally he held up a test tube and turned to us What is it I asked Some other poison as rare and little known as the snake venom No something much more curious In the stem of the glass I find the toxin of the Bacillus botulinus Germs Mackay inquired Kennedy shook his head Not germs but the pure toxin the poison secreted by this bacillus What does it do was my question Well thoughtfully botulism may be ranked easily among the most serious diseases known to medical science It is hard to understand why it is not a great deal more common It is one of the most dangerous kinds of food poisoning Then the apple juice they used for the wine was bad spoiled No not that Werner was the only one stricken Somebody put the pure toxin in his glass It was as I suspected deliberate murder as in the case of Miss Lamar Bacillus botulinus produces a toxin that is extremely virulent Hardly more than a ten thousandth of a cubic centimeter would kill a guinea pig This was botulin itself the pure toxin an alkaloid just like that which is formed in meat and other food products in cases of botulism The idea might also have been to make the death seem natural due solely to bad food Do you suppose it was used because it was quick and was colorless so as not to be noticed in the glass I hazarded Kennedy paced up and down the laboratory several times in thought To me Walter this is another indication of the satanic cleverness of the unknown criminal in the case First Miss Lamar is to be killed For that purpose something was sought probably which could not be traced easily to the perpetrator In snake venom an agent was employed which may be said to be almost ideal for the grim business of murder It is extremely difficult to identify in its results it is comparatively unknown yet it is swift in action and to be obtained with fair ease Differing from most poisons it may be inflicted through a prick so slight as to be almost unnoticed by the victim The scheme of fixing the needle in the curtain was so simple and yet so effective that the guilty person need never have feared its discovery under ordinary circumstances or its association with the girl s death if some one stumbled upon it accidentally The idea of returning for the death dealing point was only one of the many details of a precautionary measure upon which we have stumbled Had I found it the next morning I would have been unable in all probability to identify it as belonging to or as obtained by any of our suspects You must realize Walter that with all the scientific aids I have been able to bring to bear we possess almost no direct evidence There are no fingerprints no cigarette stubs no array of personal intimate clues of any sort to this criminal These are the threads which lead the detective to his quarry in fiction and on the stage Here we lack even the faintest description of the man or woman if that is her sex It is murder from a distance planned with almost meticulous care executed coolly and without feeling or scruple After the death of Miss Lamar I was not so sure but that the selection of the snake venom was simply the inspiration of a perverted brain the evolution of the detailed method of killing her an outgrowth of someone s familiarity with studio life in general with the script of The Black Terror in particular Now I realize that we are face to face with the studied handiwork of a skilled criminal These two deaths may be his or her first departure into the realm of crime But potentially we have a super villain I make that statement because of the manner of Werner s demise It is evident that the director stumbled on a clue to the murderer If my first hypothesis had been correct if the use of snake venom and the unlucky thirteenth scene had been largely a matter of blind chance in the selection of poison and method then we might have expected Werner to be struck down in some dark street or perhaps decoyed to his death at the best inoculated with the same crotalin which had killed Miss Lamar But let us analyze the method used in slaying the director If he had been blackjacked there would be the clue of the weapon always likely to turn up the chance of witnesses and also the likelihood in an extreme case that Werner might not die at once but might talk and give a description of his assailant or even survive Much the same objections from the criminal s standpoint obtain in nearly all the accepted modes of killing a man Even the use of venom a second time possesses the disadvantage of a certain alertness against the very thing on the part of the victim Werner was a dope fiend fully aware of the potency of a tiny skin puncture I ll wager he was on constant guard against any sort of scratch On the other hand the few drops of toxin in the glass possessed every advantage from the unknown s standpoint It was invisible and as sure in its action as the venom Also it was as rare and as difficult to trace For remember this Botulism is food poisoning If I had not found the stem of that glass it would be absolutely impossible to show that Werner died from anything on earth but bad food That is why I do not even take time to analyze the stomach contents That is why I say we are confronted by an archscoundrel of highest intelligence and downright cleverness More Kennedy paused for emphasis I realize now the presence of a grim invisible menace It has just now been driven home to me The botulin with its deadly paralyzing power sealed Werner s tongue even while he tried to tell me what he knew Mackay was tremendously impressed by Kennedy s explanation Does this mean he asked that the guilty man or woman is some outsider Those we have figured as possible suspects would hardly have this detailed knowledge of poisons There are two possibilities Kennedy answered The real person behind the two murders may have employed some one else to carry out the actual killing a hypothesis I do not take seriously or again he paused this may be a case of some one with intelligence starting out upon his career of crime intelligently by reading up on his subject It is as simple to learn how to use crotalin or botulin toxin or any number of hundreds of deadly substances as it is to obtain the majority of them In fact if people generally understood the ease with which whole communities could be wiped out and grasped that it could be done so as to leave virtually no clue to the author of the horror they might not sleep as soundly at night as they do The saving grace is that the average criminal is often clever but almost never truly scientific Unfortunately we have to combat one who possesses the latter quality to a high degree What is the invisible menace of which you spoke Craig I inquired The possibility of another murder before we can apprehend the guilty person or gain the evidence we need Good heavens I imagine I blanched You mean Werner was struck down apparently for no reason but that he had guessed the identity of the villain There is a second man in the company who has certain suspicions and is acting upon them If he is on the right trail by any chance Kennedy shrugged his shoulders soberly Shirley Exactly And there is still another possibility What is that Here in this laboratory I have blood spots made on the portieres at the house of Phelps by the man who removed the needle probably the unknown himself possibly his or her agent In any case it is a clue and THE ONLY DIRECT AND INFALLIBLE CLUE IN EXISTENCE TO THE CRIMINAL Also I have the evidence of the snake venom and of the botulin toxin here Sooner or later the person who killed Werner because he suspected things will wake up to the fact that we possess tangible proof against him I grew pale You mean then that you may be attacked yourself That even I Kennedy smiled unafraid But from the expression in his eyes I knew that he took the thought of our possible danger very seriously XXIV THE INVISIBLE MENACE Mackay and I exchanged glances Kennedy busied himself putting away some of the more important bits of evidence in the case placing the tiny tubes of solution the blood smears and other items together in a cabinet at the farther corner of the laboratory The vast bulk of his paraphernalia the array of glass and chemicals and instruments he left on the table for the morning Then he faced us again with a smile Suppose you start up the percolator once more Walter He took a cigar and lighted it from the match I struck I believe I ve earned another cup of coffee he added Mackay had been fidgeting considerably since Kennedy s explanation of the possible danger to Shirley as well as to ourselves or even to others Isn t there something we can do Kennedy he exclaimed suddenly Is it necessary to sit back and wait for this unknown to strike again Ordinarily Kennedy replied on a case like this it has been my custom to permit the guilty parties to betray themselves as they will do inevitably especially when I call to my aid the recent discoveries of science for the detection and measurement of fine and almost imperceptible shades of emotion But now that I realize the presence of this menace I shall become a detective of action in fact I shall not stop at any course to hurry matters The very first thing in the morning I shall go to the studio and I want you and Jameson along I his eyes twinkled it was the excitement at the prospect I may need considerable help in getting the evidence I wish Which is It was I who interposed the question Kennedy blew a cloud of smoke There are three ways of tracing down a crime aside from the police method of stool pigeons to betray the criminals and the detective bureau method of cross examination under pressure popularly known as the third degree What are they Mackay asked unaware that Kennedy needed little prompting once he felt inclined to talk out some matter puzzling him One is the process of reasoning from the possible suspects to the act itself in other words putting the emphasis on the motive A second is the reverse of the first involving a study of the crime for clues and making deductions from the inevitable earmarks of the person for the purpose of discovering his identity The third method except for some investigations across the water is distinctly my own the scientific In all sciences Kennedy went on warming to his subject progress is made by a careful tabulation of proved facts The scientific method is the method of exact knowledge Thus in crime those things are of value to us which by an infinite series of empiric observations have been established and have become incontrovertible The familiar example of course is fingerprints Nearly everyone knows that no two men have the same markings that the same man displays a pattern which is unchanging from birth to the grave No less certain is the fact that human blood differs from the blood of animals that in faint variations the blood of no two people is alike that the blood of any living thing man or beast is affected by various things an infinite number almost most of which are positively known to modern medical investigators In this case my principal scientific clue is the blood left upon the portiere by the man who took the needle the night following the murder Next in importance is the fact demonstrated by me that some one at the studio wiped a hypodermic on a towel after inoculating himself with antivenin Of course I am presuming that this latter man inoculated himself and not some one else because it is obvious If necessary I can prove it later however by analyzing the trace of blood That is not the point The point is that whoever removed the needle pricked himself and yet did not die of the venom unless it was a person not under our observation an unlikely premise Therefore because of this last fact and because again it is obvious I expect to find that the same individual inoculated himself with antivenin and removed the needle from the portiere and I expect to prove it beyond possibility of doubt by an analysis of his blood A sample of the blood from this person will be identical with the spot on the portiere and much the easier test will contain traces of the antitoxin With that much accomplished a little of the well third degree will bring about a confession It is circumstantial evidence of the strongest sort Not only does a man take precautions against a given poison but he is proved to be the one who removed the needle actually responsible for Miss Lamar s death My handicap however is that I have no justifiable excuse for taking a sample of blood from each of the people we suspect or feel we might suspect For that reason I was waiting until one of the other detective methods should narrow the field of suspicion Now that there is the menace of another attempt to take a life I am forced to act To morrow we will get samples of blood from everyone by artifice or force Meanwhile He hastened to continue as though afraid we might interrupt to break his train of thought Meanwhile to night let us see if it is possible to accomplish something by the deductive method Already I have gone into an analysis starting from the nature of the crime and reasoning to the type of criminal responsible The guilty man or woman is a person of high intelligence added to genuine cleverness But for the results accomplished in this laboratory we would be without a clue our hands would be tied completely Both Miss Lamar and Werner were killed by unusual poisons deadly and almost impossible to trace There was a crowd of people about in each case yet we have no witnesses Now who out of all our people with possible motives are intelligent enough and clever enough to be guilty Kennedy glanced first at me then at Mackay Manton Phelps suggested the district attorney The promoter Kennedy rejoined is the typical man of the business world beneath the eccentricity of manner which seems to cling to everyone in the picture field Ordinarily his type thinking in millions of dollars and juggling nickel and dime admissions or other routine of commercial detail is apart from the finer subtle passions of life When a business man commits murder he generally uses a pistol because he is sure it is efficient he can see it work The same applies to Phelps Millard Mackay hesitated now to face the logic of Kennedy s keen mind He was Stella Lamar s husband Millard is a scenario writer and so apt to have a brain cluttered with all sorts of detail of crime and murder At the same time an author is so used to counterfeiting emotion in his writings that he seldom takes things seriously Life becomes a joke and Millard in particular is a butterfly concerned more with the smiles of extra girls and the favor of Miss Faye than the fate of the woman whose divorce from him was not yet complete A writer is the other extreme from the business man The creator of stories is essentially inefficient because he tries to feel rather than reason When an author commits murder he sets a stage for his own benefit He is careful to avoid witnesses because they are inconvenient to dispose of At the same time he wants the victim to understand thoroughly what is going to happen and so he is apt to accompany his crime with a speech worded very carefully indeed Then he may start with an attempt to throttle a person and end up with a hatchet or he may plan to use a razor and at the end brain his quarry with a chair He lives too many lives to follow one through clearly his own How about Shirley I put in At first glance Shirley and Gordon suggest themselves because both murders were highly spectacular and the actor above everything else enjoys a big scene After Werner s death for instance Shirley literally strutted up and down in that set He was so full of the situation so carried away by the drama of the occasion that he failed utterly to realize how suspicious his conduct would seem to an observer Unfortunately for our hypotheses the use of venom and toxin is too cold bloodedly efficient The theatrical temperament must have emotion An actor cruel and vicious enough to strike down two people as Miss Lamar and Werner were stricken of sufficient dramatic make up to conceive of the manner of their deaths would want to see them writhe and suffer He would select poisons equally rare and effective but those more slow and painful in their operation No Walter Shirley is not indicated by this method of reasoning The arrangement of the scenes for the murders was simply another detail of efficiency not due to a wish to be spectacular The crowd about in each case has added greatly to the difficulty of investigation Do you include Gordon in that Mackay asked Yes and in addition Kennedy smiled slightly I believe that Gordon is rather stupid For one thing he has had several fights in public at the Goats Club and at the Midnight Fads and I suppose elsewhere That is not the clever rogue Furthermore he had been speculating not just now and then but desperately doggedly Clever men speculate but scientific men never Our unknown criminal is both clever and intelligent That brings you to the girls then Mackay remarked Kennedy s face clouded and I could see that he was troubled To be honest in this one particular method of deduction he stated I must admit that both Miss Faye and Miss Loring are worthy of suspicion The fact of their rise in the film world the evidences of their popularity is proof that they are clever Miss Loring in my few brief moments of contact with her on two occasions showed a grasp of things and a quickness which indicate to me that she possesses a rare order of intelligence for a woman As for Miss Faye again he hesitated one little act of hers demonstrated intelligence When Shirley was standing guard in the set after Werner s death and making a fool of himself Millard evidently wanted to get over and speak to him perhaps to tell him not to let me find him searching the scene as though his life depended upon it perhaps something else But Miss Faye stopped him Unquestionably she saw that anyone taking an interest in the remains of the banquet just then would become an object of suspicion Do you really suspect Marilyn or Enid I inquired If this were half a generation ago I would say without hesitation that the crime was the handiwork of a man But now the women are in everything Young girls particularly He shrugged his shoulders Mackay had one more suggestion The camera men the extras the technical and studio staffs they are not worthy of consideration are they Kennedy shook his head The odor of coffee struck my nostrils and I turned to find the percolator steaming Kennedy leaned over to take a whiff Mackay rose At that moment there was a sudden crash and the window pane was shattered Simultaneously a flash of light and a deafening explosion took place in the room scattering broadcast tiny bits of glass from the laboratory table splashing chemicals many of them dangerous over everything Kennedy hurried to the wreck of his paraphernalia In an instant he held up a tiny bit of jagged metal An explosive bullet he exclaimed An attempt to destroy my evidence XXV ITCHING SALVE 
2488-155524-0000	train-other-500	For once I rose with Kennedy He preceded me to the laboratory after breakfast however leaving me to wait for Mackay When the little district attorney arrived I noticed that he carried a package which looked as though it might contain a one reel film can
2488-155524-0001	train-other-500	The negative we took from the cameras at Tarrytown he explained Also a print from each roll ready to run I ve been holding this as evidence mister Kennedy wanted me to bring it with me to day He s waiting for us at the laboratory I remarked He ll straighten everything up in a hurry won t he
none	none	 Kennedy s the most high handed individual I ever knew I laughed 
2488-155524-0002	train-other-500	if he sees a chance of getting his man Then I became enthusiastic Often I ve seen him gather a group of people in a room perhaps without the faintest shred of legal right to do so and there make the guilty person confess simply by marshaling the evidence
2488-155524-0003	train-other-500	or maybe betray himself by some scientific device
none	none	 It s wonderful Mackay Do you think he plans something of that kind this morning 
2488-155524-0004	train-other-500	I led the way to the door After what happened last night I know that Kennedy will resort to almost anything The district attorney fingered the package under his arm
none	none	 He might get everyone in the projection room then and make them watch the actual photographic record of Stella s death the scene where she scratched herself Let s hurry I interrupted When we entered the laboratory we found Kennedy vigorously fanning a towel which he had hung up to dry I recognized it as the one I had discovered in the studio washroom immediately following the first murder This will serve me better as bait than as evidence he laughed I have impregnated it with a colorless chemical which will cling to the fibers and enable me to identify the most infinitesimal trace of it 
2488-155524-0005	train-other-500	We shall get up to the studio and start well I guess you could call it fishing for the guilty man He fingered the folds then jerked the towel down and flung it to me
2488-155524-0006	train-other-500	Here Walter It s dry enough Now I want you to rub the contents of that tiny can of grease open before you there into the cloth He hurried over to wash his hands
none	none	 I spread the towel out on the table and began to work in the stuff indicated by Kennedy There was no odor and it seemed like some patent ointment in color At first I was puzzled 
2488-155524-0007	train-other-500	Then absently I touched the back of one hand with the greasy fingers of the other and immediately an itching set up so annoying that I had to abandon my task Kennedy chuckled That s itching salve Walter
2488-155524-0008	train-other-500	The cuticle pads at your finger tips are too thick but touch yourself anywhere else He shrugged his shoulders You d better use soap and water if you want any relief Then you can start over again
none	none	 At the basin I thought I grasped his little plot You re going to plant the towel I asked so that the interested party will try to get hold of it Evidently he thought it unnecessary to reply to me Why couldn t you just put it somewhere without all the preparation 
2488-155524-0009	train-other-500	Mackay suggested and watch to see who came after it Because our criminal s too clever Kennedy rejoined Our only chance to get it stolen is to make it very plain that it is not being watched Whoever steals it however possibly will reveal himself on account of the itching salve
none	none	 In any case I expect to be able to trace the towel to the thief no matter what efforts are made to destroy it The towel was wrapped in a heavy bit of paper then placed with a microscope and some other paraphernalia in a small battered traveling bag Climbing into Mackay s little roadster we soon were speeding toward the studio 
2488-155524-0010	train-other-500	Will you be able to help me to stay with Jameson and myself all day Kennedy asked the district attorney after perhaps a mile of silence Surely It s what I was hoping you d allow me to do I have no authority down here though I understand But the police or
2488-155524-0011	train-other-500	an outsider might allow some of my plans to become known He paused a moment in thought
none	none	 The film you brought in with you consists of the scenes on the rolls of negative in use at the time of Miss Lamar s collapse 
2488-155524-0012	train-other-500	It may or may not include the action where she scratched herself Now I want the scenes up to thirteen put together in proper order first as photographed by one camera
none	none	 then as caught by the other I ll arrange for the services of a cutter and for the delivery to me of any other negative or positive overlooked by us when we had the two boxes sealed and given into your custody at Tarrytown Will you superintend the assembly of the scenes so that you can be sure nothing is taken out or omitted 
2488-155524-0013	train-other-500	Of course I want to do anything I can Upon arrival at the studio we detected this time all the signs of a complete demoralization The death of Werner
none	none	 the fact that he had been stricken down during the taking of a scene and on the very stage 
2488-155524-0014	train-other-500	had served to bring the tragedy home to the people More
none	none	 it was a second murder in four days apparently by the same hand as the first A sense of dread a nameless intangible fear 
2488-155524-0015	train-other-500	had taken form and found its way under the big blackened glass roofs and around and through the corridors
none	none	 into the dressing rooms and back even to the manufacturing and purely technical departments The gateman eyed us with undisguised 
2488-155524-0016	train-other-500	uneasiness as we drove through the archway into the yard In that inclosure there were only two cars Manton s and one we later learned belonged to Phelps The sole human being to enter our range of vision was an office boy
2488-155524-0017	train-other-500	He skirted the side of the building as though the menace of death were in the air or likely to strike out of the very heavens without warning We found Kauf in the large studio obviously unhappy in the shoes of the unfortunate Werner
2488-155524-0018	train-other-500	Probably from half reasoned out motives of efficiency in psychology the new director
none	none	 had made no attempt to resume work at once in the ill fated banquet set but had turned to the companion ballroom setting since both had been prepared and made ready at the same time Kennedy explained our presence so early in the morning very neatly I thought I would appreciate it he began if you could place a cutter at the disposal of mister Mackay He has the scenes taken from the camera and sealed at the time of Miss Lamar s death I would like to have any other film taken out there delivered to him and the whole joined in proper sequence Then mister Kauf if you could arrange to have the same cutter take the film exposed yesterday when mister Werner You think you might be able to see something to discover something on the screen 
2488-155524-0019	train-other-500	Exactly Kauf beamed mister Manton gave me orders to assist you in every way I could or to put any of my people at your disposal More than that mister Kennedy he anticipated you
none	none	 He thought you might want to look at the scenes taken yesterday and he rushed the laboratory and the printing room We ll be able to 
2488-155524-0020	train-other-500	fix you up very quickly Good
none	none	 Kennedy nodded to Mackay and the district attorney hurried off with Kauf 
2488-155524-0021	train-other-500	Now Walter he exclaimed sobering I picked up the traveling bag and together we strolled toward the ballroom set There most of the players were gathered already in make up and evening clothes of a fancier sort even than those demanded for the banquet
2488-155524-0022	train-other-500	I saw that Kennedy singled out Marilyn Good morning she said cheerfully but with effort It was obvious she had spent a nervous night There were circles under her eyes ill concealed by the small quantity of cosmetic she used Her hands shifting constantly
none	none	 displayed the loss of her usual poise You are out bright and early she added We ve stumbled into a very important clue Kennedy told her with a show of giving her his confidence 
2488-155524-0023	train-other-500	In that bag in Walter s hand is one of the studio towels It contains a hint of the poison used to kill Miss Lamar and of utmost consequence
2488-155524-0024	train-other-500	it has provided me with an infallible clue to the identity of the murderer himself or herself It seemed to me that Marilyn blanched Where
none	none	 where did you find it 
2488-155524-0025	train-other-500	she demanded in a very awed voice In one of the studio washrooms It has been it
none	none	 has been in the washroom ever since poor Stella s death 
2488-155524-0026	train-other-500	No not that Jameson discovered it the same day but the very slight pause was perceptible to me Kennedy hated to lie
none	none	 I haven t realized its importance until just this morning 
2488-155524-0027	train-other-500	Enid Faye seeing us from a distance conquered her dislike of Marilyn sufficiently to join us She was very erect and tense
none	none	 Her eyes wide and sober and searching traveled from my face to Kennedy s and back Then she dissembled 
2488-155524-0028	train-other-500	softening as she came close to me laying a hand on my shoulder and allowing her skirt to brush my trousers Tell me Jamie she whispered her warm breath thrilling me through and through Has the wonderful Craig Kennedy discovered something
2488-155524-0029	train-other-500	It was not sarcasm but assumed
none	none	 playfulness 
2488-155524-0030	train-other-500	masking a throbbing curiosity I found a towel in one of the studio washrooms I answered
none	none	 and Craig has demonstrated that it is a clue to the poison which killed Stella Lamar as well as to the person who did it 
2488-155524-0031	train-other-500	Enid gasped
none	none	 Then she drew herself up and her eyes narrowed Now she faced Kennedy How can the towel be a clue to the crime she protested Stella was was murdered way out in Tarrytown mister Jameson found the towel here Kennedy shrugged his shoulders 
2488-155524-0032	train-other-500	I cannot tell you that just yet He paused deliberately You see he lied I have yet to make my analysis But you know it s a clue to the That towel he raised his voice as though in elation
none	none	 that towel will lead me to the murderer infallibly Merle Shirley had come up in time to hear most of the colloquy between Enid and Kennedy At the last he flushed clenching his fists 
2488-155524-0033	train-other-500	If you can prove who the murderer is mister Kennedy he exploded why don t you apprehend him before some one else meets the fate of Werner I can do nothing until I return to my laboratory this afternoon
2488-155524-0034	train-other-500	I will not know the identity of the guilty person until I complete a chemical analysis One by one the various people possibly concerned in the two crimes joined the group This morning all the faces were serious
2488-155524-0035	train-other-500	most of them showed the marks of sleeplessness following the second murder Kennedy walked away but I saw that Jack Gordon hastened to question both the girls ignoring their evident dislike for him
none	none	 Among the others I recognized Watkins the camera man and his associate Lawrence Millard came in and hastened to the side of Enid As he drew her away to ask the cause of the gathering I wondered at his early presence The scenario writer was typical of them all The strange and unusual nature of the crimes 
2488-155524-0036	train-other-500	the evident relationship between them had drawn the employees of Manton Pictures to the studio as a crowd of baseball fans collects before a public bulletin board Not one of them but was afraid of missing some development in the case
2488-155524-0037	train-other-500	In no instance could the interest of a particular individual be taken as an indication of guilt Phelps entered the studio from the door to the dressing rooms Disdaining to join the other group he approached us to ask the cause for the excitement
2488-155524-0038	train-other-500	Kennedy explained patiently and I saw that Phelps looked at the black bag uneasily
none	none	 I hope the guilty party is not a member of the company 
2488-155524-0039	train-other-500	he muttered Why Kennedy s mouth tightened The financier grew red Because this picture has been crippled enough First a new star now a new director
none	none	 if it wasn t so preposterous I d believe that it was all part of a deliberate He stopped as if realizing suddenly the inadvisability of vague accusations Don t you want justice done Kennedy inquired Of course Phelps tugged at his collar uncomfortably Of course mister Kennedy 
2488-155524-0040	train-other-500	Then he turned and hurried away out of the studio Gordon and Millard detached themselves from the others coming over In which washroom was the towel found mister Kennedy Gordon put the question as though he felt himself specially delegated to obtain this information
none	none	 I wondered how Kennedy would evade a direct answer To my surprise he made no attempt at concealment 
2488-155524-0041	train-other-500	The one on the second floor of the office building
none	none	 Millard laughed facing Gordon That puts it on myself or the big boss It struck me that the leading man was uneasy as he hurried back to the others 
2488-155524-0042	train-other-500	Millard still smiling turned to say something to us
none	none	 but we were joined by Manton entering from the other end of the big inclosure Good morning the promoter exclaimed somewhat breathless 
2488-155524-0043	train-other-500	I just learned you were here Is is there some new development Is there something I can do I see you are not allowing anything to interfere with the making of the picture Kennedy remarked All the people seem to be here bright and early A shadow crept into Manton s face It
none	none	 seems almost as cold blooded as 
2488-155524-0044	train-other-500	as war he admitted But I can t help myself mister Kennedy The company has no money and if we don t meet this release we re busted All at once he lowered his voice eagerly Tell me have you discovered something Is there some clue to the guilty man
2488-155524-0045	train-other-500	He s found a towel Millard put in an expression of half amusement on his face as he faced the promoter
none	none	 In some way it s a clue to the identity of the murderer an infallible clue 
2488-155524-0046	train-other-500	he says He found it in the washroom by our offices
none	none	 Since Werner is dead that points the finger of suspicion at you or me Manton s jaw dropped His expression became almost ludicrous as if the thought that he could possibly be suspected himself was new to him Millard s eyes sobered a bit at his superior s confusion There s a door from the dressing rooms Kennedy suggested Any of the actors or actresses could have used the place Of course Manton grasped at the straw I had forgotten There have been complaints to me about the players using that room I have the towel with me wrapped up in a paper in this grip Kennedy went on It s so very valuable as a bit of evidence I wonder if I could borrow a locker so as to keep it under lock and key until we re ready to return to the laboratory 
2488-155524-0047	train-other-500	Sure Of course Manton glanced about and saw the little knot of people still gathered in the set
none	none	 Millard Go over and tell Kauf to get busy 
2488-155524-0048	train-other-500	He s losing time Then he turned to us again Come on mister Kennedy we have some steel lockers out by the property room
none	none	 As we started across the floor I could see that Kennedy was framing a question with great care Do you ever use snakes in films mister Manton he asked Why no The promoter stopped in his surprise That is not if we ever can help it The censorship won t pass anything with snakes You have used them though Yes Once we made a short length special subject nothing but snakes Manton became enthusiastic It was a wonder too a pet film of mine We made it with the direct company operation and supervision of the greatest authority on poisonous snakes in the country Doctor Nagoya of Castleton Institute XXVI A CIGARETTE CASE Kennedy s face betrayed only a remote interest Have you any copies of that particular film Just the negative I believe Could I have that for a few days Of course Manton seemed to wish to give us every possible amount of company operation yet this request puzzled him Would you care to go down to the negative vaults with me Kennedy nodded First we stopped in a lengthy corridor in the rear building where there were no great signs of life Through a door I could see a long room filled with ornaments pictures furniture rugs and all the vast freak collections of a property room Along the side of the hallway itself was a line of steel lockers of recent design Manton called out to an employee and he appeared after a long wait and unlocked one of them At Kennedy s direction I put the traveling bag in the lower compartment pocketing the key Then we retraced our steps to broad steel stairs leading up and down We descended to the basement and found ourselves in a high ceilinged space immaculately clean and used generally for storage purposes The film vaults Manton explained are at the corner of the west wing They have to be ventilated specially on account of the high inflammability of the celluloid composition Since the greatest fire risk otherwise is the laboratory and printing departments and next to that the studios themselves with the scenery the heat of the lights the wires et cetera we have located them in the most distant corner of the quadrangle The negative you see represents our actual invested capital to a considerable extent The prints wear out and frequently large sections are destroyed and have to be reprinted Then sometimes we can reissue old subjects All in all we guard the negative with the care a bank would give actual funds in its vaults In our many visits to the Manton studios I had been struck by the scrupulous cleanliness of every part of the place The impression of orderliness came back to me with redoubled force as we made our way around in the basement Nothing seemed out of its proper position although a vast amount of various material for picture making was stored here We passed two projection rooms one a miniature theater with quite a bit of comfort the other small and bare for the use of directors and cutters Finally we saw the vaults ahead of us The walls were concrete matching the actual walls of the basement There were two entrances and the doors were double of heavy steel arranged so that an air space would give protection in case of fire At a roll top desk arranged for the use of the clerk in charge of the negatives and prints was a young boy Where s Wagnalls demanded Manton He went out sir the boy replied respectfully enough Said he would be right back and for me to watch and not to let anything get out The promoter led the way into the first room Here on all four sides and in several rows down the center like the racks in a public library were shelves supporting stacks of square thin metal boxes or trays with handles and tightly fitting covers Cards were secured to the front of each by clamps giving the name of the picture and the number under which the film was filed I was surprised because I expected to find everything kept in ordinary round film cans These are the negatives Manton explained He pulled out a box at random opening it The negative is not all spliced together the same length as the reels of positive because the printing machines are equipped to take two hundred foot pieces at a time or approximate fifths of a reel the size of a roll of raw positive film stock Then whenever there is a change in color as from amber day that to blue tint for night the negative is broken because pieces of different coloring have to go through different baths and that also determines the size of the rolls The prints or positives in the other vaults are in reel lengths and so are kept in the round boxes in which they are shipped Kennedy glanced about curiously The negative of that snake picture is here you said Manton went to a little desk where there was a card index Thumbing through the records he found the number and led us to the proper place in the rack In the box were only two rolls of negative both were large This was a split reel the promoter began It was approximately four hundred feet and we used it to fill out a short comedy a release we had years ago a reel the first part of which was educational and the last two thirds or so a roaring slap stick We never made money on it But this stuff was mighty good mister Kennedy We practically wrote a scenario for those reptiles Doctor Nagoya was down himself and for the better part of a day it wasn t possible to get a woman in the studio for fear a rattler or something might get loose Were there rattlers in the film Altogether I think The little Jap was interesting too Between scenes he told us all about the reptiles and how their poison Manton checked himself confused Was it because the thought of poison reminded him of the two deaths so close to him or was it from some more potent twinge of conscience You ll see it all in the film he finished lamely I may keep these for a little bit Kennedy asked Of course I can have the two rolls printed and developed and dry sometime this afternoon if you wish No this will do very well Kennedy slipped a roll in each pocket straining the cloth to get them in Manton opened a book on the little table making an entry of the delivery of the rolls and adding his own initials I have to be very careful to avoid the loss of negative he told us Nothing can be taken out of here except on my own personal order I thought that Manton was very frank and accommodating Surely he had made no effort to conceal his knowledge of this film made with Doctor Nagoya and he had even mentioned the poison of the rattlesnakes Though it had confused him for a brief moment that had not struck me as a very decisive indication of guilty knowledge After all no one knew of the use of crotalin to kill Stella Lamar except the murderer himself and Kennedy and those of us in his confidence The murderer might not guess that Kennedy had identified the venom Yet if Manton were that man he had covered his feelings wonderfully in telling us about the film My thoughts strayed to the towel upstairs Had an attempt been made yet to steal it from the locker It seemed to me that we were losing too much time down here if we hoped to notice anyone with itching hands I realized that Kennedy had been very clever in including all our suspects in hearing at the time he revealed the importance of the clue Of the original nine listed by Mackay Werner was dead and missus Manton had never entered the case Enid we had assumed to be the mysterious woman in Millard s divorce however and the other six had all been upon the floor in contact with Kennedy First there was Marilyn the woman Then the five men in order had displayed a lively interest in the towel Shirley Gordon Millard Phelps and Manton Kennedy s voice roused me from my reverie Does this door lead through to the other vaults mister Manton Yes The promoter straightened after replacing the records of the negative I designed this system of storage myself and superintended every detail of construction It is He checked himself with an exclamation noticing that the door was open With a flush of anger he slammed it shut I should think the connecting doors would be kept shut all the time Kennedy remarked In case of fire only one compartment would be a loss That s the idea exactly That s why I was on the point of swearing The boys down here are getting lax and I m going to make trouble Manton turned back and called to the boy outside Where did you say Wagnalls went I don t know sir Sometimes he goes across to McCann s for a cup of coffee or maybe he went up to the printing department Manton faced us once more If you ll excuse me just a moment I m going to see who s responsible for this Why he sputtered if you hadn t called me around the rack I wouldn t have noticed that the door was open and then if there had been a fire I I ll be right back As Manton stormed off Kennedy smiled slightly then nodded for me to follow We passed through into the rooms for positive storage These in turn had fireproof connecting doors all of which were open In each case Kennedy closed them Eventually we emerged into the main part of the basement through the farther vault door Nothing of a suspicious nature had caught our attention I guessed that Kennedy simply had wished to cover the carelessness of the vault man in leaving the inner doors wide open At the entrance which had first admitted us to the negative room however Kennedy stooped suddenly At the very moment he bent forward I caught the glint of something bright behind the heavy steel door and in the shadow so that it had escaped us before As he rose I leaned over It was a cigarette case a very handsome one with large initials engraved with deep skillful flourish Who is J G Kennedy asked I felt a quiver of excitement Jack Gordon the leading man What s an actor doing down in the film vaults he muttered Slipping the case into his pocket he glanced about on the floor and something just within the negative room caught his eye Once more he bent down With a speculative expression he picked up the cork tipped stub of a cigarette At this instant Manton returned breathing hard as though his pursuit of the missing Wagnalls had been very determined The butt in Kennedy s fingers attracted his attention at once Did did you find that here he demanded Kennedy pointed Right there on the floor The devil Manton flushed red This is no place to smoke By by all the wives of Goodwin and all the stars of Griffith I m going to start firing a few people he sputtered Here sonny He jumped at the boy frightening him Close all these doors and turn the combinations Tell Wagnalls if he opens them before he sees me I ll commit battery on his nose Kennedy continued to hold the stub and as Manton preceded us up the stairs he hung back comparing it with the few cigarettes left in the case Unquestionably they were of the same brand On the studio floor Mackay was waiting for us Under his arm was a reel of film in a can He clutched it almost fondly All ready he remarked to Kennedy Kennedy s face was unrevealing as he faced Manton This bit of film is valuable evidence also I think perhaps it would be safer in that locker Anything at all we can do to help stated Manton promptly Shall I show you the way again I produced the key handing it to Kennedy as the four of us arrived in the corridor by the property room Kennedy slipped the bit of metal into the lock then simulated surprise very well indeed The lock is broken he exclaimed Some one has been here Apparently the traveling bag had been undisturbed as we took it out Nevertheless the paper containing the towel was gone This is no joke mister Kennedy protested Manton in indignation Where can I hire about a dozen good men to hang around and watch and and help you get to the bottom of this Mackay without releasing his grasp of the film had been inspecting the broken lock Look at the way this was done he murmured almost in admiration This wasn t the work of any roughneck It it was a dainty job XXVII THE FILM FIRE The bag lay open at my feet The microscope and other paraphernalia brought by Kennedy were untouched Taking the film from Mackay and placing the can in with the other things Kennedy snapped the catch and turned to me as he straightened 
2488-155526-0000	train-other-500	I think our evidence is safest in plain sight Walter We ll carry it about with us Lloyd Manton seemed to be a genuinely unhappy individual
none	none	 After some moments he excused himself nervously anxious about the turn of affairs at the studio 
2488-155526-0001	train-other-500	Immediately I faced Kennedy and Mackay Manton s the only one who knew just where we put the bag I remarked When he left us in the basement he had plenty of time to run up and steal the towel and return How about the itching salve
none	none	 In his hurry he might have left the towel in the paper intending to destroy it later Kennedy frowned That s possible Walter I had not thought of that Still he brightened I m counting on human nature 
2488-155526-0002	train-other-500	I don t believe anyone guilty of the crime could have that towel in his possession after the hints I have thrown out without examining it so as to see what telltale mark or stain would be apt to betray his identity
none	none	 You can see that Manton s the logical man It would be easy for anyone else to follow and observe us 
2488-155526-0003	train-other-500	Then First of all we must keep an eye out for any person showing signs of the itching concoction We must observe anyone with noticeably clean hands Principally however another thing worries me
none	none	 What s that mister Kennedy asked Mackay 
2488-155526-0004	train-other-500	Walter and I found a cigarette case belonging to Jack Gordon in the basement
none	none	 also a butt smoked three quarters of the way down 
2488-155526-0005	train-other-500	and left directly in the negative room The fire doors between the different film vaults which are arranged like the safety compartments in a ship were all open I want to know why Gordon was down there and well
none	none	 I seem to sense something wrong Good heavens Craig I interposed You don t attach any importance to the fact that those doors were open Walter in a case of real mystery the slightest derangement of matters of ordinary routine is a cause for suspicion 
2488-155526-0006	train-other-500	I had no answer and as we re entered the studio I devoted my attention to the various people we had tabulated as possible suspects noticing that Kennedy and Mackay did likewise Jack Gordon was in the ballroom scene in make up Kauf
none	none	 still was concerned with technical details of the set and lighting and although the cameras were set up they were not in proper place nor was either camera man in evidence With Gordon was Enid From a distance they seemed to be engaged in an argument of real magnitude There was no mistaking the dislike on the part of each for the other Marilyn was the most uneasy of all of the principals She was pacing up and down glancing about in frank distress of mind 
2488-155526-0007	train-other-500	I looked at her hands and saw that she had crushed a tube of grease paint in her nervousness Not only her fingers were soiled but there were streaks on her arms where she had smeared herself unconsciously
2488-155526-0008	train-other-500	As we watched she left the studio hurrying out the door without a backward glance Marilyn at least showed no indications of the salve
none	none	 nor of painfully recent acquaintance with water Both Manton and Phelps were in evidence decidedly so I imagined from the viewpoint of poor Kauf 
2488-155526-0009	train-other-500	Manton at the heels of his new director was doing all he could to help Phelps following Manton about seemed to be urging haste upon the promoter The result was far from advantageous to picture making it was concentrated distraction
2488-155526-0010	train-other-500	Millard was poring over the manuscript perched upon a chair the wrong way so that its back would serve as a desk
none	none	 engaged busily in making changes here and there in the pages with a pencil 
2488-155526-0011	train-other-500	Like any author it was never too late for minor improvements and suggestions I don t doubt but that if Manton had permitted it Millard would have been quite apt to interrupt a scene in the taking in order to add some little touch occurring to him as his action sprang to life
2488-155526-0012	train-other-500	in the interpretation of players and director At any rate his hands seemed more clean than those of either Manton or Phelps proving nothing because he was at a task not so apt to bring him into contact with dirt
2488-155526-0013	train-other-500	Shirley is missing observed the district attorney in an undertone Kennedy faced me
none	none	 Give the bag to Mackay Walter 
2488-155526-0014	train-other-500	While he keeps an eye on the people up here we ll pay a visit to Shirley s dressing room and after that go down to the basement again I can t account for it intuition perhaps but I m sure something s wrong
none	none	 The heavy man s dressing room pointed out to us by some employee passing through the hall was empty I led the way into Marilyn s quarters but again no one was about 
2488-155526-0015	train-other-500	In each case Kennedy made a quick visual search for the towel without result We did not dare linger and run the risk of giving away our trick then too Kennedy was nervously anxious to look through the basement once more
none	none	 I don t understand your suspicion of the state of affairs in the film vaults I confessed 
2488-155526-0016	train-other-500	Why should Jack Gordon the leading man be down there he countered That that really is a cause for suspicion isn t it Now Walter think a bit
none	none	 We were crossing the yard and so not apt to be overheard 
2488-155526-0017	train-other-500	Granting that Gordon actually had been down there
none	none	 why should the fact concern us 
2488-155526-0018	train-other-500	Manton explained that no negative or positive can be given out except upon order There is nothing down there but film and so no other errand to bring the leading man to the vault except to get some scenes or pieces showing his own work and that isn t likely
2488-155526-0019	train-other-500	Unless I interrupted Gordon is the guilty man and wanted to get the snake film before we did How could that be When we asked Manton about the Doctor Nagoya subject we went right down with him and procured it
none	none	 I doubt anyone could have overheard us as we talked about it in any case Remember Craig we went to the locker first and it was some little time before that fellow came out to unlock it and give us the key 
2488-155526-0020	train-other-500	And when you questioned Manton we were passing right by all of them Any one could have heard the mention of the snake film Kennedy frowned I believe you re right Walter
none	none	 Or it is possible that the guilty person believed that the scenes taken out at Tarrytown or those taken when Werner died 
2488-155526-0021	train-other-500	revealed something and so would have to be stolen or destroyed
none	none	 and that they were kept in the vault It is even possible 
2488-155526-0022	train-other-500	a gleam came into Kennedy s eyes
none	none	 it is even possible 
2488-155526-0023	train-other-500	that the mind smart enough to reason out the damaging nature of the chemical analyses I was making and clever enough to utilize an explosive bullet in an effort to destroy the fruits of my work would also have the foresight to anticipate me
2488-155526-0024	train-other-500	and to realize that I might guess the existence of a film showing snakes and suggesting the use of venom It s damning to Gordon all right I said On the contrary Walter
none	none	 Kennedy lowered his voice as we entered the building across the quadrangle and descended stairs leading directly into the basement We have mentioned over and over again the cleverness of our unknown criminal 
2488-155526-0025	train-other-500	That man or woman never would drop a cigarette case with his or her initials and leave without it nor smoke a cigarette in a place he or she was not supposed to be What then It s a plant
none	none	 a deliberate plant to throw suspicion upon Gordon Why upon Gordon I don t know that unless because Gordon is supposed to have the best possible motive for killing Miss Lamar 
2488-155526-0026	train-other-500	his money troubles and so becomes the logical man to throw the guilt upon
none	none	 As a matter of fact Craig 
2488-155526-0027	train-other-500	why should the finding of that cigarette case be a cause for suspicion at all That s what I didn t understand before Ordinarily it wouldn t be But those open inner doors the absence of the man in charge
2488-155526-0028	train-other-500	isn t it possible that we interrupted an attempt not only to search for the particular damaging pieces of film but perhaps to destroy the whole If some one acted between the time I asked Manton about the snake film and the moment we arrived in the basement to get it
2488-155526-0029	train-other-500	that some one had to move very fast In which case it might have been Gordon after all The cigarette stub may have been thrown in lighted to start a fire
none	none	 He may not have had time to pick up the case not knowing just where he dropped it 
2488-155526-0030	train-other-500	Kennedy shrugged his shoulders It all shows the futility of trying to arrive at a conclusion without definite facts That is where science is superior to deduction It s all a maze to me just now I agreed
none	none	 We made our way to the vaults 
2488-155526-0031	train-other-500	in silence and to our surprise found that they were closed and that even the boy was gone now The cellar as a whole probably for the purpose of fire protection on a larger scale was divided into sections corresponding to the units of the buildings above
2488-155526-0032	train-other-500	and this time I noticed that the door through which we had arrived before was closed also Had Manton taken fright in earnest at the possibility of fire or had he given his employees a genuine scare
2488-155526-0033	train-other-500	We retraced our steps to the yard and there the alert eye of Kennedy detected a slinking figure just as a man darted into the protection of a doorway It was Shirley Had he been watching us
2488-155526-0034	train-other-500	Was he connected in some way with the vague mystery Kennedy seemed to sense in connection with the basement and the film vaults Kennedy led the way to the entrance where Shirley had disappeared Here
none	none	 there was no sign of him only steps leading up and down and the open door to a huge developing room Returning to the yard we caught a gesture from the chauffeur of a car standing near by and recognized McGroarty the driver who had found the ampulla a few days previously Excuse me mister Kennedy he apologized as we approached I should have come to you instead of making you two walk over to me but it s less suspicious this way What do you mean You recognize me McGroarty the chauffeur as found the little bottle Kennedy nodded Well I says to myself I ought to tell you but I don t like to because it might be nothing you know It might prove very valuable McGroarty Kennedy wanted to encourage him Well I ve been sitting here for an hour I guess One of the other directors is going out to day and his people are late and so here I am Well I don t like the way the heavy man mister Werner had Shirley Merle Shirley I spoke up That s him Well he s been hanging and snooping around that building over there where you just saw him for twenty minutes or more I guess he s gone in and out of that basement a dozen times I says to myself maybe he s up to something You know how it is Kennedy glanced at me significantly Then he extended his hand to the chauffeur Again I thank you McGroarty As I said before I won t forget you Now what I asked as we drew away Shirley s dressing room and the studio floor and Mackay 
2488-155526-0039	train-other-500	As we rather expected the heavy man s quarters were deserted
none	none	 I thought that Kennedy would stop now to make a careful search 
2488-155526-0040	train-other-500	but he seemed anxious to compare notes with the district attorney
none	none	 Nothing here reported Mackay Shirley Hasn t been a sign of him 
2488-155526-0041	train-other-500	I looked about the moment we arrived under the big glass roof Marilyn Loring I inquired She s been missing too
none	none	 All at once Mackay grinned broadly 
2488-155526-0042	train-other-500	You know either there s no efficiency in making moving pictures at all
none	none	 or these people have all gone more or less out of their heads as the result of the two tragedies Look He pointed When you left me Phelps and Manton were stepping on each other s toes trying to help that new director and about half driving him crazy and now Millard seems to have figured out some new way 
2488-155526-0043	train-other-500	of handling the action and he s over in the thick of it It s worse than Bedlam and better than a Chaplin comedy I was compelled to smile although I knew that this was not uncommon in picture studios
2488-155526-0044	train-other-500	Manton Phelps Millard and Kauf were in the center of the group all talking at once Clustered about I saw Enid and Gordon both camera men and a miniature mob of extra people But as I looked little Kauf seemed to come to the end of his patience
2488-155526-0045	train-other-500	In an instant or two he demonstrated real generalship Shutting up Manton and the banker and Millard with a grin but with sharp words and a quick gesture which showed that he meant it
2488-155526-0046	train-other-500	he called to the others gathered about clearing the set of all but Enid and Gordon He sent the camera men to their places then confronted Phelps and Manton and the scenario writer once more We could not hear his words but could see that he was asserting himself
none	none	 was forcing a decision so that he could proceed with his work 
2488-155526-0047	train-other-500	This seemed uninteresting to me
none	none	 I remembered my success in my visit to Werner s apartment when I had essayed the role of detective 
2488-155526-0048	train-other-500	Listen Kennedy I suggested Suppose I go out by myself and see if I can locate Shirley or Marilyn Everyone else is right here where you can At that instant a deafening explosion shook the studio and every building about the quadrangle
none	none	 the sound echoing and re echoing with the sharpness of a terrific thunderclap Mixed with the reverberations which were intensified by the high arch of the studio roof were the screams of women and the frightened calls of men Following immediately upon the first roar were the muffled sounds of additional explosions 
2488-155526-0049	train-other-500	persisting for a matter of ten to fifteen seconds With every detonation the floor beneath our feet trembled and rocked Several flats of scenery stacked against a wall at our rear
none	none	 toppled forward and struck the floor with a resounding whack not unlike some gigantic slap stick 
2488-155526-0050	train-other-500	One entire side of the banquet set luckily unoccupied fell inward and I caught the sound as the dainty gold chairs and fragile tables snapped and were crushed as so much kindling wood
2488-155526-0051	train-other-500	Then a fitting climax of destruction withheld until this moment there followed the terrifying snap of steel from above An entire section of roof literally was popped from place
2488-155526-0052	train-other-500	the result of false stresses in the beams created by the explosion Upon the heads of the unlucky group in the center of the ballroom set came a perfect hailstorm of broken and shattered bits of heavy ground glass For an instant an exceedingly brief instant
2488-155526-0053	train-other-500	there was the illusion of silence The next moment the factory siren rose to a shrill shriek with a full head of steam behind it the fire call Kennedy dashed over to the scene where those beneath the shower of glass lay dazed and uncertain of the extent of their own injuries
2488-155526-0054	train-other-500	Where are the first aid kits he shouted Bring cotton and bandages and and telephone for a doctor an ambulance It seemed to me that Kennedy had never been so excited
none	none	 Mackay and I at his heels and some of the others unhurt hurriedly helped the various victims to their feet Then we realized that by some miracle some freak of fate 
2488-155526-0055	train-other-500	no one had been hurt seriously Already a property boy was at Kennedy s side with a huge box marked prominently with the red cross Inside was everything necessary and Kennedy started to bind up the wounds with all the skill of a professional physician
2488-155526-0056	train-other-500	Mackay he whispered hurry and get me some envelopes or some sheets of paper anything quick And to me before I could grasp the reason for that puzzling request Don t let anyone slip away Walter No matter what happens I must bind up these wounds myself
2488-155526-0057	train-other-500	A few moments later I understood what Kennedy was up to As he finished with each victim he took some bit of cotton or gauze with which he had wiped their cuts enough blood to serve him in chemical analysis and handed it to Mackay
2488-155526-0058	train-other-500	The district attorney very unobtrusively slipped each sample into a separate envelope sealing it and marking it with a hieroglyph which he would be able to identify later In this fashion Kennedy secured blood smears of Manton and Phelps
2488-155526-0059	train-other-500	Millard and Kauf and Enid Gordon the two camera men and a scene shifter
none	none	 I smiled to myself Meanwhile a bitter acrid odor penetrated through the windows and to every part of the structure the odor of burning film an odor one never forgets to fear All those uninjured in the explosions had rushed out to see the fire or else to escape from any further danger the moment they recovered their wits Manton only cut at the wrist and impatient as Kennedy cleaned dusted and bound the wound was the first to receive attention 
2488-155526-0060	train-other-500	The vaults he called to the men who seemed disposed to linger about For God s sake get busy The next instant he was gone himself
none	none	 Enid was cut on the head Tears streamed from her eyes as she clung to Kennedy s coat trembling Will it make a scar she sobbed Will I 
2488-155526-0061	train-other-500	be unable to act before the camera any more He reassured her In the case of Millard who had several bad scalp wounds he advised a trip to a doctor but the scenario writer laughed Phelps was yellow
2488-155526-0062	train-other-500	It seemed to me that he whimpered a bit Gordon was disposed to swear cheerfully although a point of glass had penetrated deep in his shoulder and another piece had gashed him across the forehead Finally Kennedy was through He packed the little envelopes in the bag
none	none	 still in the possession of Mackay and added the two rolls of film from his pocket 
2488-155526-0063	train-other-500	Then for the first time he locked it As he straightened his eyes narrowed
none	none	 Now for Shirley he muttered And Marilyn I added XXVIII THE PHOSPHORUS BOMB We rushed out into the courtyard Kennedy in the lead Mackay trailing with the bag Here there were dense clouds of fine white suffocating smoke mixed with steam and signs of the utmost confusion on every hand Because Manton fortunately had trained the studio staff through frequent fire drills there was a semblance of order among the men actually engaged in fighting the spread of the blaze Any attempt to extinguish the conflagration in the vault itself was hopeless however and so the workers contented themselves with pouring water into the basement on either side to keep the building and perhaps the other vaults cool and with maintaining a constant stream of chemical mixture from a special apparatus down the ventilating system into and upon the smoldering film The studio fire equipment seemed to be very complete There was water at high pressure from a tank elevated some twenty to thirty feet above the uppermost roof of the quadrangle In addition Manton had invested in the chemical engine and also in sand carts because water aids rather than retards the combustion of film itself I noticed that the promoter was in direct charge of the fire fighters and that he moved about with a zeal and a recklessness which ended for once and all in my mind the suspicion that Phelps might be correct and that Manton sought to wreck this company for the sake of Fortune Features In an amazingly quick space of time the thing was over When the city apparatus arrived after a run of nearly three miles there was nothing for them to do The chief sought out Manton to accompany him upon an inspection of the damage and to make sure that the fire was out The promoter first beckoned to Kennedy This is unquestionably of incendiary origin he explained to the chief I want mister Kennedy to see everything before it is disturbed so that no clue may be lost or destroyed The fire officer brightened Craig Kennedy he inquired Gee there must be some connection between the blaze and the murder of Stella Lamar and her director I ve been reading about it every day in the papers mister Jameson of the Star Kennedy said presenting me We found we could not enter the basement immediately adjoining the vaults that is directly from the courtyard because it seemed advisable to keep a stream of water playing down the steps and a resulting cloud of steam blocked us Manton explained that we could get through from the next cellar if it was not too hot and so we hurried toward another entrance Mackay who had remained behind to protect the bag from the heat joined us there I ve put the bag in charge of that chauffeur McGroarty and armed him with my automatic he explained He paused to wipe his eyes The fumes from the film had distressed all of us Shirley and Marilyn Loring are both missing still he added I ve been asking everyone about them No one has seen them The fire chief looked up Everyone is out You are sure everybody is safe I had Wagnalls at my elbow with a hose Manton replied I saw the boy around also No one else had any business down there and the vaults were closed and the cellar shut off The door leading from the adjoining basement was hot yet but not so that we were unable to handle it However the catch had stuck and it took considerable effort to force it in As we did so a cloud of acrid vapor and steam drove us back Then Kennedy seemed to detect something in the slowly clearing atmosphere He rushed ahead without hesitation The fire chief followed In another instant I was able to see also The form of a woman dimly outlined in the vapor struggled to lift the prone figure of a man After one effort she collapsed upon him I dashed forward as did Mackay and Manton Two of them carried the girl out to the air the other three of us brought her unconscious companion It was Marilyn and Shirley The little actress was revived easily but Shirley required the combined efforts of Kennedy and the chief and it was evident that he had escaped death from suffocation only by the narrowest of margins How either had survived seemed a mystery Their clothes were wet their faces and hands blackened eyebrows and lashes scorched by the heat But for the water poured into the basement neither would have been alive They had been prisoners during the entire conflagration the burning vault holding them at one end of the basement the door in the partition resisting their efforts to open it Thank heaven he s alive were Marilyn s first words How did you get in the cellar Kennedy spoke sternly I thought he might be there Now that the reaction was setting in the girl was faint and she controlled herself with difficulty I was looking for him and as soon as I heard the first explosion I ran down the steps into the film vault entrance I was right near there and I found him stunned I started to lift him but there were other explosions almost before I got to his side The flames shot out through the cracks in the vault door and I I couldn t drag him to the steps I had to pull him back where you found us She began to tremble It it was terrible Was there anyone else about anyone but mister Shirley No I I remember I wondered about the vault man What was mister Shirley down there for Miss Loring He she hesitated he said he had seen some one hanging around and and he didn t want to report anything until he was sure He he thought he could accomplish more by himself although I told him he was was wrong Whom did he see hanging around He wouldn t tell me Shirley was too weak to question and the girl too unstrung to stand further interrogation In response to Manton s call several people came up and willingly helped the two toward the comfort of their dressing rooms At the fire chief s suggestion the stream of water into the basement was cut off Manton led the way choking eyes watering to the front of the vaults Feverishly he felt the steel doors and the walls There was no mistaking the conclusion The negative vault was hot the others cold The devil Manton exclaimed A deep poignancy in his voice made the expression childishly inadequate Why couldn t it have been the prints Suddenly he began to sob That s the finish Not one of our subjects can ever be worked again It s a loss of half a million dollars If you have positives Kennedy asked can t you make new negatives Dupes Manton looked up in scorn Did you ever see a print from a dupe negative It s terrible Looks like some one left it out in the wet overnight How about the Black Terror I inquired All of that s in the safe in the printing room that and the two current five reelers of the other companies We won t lose our releases but again there was a catch in his voice we could have cleared thousands and thousands of dollars on reissues All all of Stella s negative is gone too To my amazement he began to cry without attempt at concealment It was something new to me in the way of moving picture temperament First they kill her and now now they destroy the photographic record which would have let her live for those who loved her The his voice trailed away to the merest whisper as he seemed to collapse against the hot smoked wall the devil The fire chief took charge of the job of breaking into the vault First Wagnalls attempted to open the combination of the farther door but the heat had put the tumblers out of commission Returning to the entrance of the negative vault itself the thin steel manufactured for fire rather than burglar protection was punctured and the bolts driven back A cloud of noxious fumes greeted the workers and delayed them but they persisted Finally the door fell out with a crash and men were set to fanning fresh air into the interior while a piece of chemical apparatus was held in readiness for any further outbreak of the conflagration Manton regained control of himself in time to be one of the first to enter Mackay held back but the fire chief the promoter Kennedy and myself fashioned impromptu gasmasks of wet handkerchiefs and braved the hot atmosphere inside the room The damage was irremediable The steel frames of the racks the cheaper metal of the boxes the residue of the burning film all constituted a hideous shapeless mass clinging against the sides and in the corners and about the floor Only one section of the room retained the slightest suggestion of its original condition The little table and the boxes of negative records the edges of the racks which had stood at either side showed something of their former shape and purpose This was directly beneath the ventilating opening Here the chemical mixture pumped in to extinguish the fire had preserved them to that extent All at once Kennedy nudged the fire chief Put out your torch he directed sharply In the darkness there slowly appeared here and there on the walls a ghostly bluish glow persisting in spite of the coating of soot on everything Kennedy s keen eye had caught the hint of it while the electric torch had been flashed into some corner and away for a moment Radium I exclaimed entirely without thought Kennedy laughed Hardly But it is phosphorus without question What do you make of that The fire chief was curious Let s get out was Kennedy s reply Indeed it was almost impossible for us to keep our eyes open because of the smarting and more the odor was nauseating A guard was posted and in the courtyard disregarding the curious crowd about Kennedy asked for Wagnalls and began to question him When did you close the vaults About two hours before the fire mister Manton sent for me Was there anything suspicious at that time No sir I went through each room myself and fixed the doors That s why the fire was confined to the negatives Have you any idea why the doors were open when we went through No sir I left them shut and the boy I put there while I went over to McCann s said no one was near He Wagnalls hesitated Once he went to sleep when I left him there Perhaps he dozed off again Why did you leave Why go over to McCann s in business hours We d worked until after midnight the night before I had to open up early and so I figured I d have my breakfast in the usual morning slack time when nothing s doing I see Kennedy studied the ground for several moments Do you suppose anyone could have left a package in there a bomb in other words Wagnalls s eyes widened but he shook his head I d notice it sir If I do say it I m neat I generally notice if a can has been touched They don t often fool me Well has any regular stuff been brought to you to put away anything which might have hidden an explosive Again Wagnalls shook his head I put nothing away or give nothing out except on written order from mister Manton Anything coming in is negative and it s in rolls and I rehandle them because they re put away in the flat boxes I d know in a minute if a roll was phony You re sure nothing special Holy Jehoshaphat interrupted Wagnalls I d forgotten He faced Manton Remember that can of undeveloped stuff a two hundred roll He turned to Kennedy explaining When negative s undeveloped we keep it in taped cans Take off the tape and you spoil it the light you know mister Manton sent down this can with a regular order marking on it that some one had to come to watch it being developed in about a week Of course I didn t open the can or look in it I put it up on top of a rack When was this About four days ago the day Miss Lamar was killed The expression on Manton s face was ghastly I didn t send down any can to you Wagnalls he insisted It was your writing sir Kennedy rose What did you do with orders like that such as the one you claim came with the can of undeveloped negative Put them on the spindle on that table in the vault Wet your handkerchief and come show me When they returned Kennedy had the spindle in his hand the charred papers still in place This was one of the items preserved in part by the chemical spray through the ventilating opening above Can you point out which one it is Kennedy asked Let s see Wagnalls scratched his head Next to the top he replied in a moment Miss Lamar s death upset everything Only one order came down after that With extreme care Kennedy took his knife and lifted the ashy flakes of the top order Get me some collodion somebody he exclaimed Wagnalls jumped up and hurried off The fire chief leaned forward Do you think mister Kennedy that the little can he told you about started the fire I m sure of it although I ll never be able to prove it How did it work Well I imagine a small roll of very dry film was put in to occupy a part of the space Film is exceedingly inflammable especially when old and brittle In composition it is practically guncotton and so a high explosive In this recent war I remember the Germans drained the neutral countries of film subjects until we woke up to what they were doing while in this country scrap film commanded an amazing price and went directly into the manufacture of explosives Then I figure that a quantity of wet phosphorus was added to fill the can and that then the can was taped The tape of course is not moisture proof entirely With the dampness from within it would soften might possibly fall off In a relatively short time the phosphorus would dry and burn Immediately the film in the can would ignite As happened it blew up a minor explosion but enough to scatter phosphorus everywhere That in the fume laden air of the vault there are always fumes in spite of the best ventilation system made caused the first big blast and started all the damage Mackay had rejoined us in time to hear the explanation Ingenious he murmured As ingenious as the methods used to murder the girl and her director Breathless Wagnalls returned with the collodion We watched curiously as Kennedy poured it over the charred remains of the second order on the spindle It seemed almost inconceivable that the remnants of the charred paper would even support the weight of the liquid yet Kennedy used it with care and slowly the collodion hardened before us creating a tough transparent coating which held the tiny fibers of the slip together At the same time the action of the collodion made the letters on the order faintly visible and readable A little known bank trick Kennedy told us Then he held the slip up to the light and the words were plain Wagnalls had been correct The order from Manton was unmistakable The can was to be kept in the negative vault for a week without being opened until a certain party unnamed was to come to watch the development of the film The promoter wet his lips uneasily I I never wrote that It it s my writing all right and my signature but it s a forgery XXIX MICROSCOPIC EVIDENCE Kennedy made some efforts to preserve the forged order which he had restored with the collodion but I could see that he placed no great importance upon its possession Gradually the yard of the studio had cleared of the employees who had returned to their various tasks Under the direction of one stout individual who seemed to possess authority the fire apparatus had been replaced in a portable steel garage arranged for the purpose in a farther corner and now several men were engaged in cleaning up the dirt and litter caused in the excitement Except in the basement there were few signs of the blaze Manton accompanied the fire chief to his car then hurried up into the building without further notice of us Mackay went to McGroarty s machine to claim the traveling bag containing our evidence Kennedy and I started for the dressing rooms I want to get blood smears of Shirley and Marilyn he confided in a low voice I shall have to think of some pretext Neither of the two we sought were in their quarters and so we continued on into the studio Here we found Kauf at work at least he was engaged in a desperate attempt to get something out of his people Ye gods Gordon we heard him exclaim as we made our way through the debris of the banquet set to the ballroom now dazzlingly bright under the lights What if you do have to wear a bandage around your head It s a masked ball isn t it You ve got a monk s cowl over everything but your features haven t you It struck me that the faces had never been more ghastly although my reason convinced me it was simply the usual effect of the Cooper Hewitt tubes But there was no question but that the explosion had given everyone a bad fright that not an actress or actor but would have preferred to have been nearly anywhere else but under the heat of the glass roof now a constant reminder of the accident because of the gaping hole directly above them Marilyn was in the center of the revelers in the set already in costume Shirley I saw close to the camera men standing uneasily on shaky legs shielding his eyes with one hand while he clung to a massive sideboard for support with the other He had not yet donned his carnival clothes nor essayed to put on a make up Enid Faye the only one in sight whose spirits seemed to have rallied at all was offering him comfort of a sort You ll get by all right Merle if you can keep on your pins and I ll say you deserve credit for trying it There s she stepped back a bit to study him there s just one thing Your eyes show the result of all that smoke and vapor no color or luster at all I I wonder if belladonna wouldn t brighten them up a bit and well get you by for to day I ll go out and get some at lunch He smiled weakly I ll try anything once That s the spirit She patted him on the shoulder then danced on into the center of the set stopping to direct some barbed remark at Marilyn Kauf took his megaphone to call his people around him There seemed to be a certain essential competence about the little man now that Manton and Phelps and Millard were not about to bother him While we watched he succeeded in photographing one of the full shots of the general action or atmosphere of the dance Then he hurried to the side of Shirley to see if the heavy man felt equal to the task of resuming his make up once more I found the time dragging heavy on my hands and I wished that Kennedy would return to the laboratory or decide upon some definite action Though I racked my brain I failed to think of a device whereby Kennedy could get blood smears of Shirley or Marilyn without their knowledge Once more my reflections veered around to the matter of the stolen towel and I wondered if that had been wasted effort on Kennedy s part if the fire had thrown out his carefully arranged plans to trap whoever took it Suddenly I realized that Kennedy was following a very definite procedure that his seeming indifference his apparent idle curiosity concerning the scene taking masked a settled purpose When Phelps entered he approached him casually and turned to him with skilled nonchalance holding up a finger Will you lend me a pocket knife for a moment he asked to get a hang nail Phelps produced one rather grudgingly Kennedy promptly went over to the window as though seeking better light Thereafter he avoided Phelps Soon the banker had forgotten the incident Some time later Manton rushed in from the office Kennedy maneuvered his way to the promoter s side and waited his chance to borrow that man s pocket knife under conditions when Manton would be the least apt to remember it Then he made his way around to Mackay and I saw that both the acquisitions went into little envelopes of the sort used to take the blood smears after the explosion and falling glass Kennedy now seemed rather elated Millard entered and he borrowed the scenario writer s knife in exactly the same fashion as the others No one of the three men noticed his loss I thought it lucky that all three carried the article and tried to guess how far Kennedy intended to carry this little scheme Kauf s announcement of lunch gave me my answer It seemed that there would be just half an hour and that the entire cast was expected to make shift at McCann s rather than attempt to go to any better place at a greater distance Immediately Kennedy turned to me Hurry Walter Twenty minutes quick work and then it s the laboratory and the solution of this mystery With Mackay and the bag we stole to the dressing rooms waiting until sure that everyone was downstairs In Enid s chamber Kennedy glanced about carefully but swiftly When nothing caught his attention he picked up her finger nail file gingerly from the blunt end slipping it into one of the little envelopes which Mackay held open Thereupon the district attorney put his identifying mark upon the outside and we went to the next room It proved to be Gordon s The general search was barren of result but the dressing table yielded another finger nail file handled in the same manner as before Then we entered Marilyn s room and left with the file from her dressing stand In Shirley s quarters the last we visited we were in greater luck however While Kennedy and Mackay abstracted the usual file I discovered some bits of tissue paper used in shaving There was caked soap left to dry just as it had been wiped from the razor More there was a blood stain of fair proportions Here s your smear Kennedy I exclaimed Good Fine He faced Mackay Now I lack just one thing a sample of the blood of Miss Loring Is that all The district attorney brightened Let me try to get it I I ll manage it in some way All right Kennedy took the bag Explain your marks so I ll know He stopped suddenly No don t tell me anything I ll make my chemical analyses and microscopic examinations without knowing the identity in the case either of the blood samples or the finger nail files If I obtain results by both methods and they agree I ll return armed with double barreled evidence Meanwhile Mackay you get a smear from Miss Loring and follow us to the laboratory I ll coax McGroarty to drive us down so you ll have your car and you can bring us back The district attorney nodded Me for McCann s he muttered That s where she went to eat He rushed off eagerly Kennedy had no difficulty persuading McGroarty to put his particular studio car at our disposal without an order from Manton or from the director who had called him In a very brief space of time we were at the laboratory You expect to find the blood of one of those people showing traces of the antivenin I grasped Kennedy s method of procedure but wanted to make sure I understood it correctly Already I was blocking out the detailed article for the Star the big scoop which that paper should have as a result of my close association with Kennedy on the case One of those samples should correspond I suppose to the trace of blood on the portieres Exactly He answered me rather absently being concerned in setting out the apparatus he would need for a hasty series of tests Will the antivenin show in the blood after four perhaps five days I should say so Walter If it does not by any chance I will be able to identify the blood but that is much more involved and tedious a great deal more actual work I ve got it straight then Now I paced up and down several times The finger nail files should show a trace of the itching salve Is that correct Craig For a moment he didn t answer as his mind was upon his paraphernalia Then he straightened Hardly Walter The salve is soluble in water What I shall find if anything is some of the fibers of the towel You see a person s finger nails are great little collectors of bits of foreign matter and anyone handling that rag is sure to show some infinitesimal trace for a long while afterward If the person stealing the towel filed or cleaned his nails there will be evidence of the fibers on his pocket knife or finger nail file I impregnated the towel with that chemical so that I would be able to identify the fibers positively The use of the itching salve was unnecessary A quizzical smile crept across Kennedy s face Did you think I expected some one to go walking around the studio scratching his hands Did you imagine I thought the guilty party would betray his or her identity in such childish fashion after all the cleverness displayed in the crimes themselves But you were insistent that I rub in the To force them to wash their hands after touching the towel Walter Oh I felt rather chagrined Wouldn t some pigment some color have served the purpose better No because anyone would have understood that and would have taken the proper measures to remove all traces But the itching salve served two purposes It was misleading because obviously a trap upon reflection and so it would distract attention from the impregnated fibers my real scheme Then it was the best device of all I could think of for it set up a local irritation of the sort most calculated to make a person clean his finger nails The average man and woman is not very neat Walter I was not sure but a scientific prodding was necessary to transfer my evidence to some object I could borrow and examine under a microscope Meanwhile Kennedy s long fingers were busy at the preliminary operations in his tests He turned away and I asked no more questions not wishing to delay him I noticed that first he examined the blood samples under the microscope Afterward he employed a spectroscope But none of the operations took any great amount of time since he seemed to anticipate his results Mackay burst in upon us very elated and produced a handkerchief with a bit of blood upon it I scratched her deliberately with the sharp point of my ring he chuckled I found her in the restaurant and the seat beside her was empty I I talked about everything under the sun and I guess she thinks I m a clumsy boob Anyhow she cried out when I did it and got red in the face for a moment but she suspects nothing Kennedy cut the spot from the handkerchief put it in an envelope and turned back to his table I drew Mackay into the corner As the minutes sped by and Craig worked in absorbed concentration Mackay grew more and more impatient to get back to the studio Did you find anything repeated Mackay for the tenth time With a gesture of annoyance Kennedy reached out for the nail files This is a grave matter he frowned I must check it up and double check it then I m going back to the studio to triple check it Let me see what the nail files reveal It will be a bare ten minutes more Insisting that we remain back in the corner he spread out the four nail files and the open blades of the three pocket knives setting each upon the envelope which identified it The next quarter of an hour seemed interminable Finally Kennedy started replacing the files and the pocket knives in their envelopes his face still wearing the inscrutable frown Next he packed the blood samples and other evidence in the traveling bag once more Mackay was bursting with impatience but Craig still refused to betray his suspicions I must get back there quick he hastened I want everybody in the projection room In court a jury might not grasp the infallibility of the methods I ve used There would be a great deal of medical and expert testimony required and you know Mackay what that means Is it a man or a woman you suspect persisted the district attorney Three of the men had pocket knives and Kennedy led the way to the door without answering and Mackay cut short his hopeless quizzing as Craig nodded to me to carry the bag XXX THE BALLROOM SCENE Sounds of music caught our ears as we entered the studio courtyard of Manton Pictures 
679-155529-0000	train-other-500	Carrying the bag with its indisputable proof of some person s guilt we made our way through the familiar corridor by the dressing rooms out under the roof of the so called large studio There
679-155529-0001	train-other-500	a scene of gayety confronted us in sharp contrast with the gloomy atmosphere of the rest of the establishment Kauf however had thoroughly demonstrated his genius as a director
679-155529-0002	train-other-500	To counteract the depression caused by all the recent melodramatic and tragic happenings he had brought in an eight piece orchestra establishing the men in the set itself so as to get full photographic value from their jazz antics
679-155529-0003	train-other-500	Where Werner and Manton had dispensed with music in a desperate effort at economy Kauf had realized that money saved in that way was lost through time wasted with dispirited people
679-155529-0004	train-other-500	It was a lesson learned long before by other companies In other studios I had seen music employed in the making of soberly dramatic scenes solely as an aid to the actors enabling them to get into the atmosphere of their work more quickly
679-155529-0005	train-other-500	and naturally Under the lights the entire set sparkled with a tawdry garishness apt to fool those uninitiated into the secrets of photography On the screen
none	none	 colors which now seemed dull and flat 
679-155529-0006	train-other-500	would take on a soft richness and a delicacy characteristic of the society in which Kauf s characters were supposed to move Obviously fragile scenery
679-155529-0007	train-other-500	would seem as heavy and substantial as the walls and beams of the finest old mansion Even the inferior materials in the gowns of most of the girls would photograph as well as the most expensive silk in fact
679-155529-0008	train-other-500	by long experience many of the extra girls had learned to counterfeit the latest fashions at a cost ridiculous by comparison Kennedy approached Kauf then returned to us
679-155529-0009	train-other-500	He asks us to wait until he gets this one big scene It s the climax of the picture really the unmasking of the Black Terror
none	none	 If we interrupt now he loses the result of half a day of preparation 
679-155529-0010	train-other-500	He may lose more than that muttered Mackay and I wondered just whom the district attorney suspected Is everyone here I asked All seven Gordon and Shirley of the men
679-155529-0011	train-other-500	and Marilyn and Enid of course were out on the floor of the supposed ballroom Gordon I recognized because I remembered that he was to wear the garb of a monk Marilyn was easily picked out although
679-155529-0012	train-other-500	the vivacity she assumed seemed unnatural
none	none	 now that we knew her as well as we did Her costume was a glorious Yama Yama creation 
679-155529-0013	train-other-500	of a faint yellow which would photograph dazzling white revealing trim stockinged ankles and slender bare arms framing face and eyes dancing with merriment and maliciousness
679-155529-0014	train-other-500	Unquestionably she was the prettiest girl beneath the arcs never to be suspected as the woman who had braved the terrors of a film fire to rescue the man she loved Enid was stately and serene in the gown of Marie Antoinette
679-155529-0015	train-other-500	In the bright glare her features took on a round innocence and she was as successful in portraying sweetness as Marilyn was in the simulation of the mocking evil of the vampire
679-155529-0016	train-other-500	Shirley interested me the most however I wondered if Kennedy still eliminated him in guessing at the identity of the criminal I called to mind the heavy man s presence in the basement at the time of the explosion
none	none	 and McGroarty s information that he had been hanging about that part of the studio for some time previously Some one had planted a cigarette case and stub to implicate Gordon according to Kennedy s theory Shirley certainly had had opportunity to steal the towel from the locker 
679-155529-0018	train-other-500	as well as to point suspicion toward the leading man In the midst of my reverie Shirley approached and passed us He was in the garb of Mephisto Like the others he had not yet masked his face
679-155529-0019	train-other-500	A peculiar brightness in his eyes struck me and I nudged Kennedy Belladonna Kennedy explained when he was beyond earshot Oh I remembered Enid told him to use it What
679-155529-0020	train-other-500	I repeated the conversation as near as I could reconstruct it
none	none	 H m That s a new cure for smoke burned eyes 
679-155529-0021	train-other-500	no cure at all I was unable to get any more out of Kennedy however Manton I detected in the background with Phelps The two men were arguing as always and it was evident that the banker was accomplishing nothing
679-155529-0022	train-other-500	by this constant hanging about the studio Where previously my sympathy had been with Phelps entirely now I realized that the promoter had won me Indeed Manton s interest in all the affairs of picture making at this plant
679-155529-0023	train-other-500	had been far too sincere and earnest to permit the belief that he was seeking to wreck the company or to double cross his backer Millard entered the studio as I glanced about for him He handed some sheets to Kauf then turned to leave
679-155529-0024	train-other-500	I attracted Kennedy s attention You don t want Millard to get away I whispered Kennedy sent Mackay to stop him The author accompanied the district attorney willingly Yes mister Kennedy
679-155529-0025	train-other-500	As soon as this scene is over we re going down to the projection room everyone concerned in the death of Miss Lamar and of mister Werner The scenario writer looked up quickly Do you
none	none	 do you know who it is 
679-155529-0026	train-other-500	he asked soberly Not exactly but I will identify the guilty person
none	none	 just as soon as we are assembled down in front of the screen 
679-155529-0027	train-other-500	Shirley had left the studio floor apparently to go to his dressing room Now I noticed that he returned and passed close just in time to hear Millard s question and Kennedy s answer His eyes dilated
none	none	 As he turned away his face fell 
679-155529-0028	train-other-500	He went on into the set but his legs seemed to wabble beneath him I was sure it was more than the weakness resulting from his experience in the fire Kauf s voice through the megaphone echoed suddenly from wall to wall reverberating beneath the roof
679-155529-0029	train-other-500	All ready Everyone in the set Masks on Take your places At a signal the orchestra struck up and the couples started to dance It was a wonderfully colorful scene and I saw that Kauf proposed to rehearse it thoroughly
679-155529-0030	train-other-500	doing it over and over without the cameras until every detail reached a practiced perfection In this I was certain he achieved results superior to Werner s slap dash and bang Then came the call for action
679-155529-0031	train-other-500	Camera Kauf began to bob up and down Into it everybody For fascination and charm this far exceeded the banquet scene which we had witnessed in the taking previously The music was surprisingly good
679-155529-0032	train-other-500	so that it was impossible for the people not to get into the swing and the result was a riotous swirling of gracefully dancing pairs the girls selected for their beauty flashing half revealed faces toward the camera
679-155529-0033	train-other-500	displaying eyes which twinkled through their masks in mockery at a wholly ineffectual attempt at concealment Enid maintained her stately carriage but made full use of the dazzling whiteness of her teeth
none	none	 Early she permitted the attentions of the cowled monk 
679-155529-0034	train-other-500	whom she knew to be her lover Marilyn was everywhere making mischief the best she could Shirley stalked about in his satanic red which would photograph black and appear even more somber on the screen
679-155529-0035	train-other-500	Of course the whole was not photographed in a continuous strip from one camera position I saw that Kauf made several long shots to catch the general atmosphere Then he made close up scenes of all the principals
679-155529-0036	train-other-500	and of some of the best appearing extras At one time he ordered a panorama effect in which the cameras pammed swept from one side to the other giving a succession of faces at close range Finally
679-155529-0037	train-other-500	everything was ready for the climax Shirley had been playing a sort of Jekyll and Hyde role in which he was at once the young lawyer friend of Enid and the Black Terror
679-155529-0038	train-other-500	Unmasked and cornered at this function of a society terrified by the dread unknown menace he was to make the transformation directly before the eyes of everyone using the mythical drug which changed him from a young man of good appearance and family
679-155529-0039	train-other-500	to the being who was a very incarnation of evil For once Kauf did not rehearse the scene Shirley was obviously weakened from his experience and the director wished to spare him
679-155529-0040	train-other-500	All the details were shouted out through the megaphone however and I grasped that the action of this part of the dance was familiar to everyone it was the big scene of the story toward which all other events had built
none	none	 Then came the familiar order Camera 
679-155529-0041	train-other-500	At the start of this episode the orchestra was playing and the dancers were in motion Suddenly Gordon as the hero strode up to Shirley and unmasked him with a few bitter words which later would be flashed upon the screen in a spoken title
679-155529-0042	train-other-500	Instantly a crowd gathered about but in such a way as not to obstruct the camera view Cornered seeing that flight was impossible
none	none	 unless he became the Black Terror and possessed the strength and fearlessness of that strange other self Shirley drew a little vial from his breast pocket 
679-155529-0043	train-other-500	and drank the contents Evidently he knew his Mansfield well Slowly he began to act out the change in his appearance which corresponded with the assumption of control by the evil within
none	none	 His body writhed 
679-155529-0044	train-other-500	went through contortions which were horrible yet fascinating It was almost as though a new fearful being was created within sight of the onlookers Not only was the face altered but the man s stature seemed to shrink
679-155529-0045	train-other-500	to lose actual inches I thought it a wonderful exhibition The very next instant there came a groan from Shirley something which at once indicated pain and realization and fear He lost all control of himself
679-155529-0046	train-other-500	and in a moment pitched forward upon the floor sputtering and clutching at the empty air Another cry broke from between his lips a ghastly contracted shriek as treble as though from the throat of a woman This was no part of the story no skillful bit of acting
679-155529-0047	train-other-500	It was real Even before I had grasped the full significance of the happening Kennedy had dashed forward The cameras still were grinding and they caught him as he kneeled at the side of the stricken man Hardly a second afterward Mackay and I followed
679-155529-0048	train-other-500	and were at Kennedy s side Kauf and the others their faces weirdly ashen clustered about in fright A third time the invisible hand had struck at a member of the company The Black Terror
679-155529-0049	train-other-500	with all the horror written into that story contained nothing as fearful as the menace to the people engaged in its production Shirley s skin was cold and clammy his face almost rigid While conscious he was helpless
679-155529-0050	train-other-500	Kennedy found the little vial and examined it Atropin he ejaculated Walter He turned to me Get some physostigmin quick Have Mackay drive you It s it s life or death Here I ll write it down Physostigmin
none	none	 As I raced madly out and down the stairs Mackay at my heels 
679-155529-0051	train-other-500	I heard a woman s scream Marilyn Did she think him dead Once in the car headed for the nearest drug store grasping wildly at the side or at the back of the seat every few moments
679-155529-0052	train-other-500	as the district attorney skidded around curves and literally hurdled obstacles I remembered a forgotten fact Atropin That was belladonna simply another name for the drug
679-155529-0053	train-other-500	Shirley had procured the stuff for use in his eyes Nevertheless he had been aware undoubtedly of its deadly nature Passing by Kennedy and the rest of us he had overheard Kennedy state that the murderer would be identified
679-155529-0054	train-other-500	as soon as all could be assembled in the projection room The heavy man had not cared to face justice in so prosaic a manner With the same sense of the melodramatic which had led him to slay Stella Lamar in the taking of a scene
679-155529-0055	train-other-500	Werner in the photographing of another he had preferred suicide and had selected the most spectacular moment possible for his last upon earth Yes Shirley was guilty Rather than wait
679-155529-0056	train-other-500	the slow processes of legal justice he had attempted suicide Now we raced to save his life to preserve it for a more fitting end
none	none	 in the electric chair XXXI PHYSOSTIGMIN The first drug store we found was unable to supply us At a second we had better luck All in all we were back at the Manton Pictures plant in a relatively few minutes a remarkable bit of driving on the part of the district attorney Shirley was still in the set Kennedy at once administered the physostigmin I thought with an air of great relief This is one of the rare cases in which two drugs both highly poisonous are definitely antagonistic he explained Each therefore is an antidote for the other when properly administered Marilyn was chafing Shirley s cold hands tears resting shamelessly upon her lids a look of deep inexpressible fear in her expression Will will you be able to save him Professor she asked not once but a dozen different times None of the rest of us spoke We waited anxiously for the first signs of hope the first indication that the heavy man s life might be preserved It was wholly a question whether the physostigmin had been given to him quickly enough Kennedy straightened finally and we knew that the crisis was over Marilyn broke down completely and had to be supported to a chair Strong willing arms lifted Shirley to take him to his dressing room At that moment Kennedy stood up raising his voice so as to demand the attention of everyone taking charge of matters through sheer force of personality I have come here this afternoon he began to apprehend the man or woman responsible for the death of Miss Lamar and mister Werner for the fire in the negative vault and now for this attempt upon the life of mister Shirley Not a sound was evident as he paused no movement save a vague uneasy shifting of position on the part of some of those who had been on the point of leaving I have indisputable evidence of the guilty person s identity but nevertheless for reasons which I will explain to you I have not yet completed my identification To do so it is necessary that certain photographed scenes be projected on the screen and that certain other matters be made perfectly clear I am very anxious you see to eliminate the slightest possibility of error mister Mackay here Kennedy smiled very slightly is the district attorney with jurisdiction at Tarrytown At my request since yesterday or to be exact since the death of mister Werner warned us that no time could be lost he has carried a John Doe warrant Immediately following my identification of the guilty person he or she will be placed under arrest The charge will be the murder of Stella Lamar by the use of poison in a manner which I will explain to you The trial will take place at White Plains the county seat of Westchester County where the murder occurred mister Mackay informs me that the courts there are not crowded in fact he personally has been able to devote most of his time to this case Therefore the trial will be speedy and I am sure that the cold blooded methods used by this criminal will guarantee a quick sentence and an early trip to the electric chair at Ossining Now suddenly grim if everyone will go down to the projection room the larger one we will bring matters to their proper conclusion I imagined that Kennedy s speech was calculated to spread a little wholesome fear among the people we had considered suspects In any case that was the result for an outsider from the expressions upon the various faces might have concluded that several of them were guilty Each seemed to start off across the studio floor reluctantly as though afraid to obey Kennedy yet unable to resist the fascination of witnessing the identification of the criminal as though feeling that he or she individually might be accused and yet unwilling to seek safety at the expense of missing Kennedy s revelation of his methods and explanation of their result I drew him aside as quickly as I could Craig I started eagerly isn t this all unnecessary Can t you see that Shirley is the guilty man If you will hurry into his room with paper and pencil and get his confession before he recovers from his fright and regains his assurance What on earth Walter Kennedy interrupted me with a look of surprise which I did not miss even in my excitement What are you driving at anyway Why Shirley is the criminal He Nonsense Wasn t an attempt made to kill him just now Wasn t it evident that he was considered as dangerous to the unknown as Werner the director Hasn t he been eliminated from our calculations as surely as the man slain yesterday No I flushed Not at all Craig This was not an attempt at murder There were none of the criminal s earmarks noticeable at Tarrytown or in the banquet scene How do you mean Walter For once Kennedy regarded me seriously Why you pointed out yourself that this unknown was exceptionally clever The attempt on Shirley if it were an attempt was not clever at all Why Why I was a little sarcastic because I was sure of myself Because the poison was atropin belladonna That is common I ve read of any number of crimes where that was used Do you think for a moment that the mind which figured out how to use snake venom and botulin toxin would descend to anything as ordinary as all this Well if it was not an attempt at murder what was it Suicide It s as plain as the nose on your face Shirley was passing us as we were standing with Millard and as you told Millard we all were to go to the projection room to identify the criminal Therefore Shirley knew he was at the end of his rope With the theatrical temperament he took the poison just as he finished playing his last great scene It it was a sort of swan song Quite a theory Walter Now I knew Kennedy was unimpressed But where did he get the belladonna For his eyes After the smoke smart The drug is of no use against such inflammation No but it served to brighten his eyes Enid suggested it to him and he went out and got it It helped him play his scenes It gave him the glittering expression he needed in his characterization Again Kennedy seemed to grasp my view He hesitated for several moments Finally he looked up If Shirley is the criminal and if he is above using as common a drug as atropin for killing another man then then why isn t he above using it upon himself That struck me as easy to answer Because if he is killing himself it is not necessary for him to cover his tracks or to do it cleverly and besides it was my big point he probably didn t decide to try to do it until he overheard us and realized the menace At that time he had the belladonna in his pocket He did not have an opportunity to procure anything else Kennedy grinned You re all wrong Walter and I ll show you where your reasoning is faulty In the first place if this criminal was the type to commit suicide at the moment he thought he was about to be caught he would be the type who would reflect upon that idea beforehand As his crimes show a great deal of previous preparation so we may assume that he would prepare for suicide or rather for the possibility that he might wish to attempt it Therefore he would have something better for that purpose than atropin I shook my head but Kennedy continued As a matter of fact the use of that drug is not less clever than the use of the venom or the toxin it is more so Stop and think a minute The snake venom was employed in the case of Miss Lamar s death because it offered about the least possible chance of leaving telltale clues behind The snake poison could be inflicted with a tiny scratch and in such a way that an outcry from the girl would never be noticed Nothing but my pocket lens caught the scratch only the great care I used in my examination put us on the trail at all Now remember how Werner met his death The toxin gave every symptom of food poisoning Except that we discovered the broken stem of the wineglass we would never have been able to prove the tragedy anything but accident Very possibly we have Shirley to thank for the fact that our one clue there was not removed or destroyed In both cases the selection of the poison was suited to the conditions Therefore if an attempt was made to kill Shirley and of the fact I am sure we might expect that the agent likewise would be one least apt to create suspicion There are no portieres no opportunity for the use of another venom and besides that has lost its novelty and so its value Similarly there is no use of food or wine in the scene precluding something else along the toxin order Our unknown realizes that the safest place to commit murder is where there is a crowd He has followed that principle consistently In the case of the heavy man who has a bit of business before the camera where he drinks the contents of a little bottle the very cleverest thing is to use belladonna because Shirley has employed it for his eyes and because maliciously almost it leads immediately to the hypothesis of suicide Ye gods Craig A sudden thought struck me and rather terrified me Do you suppose Enid Faye suggested the use of the drug to Shirley as part of the scheme to kill him Is she I prefer Kennedy interrupted I prefer to suppose that the guilty person overheard her or perhaps saw him buy it or learned in some other way that he was going to use it Completely taken up with this new line of thought I failed to question Kennedy further and it was just as well because most of the people were on their way down to the projection room not only those we wished present but practically everyone of sufficient importance about the studio to feel that he could intrude Kennedy turned to Mackay who had taken no part in our discussion although an interested listener You have the bag and all the evidence Yes Mackay picked it up Watkins the camera man watched it for me while Jameson and I went after that drug Kennedy stooped down quickly but it was locked and had not been tampered with In the corridor by the dressing rooms we met Kauf and Kennedy stopped him How long would it take to make a print from the scene where Shirley took the poison We could have it ready in half an hour in a case of grim necessity Half an hour I exclaimed at that in disbelief You couldn t begin to dry the negative in that time Kauf He glanced at me tolerantly We make what is called a wet print that is we print from the negative while it is still wet and so we only have the positive to dry Then we put it on drums in a forced draught of hot air The result is not very good but it s a fine thing sometimes to get a picture of a parade or some accident in a theater right after it happens Will you do it for me Kauf Kennedy broke in impatiently This is a case of grim necessity he added Kauf hurried off and we made our way across the yard to the stairs leading down into the basement and to the projection room specified by Kennedy Here Manton was waiting uneasy flushed his face gathered in a frown and his hands clenching and unclenching in his nervousness Do you do you know who it is he demanded Not yet Kennedy replied First I must marshal all my evidence Who who do you want present in the projection room mister Phelps mister Millard and yourself mister Manton Miss Loring and Miss Faye mister Gordon Anyone else who wishes if there is room Phelps Millard Gordon and the two girls are inside already Good We will start at once Manton turned to lead the way in At that moment there was a call from the yard We stopped looking up It was Shirley Wait just a minute he cried He was so weak that the two extra men who were helping him virtually supported his weight On his face was a look of desperate determination I I must see this too he gasped XXXII CAMERA EVIDENCE Coming in from the bright light of open day the projection room seemed a gloomy forbidding place certainly well calculated to break down the reserve of perhaps the cleverest criminal ever pitting his skill against the science of Craig Kennedy It was a small room long and not so wide with a comparatively low ceiling In order to obviate eye strain the walls were painted somberly and there were no light colors in evidence except for a nearly square patch of white at the farther end the screen upon which the pictures were projected The illumination was very dim This was so that there would be no great contrast between the light reflected from the images cast upon the screen during pictures and the illumination in the room itself between reels again designed to prevent strain upon the eyes of the employees whose work was the constant examination of film in various stages of its assembly The chairs were fastened to the floor arranged in tiny crescents and placed so as not to interfere with the throw of the pictures from behind The projection machines themselves two in number in order to provide continuous projection by alternating the reels and so threading one machine while running the other were in a fireproof booth or separate room connected with the tiny auditorium only by slits in the wall and a sort of porthole through which the operator could talk or take his instructions Directly beneath the openings to the booth were a table equipped with a shaded lamp a stand for manuscripts and a signal button Here the film cutters and editors sat watching the subject upon which they worked and making notes for changes for bits of superfluous action to be cut out or for titles or spoken inserts to be moved At a signal the operator could be instructed to stop at any point or to start or to wind back and run some given piece over again The lights in the room were controlled from within the booth and also by a switch just at the side of the door A telephone on the table offered a connection with any part of the studio or with the city exchanges so that an official of the company could be reached while viewing a picture As we entered I tried to study the different faces but found it a hopeless task on account of the poor light Kennedy took his place at the little table switching on the little shaded lamp and motioning for Mackay to set the traveling bag so he could open it and view the contents Then Mackay took post at the door a hand in his pocket and I realized that the district attorney clasped a weapon beneath the cover of his clothing and was prepared for trouble I moved over to be ready to help Kennedy if necessary As Kennedy took his key unlocking the bag it would have been possible to have heard the slightest movement of a hand or foot the faintest gasp of breath so tense was the silence First Kennedy took out the various rolls of film Looking up he caught the face of the operator at the opening in the wall and handed them to him one by one Here are two sections of the opening of the story scenes one to thirteen of The Black Terror put together in order but without subtitles One is printed from the negative of the head camera man Watkins The other is exactly the same action as taken by the other photographer We will run both but wait for my signal between each piece Understand Yes sir Now I am giving you two rolls which contain prints of the negative from both cameras of the action at the moment of Werner s death Those are to be projected in the same way when I give you the signal Following that there will be two very short pieces which show the attempt upon the life of mister Shirley They are being rushed through the laboratory at this moment and will be brought to you by the time we are ready for them Finally Kennedy paused and as he took the rolls of negative of the snake film I could see that he hesitated to allow them out of his hands even for a few moments here is some negative which will be my little climax It it is very valuable indeed so please be careful You you want to project the NEGATIVE queried the operator Yes They tell me it can be done even with negative as old and brittle as this if you are careful I ll be careful sir You punch the button there once to stop and two to go I ll be ready in a moment As he spoke he disappeared and soon we heard the unmistakable hiss of the arcs in his machines Kennedy stooped and from the bag produced the little envelopes with the pocket knives and nail files the set of envelopes with the samples of blood the piece of silk he had cut from the portiere at Tarrytown the tiny bits he had cut from the towel found by me in the washroom of this studio and a microscope the last I guessed for effect Around in the semidarkness I could see the faces as necks were craned to watch us Kennedy s deliberateness his air of certainty must have struck terror home to some one person in the little audience Often Kennedy depended upon hidden scientific instruments to catch the faint outward signs of the emotions of his people in a seance of this sort to allow the comparison of their reactions in the course of his review of the evidence to give him what amounted to a very sure proof of the one person s guilt The very absence of some such preparation indicated to me the extent of his confidence At length he began his little lecture for all the world as though this were one of his classes at the University as though there were at stake some matter of chemical reaction I need not tell you ladies and gentlemen that this is a highly scientific age in which we live His tones were leisurely businesslike cool Your own profession the moving picture with all its detail of photography and electricity its blending of art and drama and mechanics is indicative of that but a pause for emphasis it is of my own profession I wish to talk just now the detection and prevention of crime Criminals as a whole were probably the very first class of society to realize the full benefit of modern science Banks and business institutions the various detective and police forces all grades and walks of life have been put to it to keep abreast of the development of scientific crime So true has this been that it is a matter of common belief with many people that the hand of the law may be defied with impunity that justice may be cheated with absolute certainty just so long as a guilty man or woman is sufficiently clever and sufficiently careful Fortunately the real truth is quite the reverse Science has extended itself in many dimensions of space With the use of a microscope for instance a whole new world is opened up to the trained detective Everyone knows now that the examination of hands and fingers is an infallible aid in the identification of criminals and in the proof of the presence of a suspect at the scene of a crime I refer to fingerprints of course But fingerprints are only one small detail in this department of investigation Our criminals know that gloves must be worn or any smooth surface wiped so as to remove the prints In that way they believe they cheat the microscope or the pocket lens As a matter of fact few people have thought of another way of gaining evidence from the finger tips but it is a method possible to the scientist and is not only practicable but exceedingly effective In time it will be recognized by all specialists in crime Now I refer to the deposits under the finger nail Indeed it is surprising how many things find their way under the nail and into the corners of the cuticle Kennedy indicated the files and pocket knives visible in the shaded square of light before him The value of examining finger nail deposits becomes evident when we realize that everyone carries away in that fashion a sample of every bit of material he handles To touch a piece of cloth even lightly will result in the catching of a few of its fibers Similarly the finger nails will deposit either a small or large portion of their accumulation upon such things as the knife blades or files used to clean them and there identification still is possible Nothing in the world is too infinitesimal for use as evidence beneath the microscope In classifying these accumulations Kennedy paused and the silence in the little room was death like we may say that there are some which are legitimate and some which are not It is the latter which concern us now The first day we were here at the studio just four days ago now and immediately following the murder of Miss Lamar mister Jameson discovered a towel in the washroom on the second floor of the office building On that towel there were spots of Chinese yellow make up as though it had been used to wipe a face or hands by some actor or actress Those spots were unimportant There were others however of an entirely different nature together with the mark of blood and a stain which showed that a hypodermic needle had been cleaned upon the towel before it was thrown in the basket Kennedy leaned forward His eyes traveled from face to face That towel was a dangerous clue Now there was a new grim element in his voice That towel alone has given me the evidence on which I shall obtain a conviction in this case To day I let it be known that it was in my possession and the guilty man or woman understood at once the value it would be to me In order to gain additional clues I purposely gave the impression that I had yet to analyze either the spots or the trace of blood I wanted the towel stolen and for that purpose I placed the bag containing it in a locker and left the locker unguarded I coated the towel with a substance which would cause discomfort and alarm itching salve not with the idea that anyone would be foolish enough to go about scratching before my eyes but with the idea of making that person believe that such was my purpose and with the idea of driving him or her to washing his hands at once and more with the idea of forcing him or scaring him into cleaning his fingernails I succeeded On one of these files or knife blades I have found and identified the fibers of that towel I do not yet know the person but I know the mark placed by Mackay on the outside of the little envelope and when I tell Mackay the mark he will name the guilty person mister Kennedy Manton spoke up impulsively every towel in the studio is the same I bought them all at the same time The fibers would all be alike You have named seven people to me including myself as possibly guilty of these these murders Your conclusions may be very unjust and may lead to a serious miscarriage of justice Kennedy was unperturbed This particular towel in addition to the itching salve was thoroughly impregnated with a colorless chemical which changed the composition of the fibers in a way easily distinguishing them from the others under the microscope Do you see mister Manton The promoter had no more to say Now what connection has the towel with the case Simply this Kennedy picked up one of the tiny pieces he had cut out of it The poison used to kill Miss Lamar was snake venom He paused while a little murmur went through his audience the first sound I had detected These spots on the towel are antivenin The venom itself is exceedingly dangerous to handle The guilty man or woman took no chances but inoculated himself with antivenin protection against any chance action of the poison The marks on the towel are the marks made by the needle used by that person in taking the inoculation If you will follow me closely you will understand the significance of this Miss Lamar was killed by the scratch of a needle secreted in the portieres through which she came playing the scene in mister Phelps s library That I will prove to you when I show you the film The night following her death some one broke into the room there at Tarrytown and removed the needle In removing the needle that person scratched himself or herself On the portieres I found some tiny spots of blood Kennedy paused to hold up the bit of heavy silk I analyzed them and found that the blood serum had changed in character very subtly I demonstrated that the blood of the person who took the needle contained antivenin and if necessary I can prove the blood to come from the same individual who wiped the needle on the towel in the studio Kennedy pressed the button before him twice Now I want you to see actually see Miss Lamar meet her death The lights went out then the picture flashed on the screen before us revealing the gloom and mystery of the opening scene of The Black Terror We saw the play of the flashlight finally the fingers and next the arm of Stella as she parted the curtains In the close up we witnessed the repetition of her appearance since the film was simply spliced together not matched or trimmed Following came all the action down to the point where she collapsed over the figure of Werner on the floor Before the camera man stopped Manton rushed in and was photographed bending over her Kennedy s voice was dramatically tense for not one of us but had been profoundly affected by the reproduction of the tragedy Did you notice the terror in her face when she cried out Was that terror really If you were watching you would have detected a slight flinch as she brushed her arm up against the silk For just a moment she was not acting It was pain not pretended terror which made her scream The devilish feature to this whole plot was the care taken to cover just that thing her inevitable exclamation Now watch closely as I signal the operator to run the same action from the other camera Notice the gradual effect of the poison how she forces herself to keep going without realization of the fact that death is at hand how she collapses finally through sheer inability to maintain her control of herself a moment longer During the running of the second piece the tense silence in the room was ghastly Who was the guilty person Who possessed such amazing callousness that an exhibition of this sort brought no outcry Now Kennedy glanced around in the dim light switched on between the running of the different strips I m going to project the banquet scenes and show you the manner of Werner s death Scene after scene of the banquet flashed before us Here the cutter had not been sure just what Kennedy wanted and had spliced up everything We saw the marvelous direction of Werner who little realized that it was to be his last few moments on earth and we grasped the beauty and illusion of the set caused by the mirrors and the man s skill in placing his people Yet there was not a sound because we knew that this was a tragedy a grim episode in which there was no human justification whatever Werner rose at his place He proposed his toast He drank the contents of his glass Then his expression changed to wonderment and from that to fear and realization and he dropped to the floor Kennedy s voice interrupting seemed to me to come from a great distance so powerfully was I affected by the bit of film The poison used to kill mister Werner was botulin toxin selected because its effects could not be diagnosed as anything other than ordinary food poisoning When we look at the print from the second camera s negative you will notice how quickly it acted It was the pure toxin placed in his glass before the wine was poured Once more the unfortunate director s death was reproduced before us Struck down exclaimed Craig as though by some invisible lightning bolt without mercy without a chance without the slightest bit of compunction Why I ll tell you Because he suspected in fact knew who the guilty person was Because he followed that person out to Tarrytown the night the needle was removed from the portieres Because he was a menace to that person s life Kennedy turned to the operator Have those other scenes come down Yes sir All right Kennedy faced the rest of us again There was or rather is another person who suspects the identity of the criminal To day an attempt was made upon the life of Shirley Shirley will not tell whom he suspects because he has no definite proof yet for the mere fact that he suspects he narrowly escaped the fate of Stella Lamar and Werner Kennedy pressed the button Witness the effort to kill the man playing the part of the Black Terror The print was terribly bad in appearance almost a dupe due to the speed with which it had been made Nevertheless the two very brief scenes rushed through for this showing were more absorbingly thrilling more graphic than anything ever to be seen even in a news reel at a movie theater Notice Kennedy exclaimed He puts his hand in one pocket he fumbles hesitates then finds the bottle in the other Whoever put the poison in the vial replaced it in the wrong pocket The film shows that very clearly The camera proves that it was not an attempt at suicide Yet the poison used was belladonna selected because this victim had purchased some and because it would seem sure therefore that he had committed suicide We sat in silence listening horrified There is still another matter Kennedy went on after a moment The fire in the negative vault this morning was incendiary I have proved to the satisfaction of several of us that a bomb was constructed of wet phosphorus and old film and placed in the vault by trickery four days ago the same day Stella Lamar was killed Through a miscalculation the phosphorus was slow in drying and the fire did not occur until to day Thanks to that fact I have in my possession a bit of negative which the murderer very likely wished to have destroyed in fact I believe its destruction to be the motive in planning the fire in the vault He faced the operator Ready to run the negative Yes sir Kennedy pressed the button and when the projection machine threw its picture upon the screen I saw something such as I had never imagined before Everything was black which should have been white and everything white which should have been black The two extremes shaded into each other in weird fashion In fact it was uncanny to watch a negative projected and I followed fascinated This is a film made with the company operation of Doctor Nagoya of the Castleton Institute and I am told by mister Manton that it is one of the finest snake pictures ever made Kennedy spoke fast so that we would get the full benefit of his explanation and so that it would not be necessary to subject the negative to the wear and tear of the sprocket wheels in the projection machine again I am running this for you to show you the action of the rattlesnake whose venom was used to kill Miss Lamar and to give you an idea of the source of the murderer s knowledge of snake poison At this moment Doctor Nagoya whom I could barely recognize in the inverted photography seized one of the rattlers It was a close up and we could see the reptile dart out its forked tongue seeking to get at the hands of the Japanese locked firmly about its neck Then another man walked into the picture holding a jar At once the snake struck at the glass As it did so it was possible to see drops of the venom projected into the jar Other details followed and there were views of other sorts and breeds of snakes from the poisonous to the most harmless The principal scene however had been the one showing the venom Lights up The operator threw the switch again stopping the film and at the same time lighting the projection room Kennedy stepped forward and turned to face us There was this negative in the vaults He spoke rapidly It bore a certain name on the film as editor Some one knew that proof of the possession of this knowledge of snakes might prove a powerful link in the chain against him If that had been a positive instead of a negative you would have recognized Doctor Nagoya s assistant There was a double motive in blowing that vault to destroy the company and to protect himself In fact all the rest of the negative was destroyed Only by chance I saved this piece the very one that he wanted to destroy Everyone waited breathlessly for Kennedy s next move Suddenly Kennedy flushed I could see that he became genuinely angry In this room he exclaimed there sits the most unscrupulous cold blooded inhuman being I have ever known Yet he maintains silence believing still that he can defy the scientific evidence of his crimes I have not yet mentioned however the real proof of his guilt Kennedy picked up one of the little envelopes one which contained a blood smear During the explosion this morning a number of you were cut by falling glass You will remember that I bound up your cuts carefully cleansing each one and wiping away the blood That gave me a sample of the blood of everyone but Miss Loring and mister Shirley Subsequently without their knowledge I obtained a sample from each of them Thus I have a specimen from everyone concerned or possibly concerned in the murders He glanced about but even now there was no telltale revelation I have analyzed these and one shows that the person from whom I obtained the sample has been inoculated with antivenin The mark on the envelope is the same as the mark on the envelope containing the towel fibers a double proof Furthermore I am prepared to show that it is the same blood as the blood upon the portiere He faced me All at once his voice carried the sharpness of a whip Walter relieve Mackay at the door and take his weapon Let no one out Mackay come here An instant later the district attorney leaned over He glanced at the mark indicated by Kennedy then whispered a name The next instant Kennedy rose I thought so he muttered Raising his voice he addressed all of us Here is a man who thought crime so long that he believed he could get away with murder Not only did he commit a second murder and plan a third to cover the first but he planted evidence against nearly all of you He dropped the ampulla in McGroarty s car to implicate any one of four people He coolly stole a cigarette case to put it where it would be found after the film fire and clinch suspicion For all this what justification has he had Jealousy jealousy of the narrowest most primitive sort actuated him Not only was he willing to kill Stella Lamar but he sought to destroy every foot of negative in which she had appeared He was jealous of her success greater than his jealous of her interest in other men greater than her interest in him Her divorce was maneuvered directly by him simply because he thought it would hurt and humiliate her and for no other reason When nothing seemed to stop her on her upward climb when he realized that she was as ambitious as he was and that her position in the picture world alone interested her he sought by devious means by subtle schemes by spreading dissatisfaction and encouraging dissension to wreck the company which had made her At the end he killed her waiting craftily until she was at the very climax of her finest piece of work the opening scenes of The Black Terror There was bitterness in Kennedy s tones Before I would not believe that a man Suddenly the projection room was plunged into darkness Some one had pushed the wall switch close by me I backed into the doorway raising my weapon to resist any attempt to escape Almost at the same instant there were the sounds of a struggle Kennedy had dashed forward in the darkness sure of the position of his man unafraid A scream I recognized from the throat of Enid I groped for the switch but the operator in the booth anticipated me In the first burst of illumination I saw that Kennedy had forced his antagonist back over the front row of chairs Almost I heard the crack of the man s spine I caught a glimpse of the man s face and gasped at the murderous rage as he struggled and strove to break Kennedy s iron grip Enid was the first at Kennedy s side With an expression I failed to analyze until long afterward she sought to claw at the murderer s unprotected features twitching now in impotent fury You wrote that note for her to meet you at the tearoom Kennedy muttered eyes narrowing grimly knowing she would be dead before that time You protected yourself against the poisoned needle in the portieres but your own blood convicts you Millard THE END End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Film Mystery by Arthur B Reeve END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE FILM MYSTERY This file should
