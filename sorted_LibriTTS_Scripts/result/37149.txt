TO THE FRONT CHAPTER I MADGE One bright hot August morning a cheap excursion was advertised to leave South Street wharf Philadelphia for Atlantic City that lively little city by the sea which is so fast growing in size and popularity as to rival the more noted of the Atlantic coast summer resorts A cheap excursion which is within the means of the working class is ever a success and this one was no exception it gave the masses a chance to escape from the overheated city for a small sum and they grasped at it eagerly Bright and early the ferry boat was crowded and still there was no cessation of the stream of humanity that surged toward the river front There were representatives of every trade in the city nearly and likewise a mixture of several nationalities there were young folks and old folks and little children then there were roughs bruisers and bummers an indispensable adjunct to summer excursions and all in all a heterogeneous collection of humanity Just as the hot August sun peeped up over Jersey s sandy horizon the bell of the boat rung and the huge ferry boat began to move out across the Delaware toward Kaighn s Point where connection was to be made with the railway It was a noisy crowd aboard the boat there being a good many roughs among the pleasure seekers who were more or less under the effect of Dock Street soothing syrup and who were disposed to have something to say to every one Among the passengers was a young lady of eighteen or nineteen years of age who sat in the stern of the boat seeming to have no friends or acquaintances She was by no means unprepossessing in face and was trimly built and dressed rather stylishly compared to the others of her sex aboard the boat It was not long before several of the roughs noted the fact that she was unaccompanied and determined to know the reason why Therefore one lubberly raw boned young bruiser with a freckled face blood shot eyes and a large red nose approached her and tipped his hat with tipsy gallantry Scuse me young lady but hic may I ask ef yer got hic company he asked Plenty of it sir the young lady replied her eyes flashing I do not know you you d confer a favor by not addressing me I ll do as I please my gal don t ye sass yer cuzzin Don t ye know me I m a full moon solid Mulligan Muldoon I am Greatly annoyed the young woman turned her head away without answering This however did not abash the full moon for he advanced closer and laid one burly hand upon the railing beside her Now hic see here my beloved Miss Moriarty he began but before he could proceed further a foppishly attired young Jew with red hair and a hooked nose stepped forward and slapped the Fourth Ward man on the shoulder Yoost you bounce oud mine friend he said Der young lady don d vas vant some off your attention Hello who in blazes are you Muldoon demanded gruffly not offering to move I are Muldoon ther solid man I am an I allow I kin lick any man on hic ther boat That don d make any difference Dot young lady don d vant you near her und uff you don d vas gone away right off quick I ll throw you oud dot s der style off an excursionist I am cried the Jew Oho you wull wull you You ll throw me out hey me Full moon Muldoon ther solid man I ll hev a kiss from the girl an then I ll heave yer Israelite carcass overboard for the fishes And making a drunken lunge forward he threw his arms about the young lady s neck amid indignant cries of a crowd of bystanders and attempted to kiss her But he failed in his purpose for she pluckily threw him off and the next instant the Jewish looking young man came to her rescue Seizing the rough by the coat and trousers he jerked him away then with the strength of a Hercules raised him from the floor and hurled him forward down the cabin stairway to the lower deck A cheer of approval at once went up from the larger share of the spectators and the Dutchman became the hero of the hour Some of Muldoon s companions rushed to his rescue and found him doubled up like a jack knife and groaning over severe bumps His rough usage however had evidently cowed him for he made no attempt to show fight or create further disturbance The young lady thanked the Jew but that was all until the boat grated up alongside Kaighn s Point wharf when she caught his eye and motioned for him to approach If you will be so kind as to assist me in finding a seat in the train she said modestly I would esteem it a great favor Vel you bet I vil Id is a purdy rough crowd for a young lady withoud some company My name ish Fritz Snyder vot ish yours You may call me Madge was the quiet reply Then Fritz took her little traveling bag and they left the boat with the crowd and boarded the excursion train which was close at hand Being among the first to reach it they had no difficulty in finding a seat and made haste to occupy it as the cars were fast filling I reckon ash how you vas goin to der sea shore Fritz asked having some curiosity to know I presume so if the cars take me there the young lady replied with a faint smile Is it a nice place Vel I don d know I vas neffer there but I hear id vas a nice place You see I vas goin there on pizness I I don d know off I stay long or not Little more was said during the overland trip to the ocean The young woman did not appear inclined to talk and Fritz finally excused himself and moved to another seat Der ish somedings vot don d vas right apoud dot vimmens he soliloquized She ish not goin to der sea shore for vone object alone I ll bet a half dollar Just ahead of him in the next seat sat two old ladies who were discussing that topic uppermost in their minds spiritualism One was a believer the other an unbeliever Pooh you can t stuff such nonsense into my head Marier the unbeliever declared taking a pinch of snuff Speerits don t trouble me But that is because you have no faith Mehitable Now my Sammy s speerit converses with me every day and night and keeps me posted about the realms of eternal bliss and when I ax him to appear he comes before me as natural as life Has he got that wart behind his left ear yet apparently asked a man in front of the ladies though Ventriloquist Fritz was of course the author of the question Sir r rh the spiritualist cried indignantly I ll have you know my Samuel had no wart upon his person But he had bunions though a portly old gent across the aisle seemed to declare It s a lie a shameful lie I d like to know how you dare cast your insinuations about one you never knew sir and missus Marier arose in her seat excitedly My husband was a good moral gentleman For the land s sake Marier do set down the other woman cried feeling embarrassed No I won t set down Marier declared That old bald headed pussy fabricator said my Sammy had bunions My good woman I never said anything of the kind the portly party declared getting red in the face The old woman s crazy another man seemed to cry Crazy am I missus Marier cried snatching up a freshly baked pumpkin pie from the seat beside her and holding it ready to hurl at the offenders I ll show you if I m crazy Jest ye open yer mouths ary one of ye an I ll show ye how crazy I am Oh I ll learn ye to insult a respectable woman who minds her own business And the woman came off victor for Fritz ventriloquized no further and the passengers had nothing to say having no desire to get plastered up with freshly prepared pumpkin pie In the course of three hours the train arrived at Atlantic City and before the ocean s blue expanse as it billowed away to meet the horizon The grand stretch of level beach was thronged with people despite the pouring heat of the midday sun and many queerly costumed pleasure seekers were buffeting about in the water for recreation and health Fritz was among the first to leave the cars and he stationed himself where he could watch the movements of the girl Madge Some subtle instinct prompted him to do this with the impression that she was what That was an enigma He could not for the life of him have told why but he was impressed with an idea that there was some strange romance connected with her visit to the sea shore that she did not come alone for pleasure but for an object that might be worth investigating She left the cars and at once took a carriage for the principal hotel Not to be balked Fritz jumped into another carriage and directed the driver to take him to the same hotel His conveyance arrived first and he was standing on the veranda when the carriage drove up with Madge and she got out She scarcely noticed him as she came up the steps and passed into the hotel but after she had registered she came out and touched him on the arm You are watching me what for she asked when he turned around facing her Am I an object of suspicion to you sir Fritz flushed uncomfortably and hardly knew how to answer Vel I I There don t make any apologies or excuses I know you are and shall look out for you Please understand I am no criminal Then she turned around again and swept haughtily into the hotel while Fritz walked away toward the beach in meditation She vas sharper ash lightning he mused und dot makes me t ink some more dot for some reason or odder she vil bear watching He took a bath in the ocean and then went back to the hotel He was not quite satisfied to drop the matter where it was Something urged him to pry further into the affairs of this young lady whose case had struck him as being singular On examining the register he found that she was registered as Miss Madge Thurston and assigned room forty three As nothing more offered he sat down on the veranda and watched the stream of people that surged in and out of the hotel and to and from the beach men women and children by the hundred and yet there were scarcely two faces alike During the afternoon an elegant close carriage drawn by a superbly harnessed pair of high stepping bays which were in turn driven by a liveried negro came dashing down the avenue and drew up before the Brighton A man of some thirty five years of age leaped from the carriage and entered the hotel a man with a sinister yet handsome face ornamented with a sweeping mustache and a pair of sharp black eyes He was attired in spotless white duck with patent leather boots and a white plug hat and was evidently a person of some importance He soon came out of the hotel accompanied by the young woman Fritz had defended and entering the carriage they were whirled away down the avenue out of sight Dot settles dot My game s gone und I don d got some professional detective gase there Fritz growled as he watched the receding carriage I ll bet a half dollar I neffer see dem again But he was mistaken That evening when the moon was sending a flood of brilliant light down upon the long level beach he was one of a thousand who took a stroll along the water s edge over the damp sands of the sea He was thus engaged and watching the great luminous moon which seemed to have risen out of the distant watery waste when a man touched him upon the shoulder Excuse me he said respectfully but are you Fritz the young man who took a young lady s part on a ferry boat near Philadelphia to day Vel I dink I am uff I recomember right Vot of it Fritz replied Well sir you are wanted to bear witness to a marriage ceremony to night up the coast and I was sent for you Step this way to the carriage sir Scarcely knowing what was best to do Fritz followed got into an open carriage and was driven rapidly north along the beach through the romantic moonshine But how romantic was his little adventure destined to turn out That was what he asked himself as he gazed doubtfully out upon the greenish blue of mother ocean CHAPTER II THE STRANGE MARRIAGE In the course of little over an hour the carriage stopped at the inlet where Fritz was told to get out and take a small boat and row across the water to the other shore where he would find another carriage to complete his journey in He accordingly did as directed and had soon crossed the inlet found the second carriage and was once more rolling northward along the sandy beach It seemed hours to him ere his conductor drew rein in front of a jutting bluff which interrupted their further progress along the beach from the fact that it reached to the water s edge for another hour he followed the driver a grim uncommunicative fisherman on foot up a jagged path which finally led into a lonely ocean cave which the high tides of many centuries had washed out to about the size of an ordinary room A torch thrust in a crevice in the rocky wall lit up the scene in rather a ghostly way About in the center of the cave stood three parties Madge a clerical looking party and another well dressed man with black hair and full beard He stepped forward as Fritz and the fisherman entered the cave and said Ah I am glad you have come Was fearing that you would not accommodate us sir Vel I didn t vas know vedder to come or not Fritz answered but ash I am here vot you want off me I will tell you The young lady yonder and myself are about to be married and to make things legal we prefer to have a couple of witnesses to the ceremony You will only be required to attach your signature to the marriage certificate and will then be taken back to Atlantic City Vel off dot ish all go ahead mit der pizness Fritz said perching himself on a rock I don d know off id is a legal dransaction or not but I ll do vot ish right by der lady Then let s have the ceremony the prospective bridegroom said Are you ready Madge Quite ready the young lady replied smilingly Then they clasped hands and the aged clerical looking gentleman read a marriage service asked the usual questions and pronounced them man and wife The parties to the consummation were announced as Miss Madge Thurston and Major Paul Atkins At the conclusion of the ceremony the clergyman filled out a certificate signed it himself and then requested Fritz to come forward and do likewise and also the old fisherman His request being obeyed Major Atkins said Your favor is duly appreciated mister Snyder and if an opportunity offers I shall be happy to be of service to you You may now return to town in the manner you came Accordingly Fritz did so not a little puzzled at his adventure and the strange wedding in the coast cave Day was just beginning to lighten the eastern horizon when he arrived back at Atlantic City and went to his room for a nap But he found that sleep would not come to his relief and so he was among the early fashionable bathers at the beach After a good refreshing bath he went back to the Brighton and took a seat on the veranda He had not been seated long when a rapidly driven carriage whirled up before the hotel and an elderly portly man leaped out and hurried into the hotel his face flushed with excitement He was well dressed wore a little bunch of gray side whiskers on either cheek and was evidently all of sixty years of age Fritz surveyed him closely with the short glimpse he got of him and then scratched his head as if in quest of an idea I ll bet a half dollar I see into der whole pizness now he muttered with a chuckle Id vas plainer ash mud to me Dot couple vot got married vas elopers mit each odder und dis pe der old man on der war path after em madder ash a hornet Der next t ing is who vas der bully veller vot ish honest und haff der rocks to support dot virtue After a few minutes the old gentleman came out of the hotel and stood looking out upon the ocean with rather a savage expression of countenance and his was a face that could be very stern when occasion required it I don d know vedder I better poke mine nose inder dis pizness or not Fritz muttered taking a second survey of him He looks like ash if he might swaller a veller off he got mad und I don d vas care apoud imitadin Jonah As if interpreting his thoughts the old gent turned rather gruffly and took a searching glance at the young man Well he said I suppose I look as if I wanted to cut some one s throat don t I Fritz laughed lightly Vel I vas t inking somedings like dot he admitted I thought so I ain t a fool I know when I am mad I look mad Do you know of any party around here who s particularly anxious to end his career and ain t got the grit to do the job I would like to operate on such a chap You feels like ash off you could pulverize some one eh Humph I ll contract to lay out the first man that durst look cross eyed at me I m mad I am mad as thunder and I come from Leadville too where they raise thunder occasionally Bah I wish some one would step up and kick me Well I m your man if you really want a bona fide job done Fritz caused a pompous looking man to say who stood near ventriloquially of course I m the champion patent kicker from Kalamazoo The old gent from Leadville turned and gazed at the pompous looking man a moment his dander rising several degrees Oh so you re anxious to kick me are you my Christian friend You want to kick me do you he ejaculated Who has said anything about kicking you sir the pompous party demanded in haughty surprise You d evidently better go to bed and sleep off your cups my friend I haven t drank a drop sir in ten years And for you to deny expressing a desire to boot me sir why man I heard you You are a liar sir I said nothing of the kind Besides I am not in the habit of picking quarrels with strangers And with a shrug the pompous man turned on his heel and walked off indignantly Leadville s angered delegate gazed after him a moment with unutterable contempt then turned to Fritz Poor fool He s no sand or he d not cut and run after calling a man a liar Up in Leadville things are supremely different but here alas is a lack of back bone I say young fellow have you ever cherished dreams of becoming rich a man of millions as it were Vel I don d know but I haff some off dose anxiety to get rich vonce in a vile Fritz admitted Well sir I can tell you just how you can do it the easiest if you will stroll upon the beach with me Accordingly Fritz arose and sauntered down to the beach with this eccentric Leadvillian whoever he might prove to be Now I suppose you d like to know what I m mad at the old gent began pushing his gold headed cane into the sand as they strolled along Well before I tell you I want to know who you are and what your business is My name vos Fritz Snyder und I vas vot you might call a detective or dot is I vas trying my luck at der pizness Indeed Then perhaps it is well I have met you for I have a case and if you can win that case you can also win five thousand dollars How does that strike you It hits me right vere I liff ven I ish at home Fritz grinned Yoost you give me der p ints und I m your bologna you can bet a half dollar on dot five t ousand dollar job Vot s der lay suicides murder sdole somedings or run avay mit anodder vife s veller Neither A girl has run away from her home and is wanted five thousand dollars worth She is my daughter and is a somnambulist and consequently of unsound mind at times She frequently goes into a trance and remains thus for weeks at a time eating and drinking naturally enough but knowing nothing what she has been doing when she awakens though to outward appearance she is awake when in this trance but not in her right mind I have consulted eminent physicians but they pronounce her case incurable and say she will some day die in one of these trances Here the man from Leadville grew pathetic in his story and wiped a tear from his eye but finally went on Well as you may imagine I have had a deal of trouble with her for in her state of trance she has often robbed me of sums of money And wandered off too sometimes but this last blow has been the most severe It came to my knowledge that she had become the prey of an unprincipled Eastern rascal He had met her during her somnambulistic wanderings and prejudiced her against me and caused her to rob not only me but others and surrender the stolen booty to him On learning this myself and neighbors formed into a vigilance committee to hunt the rascal down but he took to his heels and fled Eastward A few days later my poor child turned up missing and with her the sum of twenty thousand dollars which had been paid me from the sale of a mine and which I had lodged in my safe for safe keeping until I could deposit it the next day Twenty t ousand so much ash dot Yes a big sum and likewise nearly all the money I then possessed I immediately took up the trail but egad twas no use The girl is sharper than lightning and eluded me at every turn I found that her destination was Eastward doubtless to join her evil genius and so I telegraphed to Chicago and saint Louis for the detectives to look out and intercept her if possible But all to no avail She was seen in those places but owing to some irregularity beyond my comprehension was not captured When I arrived in Chicago I found that she had two days before left the city Eastward bound I trailed her to Philadelphia and there lost all track of her Thinking quite likely she would come to this summer resort I came on to day in hopes of striking the trail but all to no avail I have as yet heard of no clew to her whereabouts Vel dot ish purdy bad Fritz assented Vot ish your name My name is Thornton I am a mining speculator from Leadville Colorado Und your daughter s name vos Madge She is a pretty young maiden aged eighteen and left her home very well dressed Und der feller vot vas pocketing der money vot vos his name It is hard to guess what his true name was At Leadville he was called Pirate Johnson at Pueblo he was known as Griffith Gregg Gregg Gregg Fritz said meditatively I am on the look out for a man by that name But my man is a smuggler This villain may be connected with any nefarious piece of rascality If I only had him here one or the other of us would get laid out that is as good as sworn to God only knows what perils my poor child will pass through before I succeed in finding her if I ever do Vel I reckon ve can find her uff der ish such a t ing in der dictionary Fritz asserted He then went on to relate the particulars of his assisting the lady on the boat and of the marriage in the cave which excited mister Thornton greatly By Heaven I see through it all Madge Thurston is no more or less than my daughter and she has wedded this rascal Atkins who is one and the same person who was the Gregg or Johnson out West God forbid that my child is married to such a wretch Describe him Fritz obeyed giving a description according as he remembered the bridegroom also of the man who took Madge Thurston from the hotel The latter was undoubtedly Gregg the speculator declared and the other also was it is likely disguised for the occasion with a false beard Now Fritz I want you to help me find my child and break the neck of this rascal and you shall have for reward the sum I promised you We ll search this world high and dry but what we ll recover my child Come let s seek a conveyance to take us to the cave They accordingly went back to the Hotel Brighton ate dinner and afterward secured a carriage and set out for the scene of the strange wedding the night before And thus Fritz entered into a five thousand dollar chase which was destined to lead him into more adventures than he had yet experienced CHAPTER III THE BLUFF HOUSE In due time they arrived at the cave where the ceremony of the previous night had taken place but a thorough search of the cavernous wash out failed to yield any tidings of the romantic lovers Pshaw there s no use of further search in this direction they have long ere this set out for some other portion of the country and we are wasting time in tarrying here Mebbe dot ish so but I dink dey vas go on up der coast instead off cum pack by Atlantic City Not impossible In that case it will be our best lead to go back to Atlantic take the cars to Philadelphia and strike for some sea coast point ahead of them Dot vould pe a purty good idea vor you but I t ink better I remain on der coast stardting vrom here und follow der trail in der rear I ll bet a half dollar I find em first afore you do Very well It shall be as you deem best I will leave you here and join you or rather be there to meet you when you reach Long Branch If nothing results in our favor by that time I ll decide what is the next best course to pursue Here is a hundred dollars toward defraying your expenses If you need more telegraph to Jim Thornton at the Chalfonte Long Branch and I ll remit And placing the sum of money in Fritz s possession he soon after took his departure After he had gone Fritz sat down on a rock in the mouth of the cave which overlooked the ocean and gazed thoughtfully out upon the sunlit waters Vel here I vas but der next question ish vere vas I he soliloquized I haff undertaken a job mitout any bases vor a start off I kinder vish Rebecca vas here too but ash vishin don d vas do some good pizness is der next consideration Night was not far distant but he resolved to continue on up the coast in hopes of finding a fisherman s house where he could obtain food and lodging He accordingly left the cave and continued his journey He soon came to a level stretch of beach again and followed its northward course for a number of miles until sunset when he found himself as far from any human habitation as he had in the start He accordingly sought a grassy spot back from the beach and lay down to rest Arising early the next morning he struck out once more on his journey feeling decidedly anxious to find some kind of a human habitation as he was very hungry He soon spied a farm house inland from the beach and made for it in double quick time A gruff looking man sat upon the front veranda as he entered the well kept yard and eyed him with an expression of suspicion Well what d ye want young man he demanded sourly Grub somedings to eat Fritz replied spiritedly I vas hungry like ash a sucker after a hard winter Get out I don t want no tramps about here Clear I say or I ll set the dog on you the farmer growled stamping on the veranda with his cane But I don d vas no tramp nor I don d vas skeardt at der dogs Fritz replied I vants some preakfast und ish able to pay vor id like a shendleman Go to a tavern then I don t keep no puttin up place But I don d find some tavern und I ain d going no furder ondil I get somedings to eat So trot oud der best vot you haff und I pay for em Didn t I tell you you couldn t get something to eat here the man cried getting exasperated Then he began whistling for the dog I ll show you who runs this place All right Fetch oud der canine Fritz grinned perching himself on the fence and taking a pistol from his pocket I yoost ash leave haff dog steak ash peef stew Anydings to fill up ven a veller vas hungry What how dare you sir I ll have you arrested for carrying concealed weapons you scamp Den I haff you arrested vor causing cannibalism py not giffin a veller somedings to eat Come now mister yoost set oud der vittles und der von t pe no droubles otherwise der may be an exposure off somedings The farmer started at Fritz s unmeaning declaration and giving him a swift startled glance arose and entered the house Fritz noticed what effect his thoughtless shot had had and gave vent to a low peculiar whistle denotive of surprise Hello vot ish dose I ve done he mused I give der old chap a sour grape dot time all of which proves dot he is fraid off der exposure off somedings und don d vas got a clear conscience Vel dot ish purdy goot too Von t ing leads to anodder mebbe I vil discover somedings else Anyhow I m going to stay right here undil I gets somedings to eat und I reckon der old man vil fetch or send id Nor was he wrong in his reckoning for shortly afterward a plump and pretty maid brought him out a tray of victuals that looked most tempting There was bread and butter cold meat cake pie apples and a bowl of rich milk No wonder Fritz s eyes sparkled with satisfaction as he sat down upon the carriage block and received the offering I thank you more ash a t ousand times he said Der old man didn t vas goin to give me somedings but I told him I would expose him und dot fixed him Vot s der old crab s name young lady The girl stared mister Sample do you mean she asked in surprise Yes I reckon dot s der one der old vinegar barrel vot yoost sot on der veranda So his name vas Sample eh If he vas a sample off der neighbors around here I dinks I stop no more He vas got a segret don d he How should I know sir Oh vel I didn t know but you might haff heard somedings If I had I don t believe I should confess it to you the maid retorted When you get through eating leave the server on the block But hold on you ain d going Yes But vait aw ile I say no I vant to ask you some questions What Vel one t ing ish der a town somevere s near on der coast Yes several Vot one is der nearest Forsyth Landing Vot is der population Four people Shimminy dunder So mooch ash dot Any old maids among der lot Nary a maid Vel dot s all Much obliged After she had departed Fritz finished his meal and then resumed his tramp along the lonely beach Half an hour brought him to the landing but he did not pause Two rough looking old sea dogs were lounging outside a sort of a hut but their appearance did not inspire Fritz with any desire to cultivate their acquaintance About sunset he arrived at a far prettier spot than he had yet encountered A great bluff of land rolled up to an abrupt and precipitous ending at the ocean s edge In high tide it would be impossible to walk along the beach at the base of the bluff owing to the depth of water while at low tide the beach was quite bare The evening tide was rolling in close to the base of the cliff when Fritz reached it and so he paused and took a reconnoissance Far up on the top of the bluff he saw a large rambling old house in a grove of trees but whether it was deserted or not he could not tell It looked so grim in the weird sunset light and so isolated in its lone watch by the sea that one might easily have fancied it an abode of spooks and their like I s pect dot I ll haff to climb up und go around that bluff Fritz muttered not at all liking the idea Uff a veller vas to try und wade along der front he d like ash not get drowned und dot vould pe a duyfel off a fix I wonder ef der folks who lif up yonder ar samples off dot Sample I met dis morning Looks like ash uff it might be a ghost factory He was considering what was best to do when he felt a tap upon his shoulder and wheeled about with a nervous start Before him stood a ragged frowsy haired bare footed girl some sixteen or seventeen years of age a girl with a well rounded figure of but medium stature and a face at once peculiar and attractive from the sparkle of its eyes the broad grin of its mouth and the amount of dirt gathered about it She had evidently but recently emerged from the water for her long black hair as well as her wet garments were dripping with drops which the dying sunlight transformed into diamonds Ha ha ha she laughed putting her pretty arms akimbo and staring hard at Fritz Don t I look silly though Vel I don d know apoud dot I dink der abblication uff some water mit your face vould make you look petter ash vot you are now Fritz answered somewhat puzzled Water ha ha I just came out of the water But oh I m so silly that s what everybody says and I guess it must be so anyhow they call me Silly Sue Was you ever silly boss Vel I don d vas know so mooch apoud dot vedder I vas or not Fritz replied with a doubtful grin Do I look silly Oh lordy you are the silliest looking goose I ever saw I never saw a Yankee but what he was silly But I don d vas be a Yankee Get out Don t dispute me I know just who and what you are You are Neptune come up from the bottom of the sea You lie like dunder Fritz retorted backing up and beginning to get considerably alarmed for he began to suspect that she was crazy I vasn t no Neptune at all no von but Fritz Snyder Id s a vonder you don d call me Joner vot swallered de valebone Nop you re Neptune Do you see the house up yonder Vel yes vot off it Oh that s a high old roost Ghosts and skeletons perch up there after dark and grin and rattle their bones at you They don t do it to me because I feed em snuff Ha ha can you snuff the silly part of that outrageous gag Say boss where you going ef it ain t askin too much Vel I don d know dot myself Don t know where you re going No I vas huntin vor somebody Oho so am I I was huntin for some one when I discovered something and they called me silly because I refused to tell what Well good day swim over to England when you want to see me again Then with a peal of elfish laughter she ran and sprung into the water and swam around the base of the cliff out of sight I ll pet a half dollar dot gal vas drunk or crazy von or der odder und der pest t ing vor me to do is shlip avay vile I can Fritz ejaculated To think was to act with him and he accordingly set out clambering up the steep side of the bluff In due time he reached the top and found a level spot of a couple of acres extent in the center of which the house was situated surrounded by sentinel rows of sighing hemlocks A general aspect of desolation was perceptible on every hand showing the premises to be untenanted The garden was grown up with rank weeds and the house weather worn and old some of the shutters hanging by one hinge It was a large structure of many queer gables wings and projections and fronted upon a road which had been used to communicate with some thoroughfare further inland Dot looks like ash uff it vas going to rain Fritz muttered gazing at an ominous bank of clouds that was gathering in the west I dink maybe I petter sday in der old house till morning uff I und der ghosts can agree I don d vas much affraid off ghosts anyhow And he evidently was not for he boldly entered the house by the creaking front door and closed the door behind him When the clouds had overspread the sky in an inky mass and darkness had set in around the gloomy edifice two black whiskered men came along and stopped at the mansion CHAPTER IV THE GHASTLY RELIC Meantime Fritz had been in the old rookery some time prior to the arrival of the bearded men No sooner had he entered the large hall and closed the door behind him than he felt a sort of dread of something he knew not what There was a damp musty deathly smell about the place that he did not quite like I don d know vedder I vas afraid of ghosts or not he soliloquized pausing and gazing around him It looks ash uff dis might be a blace vere dey manufacture ghost shows but somebody has liffed here vonce upon a time The carpet yet remained upon the floor of the long hall and also upon the staircase which led to the upper floor There was also a large picture hung upon the wall Passing along the hall Fritz tried each of the doors which opened off from it but in each instance he found them locked and was unable to effect an entrance Vel dot looks like ash uff nopody vas to home he muttered I ll try der upstairs part und if I don d haff no better success I vil stay out mit der hall He accordingly ascended the hall staircase and proceeded to take a tour of the upper part of the rambling old structure Here the doors were all locked with one exception and this had evidently been left as locked the bolt being turned but the door not having been tightly closed the bolt failed to enter the socket Opening this door Fritz entered and found himself in a large furnished apartment there being a carpet old and moth eaten upon the floor several pieces of stuffed furniture which had also been victims of moth and worm and a large round oaken table in the center of the room And over this suspended by a cord which was fastened to the ceiling was an object which caused Fritz to utter a grunt of startled alarm It was a man s head cut from the body at the throat and held in suspension by a cord fastened to the long hair The head had probably hung there for a year or so for the flesh had dried down upon the bones The eyes however retained their glassy stare the teeth showed to ghastly advantage and the heavy black mustache and goatee bristled ferociously Fritz gave a startled cry and his hair fairly raised on end as he beheld the strange spectacle but the longer he stared at it the less his alarm and he finally advanced into the room By shimminy I vas skeardt like ash der duyfel at first put now I don d vas a bit afraid Somepody hang dot up there yoost for a scare crow Uff der ghosts vas to see it I ll bet a half dollar dey vould run Just then there was a flash of lightning and a heavy roll of thunder which caused Fritz to start and give a nervous glance at the swinging head I don d quite vas like id here he muttered uneasily I d makes a veller t ink he s goin der get smashed up effery minute I vonder vot dey keep up there and his eyes rested upon an aperture in the ceiling such as is often provided in houses as a means of reaching the roof A stout rope hung down through this opening to the floor of the room and had evidently been used to climb up into the attic Fritz was just contemplating it when a sound of footsteps in the hall outside aroused him to quicker thoughts I ll bet a half dollar it s a ghost comin he gasped the tendency of his hair being again decidedly upward But it was a cold day ven dey scalb me mit der tommyhawk ash long ash I can climb Accordingly up the rope he went hand over hand with the agility of a monkey and soon gained the attic immediately above the chamber It was a dark ill smelling place and so far as Fritz could see used for no particular purpose whatever Ensconcing himself directly beside the aperture through which he had come up Fritz prepared to await developments He was not a little anxious to know who the new comer was whether a human or spiritual being for if the latter he had a curiosity to inspect it In a few moments the door opened and a strapping Irishman stalked into the chamber a lank lean specimen of humanity with a Killkenny face red hair a fringe of reddish beard under his lower jaw extending to his ears and attired in brogans short pantaloons and a blue soldier coat with a grimy clay pipe in his mouth and battered plug hat on his head Of the rale old race of Irishmen he was certainly a good specimen Arrah sure it s divil one room but they have locked an a sorry place it is too for a dacent Irish gintlemon an the son of a duke at that Bad cess to sich a counthry onny how It s wurruk like the divil for a bit of grub and when a mon gits out ov wurruk sure stomick has to pay for it If yez ax a mon will he be afther givin yez a nip off bread he tell yez Arrah off wid ye ye murdtherin tromp or I ll sick tha purrup on yez bedad I ll yoost pet half dollar der Irishman vas pin stoppin mit Samples Fritz muttered with a grin taking a peep at the son of Erin He vas hungry like as vot I vas Vonder off he haff discovered der skelegon yet avile The Hibernian had not evidently for he was perched composedly beneath the suspended head Sorry a place this is for the son of a duke he went on muttering Sure it looks as if the ould divil himself had been here Guess this property would be sellin moighty cheap tha while Ugh as a heavy clap of thunder caused the house to shake from stem to stern a sorry wild night it s a goin to be an it s meself that s wishin I was back forninst the furdther side av the big puddle Ha ha laughed Fritz throwing his voice to the farther side of the room Yis ha ha bad cess to the loikes av yez whoever ye may be the Irishman cried fiercely gazing in vain around the apartment in search of the author of the laugh Ho ho itchy dirdty Irish Fritz caused a different voice to say in a still opposite part of the room No I m divil a wan av the likes the son of Erin cried getting angry Bad luck to yez ef I gits me hands on yez it s a divil s own trouncin you ll get ontirely I ll have yez know my name is Patrick Grogan an it s the dacent gintlemonly son av a duke and a duchess I am bedad A son off a gun more likely Look out you bloody Irish or I vil spit on you Fritz caused the suspended head to say in a hoarse gurgling voice Aha it s spittin on me yez ll be eh the Hibernian cried leaping from his seat his walking stick in hand a formidable piece of real thorn Oh you black livered omadhaun if I catch yez won t I tache yez to be dacent and civil to a gintlemon Then chancing to glance upward he saw for the first the swinging head and in utter horror dropped upon his knees and raised his hands upward in supplication Oh holy Virgin Mary protect me he howled his terrified gaze glued upon the unsightly object Oh murdtherin Maria och bad luck fot have I done mister Divil shure it s nary a thing wrong I ve did nor sthalin I ve never been guilty of You vas von son off a sea cook came from the head Yis och sure I se anything yez wants mister Divil only don t be afther hurtin the loikes av me Then arise dirdty Irish and climb into the attic before the spirits come to wrap their icy clutches around you Sure I ll be afther goin Pat cried and he did go not up the rope but out of the room as fast as he could go Nor did he pause until outside of the house as Fritz could tell by the sound of his rapidly retreating footsteps Vel dot vas purdy goot fun Fritz muttered with a grin I dink I vil vait dil some vone else comes He had not long to wait before footsteps sounded once more coming up the stairs just as the storm broke loose outside and torrents of rain poured down upon the roof while the thunder rumbled ominously Presently two men entered one carrying a lantern for it was now quite dark Both were roughly dressed and brutal looking fellows wearing heavy black beards Humph was Fritz s mental comment as he beheld them I ll bet a half dollar I smells von mice Uff I haff not made a big mistake I dinks I haff stumbled right inder the smugglers den vot I am looking for It was only a sudden suspicion to be sure nevertheless it struck him very forcibly One of the men set the lantern upon the table and then perched himself beside it while the other sat down upon a chair and gazed speculatively at the ghastly object which hung suspended from the ceiling I wonder how long afore the rest o ther boys will be here he growled Dunno the other fellow replied Hope they ll come afore long and settle the matter so that we ll know what we ve got to do How d ye think it s going Dunno Reckon the majority ll be ag in the poor cuss I m thinkin that way too I kinder hope not though for I don t fancy the job Pshaw you re chicken hearted without cause He s never made love to you Darn it no but he s too fine a specimen of manhood to feed to the sharks Pooh Many s the one better n he wot s enriched the bottom o the sea I wonder who the Irishman was we met at the front Some tramp I allow who d sought a night s shelter here and got skeered at our friend Bill and he glanced at the swinging head with a laugh Hello I say Bill how are you getting along in your new place o residence First rate apparently answered the grinning head followed by a ghostly sort of a gurgling laugh Jehosaphat cried the questioner leaping to his feet Thunder and lightning Did ye hear that Hand Waal I should murmur Hank grunted leaving the table with a spring and landing near the door What the devil s the matter Cussed ef the cadaver o Bill Budge didn t speak the first man cried Git out Budge has bin dead over a year how in thunder could he speak Mebbe his spirit hes come back inter his head Pooh impossible It was our fancy we didn t hear nothin Hank growled edging a little nearer to the door You re a liar thundered a voice seeming to come directly from between the pearly teeth of the suspended head and to make matters worse the head began to swing slowly to and fro With howls and curses the two masked men made the hastiest kind of an exit from the room and down the stairs while Fritz in the attic was convulsed with laughter Dot was better as half a dozen suppers py shimminy he snorted holding his sides All was now quiet for some time except for the howling of the storm without But finally footsteps were again heard and eight men all masked but one filed into the room The eighth man was a young man of prepossessing appearance unmasked and had his hands bound behind his back He was better dressed than his grim captors and there was a fearless cool expression upon his face that at once won Fritz s admiration Ha Hank and Jim have been here already and gone a tall broad shouldered member of the party said They ll be back directly no doubt And now Hal Hartly we will proceed to review your case and dispose of it according to the decision of the majority Go ahead captain the prisoner replied calmly I am as well prepared now as I shall be CHAPTER V 
6687-119383-0000	train-other-500	BILL BUDGE S CONVERSATION To Fritz the scene below of course began to grow more interesting
none	none	 Dot veller vas goin to pe tried for somedings he muttered 
6687-119383-0001	train-other-500	und vot ish more uff der verdict don t vas in his favor he vas goin der git sp iled
none	none	 Young Hartly if his thoughts were in the same channel as those of the watcher didn t appear very much troubled about the matter 
6687-119383-0002	train-other-500	for he perched himself upon the table while the six jurors sat in a semicircle facing him and the captain a little to one side
none	none	 Well sir what have you to say Hartly in regard to this suspicion which has arisen against you 
6687-119383-0003	train-other-500	that you are a traitor to our cause Nothing sir except that whoever started the suspicion is a liar and a coward was the retort Then you deny that you have ever betrayed the existence of this band outside of its own membership
6687-119383-0004	train-other-500	I do most emphatically What assurance have you that any one has betrayed you Is it not ample proof when strange men haunt this vicinity and haunt the members to their very doors
6687-119383-0005	train-other-500	These law sharks or detectives only wait for some disclosure to spring their traps on me and my faithful followers I am not to blame Though forced into service against my will
6687-119383-0006	train-other-500	and made to swear the oath of allegiance rather than lose my life I have kept such secrets as came into my possession I believe I know who has excited the suspicious feeling against me Well sir who
6687-119383-0007	train-other-500	Your rascally son for one your jealous daughter for another Hartly replied shrugging his shoulders with a contemptuous laugh How dare you term my son rascally sir and accuse my child of jealousy
6687-119383-0008	train-other-500	Because the boy is as unprincipled a villain as yourself and as for your daughter when she found that I did not court her favor she at once turned against me
6687-119383-0009	train-other-500	I despise both your son and your daughter Captain Gregg and that is all I have to say except that I am not guilty of the charge preferred against me That remains to be told by the jury You see the head of Bill Budge
6687-119383-0010	train-other-500	just above you Hartly He was caught in an intended act of treachery and you see his end If Bill could speak he d tell you that the fate of the traitor is hard
none	none	 You re a cussed liar 
6687-119383-0011	train-other-500	Budge s suspended remnant seemed to say in a deep hoarse voice The captain and the jury uttered each a startled oath and gazed at the offending head in astonishment Who called me a liar Gregg demanded fiercely By the gods
6687-119383-0012	train-other-500	I thought it was Budge s lips that uttered those words So it was the head seemed to say then there was a gurgling sort of laugh and the head shook perceptibly
none	none	 Ten thousand furies 
6687-119383-0013	train-other-500	Gregg yelled and hastily wrenching open the door he made a hasty exit from the room followed by the jurors nor did they stop short of the bottom of the stairs
6687-119383-0014	train-other-500	Hartly did not leave the room but dismounting from his perch upon the table walked off a few paces to where he could get a good look at Budge s unfortunate pate
none	none	 Something deuced funny here 
6687-119383-0015	train-other-500	I m blowed if there ain t he soliloquized apparently quite composed It s the first time I have ever heard dead men talk I say Budge how s the temperature up your way Two t ousand degrees above blood heat
none	none	 seemed to issue from between the gleaming teeth Humph pretty warm that I must admit Hartly said looking still more puzzled 
6687-119383-0016	train-other-500	Fritz while perpetrating the ventriloquism was also listening and planning
none	none	 Dot veller Hartly is der very chap to helb me oud mit my scheme he muttered und ve must escape from here pefore der smugglers return 
6687-119383-0017	train-other-500	Accordingly he slid down the rope into the room below Hartly looked surprised Who the deuce are you he demanded stepping back a pace Fritz Snyder detective Fritz replied I come here on pizness
none	none	 vot for you can easily guess 
6687-119383-0018	train-other-500	I vant you to helb me oud mit it und I vil see dot you haff your liberty Ha ha that s your game is it Well my friend I d like to do it first rate but I can not oblige you Vy not
none	none	 Because I swore allegiance to the cause you would have me betray and it never shall be said that Hal Hartly was not a man of his word But I heard you say dot you vas forced inder der pizness 
6687-119383-0019	train-other-500	So I was against my will but that does not lessen the obligations of my oath While I live I shall adhere to my sworn promise You vas foolish you don d vil get any credit for your resolve
6687-119383-0020	train-other-500	Yoost ash like ash not you will pe killed on der suspicion dot s already against you Perhaps If so I shall submit knowing I have been innocent of breaking my word
none	none	 Pshaw dis vos all nonsense 
6687-119383-0021	train-other-500	You don d vas vant to die no more ash any odder man
none	none	 Let me cut der bonds vot fastens your arm und ve vill climb up to der attic und escape vrom der roof to some place where we vil pe safe undil we can make arrangements to break oop dis smugglers league 
6687-119383-0022	train-other-500	Nothing would please me more but owing to my oath I must positively refuse to do anything of the kind Hartly persisted firmly I admire your proposed attempt and while I shall do nothing to interrupt it
6687-119383-0023	train-other-500	I can not conscientiously do anything to help it along Can you enlighten me any as to the mystery of this head which though not possessed of life yet uses its voice so naturally I dells you noddings apoud it Fritz replied shaking his head Hark
6687-119383-0024	train-other-500	Yes I hear it It is Gregg and the boys coming back Quick or you will be seen
none	none	 Fritz made haste to shin up the rope to the garret once more and had barely succeeded in so doing when the smugglers headed by Captain Gregg once more entered the room They did not come boldly in but thrust their heads in and took a look around first 
6687-119383-0025	train-other-500	Seeing that no harm had come to Hartly they then ventured in Ha ha you re brave fellows ain t you he laughed I didn t cut tail and run although I have not even the use of my hands
none	none	 You re cussed brave all at once 
6687-119383-0026	train-other-500	Gregg growled evidently not liking the taunt Did that thing speak again with a wry glance at the guiltless pate of the departed Budge Of course I ve had quite a chat with William Hartly replied
6687-119383-0027	train-other-500	He says he s in a very warm latitude at present and so he s come back spiritually for a short cooling off Gregg uttered an oath Pooh I don t believe such bosh But it s a fact nevertheless
6687-119383-0028	train-other-500	Budge says they ve got a little corner left up in his country for you too when you get ready to emigrate which will be mighty soon judging by the active preparations that are being made to receive you such as gathering kindling wood making matches and the like
6687-119383-0029	train-other-500	Curse you they ll git you first the smuggler said with vicious emphasis Go ahead boys an tell him the decision you ve made Well
6687-119383-0030	train-other-500	we ve concluded that Hal Hartly is a traitor to our cause and for the sake of protection it will be necessary to feed him to the fishes one of the jurors said
none	none	 Eh ain t that the ticket boys 
6687-119383-0031	train-other-500	A grunt of assent from the others was the answer Then it shall be so Captain Gregg ordered I am sorry for you Hartly but treachery merits death as you were informed when you joined
6687-119383-0032	train-other-500	As an organization which must exist in secrecy we are forced to adopt harsh rules Your companions have carefully weighed all the evidence and have decided that the safety of the organization demands your death As you have sown
6687-119383-0033	train-other-500	so shall you reap Do you mean this Captain Gregg I do sir emphatically Then you shall live to repent ever having pronounced my doom
6687-119383-0034	train-other-500	Henceforth I shall not consider my oath of allegiance obligatory as I have hitherto done I ll show you what harm I can do your vile organization But you shall have no chance
6687-119383-0035	train-other-500	Jim Hovel and his brother have already consented to sink you to the bottom of the Atlantic for a stated sum and thus rid us of you effectually They are waiting below for you as it is a safe night for such work
6687-119383-0036	train-other-500	If you have any prayers to make you had better make the best use of your time I ll suit myself about that you villain Numbers two and three take the prisoner down stairs the captain ordered Two of the smugglers seized hold of poor Hartly and led him from the room
6687-119383-0037	train-other-500	Up in the attic Fritz was in a predicament The majority of the smugglers yet remained in the room below and he could not get out of the house in that way as was his desire to make an attempt if possible to rescue Hal Hartly
none	none	 The only course left for him was to escape through a trap door onto the roof and trust to luck in getting to the ground from there Dot veller vas von big fool for not acceptin my advice he mused as he fumbled cautiously around in the darkness 
6687-119383-0038	train-other-500	Yoost like ash not dey vil pe gone off mit him ven I git down dere und den he vil pe a goner sure ash der dickens It required several minutes to find the trap in the roof and it was no slight job to displace it
6687-119383-0039	train-other-500	When he had accomplished this much however it was but a moment s work to clamber out upon the roof in the pouring rain and replace the door Py shimminy dot vas a hard storm he soliloquized
none	none	 Der ocean grunts as uff she vas got der dispeppersy Now der next t ing ish somedings else Der roof vas slippery ash von soap ladle und first I know der vil pe a dead Dutchmon spilled someveres over t e ground 
6687-119383-0040	train-other-500	That portion of the main roof of the building was quite steep and the eaves were at least twenty five feet from the ground
none	none	 Not fancying the idea of a drop of that distance the young detective crawled to the ridge to reconnoiter 
6687-119383-0041	train-other-500	On the other side of the ridge the roof sloped down to meet a gable from where the gable s roof took another descent so as to bring the eaves about seven feet nearer to the ground Aside from this there was no possible way of reaching terra firma
6687-119383-0042	train-other-500	Eighteen feet I don d know vedda I can stand dot or no
none	none	 I must try it however 
6687-119383-0043	train-other-500	or Hal Hartly vas a dead codfish sure Using extreme caution he slid from one ridge to the other and then from that to the eaves from where he was to drop
6687-119383-0044	train-other-500	Vel here s der blace vere I don d vas so much tickled But pizness vas pizness und a veller don d vas can rise in der vorld vidout dropping sometimes so here goes he muttered
6687-119383-0045	train-other-500	And clinging to the eaves for a second he let himself drop Down down he went with great velocity and finally struck upon something softer than mother earth from which he tumbled end over end to the ground
6687-119383-0046	train-other-500	The following instant a wild unearthly howl rent the night Och murther murther shrieked a man s voice I m kilt I m kilt
none	none	 Och Holy Vargin Mary save me It was the Irishman s voice It was upon him that Fritz had first alighted and he was probably badly jarred up for he continued to hop around and yell at the top of his voice To make matters worse the door of the house opened and Gregg and his followers came pouring out CHAPTER VI ON THE SCENT Fritz had been stunned a little even after tumbling off from the yelping Irishman still he had sense enough to struggle to his feet on seeing the smugglers rush from the building Shut oop he cried addressing Grogan The smugglers are upon us Draw your wippons if you have any and fire Dom tha wippons Grogan howled refusing to hear to reason Och holy Vargin 
6687-119384-0000	train-other-500	it s kilt sure I am ontirely Helloo what the devil is the matter here the captain shouted waving his lantern on high Who is it that s making all this noise Spies detectives suggested one of his companions
6687-119384-0001	train-other-500	Shoot em down Hurrah Death to the spy cried a third and then they made a rush forward and seized upon Pat despite his lively use of his bit o buckthorn on the defensive
none	none	 Perceiving that he was not seen Fritz crawled softly away to a safe distance and then paused to gaze back 
6687-119384-0002	train-other-500	The yelling had ceased in the vicinity of the house and the lantern light had disappeared from view leaving naught but blank darkness and the pouring rain which came down monotonously but heavily
6687-119384-0003	train-other-500	I ll bet a half dollar dot they ve choked der life oud off dot duke s son off a gun Fritz muttered creeping under the cover of a dense tree I vonder off I proke any of his pones ven I lit on him
6687-119384-0004	train-other-500	By shimminy he must haff a gonstitution like a mule or I d a smashed him all to sausage meat Evidently something was to pay for except the sound of the storm and the dashing of the ocean against the bluff all was quiet
6687-119384-0005	train-other-500	The smugglers had either killed Grogan on the spot or taken him back into the house with them And poor Hartly what had become of him That was the question which troubled Fritz far more than the fate of the lean man from Kilkenny
none	none	 He vas a gone up goose now anyhow und I don d suppose id vil do some great deal off good to vorry apoud him only I vish I could haff saved him he mused It was a wild night at the best 
6687-119384-0006	train-other-500	and Fritz heartily wished that he was back in Philadelphia sitting in the old pawnbroker shop beside his girl Rebecca Still he would not willingly have given up what he had learned in reference to the smugglers league for a good deal
6687-119384-0007	train-other-500	and he was resolved to hang to the matter attentively until he should be able to trip and trap the rogues and break up their existence as an organization
6687-119384-0008	train-other-500	Knowing of no other available shelter in the vicinity he resolved to linger under the tree until the smugglers should leave the building when he would once more take possession The night was well advanced however when he heard them leave in a body and start off down the lonely road
6687-119384-0009	train-other-500	On first thought he was tempted to follow them but a cold blast of wind from off the ocean warned him that he was wet to the skin and the best thing he could do would be to get under roof and dry off
6687-119384-0010	train-other-500	He accordingly went back into the deserted house and sat down in the lower hall Though not cowardly he had no desire to keep further company with the grinning skull of the late lamented Budge whoever he may have been
6687-119384-0011	train-other-500	Rolling up one end of the old carpet he converted it into a sort of pillow and lay down out of the draft Sleep soon came to his relief and he slept soundly until morning when he was awakened by the sun shining in his face
6687-119384-0012	train-other-500	through a rear hall window Rising he went out of doors to reconnoiter and consider what was best to do next It was a clear glorious morning after the storm the sun shone brightly
6687-119384-0013	train-other-500	and a soft salt breeze blew off from the ocean which was at once refreshing and invigorating But it was not this sort of refreshment that Fritz now yearned for He had had nothing to eat since the previous morning and was decidedly hungry and faint
none	none	 Dose fellers don d vas can live a good vays from here vot I saw last night he mused 
6687-119384-0014	train-other-500	but ten to one uff I ask em for somedings to eat dey bounce me oud He advanced to the northern edge of the bluff and took a look in that direction
none	none	 To his surprise he saw not more than a half mile away a little village nestling near the beach 
6687-119384-0015	train-other-500	This village for charity s sake we will call Millburg as that name will answer quite us well as any other There might have been a hundred buildings all told and it was evidently a fishing hamlet as a number of small boats and smacks were drawn up along the beach
6687-119384-0016	train-other-500	Just outside the breakers an ocean steamship of small size and trim build was anchored Upon her sides was painted in large letters the word Countess I don d know petter I go down there or not Fritz muttered gazing down upon the village
none	none	 I don d vas know neider vich job I better look to first 
6687-119384-0017	train-other-500	der smuggler pizness or der girl pizness For der latter I haff der bromise of five t ousand dollars for der former I like ash not get paid off mit a proken head
none	none	 Still I don d vant to leave dis blace ondil I trip und trap der game und turn id over to der law for dis is der whole game sure 
6687-119384-0018	train-other-500	After some deliberation he decided to go down to the village The people would not offer him any molestation probably unless he gave them cause to suspect him and he resolved to be constantly upon his guard
6687-119384-0019	train-other-500	Descending from the bluff he walked along the beach and finally entered the little burg It was rather a rough looking place built up of weather worn wooden shanties a few stores and a sort of tavern
6687-119384-0020	train-other-500	There were however two imposing residences on opposite sides of the only street which were built of stone and set down in large shaded lawns
6687-119384-0021	train-other-500	Passing up the street Fritz was the target for many curious glances of rough looking men who sat in their doorways but paying no attention to them he entered the tavern and purchased his breakfast to which he was able to do full justice
6687-119384-0022	train-other-500	Afterward he came out in the bar room and sat down A half a dozen rough looking fellows were lounging about who to judge from their looks were in the habit of ingulfing more grog than was good for them
none	none	 Then the landlord who kept a close watch over them was the fattest specimen of manhood Fritz had seen his girth was something enormous 
6687-119384-0023	train-other-500	He was not a villainous looking man like the rest and this fact impressed Fritz more favorably than anything else he saw about the premises
6687-119384-0024	train-other-500	During the forenoon a well dressed fine looking man with iron gray hair and mustache galloped up to the tavern on horseback He looked as if he had been reared in luxury
none	none	 for there was that haughtiness of mien that betokened the arrogant aristocrat 
6687-119384-0025	train-other-500	Good morning John he said as the tavern keeper waddled to the door Will you send up a basket of champagne during the day and a barrel of good ale the champy for her ladyship the countess you know and the ale for the villagers
6687-119384-0026	train-other-500	Going to have a sort of a jollification at the lawn to night you know in honor of the arrival of the countess and want you all to turn out Then he galloped on quite as airily as he had come Who vas dot big feelin rooster
6687-119384-0027	train-other-500	Fritz asked when John re entered the tavern That Why that s Honorable Granby Greyville the fat man replied the rich haristocrat who owns most of the land hereabouts A right big feeling man too as you say
none	none	 Granby Greyville eh 
6687-119384-0028	train-other-500	Fritz commented under his breath Vel dot ish funny I thought sure dot was Captain Gregg der smuggler und I don d vas so much foolished apoud it yet
none	none	 I ll pet a half dollar I find oud somedings pefore I leave der blace 
6687-119384-0029	train-other-500	Resolved to remain a few days in the village for the purpose of prospecting Fritz made himself at home about the hotel One suspicion after another was gradually occurring to him and he was not slow to give them a thorough consideration prior to putting them to test
6687-119384-0030	train-other-500	Of all things he was desirous of attending the jollification as the horseman had termed it with a view of seeing the countess who he learned had lately arrived from England in her own steamship for a few weeks stay upon the Atlantic coast and a visit to her prospective husband Greyville
6687-119384-0031	train-other-500	During the afternoon a man entered the tavern who evidently had blood in his eye His whole appearance seemed to indicate that he was anxious to have a fight with some one and was not particular who it was
6687-119384-0032	train-other-500	He was a large raw boned fellow with great muscular development his face was large with a bristling stubble of black beard upon the lower portion his eyes were dark and wild
none	none	 his hair silvered with broad streaks of white and worn in a shaggy unkempt mass 
6687-119384-0033	train-other-500	His mouth was large and his teeth projected beyond his lips in a horrible manner His attire too was ragged and greasy with clumsy stogy boots upon his feet and a dilapidated hat upon his head
6687-119384-0034	train-other-500	On entering the room he paused and glared around him as if in search of some one on whom to vent his wrath Well Bully Jake what ll ye have the tavern keeper demanded with a frown for the ruffian was evidently an unwelcome intruder
6687-119384-0035	train-other-500	Waal I don t keer ef I do take a drap o likker the man growled glaring around You to blazes I mean what d ye want here Fat John grunted A fureigner a fureigner

6687-119384-0037	train-other-500	Then with a tragic stride he made for Fritz pausing but a few paces away from him and shaking his fist fairly in his face You look the ruffian cried
none	none	 D ye know who I am 
6687-119384-0038	train-other-500	Vel I dinks I don d vas haff made your acquaintance Fritz replied retaining his seat but on guard for an attack if one was made Ho ho I reckon not an ye ll wish ye never had afore I git through with yer Bully Jake declared

roared the bully and sprung savagely upon the young detective as if bent on his certain destruction Fritz clinched with him It was to be a struggle of brute strength now CHAPTER VII THE STRUGGLE Both were strong active men Fritz in particular being well supplied with all the necessary muscle and agility of the prize fighter although he by no means looked as if he was an ugly customer to handle After clinching the two men soon tripped and fell to the floor where the struggle literally began in all its meaning Oh I ll show ye how ther howlin porpoise fights Bully Jake roared endeavoring to get a bite at Fritz s nose I ll chaw ye all up like a dish o hash Vil you dough Fritz cried finally getting his hands free and clinching them around the bully s throat tightly I ll pet yoost a half dollar you von t do noddings off der kind and now getting the ruffian under him he gradually shut off his wind Hold on hold on no chokin no chokin I say it s ag in ther moral rules o fightin I don d

your humble parding den I let you up But I won t Den I vil squeeze your windpipe so I ask your pardon Oh yes I do Thar now let me up Fritz obeyed and let the ruffian rise from the floor but just as

you yoost apout a half dollar on dot I vil Fritz cried drawing and cocking his revolver Now you coome on uff you vant to get der whole dop off your head plowed off I can do der job vid greatest of

grimace as he stalked toward the door I ll allow ye hold ther grip now but thet ain t sayin ye ll allus hold it Then he took his leave Fritz was not sorry He did not want to hurt any one unless forced to and yet was bound to defend himself Toward evening the loungers one by one quitted the tavern until Fritz and Fat John were the only ones in the bar room Then it was that the latter spoke I say young feller he said you re a hextrordinary chap and if it wouldn t be haskin too much I d like to inquire what brings you here Vel pizness I dinks Fritz replied und judgin py der latest demonstrations I vil haff lots off id You had better look out sharp for Number One I tell you for though this ain t counted no hard town they ginerally pitch onto a stranger and try to bulldoze him into leavin by settin Bully Jake onto him I vas tumbled to dot already Fritz replied but der virst one vot attempted it didn t make so much success No but that ain t saying you ll have as big luck next time You see his honor mister Greyville owns most of the property hereabouts an he s as big feeling as a duke and won t allow no one around cept what bows to his will Vel ve vil see apoud dot Fritz muttered I dinks dey don d vas make mooch bulldozing me I vant to ask you von question don d this man Greyville be Captain Gregg der smuggler The fat host of the Lion s Paw gave a start The question was evidently something of a surprise to him Why no of course not What ever put such an idea into your head young man Gregg the smuggler is said to be one of the worst characters along the Atlantic coast and at the same time the most successful in his line of business Greyville is a man who would scorn to stoop to such work and moreover he is said to be immensely rich in ready cash though his landed property is mortgaged for its full value Fritz accepted this explanation without reply but his mind was but little changed in the matter I dinks Gregg und Greyville vas one und der same parties he muttered und shall not giff up dot opinion until I can haff furder proof von vay or der odder As soon as the gloaming of evening began to settle over the quiet little hamlet he left the tavern and sauntered down the street toward the Honorable Granby Greyville s residence whither most of the villagers had already wended their way On arriving at the front of the handsome lawn with its winding walks large shade trees beds of flowers and attractive residence Fritz paused to survey the scene that was spread out before him Here and there dotted about among the shade trees were tables spread with tempting viands to which the villagers were freely helping themselves and to the flowing pitchers of ale that were passed around by several of the village maidens A couple of Italians were making music upon violin and harp which sounded weird and enchanting children were playing and romping about the grounds Chinese lanterns were strung about among the lower branches of the trees and altogether it was a festive and attractive scene From his position outside the fence Fritz could see nothing of either Greyville or the alleged countess and he resolved to enter the grounds for that purpose which he accordingly did and sauntered about leisurely as if he had a perfect right there by invitation Although many curious glances were leveled at him he paid no attention to them and after walking around awhile he leaned up against a tree and looked on studying every face within the reach of his gaze Presently there was a shout among the assembled villagers and upon this the door of the mansion opened and mister Greyville came forth upon the grounds with the countess leaning upon his arm His honor was attired in a suit of immaculate white duck with a massive gold chain strung across his vest and a superb diamond pin upon his shirt front The countess was a Frenchwoman of some three and thirty years with a thin angular face bead like black eyes and hair to match and a thin compressed mouth which when she laughed showed two rows of pearly teeth She also wore an abundance of paint and powder upon her face and what with her rich attire of silk lace and diamonds was a striking and peculiar looking personage a woman who looked crafty and capable of mischief As soon as she and the Honorable Greyville advanced upon the lawn the villagers arose from the tables and the women courtesied low while the men swung their hats and sent up a rousing cheer The countess and her escort then moved about here and there with a pleasant word for all and a bidding for them to continue their feast As they passed near where Fritz stood leaning against the tree Greyville gave him a sharp stern glance and said Ah who are you and what do you want here sir Nothing in particular Fritz replied returning his stare calmly I only see vot you vas haff a pic nig und I come in to look on Then begone sir at once I allow no loafers around here Go I say and then they passed on Fritz did not go however but retained his position in defiance Shorge Vashingdon made dis a free coundry und I von d go dil I gits ready he muttered It was not long however before he was hastily approached by a man and that man no less a person than the same flashily attired individual who had taken the young woman Madge away from the hotel at Atlantic City Hello get out of this you loafer he cried seizing Fritz by the shoulder roughly How many times do you have to be told to go The guv nor said go now if you don t light out I ll make your heels break your neck Vil you dough Fritz grinned wrenching loose and standing on the defensive Yoost you keep your hands off vrom me Griffith Gregg or I vil knock der whole top off your nose off What you vagabond you compare me with the smuggler s son I ll thump your skull for that piece of impudence And he was as good as his word for raising a stout cane he carried he brought it heavily down upon the young detective s head For a moment Fritz was nearly stunned but he quickly recovered and sprung at his assailant pluckily Oh you snoozer he cried I vil plack your eye mit plue for dot And he did deal the honorable s son two severe whacks between the eyes in rapid succession which had the effect to land him on his back on the ground Thump me on der head vil you Fritz cried standing over him ready to give him another rap if he attempted to rise I ll pet you a half dollar you vil got left on dot Let me up you dastardly loafer young Greyville raved not daring to rise under the existing circumstances I ll murder you for this I I ll Got your head proke off you come mit your foolishness around me Fritz cried I ll let you oop dough ash I must go He saw a half a dozen of the village roughs coming toward the spot and knew he was ill prepared to battle with all of them So with a few dextrous bounds he leaped away out of the yard and ran swiftly down to the beach Finding that they did not follow him he soon after made his way up the street again to the tavern and went to the room which had been assigned him I ll pet der vil pe some droubles before I got t rough mit dis pizness he muttered but I vas der man who vil come oud der winner He was soon off in a sound sleep from which he hours later awakened with a violent start The scene was changed He was not in the tavern on the bed but instead was bound hand and foot and lying in the bottom of a boat CHAPTER VIII ADRIFT At first Fritz had no idea of what could have happened 
6687-119386-0000	train-other-500	but it did not take him long to come to one conclusion on the matter that he had been captured at night thrust into the frail boat and sent adrift on the ocean Who had been the authors of the job There could be no doubt in his mind about that
6687-119386-0001	train-other-500	The Greyvilles or the Greggs as he believed they were were anxious to have him leave the neighborhood and had probably through their agents caused his removal in this very promiscuous manner
6687-119386-0002	train-other-500	By an effort he sat up in the little boat and gazed around him He was now some distance from the beach beyond the white capped breakers
6687-119386-0003	train-other-500	and as the tide was receding the frail craft was of course drifting farther and farther from land each moment a reflection that might have caused any one a start while to Fritz bound and helpless it was the next thing to being alarming
none	none	 Vel py shimminy dunder 
6687-119386-0004	train-other-500	was his exclamation as he gazed dolefully around him Off I don d vas in a duyfel off a fix den I don d vant a cent They ve come von cute game ofer me und I ll bet a half dollar I go down der same throat vot Jonah did der w ale s
6687-119386-0005	train-other-500	Vonder vich von off dem vellers put up der shob on me I d like to punch his nose
none	none	 Reckon id vas dot veller whose eyes I placked mit Jersey plue up at der pig nic 
6687-119386-0006	train-other-500	I vonder vot der plazes a veller can do anyhow There was a sorry prospect for his being able to do anything much toward helping himself from the unenviable situation in which he had been placed He was unable to use his hands or feet
6687-119386-0007	train-other-500	and was therefore helpless and at the mercy of the wild waters over which he was drifting
none	none	 Did he have the use of hands and feet he was not yet out of danger 
6687-119386-0008	train-other-500	for the boat was without oars and the distance to the land was so great as to make it a daring attempt to breast the outgoing tide in a struggle to reach the shore by swimming
none	none	 Still it seemed the only hope for him if by any way he could free himself of the straps which bound him 
6687-119386-0009	train-other-500	and he was not the one to despair without first proving to his satisfaction that it was the only thing left for him to do Therefore he set to work industriously in an attempt to loosen the bonds from his hands
6687-119386-0010	train-other-500	Luckily they were not bound behind his back which was one advantage as he could use his teeth upon them But being leather straps he made slow headway nibbling at the strap around his hand but little by little it yielded
6687-119386-0011	train-other-500	so that after awhile a violent wrench broke it asunder and his hands were free Py shimminy dot ish goot anyhow he muttered making haste to unloosen his feet Now der next t ings is somedings else
6687-119386-0012	train-other-500	How ish I going to got pack mit der shore It was an all important question The boat was perhaps a mile farther from shore than when he first had estimated the distance I don d know vedder I can swum dot furder or not he muttered doubtfully
6687-119386-0013	train-other-500	But subbosin der whale or der duyfel fish
none	none	 catch old mit mine pootleg und suck me in under der vater Vot a duyfel o a fix I d be in den Off I only had some paddles I vould haff no droubles getting to shore vid der poat 
6687-119386-0014	train-other-500	He was in the midst of these reflections when he heard a shout farther out at sea and for the first time beheld dimly a dusky object floating in the water not far ahead of him Hello
none	none	 who you vas und vot you vant Fritz shouted in answer 
6687-119386-0015	train-other-500	I am a poor devil more or less drowned and can t hang on to this barrel much longer Be you man or devil for Heaven s sake hurry along with your boat
none	none	 All righd 
6687-119386-0016	train-other-500	I vil pe dere in der sweedness py und py Keep a stiff upper lip und I ll got you soon the young detective replied heartily Dere s nodding like hang on at der critical minute
6687-119386-0017	train-other-500	Kneeling and leaning over the front part of the boat he used his hands as propellers and in this way was able to improve the slow progress of his light craft to some extent and in a few moments was alongside the barrel
6687-119386-0018	train-other-500	on top of which a drenched human was balancing himself At a glance Fritz perceived who it was Hartly he exclaimed in surprise Yes what s left of me the sentenced smuggler replied clambering into the boat
6687-119386-0019	train-other-500	Thank Heaven you came along just as you did for my gripe wouldn t hold out much longer Vel I should dink not I d giffen you up ash dead
none	none	 How ish it dot you don d vas kilt by der smugglers It is no fault of theirs 
6687-119386-0020	train-other-500	Hartly replied grimly They chucked me under night afore last miles out at sea supposing my hands and feet were bound and a heavy stone tied to my head
6687-119386-0021	train-other-500	But while they were rowing me out I contrived to loosen up matters so that I was really free the minute I struck water But I went under all the same to deceive them When they headed for shore I arose to the surface and after swimming about until nearly exhausted
6687-119386-0022	train-other-500	I caught onto this empty cask which has in one sense been my salvation
none	none	 By the tides I have been carried quite near to the shore but my lower limbs being numb by remaining so long in the water I dared not attempt to swim ashore 
6687-119386-0023	train-other-500	and the outgoing tide has carried me out again not so far as it would however if I had not struggled shoreward constantly
none	none	 But how come you out here in this frail shell without even oars 
6687-119386-0024	train-other-500	Fritz explained as far as he had known and Hartly scowled There ll be a reckoning for some one he said if I ever succeed in getting ashore But there s not much prospect of that unless we can get some oars or something to pull ashore with
6687-119386-0025	train-other-500	The tide will begin to ebb in before a great while too I haff von idea Fritz said Uff ve can got der parrel apart we might do somedings vid der staves
none	none	 vot you t ink apoud dot 
6687-119386-0026	train-other-500	Good idea We can easily get the staves
none	none	 Hartly drew the barrel up alongside the boat and soon had it knocked to pieces and four of the staves secured 
6687-119386-0027	train-other-500	Now then for shore he cried When we get there I will leave you on business for a few hours after which I will join you and we will work together against the Gregg gang We will paddle to land on the lower side of the bluff
6687-119386-0028	train-other-500	as it wouldn t be particularly healthy for me to land in front of the village You can and in fact had better keep shady in the vicinity of the old rookery on the bluff and I will join you as soon as possible
6687-119386-0029	train-other-500	Accordingly they paddled as rapidly toward the beach as their strength would permit By the time it was daybreak they had landed below the bluff Here they drew the light boat up on the beach and Hartly said I ll leave you now but will return in the course of a few hours
none	none	 All righd I vil remain in der neighborhood 
6687-119386-0030	train-other-500	Fritz replied and then the young smuggler clambered up the side of the bluff and was soon gone from view I vonder vot dot veller ish oop to now
none	none	 Fritz muttered after he had gone 
6687-119386-0031	train-other-500	Der is somet ing he vas goin to do
none	none	 vot he ain d purticular apoud my knowing somedings apoud 
6687-119386-0032	train-other-500	I have haff a notion dot he ain d vos so nice a veller vot I firsd t ought und I vouldn t pe much surprised if he vould give me avay off he got a chance
none	none	 But oh I ll keep watch of him I ve got der smugglers und der kidnapper spotted und I ll bet a half dollar id don d vas be some centuries till I get em trapped 
6687-119386-0033	train-other-500	In der meantime der is somet ing I vant to investigate This was something he had noticed as he and Hartly had paddled in to the shore from the ocean
6687-119386-0034	train-other-500	In about the center of the bluff at the water s edge as it faced the open Atlantic was a dark hole of considerable size which looked as if it might lead to a cavern in the hill If Hartly knew of its existence he had kept it a secret
6687-119386-0035	train-other-500	but our German detective had noticed it and resolved to see where the aperture led to Under any other circumstances he would not have given it a second thought
6687-119386-0036	train-other-500	but the fact that the smugglers held out in this vicinity of which he now had no doubt gave that hole in the bluff more than ordinary significance Jumping into the boat he paddled off once more into the water and headed toward the front of the bluff
6687-119386-0037	train-other-500	Not knowing what danger he might unexpectedly run into he had drawn his revolver which strangely enough his captors had not taken from him and placed it on the stern seat beside him Working silently but steadily along the face of the bluff
6687-119386-0038	train-other-500	which was quite perpendicular he soon came before the aperture and headed his boat into it
none	none	 mister or as he styled himself Honorable Granby Greyville 
6687-119386-0039	train-other-500	sat in his private study this same morning engaged in smoking a cigar as he rocked in an easy chair and gazed out through an open glass door upon the pretty lawn That his thoughts were of an unpleasant nature was evident by a frown which disfigured his florid countenance
6687-119386-0040	train-other-500	And this frown did not lessen but rather increased as there suddenly appeared in the doorway no less a wild looking personage than Silly Sue whom Fritz had encountered upon the beach
none	none	 She made a grimace and sort of a jerky bow as she saw his honor and then stood staring at him in a strange manner 
6687-119386-0041	train-other-500	Well he growled angrily what brings you here
none	none	 What allus brings me she replied with a chuckle 
6687-119386-0042	train-other-500	I want to come back and play up high cockolorum like my big feelin sister S pose that s silly too ain t it daddy
none	none	 No more so than your accursed obstinacy you fool was the severe reply You well know the only terms that can ever restore you as a member of my family 
6687-119386-0043	train-other-500	But I won t accept em Then clear out
none	none	 You shall never be anything to me till you surrender the stolen money 
6687-119386-0044	train-other-500	Bah it ain t yours You re a bad wicked man and you got it wickedly and get all your wealth wickedly and the more you get the wickeder you get Get out I d cut my head off silly s I am before I d give you up the money
6687-119386-0045	train-other-500	Curses on your mulishness Ha ha I know you cherish the most fatherly regard for me
none	none	 If it wasn t for the hope that I will some day restore you your lost ten thousand you d had me drowned months ago 
6687-119386-0046	train-other-500	By the way old man what have you done with my feller Your fellow Yes Hal Hartly How should I know anything about him
none	none	 Who should know better 
6687-119386-0047	train-other-500	Oh you wicked monster Take care girl No I won t take care and her eyes flashed in defiance of his anger
none	none	 I ain t a bit afraid of you 
6687-119386-0048	train-other-500	because I can outrun any dog in the town
none	none	 I know what s become of Hal 
6687-119386-0049	train-other-500	Your tools took him out and chucked him under But ha ha he s all right Greyville started a little What foolishness is this of yours
none	none	 Oh only silliness of course and she laughed loudly 
6687-119386-0050	train-other-500	But Hal s all right and now that his scruples have had a pickle I allow he ll come around to my cherished plan and we ll make it warm for you What you dare to threaten me Didn t I tell you I d go for you if you didn t reform
6687-119386-0051	train-other-500	Well I must be off How s my stately sister How s the countess Ha ha ha shoot her She s an old hag with a glass eye and false teeth The future missus G

6687-119386-0052	train-other-500	Still it serves its purpose I m off now just come up to spice your breakfast Better mend your ways The way of the transgressor is hard By by Yours truly Silly Sue
none	none	 And then with a wild laugh she vanished CHAPTER IX FRITZ S DISCOVERY Let us return to our ventriloquist detective and his venturesome expedition In heading the boat into the opening in the bluff he had no idea how his venture would terminate but was urged on by a great curiosity to explore the spot feeling sure that it had some connection with the smugglers league The height of the aperture was insufficient to admit the passage of the boat with him sitting up so putting the boat under headway he lay down and thus glided in In high tide this opening he concluded was covered by water while in extreme low water the beach must be bare in front of the bluff as the water at this juncture now was quite shallow He almost immediately emerged into a cave in the heart of the bluff It was as large as a couple of good sized rooms and looked as if the waters of many years had eaten it out The work of man however was seen in the planks overhead which resting on wooden supports held the roof in place The water reached about midway into the chamber and from its edge the pebbly ground ascended to the farther side of the cave where a narrow aperture branched off evidently cut as a passageway by the hand of man Grounding his boat Fritz stepped out and took a survey of his surroundings Dis don d look ash if id vas a healthy blace at high tide but I reckon dot id vas der blace vere dey run in smuggled goods he mused Dot passage probably leads to a higher und dryer place Holding his revolver ready for use in case of emergency he stole softly toward the subterranean passage with a view to exploring it It was a dark uninviting tunnel of just sufficient width and height to admit of a person s passage and looked as if it might have no connection with any other chamber as he could see no light to indicate its terminus Nothing daunted however he entered it and walked along softly ready for any surprise A score of steps he went and then emerged into what he concluded was another large subterranean chamber but where all was of Stygian darkness Luckily he had a close metal pocket box of matches with him and lighting one after another he discovered a half dozen lamps in brackets around the chamber side One of them he soon lit when he proceeded to inspect his situation As before stated the sides of the cavern were walled up like a cellar and in size it was a hundred and fifty feet square by ten or twelve in height The ceiling overhead was planked and these supported by rude pillars resting upon the ground floor as in the outer cave Here and there scattered about were heaps of straw pieces of wooden boxes and canvas and occasionally a bottle or a piece of damaged silk or lace At the opposite side of this chamber was a round hole in the ceiling similar to a well down through which hung a rope ladder to the floor This seemed to indicate that either there was another chamber overhead or else this was a means of access to the open air In the stone wall at either side of the room were doorways supplied with strong grated iron doors which were fastened with padlocks and chains Vel I be jiggered off dis don d vas yoost like a regular brizon Fritz ejaculated und dis pe der blace vere der smugglers unpack deir goods I t ought I vould discoffer somet ings off I come here Vonder uff dey haff got somepody shut up mit dem cells Dot vouldn t pe so much off a sell neider off I am any shudge Taking down the lamp he proceeded to inspect the matter Approaching the right hand dungeon he peered in The place evidently was empty Crossing the cavern to the door of the other to his surprise he saw that this dungeon was occupied Upon a rude cot bed a woman was stretched apparently fast asleep As her face was turned from his view he could not tell whether she was young or old pretty or ugly but he was strangely impressed Her size form clothing all aroused his suspicions that it really was the Leadville man s runaway daughter Madge Thornton or Thurston as she had called herself He was staggered a moment by the very thought Hello vake oop who you vas he shouted rattling the door The woman gave a violent start and sat up on her cot with a gasp it was indeed the speculator s lost daughter Goot dot vas a nest egg for me was the thought that flashed through his mind as he remembered the offered reward Who are you what do you want the bride of Major Atkins demanded eagerly as she arose from her bed and stepped falteringly toward the door Vel I am Fritz You remember der chap Fritz don d you Oh yes yes You are a friend to me oh say that you are and that you have come to rescue me and take me back to papa Vel I should snicker dot dot vas apoud der size off der circumstance the young detective grinned You don d vas like dis hotel

expression or you vil haff mine gal Rebecca in your vool She s shealous is Rebecca und id makes her madder ash a hornet bee uff I even looks sweed at a potato pug dot ish a fact But I vil get you oud all der same if I can vich I don d know so much apoud ash der door vas fastened tighter ash a brick You see your old dad he vas send me down dis vay to look vor you und I dells him I find you yoost like a pook I vas a reg lar snoozer at findin dings vot don d pelong to me My father sent you Oh joyful news Tell me tell me where is my father and she clasped her hands her face and eyes aglow with eagerness There was evidently nothing dazed or somnambulistic about her now Vel der last I see d your old man he vas at der blace vere you got married But he left for Long Branch to rustygate und keep a vedder eye out for you vile I took der rear trail und skeer d up der game You see der old man dells me off I vind you und der money vot you stole vrom him he vould giff me five t ousand dollars How vas dot He vas yoost der man I haff pen vantin to meed vor a long vile But how apoud der money It is where no earthly hands but mine can find it except I give the directions the girl replied with evident enthusiasm over the fact When I left home to come East and marry Major Atkins I was in a state of half insanity or somnambulism they called it and took the money and when I came to my senses found it in my possession It seems as I have learned since that before his leaving for the East and at the same time when I was in my dazed state Atkins said that he had a large roll of money in my father s safe and that when I came I should bring it And to my surprise I have also since learned that it was not the first somnambulistic theft I have been guilty of Upon discovering the large sum upon my person I put it in a place where it would be safe and came on to marry Major Atkins whom I imagined myself to be in love with We met it was he who took me away from the hotel and we were married as I supposed at the time but it has since been proved a base deception Almost immediately after your departure he demanded the money of me Vel you guff it oop to him I subbose No I did not she replied with an exhibition of spirit I told him I didn t have it which was true but he wouldn t believe that saying that he had learned I had the money in my possession on leaving home Then I got angry and told him I wouldn t give it to him if I did have it This in turn enraged him and he declared the marriage to be a sham and that if I didn t surrender the money he would kill me I defied him and dared him to do it whereupon he and the bogus minister seized upon me and searched me but failed to find the money The monster Atkins then knocked me down and I became insensible When I awoke it was in this terrible underground place He has been here several times and threatened me and alternated the matter by promising to make me his wife in reality and the mistress of a princely home if I would give up the money But having found out what a villain he is I have firmly refused Dot vas right Ve will giff him der duyfel von off dese days or at least I vil for smuggling I don d know vedder I can got you oud off here or not I ought der haff some tools as id don d vas some leedle shob preakin iron mit a veller s hands Oh do try and release me in some way I do so want to get free Und I know dot But you see id vas harder ash breakin der consditution to preak dis chain It was no easy job indeed The chain was several feet in length and made of short stout welded links The padlock too was a formidable affair such as could not easily be broken and Fritz did not have any keys with him He was stuck for once in not knowing how to proceed and was just cogitating over what was best to do when he noticed something that caused him to start On glancing toward the rope ladder he perceived that it was moving Some one was descending it Did he remain here discovery was inevitable and discovery would probably destroy all possibility of rescuing Madge These thoughts occurred to him like a flash Sh some one is coming and I must hide he said to Madge in a whisper then he hurried softly across the chamber into the dark passage where he paused at a point where he could see without being seen I ll bet dot id vas der veller whose eye I blacked he muttered And sure enough he was right A moment later Major Atkins alias young Greyville alias Griffith Gregg came down the ladder into the cavern his eyes yet showing unmistakable evidence of the power of Fritz s shoulder hits What the devil s all the noise down here he demanded approaching the door of Madge s dungeon I thought I heard voices conversing You probably heard me singing Sir Monster Madge retorted sarcastically You know I am in good humor for vocalism The devil take you It wasn t singing it was talking I heard Ah perhaps you heard me saying over threats of what I ll do when I get free Now what will you do I ll claw your eyes out then I ll tie you and give you a thrashing with a bull whip Bah threaten what you like I ll guarantee you ll remain here until I get your amiable dad s swag But you will never get it Won t I When you begin to rot in your dungeon and your tongue hangs out of your mouth for want of food and water I fancy you ll come to terms But I won t though Oh we shall see I won t argue with you At the present moment I want to find out who it was I heard you conversing with And to her horror he made for the dark passage Fritz too was considerably concerned and began to make a rapid and stealthy retreat to the other chamber On arriving there another thing startled him The tide had set in and the hole in the face of the bluff was so nearly filled as to make escape with the boat impossible CHAPTER X A DIVE FOR LIFE There was but one choice left for Fritz that of standing his ground and meeting young Greyville boldly for there was apparently no avenue of escape for him now Consequently with his revolver drawn ready for use he positioned himself at the water s edge facing the aperture and waited He had not long to wait In a few seconds Griffith Gregg as we shall henceforth call him came striding into the chamber and uttered a violent oath at sight of Fritz Hello by the Satanic I thought I was not mistaken The Dutchman we left adrift for sure Fritz did not speak or allow himself to move a particle but stood glaring at his enemy like one turned to stone Hello why the devil don t you answer Gregg demanded apparently not feeling positive that Fritz was in the flesh If you don t answer I m hanged if I don t drown ye No answer from Fritz But from directly over the villain s head seemed to come the words in a hoarse voice Villain behold the reflection of your crime Bah Gregg cried with a start glaring about him You can t play any tricks on me you Dutch blunderbuss In some way you ve escaped the trap and now I ll pay you a grudge I ve got against you And with a long knife in hand which he had drawn from his belt he dashed fiercely at Fritz regardless of the drawn revolver Leveling his pistol at his opponent s breast the young detective pulled the trigger The weapon missed fire Gregg was almost upon him now There was but a moment to act and yet in that time Fritz hurled the weapon with great velocity at the villain s head and somersaulted backward into the water the toe of one of his boots catching Gregg in under the lower jaw This with the stinging blow of the pistol dropped him like a log to the ground where he lay for an instant howling with pain and rage Fritz landing in the water swam through the almost submerged entrance and soon was outside the cavern at the edge of the bluff To swim around to the southern side was the work of but a few moments and he was once more on terra firma at his starting point Here he sat down upon the beach to collect his thoughts So strange had been his experience within the last few hours that he was really more confused than he had yet been since entering upon his profession as a detective Now den let me see apoud somet ings he muttered In der virst blace dis be a reg lar ruffian seddlement vere id don d vas healthy vor such ash I und id would puzzle me to do der shob all alone I must haff some help Off der ish a delegraph office near here den I must find id und delegraph to Philadelf vor assistance Der ish no doubt but I haff discovered der smugglers und der next t ing is to cabture dem Und I don d dink id vas healthy for me to go down mit der cave again undil dis matter keeps shady I vonder vot haff pecome off der gal vot called herself Silly Sue Here she is what do you want of her a merry voice cried and the elfin danced laughing out from behind a huge bowlder at Fritz s rear where she had been concealed evidently playing the spy What do you want of Silly Sue Irishman I vas no Irishman Fritz retorted I am a Dutchman Get out You re pure Irish But that ain t the point What do you want of me I vanted to inquire how far it ish to der nearest delegraph station Oh a good ways inland The road you see in front of the old house on the bluff leads direct to it If you want to send a message I ll send it for you You vil Yes I ll hook one o dad s horses from the pasture and ride to town Guess I know what ye propose doing Vot You are a detective and you have discovered that my dad and his smugglers live around here and you want to send for help to arrest them How vos you know all dot Oh I m silly enough to guess it and I hope you ll do it They re a hard gang and a wicked gang and they hate me worse than poison because I m honest unlike the rest of them Captain Gregg und Honorable Granby Greyville are der same persons not Yes You re mighty cute to find that out when some o the villagers don t even suspect it I m his gal Ish dot a fact Yes but he don t own me because I denounce his dishonesty Ha ha an old man was found dead on the beach once The next day my papa had a big sum of money in his possession I smelled foul play I stole the money from him and burned it up Ha ha Then he whipped me unmercifully and turned me adrift But pooh I don t care I get along famous and I ll make fun for the smugglers yet So if you want me to go to the telegraph station for you and will give me a few shillings I m ready I ll giff you five dollars Fritz assured Bully the girl assented Now just tell me what you want and I m yours Vel I vant you to go to der delegraph office und send a message to Tony Fox care of Police Headquarters Philadelphia telling him to fetch a half dozen men der dis village at once Can you remember dot Well you bet I can I don t forget things easily Give us your money and I m off for a wild horseback ride Fritz accordingly gave her a V note and then after again instructing her what to do she took her departure by clambering up the bluff Fritz then lay down upon the sand in the warm sunlight little dreaming that his plans had been overheard The Irishman Pat Grogan had been concealed behind another bowlder and had over heard every word of Fritz s conversation with Silly Sue Shortly after her departure and when sure Fritz was not watching he stole softly from his place of concealment and up the side of the bluff Once on top of the bluff he quickened his pace descended the opposite side and hurried toward the village At the residence of Granville Greyville he paused and entered the spacious lawn His honor and the countess were seated upon the lawn in front of the house enjoying the shade of a great tree and Grogan tipped his hat as he approached them Sure sur it s mesilf as has made a discovery sur he said with a huge grin of satisfaction Ah indeed I thought you might be of some use his honor replied complacently What is the nature of your discovery Grogan Sure sur it s consarnin the girl you set me to watchin As I expected curse her What new devilment has she been up to Sure I did kape a civil eye on her as yez told me to and a bit ago she met a Dutchman on the beach an it s a grand plot tha be afther organizin The loikes av the Dutchman he ha wanted to ba sindin a tiligraph missage to Philadelphia for tha detectives an tha gal she did till him for a V she would stale a horse forninst your pasture an be carryin the missage for him hersilf whereat he forked over the cash and she skipped bedad His honor listened his face growing purple with passion May all the furies seize that obstinate and meddlesome little wretch he hissed She seems determined to ruin me No amount of whippings have ever served to make her like other girls Why didn t you stop her Pat Sure it was yersilf as told me to be doin naught else but watchin her True I had forgotten She has probably gone so far that it would be next to useless to attempt to overhaul her now Do you think you could mount a horse and overtake her Pat Bedad no It s sorry a horse I can ride yer honor Then ascertain from the ostler the location of the pasture and when she returns capture her I ll give you ten dollars for the job Bad cess to me if I don t do it An what shall I be doin to her after I cotch er Then take her to the old mansion on the bluff and wait until I come Och howly murther I ll not go in where the skelegon is nary a time Nor need you What time intervenes between your arrival and mine you can spend outside But look sharp she don t escape you Sure it s mesilf as will ba doin that same Then Grogan executed a grotesque bow and took his departure toward the stable while Greyville turned toward the countess The devil will be to pay now As I suspected that Dutchman is a spy and having suspicioned or ferreted out some knowledge concerning the league has sent for his fellow watch dogs In less than two days we shall be in the clutches of the law unless we make a break for liberty at once Oh there is no particular reason for hurry When we find there is danger we can easily escape the countess said calmly How If we wait until their arrival it will be too late By no means My steamboat lies out but a short distance and we can board it and sail for la belle France in defiance What without unloading Bah what are a few thousand dollars to life Besides the goods will sell again for full value at Havre CHAPTER XI A FATHER S BRUTALITY After the departure of Silly Sue Fritz sunned himself until his garments were dried then rising he began to cast about him for something to eat I don d know better I go back mit der tavern or not he mused I dinks dot vas an onhealthy blace und yet I vould like somedings to ead very bad Climbing to the top of the bluff he passed the old mansion and followed the country road for some distance in hopes of finding an orchard or watermelon patch And he was successful About a mile distant he came to a good sized orchard near no human habitation and hastily made a raid on it with the result of discovering all the luscious eating harvest apples he could carry Filling his pockets he made his way back to the old rookery and sat down upon the front step to finish his meal I vonder vot s pecome of der villain I kicked mit der under jaw he muttered I t ink I must haff dislocated im or I should a seed him I vonder vere der mouth off der well is anyhow vot dey come up t rough Id must pe somevere s vere der house stands und probably hidden After he finished his meal on apples he entered the old dwelling with a view to giving it another exploration Passing through the lower hall he tried each door opening off from it but found them all locked as before What they contained he could therefore not learn except by bursting them open or unlocking them which he had no way of doing Finding no success down stairs he went upstairs remembering that he had only tried the doors of part of the upper rooms on his previous visit the second one being the assembly chamber containing the swinging head of ill fated Bill Budge He shunned this apartment now and passed on along the corridor The first and second doors he tried were locked like those below The third door however was unfastened and opening it he entered a large unfurnished apartment containing but one window which looked out upon the ocean Noticing a card tacked upon the wall opposite the door Fritz advanced to read what was written upon it But that he was destined never to do Halfway across the room he got then the floor sunk quickly beneath him and he went down down down He had stepped upon a trap which had evidently been prepared for occasional stragglers and he was the unsuspecting victim until too late to save himself Down down he went into empty space until he struck heavily upon a hard floor and lay for a moment in a heap his senses partly leaving him When he recovered consciousness he arose to his feet He was in utter darkness and in a place where the air was close and stifling What kind of a den he had fallen into he could not ascertain by looking at least Later that day mister Granby Greyville left his handsome residence and made his way to the bluff accompanied by her ladyship the countess There was a terrible expression of stern resolve upon his countenance and in his grasp he carried an ugly looking cart whip which looked as if it were capable of inflicting dire pain in the hands of a human brute Arriving at the top of the bluff they found Grogan the Irish delegate seated upon the doorstep of the old house while lying upon the ground in front of him was the girl Sue bound hand and foot but none the less defiant for that fact as was evident by the contemptuous curl of her lip and the indignant wicked flash of her eyes A little shiver went over her though when she saw the countess the man she knew as her father and the whip he carried Sure it s mesilf as cotched her Grogan cried as Greyville approached But it s the devil s own time I had at it bedad an if yez don t b lave it ye kin look at me face Begorra she scratched an bit an fit loike tha very devil s imp she is and the Hibernian rubbed his torn and bruised visage dolefully So you re caged are you my young tigress the smuggler captain demanded gazing down at the girl wrathfully I ll see that you never break loose hereafter Ba aa the girl retorted in contempt I m not afraid of you you ruffianly wretch if you do carry a whip You can whip me pound me stamp me into the earth but you can t intimidate me I ll despise and defy you to the longest day I live We shall see I ve made up my mind to cease dealing mildly with you and instead treat you to the harshness your foolishness demands It s time you were broken in and I m going to compel you to submission to my will and to obedience or I m going to kill you Kill if you like I ll still defy you You can not make me obey a monster like you even though you are my father I despise you hate you you inhuman wretch A good flogging will bring back your affection By the way I understand that by way of amusing yourself you have become the consort of a Dutch detective and by way of furthering his game have just been to telegraph for an additional force of the devils Now do you know what I am going to do Any one might guess brutal cowards always carry whips Yes I m going to whip you within an inch of your life Then if you promise me to ever after obey me and tell me where to find the money you stole from me I will let you go If you refuse I ll kill you and end the trouble Grogan lash her securely to yonder post The Irishman obeyed by raising her and roping her to a post which had been used for a hitching post at some remote period Sue s face was very pale now and she trembled in dread of the cruel lash It was not the first time she had been whipped by him and she well knew what a merciless wretch he was Greyville threw off his coat now and seized the heavy whip firmly not a tithe of pity expressed in his stern cruel face Beg now he cried Tell me where the money is and promise future obedience and proper conduct or I ll give it to you Never I ll die first Sue gasped The next instant the wretch struck her with all his might following one blow with another until he had struck her twenty the last one being upon the top of the head with the butt of the whip White as death was Sue but her eyes flashed bravely her face was defiant but she never uttered a moan or cry of pain Now now maybe you ll come to time the smuggler roared more like some enraged wild beast than a human being in his demoniac fury Now will you tell and promise Never monster was the low piteous gasp then the eyes of the poor outcast closed she had fainted unable longer to endure the agony CHAPTER XII A PITIFUL END The situation of Fritz was to him a decidedly gloomy one as owing to the impenetrable darkness his eyesight was of no use whatever He did not know either if it was safe to stir as there might be another trap which he would fall into and go headlong down into some other pit But he resolved to test the matter and feel out the boundaries of his new prison at once Groping about inch by inch and trying the floor in front of him before trusting the weight of his body upon it he soon came to a plastered wall and concluded by that that he still remained in the building having probably only fallen to the first floor Vel dot don d vas so pad ash I first expected he muttered feeling a little more assured I t ought I vas goin vay down to der blace vere dey manufacture fire crackers Der next question ish der any outlet to dis brison I vonder Keeping his hands upon the wall he walked several times around the dark apartment without pausing Der ish not von door or vinder nor hole of any kind he finally muttered I would not haff such a house for a gift The room indeed appeared to be barren of those accessories as far as he was able to learn by the sense of feeling and it would seem that it was thus purposely prepared for a prison Vel I guess I might as vel prepare to imitate der example off Doctor Tanner und go vidout somedings to eat for forty years or so Fritz muttered feeling of his stomach dolefully for the apples had far from satisfied his appetite But if possible I must get oud off here somehow before Fox und der boys get here Just how he was to do it furnished him a serious subject to ponder on Curse the girl she s fainted the smuggler chief cried pausing in his horrible work Perhaps she is playing off to escape punishment the countess suggested with a malicious smile The American mademoiselle is very deceitful Faint or no faint she shall get all that her stubborn resistance demands Greyville growled mercilessly and he raised the whip and struck her another stinging blow Stop Strike that girl again and I ll kill you a voice cried not far in their rear and turning they beheld a stranger rushing up a pair of cocked revolvers in hand Furies Greyville gasped turning pale Mon Dieu what s to pay Let s fly from the countess No we will stand our ground the smuggler hissed The new comer soon stood before them with stern accusing gaze and a face flushed from his run Devils he cried what is the meaning of this brutal scene Explain instantly It was the Leadville speculator Thornton who spoke and there was grim business expressed in his tone What right have you to intrude in what is none of your business Greyville demanded sourly Eh I ll show you you brutal puppy Don t give me any of your lip or I ll blow your brains out Why cuss my boots you re as bad as the Dog Injuns on the frontier I presume I ve a right to chastise my own child sir when her conduct deserves it That s not your child Garry Gregg I know you You are the wretch I have been longing to meet these ten years You know me the smuggler cried in amazement Ay I know you the Westerner cried You are the worthless devil who trapped Minnie Gray into a secret marriage years ago and after living with her a couple of years and abusing her left her in poverty to live with a woman you had previously married And incurred your enmity by winning your sweetheart away from you Gregg sneered mockingly Be that as it may you are responsible for a good woman s death and you shall answer for it Tell me sir is this poor child you have been beating the daughter of Minnie Gray If you like yes Then curse you leave this spot at once if you don t want me to shoot you down I ll take care you never strike her again Go I say or I ll kill you without hesitation There was a stern glare in the speculator s eyes that betokened danger and accompanied by the countess and Grogan the smuggler chief hurried away As soon as they had gone mister Thornton cut the bonds that held Silly Sue to the post and laid her tenderly down upon the soft grass Hurrying down to the beach he procured some water in his hat and returning dashed it in her face But although he did this and chafed her hands and wrists she did not open her eyes Her breath came in stifled gasps and her heart beat slowly By Heaven I believe they have killed her mister Thornton muttered feelings of terrible rage swelling within him The equal of this brutality is seldom even among the red devils on the frontier Ah Garry Gregg if this poor child dies you shall pay bitterly for her life or my name is not Thornton He continued faithfully in his endeavors to bring her back to consciousness but all to no avail While he was thus engaged there came sounds of rapid footsteps and Hal Hartly dashed up flushed and excited Great Heaven what is the matter with Susie he demanded on seeing her lying on the ground so cold and white I fear she is dying young man mister Thornton replied solemnly I can not restore her to consciousness Was she anything to you sir Indeed yes she was all the world to me poor child and we were to be married one of these days Hartly replied kneeling beside her with tears in his eyes Susie oh Susie my little waif can t you look up and speak to me The girl slowly opened her eyes and gazed up at him with a loving smile Yes Hal I know I am dying Hal Where is Fritz I don t know darling I have not seen him since morning Well when you see him tell him I sent the message and got an answer that the detectives would come The detectives Yes I went for him to telegraph for them and he gave me five dollars It is in my pocket Hal you can have it to get me a little plain stone for my grave But Susie you can t be dying tell me what is the matter She has been cruelly beaten I came here a few moments ago and drove off the devils but I fear I came too late mister Thornton explained sadly It was papa you know Sue added as Hartly uttered a cry of astonishment He discovered the errand I had done and had a big Irishman capture me and bring me here Then he and the countess came and I was tied to a stake and whipped till I fainted They have killed me I guess I feel as if I am filling up inside and something tells me I shall soon die I hate to leave you Hal but I am not afraid to die I have always said my prayers loved the Lord and been honest and I know He will receive me The girl s childish faith and simplicity touched mister Thornton as well as young Hartly and tears flowed freely The little outcast soon closed her eyes again her arms about Hartly s neck as she rested in his embrace and a peaceful expression of contentment upon her face About sunset she spoke without opening her eyes Hal she said softly Yes Susie he replied what do you wish Not much After I am gone burn the old house yonder and break up the smugglers Yes Susie And you ll be a good man Hal all your life so you will join me in heaven I will try dearest Then kiss me good by Convulsed with sobs the grief stricken lover obeyed and just as the last rays of sunset began to fade Susie breathed her last expiring without the least appearance of pain and a faint peaceful smile upon her lips For some moments after her death neither Hartly nor mister Thornton spoke but finally the latter said She has gone where she will know no more suffering or sorrow and it is perhaps better so Is your home near by I live in a sort of hut back in the woods and if you will lend a hand we will take her there The speculator assented and Hartly procured a wide board and laid the limp form upon it Then raising the primitive litter between them they left the bluff and took to the lonely country road which they followed until they came to a rude shanty standing in the edge of the woods They bore their burden into the only room and deposited it upon a couple of stools Hartly then turned to mister Thornton You are a stranger to us sir he said but would you kindly remain here until I can go to a neighboring town and make arrangements for her burial Certainly my boy Then I will go and send the undertakers at once to take charge of the remains If I do not return with the undertakers let them remove the body and I will see you later perhaps He then kissed the lips and forehead of the dead girl and took his departure Once outside his whole demeanor underwent a change His face became stern and hard in its expression and his eyes gleamed with a wild light that could hardly have been pronounced sane First the house he muttered between his clinched teeth then I will see to the burial After that revenge words uttered with a power of feeling which bespoke grim resolution Hurrying back to the bluff he entered the building and from the pantry brought an oil can and poured oil about in a number of different places applying a lighted match to each As a result bright sheets of flame sprung up and in less time almost than it takes to tell it the interior of the old rookery was on fire in several places Then with a wild laugh he turned and fled from the building and disappeared from the vicinity of the bluff The old house was doomed And in the doorless windowless trap room where he had so unexpectedly become imprisoned was Fritz in the most unenviable situation one could well conceive Captain Gregg as we shall henceforth call him learned of Silly Sue s death shortly after it occurred through the Irishman who while pretending to leave the spot had scouted around and lurked in the vicinity until Hartly and mister Thornton had departed with the body Gregg was both alarmed and surprised when he heard the news and immediately sought the countess for consultation He had no idea he had done the girl any fatal bodily injury If she was dead and the cause of her death came to be known he well knew that he would be called upon to answer to the law The countess listened to his recital of Grogan s report the lines in her thin face growing even harder than were their wont I feared zis she said You were ver mooch savage What do you advise Zat we remain where we be for ze present You say zis stranger be an old enemy of yours Yes Doubly so now from a fact that he is the father of Grif s prisoner that s locked up in the dungeon Humph zis is bad Vare be ze Dutchman There is no telling Perhaps Griffith will know when he comes But Griffith did not come It was nearly dark in the outer world when he recovered from the terrible blow he had got from Fritz s pistol in the cave and staggered to the inner cavern The moment he entered it a smell of burning timbers greeted his nostrils By Heaven the house above is burning up I believe he cried rushing to the rope ladder and beginning to climb it rapidly But he had only got a few feet up when it gave way and he fell to the ground considerably bruised The devil s to pay now he muttered angrily A fellow will smother down here For a moment the young villain stood irresolute then he approached the door of Madge Thornton s cell Madge he called There was no answer Madge he shouted in a louder tone at the same time rattling the door savagely Well what do you want she demanded rising from her cot I want to know if you want to escape from this place alive Why what is the matter Matter enough The old house above is burning down and if you don t want to suffocate you must leave this place at once with me Well why don t you open the door then He was unlocking the great padlock even as he spoke I am perfectly willing to do so and when you reveal to me the hiding place of your father s money which you had when you left Leadville you are free to go he said standing the doorway Are you foolish enough to suppose for one moment that I will reveal that If you don t do it curse you I will leave you here to suffocate Do so I would cheerfully pay that penalty of my folly in ever having anything to do with you a hundred times rather than submit to your demands Then but no I ll release you if you ll give me half of the sum Not a cent you detestable wretch Curses on your obstinacy You have refused to do what is right and you shall take the the consequences Stepping back he reclosed the door angrily and hastily relocked the padlock then he left the main chamber for the outer one and jumped into the boat The tide was now on the ebb and the water was now down so that he could row out of the hole into the ocean As soon as he got out a grand sight met his gaze The old house on top of the bluff was in a sheet of lurid flame lighting up the early evening which otherwise was quite dark Showers of sparks ascended toward the heavens and the crackling of the dancing blaze made weird music Pulling in to shore Griffith Gregg leaped from the boat and clambered up the side of the bluff The first man he met was Thornton of Leadville who had fastened up the hut and hurried to the scene of the conflagration as soon as he had discovered the light The recognition was mutual and each uttered a cry At last the speculator cried and he bounded forward and seized his enemy by the throat Gregg clinched with him and the two men rolled to the ground in a fierce struggle the lurid light of the burning building lighting up the scene like unto the colored fire to some wild exciting drama CHAPTER XIII CONCLUSION The struggle was short and decisive Supple though the younger Gregg was he was no match for the man from Leadville and it was not long ere mister Thornton had his man pinned firmly beneath him so that he could not move By this time the villagers had arrived upon the scene in numbers and stood contemplating the scene in wonder What is the matter here one of them demanded stepping forward Who set fire to this building That I am not prepared to say as I just came mister Thornton replied but I know that I have captured one of the worst villains living Is there an officer of the law among you If so I want him to take this devil into immediate custody and watch well that he don t escape I am a constable but I must first know what charge you have against this young man of highly respected family another villager said Charges enough to hang him higher than Haman if you like the speculator cried He has my daughter imprisoned somewhere in hopes of extorting money from me he is wanted in Leadville Colorado for no less than three cold blooded murders and also for horse theft and I ve got papers to show for it It s a lie It s a mistake This man is crazy young Gregg shouted I appeal to you for protection gentlemen Protection you shall have sir by law if you deserve it the constable replied slipping a pair of hand cuffs upon the young man s wrists Now sir to mister Thornton permit me to examine your papers The speculator drew a package of documents from an inside coat pocket and the officer gave them a critical examination They are all right he said returning them For the present I will leave the scoundrel in your charge until I recover my lost daughter mister Thornton said That you will never do curse you Griffith Gregg hissed savagely You ve sealed her doom in tackling me and you may as well put a mourning band around your hat What do you dare to tell me my daughter is in peril sir Well that remains to be told It is according to whether I am released or not If not most assuredly you will never see her or the money she stole for if I am to answer for all the charges you have preferred against me I can just as well add a few more without any inconvenience We shall see about that I think a rigid search will find her Officer remove him to a place of safety until I determine upon a future course of action The constable accordingly took his departure marching the younger Gregg with him The fire had by this time gained great headway It leaped in great crackling volumes from the roof and burst through the sides in fiery forks The whole interior was a seething furnace of lurid flame and timbers were already beginning to fall in Where is Silly Sue some one cried and the question went from mouth to mouth She sometimes sleeps in the old house Silly Sue as you call her is dead mister Thornton announced Dead the villagers exclaimed gathering around him Silly Sue dead Yes dead and lies in the shanty down the road belonging to Hal Hartly who has gone to some neighboring town to arrange for her burial the speculator said Then he related what he knew concerning the brutal whipping she had had at the hands of Gregg senior A murmur of indignation ran through the crowd as he spoke and though some of the men did not cry out against the guilty man the majority were greatly excited Do you swear this is true one of the villagers cried angrily Ay swear it a hundred times if you like If you have any doubts on the matter it will take but a few moments to examine the poor child s form upon which welts and bloody cuts yet remain to be seen Then I for one propose we give Greyville as good as he meted out the man cried whose name was Tompkins I always had a private idea that he was a villain and now I need no further proof to confirm it All in favor of hauling him out and lynching him make manifest by saying I There was a decisive shout among all but about ten of the men who maintained a grim silence Lynching is a crime gentlemen mister Thornton said in the East which would render you liable It can do no harm to give the human monster a taste of the whip however and then turn him over to the rigor of the law Perhaps you are right Tompkins agreed Come along boys We ll teach the wretch that he must be civilized if he will live in a civilized country And the sturdy villager led off the whole crowd following in his rear with indignant faces There was indeed a dark look out for Captain Gregg From his library window in the village mansion he was watching the fire and saw the crowd march in a funeral like procession down from the bluff along the beach toward the village The countess saw too and compressed her lips tightly Ze crisis is coming she hissed sharply so sharply that he started violently Ze crowd has heard of ze girl s death and are coming for you He turned deathly pale they would show him no mercy as he had shown none to Susie he well knew We must escape from here somehow he cried To submit to arrest means death for you as well as myself How so Did you not witness the whipping without attempting to interfere he sneered They d string you up as quick as I especially when investigation came to prove you to be Madame Lisset the notorious French smuggler The woman s turn it was to whiten now and a suppressed curse escaped from between her clinched teeth I vas one big fool for evaire anchoring here or having you for me agent she replied Somesing must be done and zat vera quick What s all it be There is but one course flight Go to my room and get all the money and jewels there When you come back I will be ready She obeyed and in a very short space of time returned dressed ready for escape Leaving the house by the rear door they skulked hurriedly along a narrow lane This soon brought them out into the country and into an orchard Without pausing the chief of smugglers made a wide detour which finally brought them out upon the beach half a mile north of the village and directly opposite the steamer Countess which lay a good two miles out at sea at anchor A light row boat was drawn upon the beach This Gregg pushed off into the water and sprung in the countess following him Then seizing the oars he pulled with all his skill and strength toward the steamer At the same time a boat manned by half a dozen men pulled out from the beach in front of the village and this too was headed toward the steamer Ha they ve suspected our dodge Gregg growled on discovering the pursuit Curse them I did not think discovery of our flight would be made so quickly Will zey reach ze boat first By no means I ve got the start and the steamer is a good half a mile farther from them than us if not more Let us look after Fritz The roof of the old rookery on the bluff has just fallen in and millions of sparks go up toward the cloudy sky Is the young detective still within that old building He had heard Hartly when he ran through the house setting fire to it and had yelled at the top of his voice for assistance But either Hartly had not heard or did not heed his cries for no assistance came Out in the hall which adjoined the doorless room the flames soon began to crackle ominously and the pungent smell of smoke crept through the wall to his nostrils For a few moments Fritz stood transfixed with horror as the peril of his situation began to dawn upon him He knew by the smell that the house was on fire he knew that if he did not make a hasty escape he would be consumed in the merciless flames What was he to do Really what was there he could do He rushed about scarcely aware what he was doing Suddenly his foot caught upon something and he fell violently to the floor In all his after life he could look back with gladness upon that mishap as it was the means of saving him from an awful death Quickly scrambling to his feet he searched the floor a moment later his hand came in contact with an iron ring Pulling upon it he raised a trap in the floor disclosing a large aperture leading down into another pit below which he concluded was a cellar Without pausing to consider what he was doing he dropped down through the hole Anything was preferable to the horrible danger above He landed upon his feet upon a hard bottom of the cellar into which he had leaped In a moment thereafter there was a crash and a portion of the rear roof over the cellar fell in The light of the burning timbers now gave him a view of his situation The cellar ran in under the whole of the house and was nearly filled with boxes The only stairway had been covered by the caving in of the floor thus closing this avenue of escape The caving in in turn had been mainly caused by the falling of a heavy girder from the second floor Directly in front of where Fritz had landed was a large well like hole in the ground that looked as if it might be very deep and his only wonder was that he had not stepped off into it in the darkness that had prevailed immediately after he had struck into the cellar I vonder off dot vas a well or ish der hole vot leads down into der cavern he muttered peering over the edge If der latter vos der case I m all righd providin I can git down But off id vos a well den I vos a gone sucker sure I don d see anydings off der rope ladder Looking above his head he however discovered where a staple had been recently drawn out of a joist and this satisfied him that it had been where the ladder had been fastened to and that the hole was the same that penetrated into the cavern in the bluff Der next t ing vas to get down dere he muttered If I jump like ash not I preak mine neck und den I pe ash pad off ash before of not vorse There seemed no other way of getting down however and he resolved to take his chances rather than remain in the cellar and become a target for the fallen fiery timbers With a prayer for safety he made the uncertain leap Down down down he went with a velocity that took his breath and he knew no more except being conscious of striking the earth with a heavy jar When he recovered his senses he was in the outer cave and Madge Thornton was kneeling over him chafing his hands The cavern was dense with smoke and breathing was difficult Fritz comprehended the situation at once and sat up I vas come down like a t ousand of bricks eh he smiled feeling of his limbs to learn if any of them were seriously damaged I forgot all apoud vere I vas going all at vonce How you got oud off der dungeon Good luck would have it that Griffith in his passion should have thrown the bolt of the padlock when the catch was not in so I easily reached out my hand drew the padlock off and got out into the chamber Madge replied What is the matter Is the old house burning Yes We must get oud off here or ve shoke to death Off it gets too deep I vil swim mit you t rough dot hole He accordingly arose to his feet and raising her in his arms he waded toward the aperture and outside of the cavern around to the southern beach the water in the deepest place but reaching to his throat By shimminy dunder I feel yoost like ash if I vas tickled to death t ings haff turned oud so vell Fritz cried as he placed Madge on her feet A vile ago I vas ash goot ash guff up for a roasted Dutchman now I vas oud und so vas you und I feel better ash a spring lamb Are you sure we are out of danger Vel no not eggsactly sure but I t ink ve pe all righd now Yoost you sday here in der shadow off yer pluff vile I skirmish aroundt und see vot s to pay She accordingly did as directed while he clambered up the side of the bluff bent on reconnoisance The first man and only man he met was mister Thornton who had hurried back from the village to the bluff as soon as Captain Gregg was discovered missing to keep watch in the vicinity He uttered a cry of joy as he saw Fritz Why bless you boy I never expected to see you again he cried shaking the young detective by the hand Und you come purdy near id too you can bet a half dollar mister Thornton for I yoost got oud off der building here in time to save mine vool But I haff got your daughter und der monish vas safe What you do not tell me this for a fact Fritz Vel off I don d misdake it vas Yoost vait here und I pring you der girl Ash to der money she vas no fool und put it avay vere she can get it again He vanished only to reappear a few minutes later accompanied by Madge Then followed a touching scene The speculator received his lost daughter with open arms there were explanations and kisses and tears and laughs and the reunion was now complete Leaving them to their joy let us take a concluding glance at the ocean race which was in the meantime transpiring The pursuers saw Gregg pull out from the shore as soon as he saw them and they tugged at their oars with a will Pull boys Tompkins cried from his position at the steering oar See the woman is waving her handkerchief That is a signal to the crew on board to fire up ready to be off Pull pull for your worth We must intercept them if possible before they board The villagers did pull with a will and their boat fairly leaped over the water Tompkins had guessed the truth The countess s signal did result in the crew s raising anchor and in unbanking the slumbering fires for huge volumes of smoke almost immediately began to roll from the smokestacks But pull though they did with almost super human efforts the pursuers were destined not to win Gregg s boat reached the steamer while the villagers were yet eight minutes distant and he and the countess clambered aboard Then the steamer s whistle gave a defiant shriek and the craft began to move away As she did so the pursuers saw a man suddenly leap overboard into the water Pulling on they came to him just as he was sinking for the last time It was Hal Hartly and he was mortally wounded He only spoke once after they pulled him aboard it was to gasp out faintly She s doomed I ve scuttled her Then the blood spurted from his mouth and he expired while the Countess steamed away to sea and was lost from view and Captain Gregg the smuggler was lost from the clutches of the law What was the fate of the Countess is not definitely known but she never again entered the port of Havre nor was a soul on board of her ever afterward seen The Philadelphia detectives who arrived the next day found no one to arrest as those on whom suspicion could justly rest had fled during the night Susie and Hal Hartly received a respectable burial at the expense of mister Thornton then after paying Fritz as promised the sum of five thousand dollars the speculator set out for his Western home accompanied by his daughter and by Griffith Gregg who was to go back to the scene of his crimes for trial With his reward money Fritz immediately returned to Philadelphia and soon after purchased an interest in a paying established business where he may be seen most any day when not on detective duty or if he is out his pretty wife Rebecca will represent him END OF THE
