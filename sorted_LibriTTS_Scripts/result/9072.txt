none	none	Apologies are seldom of any use We will delay till your arrival the reasons good or bad which have made me such a sparing and ungrateful correspondent Be assured for the present that nothing has lessened either the esteem or love with which I dismissed you at Harwich Both have been increased by all that I have been told of you by yourself or others and seven when you return you will return to an unaltered and I hope unalterable friend All that you have to fear from me is the vexation of disappointing me No man loves to frustrate expectations which have been formed in his favour and the pleasure which I promise myself from your journals and remarks is so great that perhaps no degree of attention or discernment will be sufficient to afford it Come home however and take your chance I long to see you and to hear you and hope that we shall not be so long separated again Come home and expect such a welcome as is due to him whom a wise and noble curiosity has led where perhaps no native of this country ever was before eight I have no news to tell you that can deserve your notice nor would I willingly lessen the pleasure that any novelty may give you at your return I am afraid we shall find it difficult to keep among us a mind which has been so long feasted with variety But let us try what esteem and kindness can effect As your father s liberality has indulged you with so long a ramble I doubt not but you will think his sickness or even his desire to see you a sufficient reason for hastening your return The longer we live and the more we think the higher value we learn to put on the friendship and tenderness of parents and of friends Parents we can have but once and he promises himself too much who enters life with the expectation of finding many friends Upon some motive I hope that you will be here soon and am willing to think that it will be an inducement to your return that it is sincerely desired by dear Sir Your affectionate humble servant SAM JOHNSON Johnson s Court Fleet street January fourteen seventeen sixty six I returned to London in February and found doctor Johnson in a good house in Johnson s Court Fleet street nine in which he had accommodated Miss Williams with an apartment on the ground floor while mister Levett occupied his post in the garret his faithful Francis was still attending upon him He received me with much kindness The fragments of our first conversation which I have preserved are these I told him that Voltaire in a conversation with me had distinguished Pope and Dryden thus Pope drives a handsome chariot with a couple of neat trim nags Dryden a coach and six stately horses JOHNSON Why Sir the truth is they both drive coaches and six but Dryden s horses are either galloping or stumbling Pope s go at a steady even trot ten He said of Goldsmith s Traveller which had been published in my absence There has not been so fine a poem since Pope s time And here it is proper to settle with authentick precision what has long floated in publick report as to Johnson s being himself the authour of a considerable part of that poem Much no doubt both of the sentiments and expression were derived from conversation with him and it was certainly submitted to his friendly revision but in the year seventeen eighty three he at my request marked with a pencil the lines which he had furnished which are only line four hundred and twentieth To stop too fearful and too faint to go and the concluding ten lines except the last couplet but one which I distinguish by the Italick character How small of all that human hearts endure That part which kings or laws eleven can cause or cure Still to ourselves in every place consign d Our own felicity we make or find twelve With secret course which no loud storms annoy Glides the smooth current of domestick joy The lifted axe the agonizing wheel Luke s iron crown and Damien s bed of steel To men remote from power but rarely known Leave reason faith and conscience all our own He added These are all of which I can be sure thirteen They bear a small proportion to the whole which consists of four hundred and thirty eight verses Goldsmith in the couplet which he inserted mentions Luke as a person well known and superficial readers have passed it over quite smoothly while those of more attention have been as much perplexed by Luke as by Lydiat fourteen in The Vanity of Human Wishes The truth is that Goldsmith himself was in a mistake In the Respublica Hungarian fifteen there is an account of a desperate rebellion in the year fifteen fourteen headed by two brothers of the name of Zeck George and Luke When it was quelled George not Luke was punished by his head being encircled with a red hot iron crown corona candescente ferrea coronatur sixteen The same severity of torture was exercised on the Earl of Athol one of the murderers of King James I of Scotland doctor Johnson at the same time favoured me by marking the lines which he furnished to Goldsmith s Deserted Village which are only the last four That trade s proud empire hastes to swift decay As ocean sweeps the labour d mole away While self dependent power can time defy As rocks resist the billows and the sky Talking of education People have now a days said he got a strange opinion that every thing should be taught by lectures Now I cannot see that lectures can do so much good as reading the books from which the lectures are taken I know nothing that can be best taught by lectures seventeen except where experiments are to be shewn You may teach chymistry by lectures You might teach making of shoes by lectures eighteen At night I supped with him at the Mitre tavern that we might renew our social intimacy at the original place of meeting But there was now a considerable difference in his way of living Having had an illness in which he was advised to leave off wine he had from that period continued to abstain from it and drank only water or lemonade nineteen I told him that a foreign friend of his twenty whom I had met with abroad was so wretchedly perverted to infidelity that he treated the hopes of immortality with brutal levity and said As man dies like a dog let him lie like a dog JOHNSON If he dies like a dog let him lie like a dog I added that this man said to me I hate mankind for I think myself one of the best of them and I know how bad I am JOHNSON Sir he must be very singular in his opinion if he thinks himself one of the best of men for none of his friends think him so He said no honest man could be a Deist for no man could be so after a fair examination of the proofs of Christianity I named Hume twenty one JOHNSON No Sir Hume owned to a clergyman in the bishoprick of Durham that he had never read the New Testament with attention I mentioned Hume s notion twenty two that all who are happy are equally happy a little miss with a new gown at a dancing school ball a general at the head of a victorious army and an orator after having made an eloquent speech in a great assembly JOHNSON Sir that all who are happy are equally happy is not true A peasant and a philosopher may be equally satisfied but not equally happy Happiness consists in the multiplicity of agreeable consciousness A peasant has not capacity for having equal happiness with a philosopher I remember this very question very happily illustrated in opposition to Hume by the Reverend mister Robert Brown twenty three at Utrecht A small drinking glass and a large one said he may be equally full but the large one holds more than the small doctor Johnson was very kind this evening and said to me You have now lived five and twenty years and you have employed them well Alas Sir said I I fear not Do I know history Do I know mathematicks Do I know law JOHNSON Why Sir though you may know no science so well as to be able to teach it and no profession so well as to be able to follow it your general mass of knowledge of books and men renders you very capable to make yourself master of any science or fit yourself for any profession I mentioned that a gay friend had advised me against being a lawyer because I should be excelled by plodding block heads JOHNSON Why Sir in the formulary and statutory part of law a plodding block head may excel but in the ingenious and rational part of it a plodding block head can never excel I talked of the mode adopted by some to rise in the world by courting great men and asked him whether he had ever submitted to it JOHNSON Why Sir I never was near enough to great men to court them You may be prudently attached to great men and yet independent You are not to do what you think wrong and Sir you are to calculate and not pay too dear for what you get You must not give a shilling s worth of court for six pence worth of good But if you can get a shilling s worth of good for six pence worth of court you are a fool if you do not pay court twenty four He said If convents should be allowed at all they should only be retreats for persons unable to serve the publick or who have served it It is our first duty to serve society and after we have done that we may attend wholly to the salvation of our own souls A youthful passion for abstracted devotion should not be encouraged twenty five I introduced the subject of second sight and other mysterious manifestations the fulfilment of which I suggested might happen by chance JOHNSON Yes Sir but they have happened so often that mankind have agreed to think them not fortuitous twenty six I talked to him a great deal of what I had seen in Corsica and of my intention to publish an account of it He encouraged me by saying You cannot go to the bottom of the subject but all that you tell us will be new to us Give us as many anecdotes as you can twenty seven Our next meeting at the Mitre was on Saturday the fifteenth of February when I presented to him my old and most intimate friend the Reverend mister Temple twenty eight then of Cambridge I having mentioned that I had passed some time with Rousseau in his wild retreat twenty nine and having quoted some remark made by mister Wilkes with whom I had spent many pleasant hours in Italy Johnson said sarcastically It seems Sir you have kept very good company abroad Rousseau and Wilkes Thinking it enough to defend one at a time I said nothing as to my gay friend but answered with a smile My dear Sir you don t call Rousseau bad company Do you really think him a bad man JOHNSON Sir if you are talking jestingly of this I don t talk with you If you mean to be serious I think him one of the worst of men a rascal who ought to be hunted out of society as he has been Three or four nations have expelled him and it is a shame that he is protected in this country thirty BOSWELL I don t deny Sir but that his novel thirty one may perhaps do harm but I cannot think his intention was bad JOHNSON Sir that will not do We cannot prove any man s intention to be bad You may shoot a man through the head and say you intended to miss him but the Judge will order you to be hanged An alleged want of intention when evil is committed will not be allowed in a court of justice Rousseau Sir is a very bad man I would sooner sign a sentence for his transportation than that of any felon who has gone from the Old Bailey these many years Yes I should like to have him work in the plantations thirty two BOSWELL Sir do you think him as bad a man as Voltaire JOHNSON Why Sir it is difficult to settle the proportion of iniquity between them thirty three This violence seemed very strange to me who had read many of Rousseau s animated writings with great pleasure and even edification had been much pleased with his society thirty four and was just come from the Continent where he was very generally admired Nor can I yet allow that he deserves the very severe censure which Johnson pronounced upon him His absurd preference of savage to civilised life thirty five and other singularities are proofs rather of a defect in his understanding than of any depravity in his heart And notwithstanding the unfavourable opinion which many worthy men have expressed of his Profession de Foi du Vicaire Savoyard I cannot help admiring it as the performance of a man full of sincere reverential submission to Divine Mystery though beset with perplexing doubts a state of mind to be viewed with pity rather than with anger On his favourite subject of subordination Johnson said So far is it from being true that men are naturally equal thirty six that no two people can be half an hour together but one shall acquire an evident superiority over the other I mentioned the advice given us by philosophers to console ourselves when distressed or embarrassed by thinking of those who are in a worse situation than ourselves This I observed could not apply to all for there must be some who have nobody worse than they are JOHNSON Why to be sure Sir there are but they don t know it There is no being so poor and so contemptible who does not think there is somebody still poorer and still more contemptible As my stay in London at this time was very short I had not many opportunities of being with doctor Johnson but I felt my veneration for him in no degree lessened by my having seen mullorum hominum mores et urbes thirty seven On the contrary by having it in my power to compare him with many of the most celebrated persons of other countries thirty eight my admiration of his extraordinary mind was increased and confirmed The roughness indeed which sometimes appeared in his manners was more striking to me now from my having been accustomed to the studied smooth complying habits of the Continent and I clearly recognised in him not without respect for his honest conscientious zeal the same indignant and sarcastical mode of treating every attempt to unhinge or weaken good principles One evening when a young gentleman thirty nine teized him with an account of the infidelity of his servant who he said would not believe the scriptures because he could not read them in the original tongues and be sure that they were not invented Why foolish fellow said Johnson has he any better authority for almost every thing that he believes BOSWELL Then the vulgar Sir never can know they are right but must submit themselves to the learned JOHNSON To be sure Sir The vulgar are the children of the State and must be taught like children forty BOSWELL Then Sir a poor Turk must be a Mahometan just as a poor Englishman must be a Christian forty one JOHNSON Why yes Sir and what then This now is such stuff as I used to talk to my mother when I first began to think myself a clever fellow and she ought to have whipt me for it Another evening doctor Goldsmith and I called on him with the hope of prevailing on him to sup with us at the Mitre We found him indisposed and resolved not to go abroad Come then said Goldsmith we will not go to the Mitre to night since we cannot have the big man forty two with us Johnson then called for a bottle of port of which Goldsmith and I partook while our friend now a water drinker sat by us GOLDSMITH I think mister Johnson you don t go near the theatres now You give yourself no more concern about a new play than if you had never had any thing to do with the stage JOHNSON Why Sir our tastes greatly alter The lad does not care for the child s rattle and the old man does not care for the young man s whore GOLDSMITH Nay Sir but your Muse was not a whore JOHNSON Sir I do not think she was But as we advance in the journey of life we drop some of the things which have pleased us whether it be that we are fatigued and don t choose to carry so many things any farther or that we find other things which we like better BOSWELL But Sir why don t you give us something in some other way GOLDSMITH Ay Sir we have a claim upon you forty three JOHNSON No Sir I am not obliged to do any more No man is obliged to do as much as he can do A man is to have part of his life to himself If a soldier has fought a good many campaigns he is not to be blamed if he retires to ease and tranquillity A physician who has practised long in a great city may be excused if he retires to a small town and takes less practice Now Sir the good I can do by my conversation bears the same proportion to the good I can do by my writings that the practice of a physician retired to a small town does to his practice in a great city forty four BOSWELL But I wonder Sir you have not more pleasure in writing than in not writing JOHNSON Sir you may wonder He talked of making verses and observed The great difficulty is to know when you have made good ones When composing I have generally had them in my mind perhaps fifty at a time walking up and down in my room and then I have written them down and often from laziness have written only half lines I have written a hundred lines in a day I remember I wrote a hundred lines of The Vanity of Human Wishes in a day forty five Doctor turning to Goldsmith I am not quite idle I have one line t other day but I made no more GOLDSMITH Let us hear it we ll put a bad one to it JOHNSON No Sir I have forgot it forty six Such specimens of the easy and playful conversation of the great doctor Samuel Johnson are I think to be prized as exhibiting the little varieties of a mind so enlarged and so powerful when objects of consequence required its exertions and as giving us a minute knowledge of his character and modes of thinking To BENNET LANGTON esquire AT LANGTON NEAR SPILSBY LINCOLNSHIRE DEAR SIR What your friends have done that from your departure till now nothing has been heard of you none of us are able to inform the rest but as we are all neglected alike no one thinks himself entitled to the privilege of complaint I should have known nothing of you or of Langton from the time that dear Miss Langton left us had not I met mister Simpson of Lincoln one day in the street by whom I was informed that mister Langton your Mamma and yourself had been all ill but that you were all recovered That sickness should suspend your correspondence I did not wonder but hoped that it would be renewed at your recovery Since you will not inform us where you are or how you live I know not whether you desire to know any thing of us However I will tell you that THE CLUB subsists but we have the loss of Burke s company since he has been engaged in publick business forty seven in which he has gained more reputation than perhaps any man at his first appearance ever gained before He made two speeches in the House for repealing the Stamp act which were publickly commended by mister Pitt and have filled the town with wonder forty eight Burke is a great man by nature and is expected soon to attain civil greatness forty nine I am grown greater too for I have maintained the newspapers these many weeks fifty and what is greater still I have risen every morning since New year s day at about eight when I was up I have indeed done but little yet it is no slight advancement to obtain for so many hours more the consciousness of being I wish you were in my new study fifty one I am now writing the first letter in it I think it looks very pretty about me Dyer fifty two is constant at THE CLUB Hawkins is remiss I am not over diligent doctor Nugent doctor Goldsmith and mister Reynolds are very constant mister Lye is printing his Saxon and Gothick Dictionary fifty three all THE CLUB subscribes You will pay my respects to all my Lincolnshire friends I am dear Sir Most affectionately your s SAM JOHNSON March nine seventeen sixty six Johnson s court Fleet street fifty four To BENNET LANGTON esquire AT LANGTON NEAR SPILSBY LINCOLNSHIRE DEAR SIR In supposing that I should be more than commonly affected by the death of Peregrine Langton fifty five you were not mistaken he was one of those whom I loved at once by instinct and by reason I have seldom indulged more hope of any thing than of being able to improve our acquaintance to friendship Many a time have I placed myself again at Langton and imagined the pleasure with which I should walk to Partney fifty six in a summer morning but this is no longer possible We must now endeavour to preserve what is left us his example of piety and oeconomy I hope you make what enquiries you can and write down what is told you The little things which distinguish domestick characters are soon forgotten if you delay to enquire you will have no information if you neglect to write information will be vain fifty seven His art of life certainly deserves to be known and studied He lived in plenty and elegance upon an income which to many would appear indigent and to most scanty How he lived therefore every man has an interest in knowing His death I hope was peaceful it was surely happy I wish I had written sooner lest writing now I should renew your grief but I would not forbear saying what I have now said This loss is I hope the only misfortune of a family to whom no misfortune at all should happen if my wishes could avert it Let me know how you all go on Has mister Langton got him the little horse that I recommended It would do him good to ride about his estate in fine weather Be pleased to make my compliments to missus Langton and to dear Miss Langton and Miss Di and Miss Juliet and to every body else The wonder with most that hear an account of his oeconomy will be how he was able with such an income to do so much especially when it is considered that he paid for everything he had he had no land except the two or three small fields which I have said he rented and instead of gaining any thing by their produce I have reason to think he lost by them however they furnished him with no further assistance towards his housekeeping than grass for his horses not hay for that I know he bought and for two cows Every Monday morning he settled his family accounts and so kept up a constant attention to the confining his expences within his income and to do it more exactly compared those expences with a computation he had made how much that income would afford him every week and day of the year One of his oeconomical practices was as soon as any repair was wanting in or about his house to have it immediately performed When he had money to spare he chose to lay in a provision of linen or clothes or any other necessaries as then he said he could afford it which he might not be so well able to do when the actual want came in consequence of which method he had a considerable supply of necessary articles lying by him beside what was in use But the main particular that seems to have enabled him to do so much with his income was that he paid for every thing as soon as he had it except alone what were current accounts such as rent for his house and servants wages and these he paid at the stated times with the utmost exactness He gave notice to the tradesmen of the neighbouring market towns that they should no longer have his custom if they let any of his servants have anything without their paying for it Thus he put it out of his power to commit those imprudences to which those are liable that defer their payments by using their money some other way than where it ought to go And whatever money he had by him he knew that it was not demanded elsewhere but that he might safely employ it as he pleased His example was confined by the sequestered place of his abode to the observation of few though his prudence and virtue would have made it valuable to all who could have known it These few particulars which I knew myself or have obtained from those who lived with him may afford instruction and be an incentive to that wise art of living which he so successfully practised BOSWELL THE CLUB holds very well together Monday is my night fifty eight I continue to rise tolerably well and read more than I did I hope something will yet come on it fifty nine I am Sir Your most affectionate servant SAM JOHNSON May ten seventeen sixty six Johnson s court Fleet street After I had been some time in Scotland I mentioned to him in a letter that On my first return to my native country after some years of absence I was told of a vast number of my acquaintance who were all gone to the land of forgetfulness and I found myself like a man stalking over a field of battle who every moment perceives some one lying dead I complained of irresolution and mentioned my having made a vow as a security for good conduct I wrote to him again without being able to move his indolence nor did I hear from him till he had received a copy of my inaugural Exercise or Thesis in Civil Law which I published at my admission as an Advocate as is the custom in Scotland He then wrote to me as follows To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR The reception of your Thesis put me in mind of my debt to you Why did you sixty I will punish you for it by telling you that your Latin wants correction sixty one In the beginning Spei alterae not to urge that it should be prima is not grammatical alterae should be alteri In the next line you seem to use genus absolutely for what we call family that is for illustrious extraction I doubt without authority Homines nullius originis for Nullis orti majoribus or Nullo loco nati is I am afraid barbarous Ruddiman is dead sixty two I have now vexed you enough and will try to please you Your resolution to obey your father I sincerely approve but do not accustom yourself to enchain your volatility by vows they will sometime leave a thorn in your mind which you will perhaps never be able to extract or eject Take this warning it is of great importance sixty three The study of the law is what you very justly term it copious and generous sixty four and in adding your name to its professors you have done exactly what I always wished when I wished you best I hope that you will continue to pursue it vigorously and constantly sixty five You gain at least what is no small advantage security from those troublesome and wearisome discontents which are always obtruding themselves upon a mind vacant unemployed and undetermined You ought to think it no small inducement to diligence and perseverance that they will please your father We all live upon the hope of pleasing somebody and the pleasure of pleasing ought to be greatest and at last always will be greatest when our endeavours are exerted in consequence of our duty Life is not long and too much of it must not pass in idle deliberation how it shall be spent deliberation which those who begin it by prudence and continue it with subtilty must after long expence of thought conclude by chance sixty six To prefer one future mode of life to another upon just reasons requires faculties which it has not pleased our Creator to give us If therefore the profession you have chosen has some unexpected inconveniencies console yourself by reflecting that no profession is without them and that all the importunities and perplexities of business are softness and luxury compared with the incessant cravings of vacancy and the unsatisfactory expedients of idleness Haec sunt quce nostra polui te voce monere sixty seven Vade age As to your History of Corsica you have no materials which others have not or may not have You have somehow or other warmed your imagination I wish there were some cure like the lover s leap for all heads of which some single idea has obtained an unreasonable and irregular possession Mind your own affairs and leave the Corsicans to theirs I am dear Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON London Aug twenty one seventeen sixty six To doctor SAMUEL JOHNSON Auchinleck Nov six seventeen sixty six MUCH ESTEEMED AND DEAR SIR I plead not guilty to sixty eight Having thus I hope cleared myself of the charge brought against me I presume you will not be displeased if I escape the punishment which you have decreed for me unheard If you have discharged the arrows of criticism against an innocent man you must rejoice to find they have missed him or have not been pointed so as to wound him To talk no longer in allegory I am with all deference going to offer a few observations in defence of my Latin which you have found fault with You think I should have used spei primae instead of spei alterae Spes is indeed often used to express something on which we have a future dependence as in Virg Eclog i l fourteen modo namque gemellos Spem gregis ah silice in nuda connixa reliquit and in Georg iii l four hundred seventy three Spemque gregemque simul for the lambs and the sheep Yet it is also used to express any thing on which we have a present dependence and is well applied to a man of distinguished influence our support our refuge our praesidium as Horace calls Maecenas So AEneid xii l fifty seven Queen Amata addresses her son in law Turnus Spes tu nunc una and he was then no future hope for she adds decus imperiumque Latini Te penes which might have been said of my Lord Bute some years ago Now I consider the present Earl of Bute to be Excelsae familiae de Bute spes prima and my Lord Mountstuart as his eldest son to be spes altera So in AEneid xii l one hundred sixty eight after having mentioned Pater AEneas who was the present spes the reigning spes as my German friends would say the spes prima the poet adds Et juxta Ascanius magnae spes altera Romae You think alterae ungrammatical and you tell me it should have been alteri You must recollect that in old times alter was declined regularly and when the ancient fragments preserved in the Juris Civilis Fontes were written it was certainly declined in the way that I use it This I should think may protect a lawyer who writes alterae in a dissertation upon part of his own science But as I could hardly venture to quote fragments of old law to so classical a man as mister Johnson I have not made an accurate search into these remains to find examples of what I am able to produce in poetical composition We find in Plaut Rudens act iii scene four Nam Jiuic alters patria qua sit profecto nescio Plautus is to be sure an old comick writer but in the days of Scipio and Lelius we find Terent Heautontim act ii scene three hoc ipsa in itinere alterae Dum narrat forte audivi You doubt my having authority for using genus absolutely for what we call family that is for illustrious extraction Now I take genus in Latin to have much the same signification with birth in English both in their primary meaning expressing simply descent but both made to stand Greek kat exochaen noble descent Genus is thus used in Hor lib ii Sat v one eight Et genus et virtus nisi cum re vilior alga est And in lib i Epist vi one thirty seven Et genus et forinam Regina pecunia donat And in the celebrated contest between Ajax and Ulysses Ovid s Metamorph lib xiii one one hundred forty Nam genus et proavos et quae non fecimus ipsi Vix ea nostra voco Homines nullius originis for nullis orti majoribus or nullo loco nati is you are afraid barbarous Origo is used to signify extraction as in Virg AEneid i one two hundred eighty six Nascetur pulchrd Trojanus origine Caesar And in AEneid x one six hundred eighteen Ille tamen nostra deducit origine nomen And as nullus is used for obscure is it not in the genius of the Latin language to write nullius originis for obscure extraction I have defended myself as well as I could Might I venture to differ from you with regard to the utility of vows I am sensible that it would be very dangerous to make vows rashly and without a due consideration But I cannot help thinking that they may often be of great advantage to one of a variable judgement and irregular inclinations I always remember a passage in one of your letters to our Italian friend Baretti where talking of the monastick life you say you do not wonder that serious men should put themselves under the protection of a religious order when they have found how unable they are to take care of themselves sixty nine For my own part without affecting to be a Socrates I am sure I have a more than ordinary struggle to maintain with the Evil Principle and all the methods I can devise are little enough to keep me tolerably steady in the paths of rectitude I am ever with the highest veneration Your affectionate humble servant JAMES BOSWELL It appears from Johnson s diary that he was this year at mister Thrale s from before Midsummer till after Michaelmas and that he afterwards passed a month at Oxford He had then contracted a great intimacy with mister Chambers of that University afterwards Sir Robert Chambers one of the Judges in India seventy He published nothing this year in his own name but the noble dedication seventy one to the King of Gwyn s London and Westminster Improved was written by him and he furnished the Preface Dagger and several of the pieces which compose a volume of Miscellanies by missus Anna Williams the blind lady who had an asylum in his house Of these there are his Epitaph on Philips seventy two Translation of a Latin Epitaph on Sir Thomas Hanmer seventy three Dagger Friendship an Ode seventy four and The Ant a paraphrase from the Proverbs of which I have a copy in his own hand writing and from internal evidence I ascribe to him To Miss on her giving the Authour a gold and silk net work Purse of her own weaving seventy five Dagger and The happy Life seventy six Dagger Most of the pieces in this volume have evidently received additions from his superiour pen particularly Verses to mister Richardson on his Sir Charles Grandison The Excursion Reflections on a Grave digging in Westminster Abbey seventy seven There is in this collection a poem On the Death of Stephen Grey the Electrician which on reading it appeared to me to be undoubtedly Johnson s I asked missus Williams whether it was not his Sir said she with some warmth I wrote that poem before I had the honour of doctor Johnson s acquaintance I however was so much impressed with my first notion that I mentioned it to Johnson repeating at the same time what missus Williams had said His answer was It is true Sir that she wrote it before she was acquainted with me but she has not told you that I wrote it all over again except two lines seventy eight The Fountains dagger a beautiful little Fairy tale in prose written with exquisite simplicity is one of Johnson s productions and I cannot with hold from missus Thrale the praise of being the authour of that admirable poem The Three Warnings He wrote this year a letter not intended for publication which has perhaps as strong marks of his sentiment and style as any of his compositions The original is in my possession It is addressed to the late mister William Drummond bookseller in Edinburgh a gentleman of good family but small estate who took arms for the house of Stuart in seventeen forty five and during his concealment in London till the act of general pardon came out obtained the acquaintance of doctor Johnson who justly esteemed him as a very worthy man It seems some of the members of the society in Scotland for propagating Christian knowledge had opposed the scheme of translating the holy scriptures into the Erse or Gaelick language from political considerations of the disadvantage of keeping up the distinction between the Highlanders and the other inhabitants of North Britain doctor Johnson being informed of this I suppose by mister Drummond wrote with a generous indignation as follows To mister WILLIAM DRUMMOND SIR I did not expect to hear that it could be in an assembly convened for the propagation of Christian knowledge a question whether any nation uninstructed in religion should receive instruction or whether that instruction should be imparted to them by a translation of the holy books into their own language If obedience to the will of God be necessary to happiness and knowledge of his will be necessary to obedience I know not how he that with holds this knowledge or delays it can be said to love his neighbour as himself He that voluntarily continues ignorance is guilty of all the crimes which ignorance produces as to him that should extinguish the tapers of a light house might justly be imputed the calamities of shipwrecks Christianity is the highest perfection of humanity and as no man is good but as he wishes the good of others no man can be good in the highest degree who wishes not to others the largest measures of the greatest good To omit for a year or for a day the most efficacious method of advancing Christianity in compliance with any purposes that terminate on this side of the grave is a crime of which I know not that the world has yet had an example except in the practice of the planters of America seventy nine a race of mortals whom I suppose no other man wishes to resemble eighty The Papists have indeed denied to the laity the use of the bible but this prohibition in few places now very rigorously enforced is defended by arguments which have for their foundation the care of souls To obscure upon motives merely political the light of revelation is a practice reserved for the reformed and surely the blackest midnight of popery is meridian sunshine to such a reformation I am not very willing that any language should be totally extinguished The similitude and derivation of languages afford the most indubitable proof of the traduction of nations and the genealogy of mankind eighty one They add often physical certainty to historical evidence and often supply the only evidence of ancient migrations and of the revolutions of ages which left no written monuments behind them Every man s opinions at least his desires are a little influenced by his favourite studies My zeal for languages may seem perhaps rather over heated even to those by whom I desire to be well esteemed To those who have nothing in their thoughts but trade or policy present power or present money I should not think it necessary to defend my opinions but with men of letters I would not unwillingly compound by wishing the continuance of every language however narrow in its extent or however incommodious for common purposes till it is reposited in some version of a known book that it may be always hereafter examined and compared with other languages and then permitting its disuse For this purpose the translation of the bible is most to be desired It is not certain that the same method will not preserve the Highland language for the purposes of learning and abolish it from daily use When the Highlanders read the Bible they will naturally wish to have its obscurities cleared and to know the history collateral or appendant Knowledge always desires increase it is like fire which must first be kindled by some external agent but which will afterwards propagate itself When they once desire to learn they will naturally have recourse to the nearest language by which that desire can be gratified and one will tell another that if he would attain knowledge he must learn English This speculation may perhaps be thought more subtle than the grossness of real life will easily admit Let it however be remembered that the efficacy of ignorance has been long tried and has not produced the consequence expected Let knowledge therefore take its turn and let the patrons of privation stand awhile aside and admit the operation of positive principles You will be pleased Sir to assure the worthy man who is employed in the new translation eighty two that he has my wishes for his success and if here or at Oxford I can be of any use that I shall think it more than honour to promote his undertaking I am sorry that I delayed so long to write I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON Johnson s court Fleet street Aug thirteen seventeen sixty six The opponents of this pious scheme being made ashamed of their conduct the benevolent undertaking was allowed to go on eighty three The following letters though not written till the year after being chiefly upon the same subject are here inserted TO mister WILLIAM DRUMMOND DEAR SIR That my letter should have had such effects as you mention gives me great pleasure I hope you do not flatter me by imputing to me more good than I have really done Those whom my arguments have persuaded to change their opinion shew such modesty and candour as deserve great praise I hope the worthy translator goes diligently forward He has a higher reward in prospect than any honours which this world can bestow I wish I could be useful to him The publication of my letter if it could be of use in a cause to which all other causes are nothing I should not prohibit But first I would have you consider whether the publication will really do any good next whether by printing and distributing a very small number you may not attain all that you propose and what perhaps I should have said first whether the letter which I do not now perfectly remember be fit to be printed If you can consult doctor Robertson to whom I am a little known I shall be satisfied about the propriety of whatever he shall direct If he thinks that it should be printed I entreat him to revise it there may perhaps be some negligent lines written and whatever is amiss he knows very well how to rectify eighty four Be pleased to let me know from time to time how this excellent design goes forward Make my compliments to young mister Drummond whom I hope you will live to see such as you desire him I have not lately seen mister Elphinston eighty five but believe him to be prosperous I shall be glad to hear the same of you for I am Sir Your affectionate humble servant SAM JOHNSON Johnson s court Fleet street April twenty one seventeen sixty seven TO THE SAME SIR I returned this week from the country after an absence of near six months and found your letter with many others which I should have answered sooner if I had sooner seen them doctor Robertson s opinion was surely right Men should not be told of the faults which they have mended I am glad the old language is taught and honour the translator as a man whom GOD has distinguished by the high office of propagating his word I must take the liberty of engaging you in an office of charity missus Heely the wife of mister Heely who had lately some office in your theatre is my near relation and now in great distress They wrote me word of their situation some time ago to which I returned them an answer which raised hopes of more than it is proper for me to give them Their representation of their affairs I have discovered to be such as cannot be trusted and at this distance though their case requires haste I know not how to act She or her daughters may be heard of at Canongate Head I must beg Sir that you will enquire after them and let me know what is to be done I am willing to go to ten pounds and will transmit you such a sum if upon examination you find it likely to be of use If they are in immediate want advance them what you think proper What I could do I would do for the women having no great reason to pay much regard to Heely himself eighty six I believe you may receive some intelligence from missus Baker of the theatre whose letter I received at the same time with yours and to whom if you see her you will make my excuse for the seeming neglect of answering her Whatever you advance within ten pounds shall be immediately returned to you or paid as you shall order I trust wholly to your judgement I am Sir c SAM JOHNSON London Johnson s court Fleet street Oct twenty four seventeen sixty seven mister Cuthbert Shaw eighty seven alike distinguished by his genius misfortunes and misconduct published this year a poem called The Race by Mercurius Spur esquire eighty eight in which he whimsically made the living poets of England contend for pre eminence of fame by running Prove by their heels the prowess of the head In this poem there was the following portrait of Johnson Here Johnson comes unblest with outward grace His rigid morals stamp d upon his face While strong conceptions struggle in his brain For even wit is brought to bed with pain To view him porters with their loads would rest And babes cling frighted to the nurse s breast With looks convuls d he roars in pompous strain And like an angry lion shakes his mane The Nine with terrour struck who ne er had seen Aught human with so horrible a mien Debating whether they should stay or run Virtue steps forth and claims him for her son With gentle speech she warns him now to yield Nor stain his glories in the doubtful field But wrapt in conscious worth content sit down Since Fame resolv d his various pleas to crown Though forc d his present claim to disavow Had long reserv d a chaplet for his brow He bows obeys for time shall first expire Ere Johnson stay when Virtue bids retire The Honourable Thomas Hervey eighty nine and his lady having unhappily disagreed and being about to separate Johnson interfered as their friend and wrote him a letter of expostulation which I have not been able to find but the substance of it is ascertained by a letter to Johnson in answer to it which mister Hervey printed The occasion of this correspondence between doctor Johnson and mister Hervey was thus related to me by mister Beauclerk ninety Tom Hervey had a great liking for Johnson and in his will had left him a legacy of fifty pounds One day he said to me Johnson may want this money now more than afterwards I have a mind to give it him directly Will you be so good as to carry a fifty pound note from me to him This I positively refused to do as he might perhaps have knocked me down for insulting him and have afterwards put the note in his pocket But I said if Hervey would write him a letter and enclose a fifty pound note I should take care to deliver it He accordingly did write him a letter mentioning that he was only paying a legacy a little sooner To his letter he added P S I am going to part with my wife Johnson then wrote to him saying nothing of the note but remonstrating with him against parting with his wife When I mentioned to Johnson this story in as delicate terms as I could he told me that the fifty pound note was given to him by mister Hervey in consideration of his having written for him a pamphlet against Sir Charles Hanbury Williams who mister Hervey imagined was the authour of an attack upon him but that it was afterwards discovered to be the work of a garreteer who wrote The Fool ninety one the pamphlet therefore against Sir Charles was not printed ninety two In February seventeen sixty seven there happened one of the most remarkable incidents of Johnson s life which gratified his monarchical enthusiasm and which he loved to relate with all its circumstances when requested by his friends This was his being honoured by a private conversation with his Majesty in the library at the Queen s house ninety three He had frequently visited those splendid rooms and noble collection of books ninety four which he used to say was more numerous and curious than he supposed any person could have made in the time which the King had employed mister Barnard the librarian took care that he should have every accommodation that could contribute to his ease and convenience while indulging his literary taste in that place so that he had here a very agreeable resource at leisure hours His Majesty having been informed of his occasional visits was pleased to signify a desire that he should be told when doctor Johnson came next to the library Accordingly the next time that Johnson did come as soon as he was fairly engaged with a book on which while he sat by the fire he seemed quite intent mister Barnard stole round to the apartment where the King was and in obedience to his Majesty s commands mentioned that doctor Johnson was then in the library His Majesty said he was at leisure and would go to him upon which mister Barnard took one of the candles that stood on the King s table and lighted his Majesty through a suite of rooms till they came to a private door into the library of which his Majesty had the key Being entered mister Barnard stepped forward hastily to doctor Johnson who was still in a profound study and whispered him Sir here is the King Johnson started up and stood still His Majesty approached him and at once was courteously easy ninety five His Majesty began by observing that he understood he came sometimes to the library and then mentioning his having heard that the Doctor had been lately at Oxford ninety six asked him if he was not fond of going thither To which Johnson answered that he was indeed fond of going to Oxford sometimes but was likewise glad to come back again The King then asked him what they were doing at Oxford Johnson answered he could not much commend their diligence but that in some respects they were mended for they had put their press under better regulations and were at that time printing Polybius He was then asked whether there were better libraries at Oxford or Cambridge He answered he believed the Bodleian was larger than any they had at Cambridge at the same time adding I hope whether we have more books or not than they have at Cambridge we shall make as good use of them as they do Being asked whether All Souls or Christ Church library ninety seven was the largest he answered All Souls library is the largest we have except the Bodleian Aye said the King that is the publick library His Majesty enquired if he was then writing any thing He answered he was not for he had pretty well told the world what he knew and must now read to acquire more knowledge ninety eight The King as it should seem with a view to urge him to rely on his own stores as an original writer and to continue his labours ninety nine then said I do not think you borrow much from any body Johnson said he thought he had already done his part as a writer I should have thought so too said the King if you had not written so well Johnson observed to me upon this that No man could have paid a handsomer compliment and it was fit for a King to pay It was decisive When asked by another friend at Sir Joshua Reynolds s whether he made any reply to this high compliment he answered No Sir When the King had said it it was to be so It was not for me to bandy civilities with my Sovereign one hundred Perhaps no man who had spent his whole life in courts could have shewn a more nice and dignified sense of true politeness than Johnson did in this instance His Majesty having observed to him that he supposed he must have read a great deal Johnson answered that he thought more than he read one hundred one that he had read a great deal in the early part of his life but having fallen into ill health he had not been able to read much compared with others for instance he said he had not read much compared with doctor Warburton one hundred two Upon which the King said that he heard doctor Warburton was a man of such general knowledge that you could scarce talk with him on any subject on which he was not qualified to speak and that his learning resembled Garrick s acting in its universality one hundred three His Majesty then talked of the controversy between Warburton and Lowth which he seemed to have read and asked Johnson what he thought of it Johnson answered Warburton has most general most scholastick learning Lowth is the more correct scholar I do not know which of them calls names best The King was pleased to say he was of the same opinion adding You do not think then doctor Johnson that there was much argument in the case Johnson said he did not think there was one hundred four Why truly said the King when once it comes to calling names argument is pretty well at an end His Majesty then asked him what he thought of Lord Lyttelton s History which was then just published one hundred five Johnson said he thought his style pretty good but that he had blamed Henry the Second rather too much Why said the King they seldom do these things by halves No Sir answered Johnson not to Kings But fearing to be misunderstood he proceeded to explain himself and immediately subjoined That for those who spoke worse of Kings than they deserved he could find no excuse but that he could more easily conceive how some might speak better of them than they deserved without any ill intention for as Kings had much in their power to give those who were favoured by them would frequently from gratitude exaggerate their praises and as this proceeded from a good motive it was certainly excusable as far as errour could be excusable The King then asked him what he thought of doctor Hill one hundred six Johnson answered that he was an ingenious man but had no veracity and immediately mentioned as an instance of it an assertion of that writer that he had seen objects magnified to a much greater degree by using three or four microscopes at a time than by using one Now added Johnson every one acquainted with microscopes knows that the more of them he looks through the less the object will appear Why replied the King this is not only telling an untruth but telling it clumsily for if that be the case every one who can look through a microscope will be able to detect him one hundred seven I now said Johnson to his friends when relating what had passed began to consider that I was depreciating this man in the estimation of his Sovereign and thought it was time for me to say something that might be more favourable He added therefore that doctor Hill was notwithstanding a very curious observer and if he would have been contented to tell the world no more than he knew he might have been a very considerable man and needed not to have recourse to such mean expedients to raise his reputation one hundred eight The King then talked of literary journals mentioned particularly the Journal des Savans and asked Johnson if it was well done Johnson said it was formerly very well done and gave some account of the persons who began it and carried it on for some years enlarging at the same time on the nature and use of such works The King asked him if it was well done now Johnson answered he had no reason to think that it was one hundred nine The King then asked him if there were any other literary journals published in this kingdom except the Monthly and Critical Reviews one hundred ten and on being answered there were no other his Majesty asked which of them was the best Johnson answered that the Monthly Review was done with most care the Critical upon the best principles adding that the authours of the Monthly Review were enemies to the Church one hundred eleven This the King said he was sorry to hear The conversation next turned on the Philosophical Transactions when Johnson observed that they had now a better method of arranging their materials than formerly Aye said the King they are obliged to doctor Johnson for that for his Majesty had heard and remembered the circumstance which Johnson himself had forgot one hundred twelve His Majesty expressed a desire to have the literary biography of this country ably executed and proposed to doctor Johnson to undertake it Johnson signified his readiness to comply with his Majesty s wishes During the whole of this interview Johnson talked to his Majesty with profound respect but still in his firm manly manner with a sonorous voice and never in that subdued tone which is commonly used at the levee and in the drawing room one hundred thirteen After the King withdrew Johnson shewed himself highly pleased with his Majesty s conversation and gracious behaviour He said to mister Barnard Sir they may talk of the King as they will but he is the finest gentleman I have ever seen one hundred fourteen And he afterwards observed to mister Langton Sir his manners are those of as fine a gentleman as we may suppose Lewis the Fourteenth or Charles the Second At Sir Joshua Reynolds s where a circle of Johnson s friends was collected round him to hear his account of this memorable conversation doctor Joseph Warton in his frank and lively manner one hundred fifteen was very active in pressing him to mention the particulars Come now Sir this is an interesting matter do favour us with it Johnson with great good humour complied He told them I found his Majesty wished I should talk and I made it my business to talk I find it does a man good to be talked to by his Sovereign In the first place a man cannot be in a passion Here some question interrupted him which is to be regretted as he certainly would have pointed out and illustrated many circumstances of advantage from being in a situation where the powers of the mind are at once excited to vigorous exertion and tempered by reverential awe During all the time in which doctor Johnson was employed in relating to the circle at Sir Joshua Reynolds s the particulars of what passed between the King and him doctor Goldsmith remained unmoved upon a sopha at some distance affecting not to join in the least in the eager curiosity of the company He assigned as a reason for his gloom and seeming inattention that he apprehended Johnson had relinquished his purpose of furnishing him with a Prologue to his play one hundred sixteen with the hopes of which he had been flattered but it was strongly suspected that he was fretting with chagrin and envy at the singular honour doctor Johnson had lately enjoyed At length the frankness and simplicity of his natural character prevailed He sprung from the sopha advanced to Johnson and in a kind of flutter from imagining himself in the situation which he had just been hearing described exclaimed Well you acquitted yourself in this conversation better than I should have done for I should have bowed and stammered through the whole of it one hundred seventeen I received no letter from Johnson this year nor have I discovered any of the correspondence one hundred eighteen he had except the two letters to mister Drummond which have been inserted for the sake of connection with that to the same gentleman in seventeen sixty six His diary affords no light as to his employment at this time He passed three months at Lichfield one hundred nineteen and I cannot omit an affecting and solemn scene there as related by himself one hundred twenty Sunday Oct eighteen seventeen sixty seven Yesterday Oct seventeen at about ten in the morning I took my leave for ever of my dear old friend Catharine Chambers who came to live with my mother about seventeen twenty four and has been but little parted from us since She buried my father my brother and my mother She is now fifty eight years old I desired all to withdraw then told her that we were to part for ever that as Christians we should part with prayer and that I would if she was willing say a short prayer beside her She expressed great desire to hear me and held up her poor hands as she lay in bed with great fervour while I prayed kneeling by her nearly in the following words Almighty and most merciful Father whose loving kindness is over all thy works behold visit and relieve this thy servant who is grieved with sickness Grant that the sense of her weakness may add strength to her faith and seriousness to her repentance And grant that by the help of thy Holy Spirit after the pains and labours of this short life we may all obtain everlasting happiness through JESUS CHRIST our Lord for whose sake hear our prayers Amen Our Father c I then kissed her She told me that to part was the greatest pain that she had ever felt and that she hoped we should meet again in a better place I expressed with swelled eyes and great emotion of tenderness the same hopes We kissed and parted I humbly hope to meet again and to part no more one hundred twenty one By those who have been taught to look upon Johnson as a man of a harsh and stern character let this tender and affectionate scene be candidly read and let them then judge whether more warmth of heart and grateful kindness is often found in human nature We have the following notice in his devotional record August two seventeen sixty seven I have been disturbed and unsettled for a long time and have been without resolution to apply to study or to business being hindered by sudden snatches one hundred twenty two He however furnished mister Adams with a Dedication to the King of that ingenious gentleman s Treatise on the Globes conceived and expressed in such a manner as could not fail to be very grateful to a Monarch distinguished for his love of the sciences This year was published a ridicule of his style under the title of Lexiphanes Sir John Hawkins ascribes it to doctor Kenrick one hundred twenty three but its authour was one Campbell a Scotch purser in the navy The ridicule consisted in applying Johnson s words of large meaning one hundred twenty four to insignificant matters as if one should put the armour of Goliath upon a dwarf The contrast might be laughable but the dignity of the armour must remain the same in all considerate minds This malicious drollery therefore it may easily be supposed could do no harm to its illustrious object one hundred twenty five To BENNET LANGTON esquire AT mister ROTHWELL S PERFUMER IN NEW BOND STREET LONDON DEAR SIR That you have been all summer in London is one more reason for which I regret my long stay in the country I hope that you will not leave the town before my return We have here only the chance of vacancies in the passing carriages and I have bespoken one that may if it happens bring me to town on the fourteenth of this month but this is not certain It will be a favour if you communicate this to missus Williams I long to see all my friends I am dear Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON Lichfield Oct ten seventeen sixty seven seventeen sixty eight AETAT fifty nine It appears from his notes of the state of his mind one hundred twenty six that he suffered great perturbation and distraction in seventeen sixty eight Nothing of his writing was given to the publick this year except the Prologue to his friend Goldsmith s comedy of The Good natured Man one hundred twenty seven The first lines of this Prologue are strongly characteristical of the dismal gloom of his mind which in his case as in the case of all who are distressed with the same malady of imagination transfers to others its own feelings Who could suppose it was to introduce a comedy when mister Bensley solemnly began Press d with one hundred twenty eight the load of life the weary mind Surveys the general toil of human kind But this dark ground might make Goldsmith s humour shine the more In the spring of this year having published my Account of Corsica with the Journal of a Tour to that Island one hundred twenty nine I returned to London one hundred thirty very desirous to see doctor Johnson and hear him upon the subject I found he was at Oxford with his friend mister Chambers one hundred thirty one who was now Vinerian Professor and lived in New Inn Hall Having had no letter from him since that in which he criticised the Latinity of my Thesis and having been told by somebody that he was offended at my having put into my Book an extract of his letter to me at Paris one hundred thirty two I was impatient to be with him and therefore followed him to Oxford where I was entertained by mister Chambers with a civility which I shall ever gratefully remember I found that doctor Johnson had sent a letter to me to Scotland and that I had nothing to complain of but his being more indifferent to my anxiety than I wished him to be Instead of giving with the circumstances of time and place such fragments of his conversation as I preserved during this visit to Oxford I shall throw them together in continuation one hundred thirty three I asked him whether as a moralist he did not think that the practice of the law in some degree hurt the nice feeling of honesty JOHNSON Why no Sir if you act properly You are not to deceive your clients with false representations of your opinion you are not to tell lies to a judge BOSWELL But what do you think of supporting a cause which you know to be bad JOHNSON Sir you do not know it to be good or bad till the Judge determines it I have said that you are to state facts fairly so that your thinking or what you call knowing a cause to be bad must be from reasoning must be from your supposing your arguments to be weak and inconclusive But Sir that is not enough An argument which does not convince yourself may convince the Judge to whom you urge it and if it does convince him why then Sir you are wrong and he is right It is his business to judge and you are not to be confident in your own opinion that a cause is bad but to say all you can for your client and then hear the Judge s opinion BOSWELL But Sir does not affecting a warmth when you have no warmth and appearing to be clearly of one opinion when you are in reality of another opinion does not such dissimulation impair one s honesty Is there not some danger that a lawyer may put on the same mask in common life in the intercourse with his friends JOHNSON Why no Sir Everybody knows you are paid for affecting warmth for your client and it is therefore properly no dissimulation the moment you come from the bar you resume your usual behaviour Sir a man will no more carry the artifice of the bar into the common intercourse of society than a man who is paid for tumbling upon his hands will continue to tumble upon his hands when he should walk on his feet one hundred thirty four Talking of some of the modern plays he said False Delicacy was totally void of character one hundred thirty five He praised Goldsmith s Good natured Man said it was the best comedy that had appeared since The Provoked Husband one hundred thirty six and that there had not been of late any such character exhibited on the stage as that of Croaker I observed it was the Suspirius of his Rambler He said Goldsmith had owned he had borrowed it from thence one hundred thirty seven Sir continued he there is all the difference in the world between characters of nature and characters of manners and there is the difference between the characters of Fielding and those of Richardson Characters of manners are very entertaining but they are to be understood by a more superficial observer than characters of nature where a man must dive into the recesses of the human heart It always appeared to me that he estimated the compositions of Richardson too highly and that he had an unreasonable prejudice against Fielding one hundred thirty eight In comparing those two writers he used this expression that there was as great a difference between them as between a man who knew how a watch was made and a man who could tell the hour by looking on the dial plate one hundred thirty nine This was a short and figurative state of his distinction between drawing characters of nature and characters only of manners But I cannot help being of opinion that the neat watches of Fielding are as well constructed as the large clocks of Richardson and that his dial plates are brighter Fielding s characters though they do not expand themselves so widely in dissertation are as just pictures of human nature and I will venture to say have more striking features and nicer touches of the pencil and though Johnson used to quote with approbation a saying of Richardson s that the virtues of Fielding s heroes were the vices of a truly good man I will venture to add that the moral tendency of Fielding s writings though it does not encourage a strained and rarely possible virtue is ever favourable to honour and honesty and cherishes the benevolent and generous affections He who is as good as Fielding would make him is an amiable member of society and may be led on by more regulated instructors to a higher state of ethical perfection Johnson proceeded Even Sir Francis Wronghead is a character of manners though drawn with great humour He then repeated very happily all Sir Francis s credulous account to Manly of his being with the great man and securing a place one hundred forty I asked him if The Suspicious Husband one hundred forty one did not furnish a well drawn character that of Ranger JOHNSON No Sir Ranger is just a rake a mere rake one hundred forty two and a lively young fellow but no character The great Douglas Cause one hundred forty three was at this time a very general subject of discussion I found he had not studied it with much attention but had only heard parts of it occasionally He however talked of it and said I am of opinion that positive proof of fraud should not be required of the plaintiff but that the Judges should decide according as probability shall appear to preponderate granting to the defendant the presumption of filiation to be strong in his favour And I think too that a good deal of weight should be allowed to the dying declarations because they were spontaneous There is a great difference between what is said without our being urged to it and what is said from a kind of compulsion If I praise a man s book without being asked my opinion of it that is honest praise to which one may trust But if an authour asks me if I like his book and I give him something like praise it must not be taken as my real opinion I have not been troubled for a long time with authours desiring my opinion of their works one hundred forty four I used once to be sadly plagued with a man who wrote verses but who literally had no other notion of a verse but that it consisted of ten syllables Lay your knife and your fork across your plate was to him a verse Lay your knife and your fork across your plate As he wrote a great number of verses he sometimes by chance made good ones though he did not know it He renewed his promise of coming to Scotland and going with me to the Hebrides but said he would now content himself with seeing one or two of the most curious of them He said Macaulay one hundred forty five who writes the account of saint Kilda set out with a prejudice against prejudices and wanted to be a smart modern thinker and yet he affirms for a truth that when a ship arrives there all the inhabitants are seized with a cold one hundred forty six doctor John Campbell one hundred forty seven the celebrated writer took a great deal of pains to ascertain this fact and attempted to account for it on physical principles from the effect of effluvia from human bodies Johnson at another time one hundred forty eight praised Macaulay for his magnanimity in asserting this wonderful story because it was well attested A Lady of Norfolk by a letter to my friend doctor Burney has favoured me with the following solution Now for the explication of this seeming mystery which is so very obvious as for that reason to have escaped the penetration of doctor Johnson and his friend as well as that of the authour Reading the book with my ingenious friend the late Reverend mister Christian of Docking after ruminating a little The cause says he is a natural one The situation of saint Kilda renders a North East Wind indispensably necessary before a stranger can land one hundred forty nine The wind not the stranger occasions an epidemic cold If I am not mistaken mister Macaulay is dead if living this solution might please him as I hope it will mister Boswell in return for the many agreeable hours his works have afforded us Johnson expatiated on the advantages of Oxford for learning one hundred fifty There is here Sir said he such a progressive emulation The students are anxious to appear well to their tutors the tutors are anxious to have their pupils appear well in the college the colleges are anxious to have their students appear well in the University and there are excellent rules of discipline in every college That the rules are sometimes ill observed may be true but is nothing against the system The members of an University may for a season be unmindful of their duty I am arguing for the excellency of the institution one hundred fifty one Of Guthrie one hundred fifty two he said Sir he is a man of parts He has no great regular fund of knowledge but by reading so long and writing so long he no doubt has picked up a good deal He said he had lately been a long while at Lichfield but had grown very weary before he left it BOSWELL I wonder at that Sir it is your native place JOHNSON Why so is Scotland your native place His prejudice against Scotland appeared remarkably strong at this time When I talked of our advancement in literature one hundred fifty three Sir said he you have learnt a little from us and you think yourselves very great men Hume would never have written History had not Voltaire written it before him one hundred fifty four He is an echo of Voltaire BOSWELL But Sir we have Lord Kames one hundred fifty five JOHNSON You have Lord Kames Keep him ha ha ha We don t envy you him Do you ever see doctor Robertson BOSWELL Yes Sir JOHNSON Does the dog talk of me BOSWELL Indeed Sir he does and loves you Thinking that I now had him in a corner and being solicitous for the literary fame of my country I pressed him for his opinion on the merit of doctor Robertson s History of Scotland But to my surprize he escaped Sir I love Robertson and I won t talk of his book one hundred fifty six It is but justice both to him and doctor Robertson to add that though he indulged himself in this sally of wit he had too good taste not to be fully sensible of the merits of that admirable work An essay written by mister Deane a divine of the Church of England maintaining the future life of brutes by an explication of certain parts of the scriptures one hundred fifty seven was mentioned and the doctrine insisted on by a gentleman who seemed fond of curious speculation Johnson who did not like to hear of any thing concerning a future state which was not authorised by the regular canons of orthodoxy discouraged this talk and being offended at its continuation he watched an opportunity to give the gentleman a blow of reprehension So when the poor speculatist with a serious metaphysical pensive face addressed him But really Sir when we see a very sensible dog we don t know what to think of him Johnson rolling with joy at the thought which beamed in his eye turned quickly round and replied True Sir and when we see a very foolish fellow we don t know what to think of him He then rose up strided to the fire and stood for some time laughing and exulting I told him that I had several times when in Italy seen the experiment of placing a scorpion within a circle of burning coals that it ran round and round in extreme pain and finding no way to escape retired to the centre and like a true Stoick philosopher darted its sting into its head and thus at once freed itself from its woes This must end em one hundred fifty eight I said this was a curious fact as it shewed deliberate suicide in a reptile Johnson would not admit the fact He said Maupertuis one hundred fifty nine was of opinion that it does not kill itself but dies of the heat that it gets to the centre of the circle as the coolest place that its turning its tail in upon its head is merely a convulsion and that it does not sting itself He said he would be satisfied if the great anatomist Morgagni after dissecting a scorpion on which the experiment had been tried should certify that its sting had penetrated into its head He seemed pleased to talk of natural philosophy That woodcocks said he fly over to the northern countries is proved because they have been observed at sea Swallows certainly sleep all the winter A number of them conglobulate together one hundred sixty by flying round and round and then all in a heap throw themselves under water and lye in the bed of a river one hundred sixty one He told us one of his first essays was a Latin poem upon the glow worm I am sorry I did not ask where it was to be found Talking of the Russians and the Chinese he advised me to read Bell s travels one hundred sixty two I asked him whether I should read Du Halde s account of China one hundred sixty three Why yes said he as one reads such a book that is to say consult it He talked of the heinousness of the crime of adultery by which the peace of families was destroyed He said Confusion of progeny constitutes the essence of the crime and therefore a woman who breaks her marriage vows is much more criminal than a man who does it one hundred sixty four A man to be sure is criminal in the sight of God but he does not do his wife a very material injury if he does not insult her if for instance from mere wantonness of appetite he steals privately to her chambermaid Sir a wife ought not greatly to resent this I would not receive home a daughter who had run away from her husband on that account A wife should study to reclaim her husband by more attention to please him Sir a man will not once in a hundred instances leave his wife and go to a harlot if his wife has not been negligent of pleasing Here he discovered that acute discrimination that solid judgement and that knowledge of human nature for which he was upon all occasions remarkable Taking care to keep in view then moral and religious duty as understood in our nation he shewed clearly from reason and good sense the greater degree of culpability in the one sex deviating from it than the other and at the same time inculcated a very useful lesson as to the way to keep him I asked him if it was not hard that one deviation from chastity should so absolutely ruin a young woman JOHNSON Why no Sir it is the great principle which she is taught When she has given up that principle she has given up every notion of female honour and virtue which are all included in chastity A gentleman one hundred sixty five talked to him of a lady whom he greatly admired and wished to marry but was afraid of her superiority of talents Sir said he you need not be afraid marry her Before a year goes about you ll find that reason much weaker and that wit not so bright Yet the gentleman may be justified in his apprehension by one of doctor Johnson s admirable sentences in his life of Waller He doubtless praised many one hundred sixty six whom he would have been afraid to marry and perhaps married one whom he would have been ashamed to praise Many qualities contribute to domestic happiness upon which poetry has no colours to bestow and many airs and sallies may delight imagination which he who flatters them never can approve He praised Signor Baretti His account of Italy is a very entertaining book one hundred sixty seven and Sir I know no man who carries his head higher in conversation than Baretti one hundred sixty eight There are strong powers in his mind He has not indeed many hooks but with what hooks he has he grapples very forcibly At this time I observed upon the dial plate of his watch one hundred sixty nine a short Greek inscription taken from the New Testament Nux gar erchetai one hundred seventy being the first words of our SAVIOUR S solemn admonition to the improvement of that time which is allowed us to prepare for eternity the night cometh when no man can work He sometime afterwards laid aside this dial plate and when I asked him the reason he said It might do very well upon a clock which a man keeps in his closet but to have it upon his watch which he carries about with him and which is often looked at by others might be censured as ostentatious mister Steevens is now possessed of the dial plate inscribed as above He remained at Oxford a considerable time one hundred seventy one I was obliged to go to London where I received his letter which had been returned from Scotland TO JAMES BOSWELL esquire MY DEAR BOSWELL I have omitted a long time to write to you without knowing very well why I could now tell why I should not write for who would write to men who publish the letters of their friends without their leave one hundred seventy two Yet I write to you in spite of my caution to tell you that I shall be glad to see you and that I wish you would empty your head of Corsica which I think has filled it rather too long But at all events I shall be glad very glad to see you I am Sir Yours affectionately SAM JOHNSON Oxford March twenty three seventeen sixty eight I answered thus TO mister SAMUEL JOHNSON London twenty sixth April seventeen sixty eight one hundred seventy three MY DEAR SIR I have received your last letter which though very short and by no means complimentary yet gave me real pleasure because it contains these words I shall be glad very glad to see you Surely you have no reason to complain of my publishing a single paragraph of one of your letters the temptation to it was so strong An irrevocable grant of your friendship and your dignifying my desire of visiting Corsica with the epithet of a wise and noble curiosity are to me more valuable than many of the grants of kings But how can you bid me empty my head of Corsica one hundred seventy four My noble minded friend do you not feel for an oppressed nation bravely struggling to be free Consider fairly what is the case The Corsicans never received any kindness from the Genoese one hundred seventy five They never agreed to be subject to them They owe them nothing and when reduced to an abject state of slavery by force shall they not rise in the great cause of liberty and break the galling yoke And shall not every liberal soul be warm for them Empty my head of Corsica Empty it of honour empty it of humanity empty it of friendship empty it of piety No while I live Corsica and the cause of the brave islanders shall ever employ much of my attention shall ever interest me in the sincerest manner I am c JAMES BOSWELL Upon his arrival in London in May he surprized me one morning with a visit at my lodgings in Half Moon street one hundred seventy six was quite satisfied with my explanation and was in the kindest and most agreeable frame of mind As he had objected to a part of one of his letters being published I thought it right to take this opportunity of asking him explicitly whether it would be improper to publish his letters after his death His answer was Nay Sir when I am dead you may do as you will one hundred seventy seven He talked in his usual style with a rough contempt of popular liberty one hundred seventy eight They make a rout about universal liberty without considering that all that is to be valued or indeed can be enjoyed by individuals is private liberty Political liberty is good only so far as it produces private liberty Now Sir there is the liberty of the press which you know is a constant topick one hundred seventy nine Suppose you and I and two hundred more were restrained from printing our thoughts what then What proportion would that restraint upon us bear to the private happiness of the nation one hundred eighty This mode of representing the inconveniences of restraint as light and insignificant was a kind of sophistry in which he delighted to indulge himself in opposition to the extreme laxity for which it has been fashionable for too many to argue when it is evident upon reflection that the very essence of government is restraint and certain it is that as government produces rational happiness too much restraint is better than too little But when restraint is unnecessary and so close as to gall those who are subject to it the people may and ought to remonstrate and if relief is not granted to resist Of this manly and spirited principle no man was more convinced than Johnson himself one hundred eighty one About this time doctor Kenrick one hundred eighty two attacked him through my sides in a pamphlet entitled An Epistle to James Boswell esquire occasioned by his having transmitted the moral Writings of doctor Samuel Johnson to Pascal Paoli General of the Corsicans one hundred eighty three I was at first inclined to answer this pamphlet but Johnson who knew that my doing so would only gratify Kenrick by keeping alive what would soon die away of itself would not suffer me to take any notice of it one hundred eighty four His sincere regard for Francis Barber his faithful negro servant made him so desirous of his further improvement that he now placed him at a school at Bishop Stortford in Hertfordshire This humane attention does Johnson s heart much honour Out of many letters which mister Barber received from his master he has preserved three which he kindly gave me and which I shall insert according to their dates To mister FRANCIS BARBER DEAR FRANCIS I have been very much out of order I am glad to hear that you are well and design to come soon to see you I would have you stay at missus Clapp s for the present till I can determine what we shall do Be a good boy one hundred eighty five My compliments to missus Clapp and to mister Fowler I am Your s affectionately SAM JOHNSON May twenty eight seventeen sixty eight Soon afterwards he supped at the Crown and Anchor tavern in the Strand with a company whom I collected to meet him They were doctor Percy now Bishop of Dromore doctor Douglas now Bishop of Salisbury mister Langton doctor Robertson the Historian one hundred eighty six doctor Hugh Blair and mister Thomas Davies who wished much to be introduced to these eminent Scotch literati but on the present occasion he had very little opportunity of hearing them talk for with an excess of prudence for which Johnson afterwards found fault with them they hardly opened their lips and that only to say something which they were certain would not expose them to the sword of Goliath such was their anxiety for their fame when in the presence of Johnson one hundred eighty seven He was this evening in remarkable vigour of mind and eager to exert himself in conversation which he did with great readiness and fluency but I am sorry to find that I have preserved but a small part of what passed He allowed high praise to Thomson as a poet one hundred eighty eight but when one of the company said he was also a very good man our moralist contested this with great warmth accusing him of gross sensuality and licentiousness of manners I was very much afraid that in writing Thomson s Life doctor Johnson would have treated his private character with a stern severity but I was agreeably disappointed and I may claim a little merit in it from my having been at pains to send him authentick accounts of the affectionate and generous conduct of that poet to his sisters one of whom the wife of mister Thomson schoolmaster at Lanark I knew and was presented by her with three of his letters one of which doctor Johnson has inserted in his Life one hundred eighty nine He was vehement against old doctor Mounsey of Chelsea College one hundred ninety as a fellow who swore and talked bawdy I have been often in his company said doctor Percy and never heard him swear or talk bawdy mister Davies who sat next to doctor Percy having after this had some conversation aside with him made a discovery which in his zeal to pay court to doctor Johnson he eagerly proclaimed aloud from the foot of the table O Sir I have found out a very good reason why doctor Percy never heard Mounsey swear or talk bawdy for he tells me he never saw him but at the Duke of Northumberland s table And so Sir said Johnson loudly to doctor Percy you would shield this man from the charge of swearing and talking bawdy because he did not do so at the Duke of Northumberland s table Sir you might as well tell us that you had seen him hold up his hand at the Old Bailey and he neither swore nor talked bawdy or that you had seen him in the cart at Tyburn and he neither swore nor talked bawdy And is it thus Sir that you presume to controvert what I have related doctor Johnson s animadversion was uttered in such a manner that doctor Percy seemed to be displeased and soon afterwards left the company of which Johnson did not at that time take any notice Swift having been mentioned Johnson as usual treated him with little respect as an authour one hundred ninety one Some of us endeavoured to support the Dean of saint Patrick s by various arguments One in particular praised his Conduct of the Allies JOHNSON Sir his Conduct of the Allies is a performance of very little ability Surely Sir said doctor Douglas you must allow it has strong facts one hundred ninety two JOHNSON Why yes Sir but what is that to the merit of the composition In the Sessions paper of the Old Bailey there are strong facts Housebreaking is a strong fact robbery is a strong fact and murder is a mighty strong fact but is great praise due to the historian of those strong facts No Sir Swift has told what he had to tell distinctly enough but that is all He had to count ten and he has counted it right one hundred ninety three Then recollecting that mister Davies by acting as an informer had been the occasion of his talking somewhat too harshly to his friend one hundred ninety four doctor Percy for which probably when the first ebullition was over he felt some compunction he took an opportunity to give him a hit so added with a preparatory laugh Why Sir Tom Davies might have written The Conduct of the Allies Poor Tom being thus suddenly dragged into ludicrous notice in presence of the Scottish Doctors to whom he was ambitious of appearing to advantage was grievously mortified Nor did his punishment rest here for upon subsequent occasions whenever he statesman all over one hundred ninety five assumed a strutting importance I used to hail him the Authour of The Conduct of the Allies When I called upon doctor Johnson next morning I found him highly satisfied with his colloquial prowess the preceding evening Well said he we had good talk one hundred ninety six BOSWELL Yes Sir you tossed and gored several persons one hundred ninety seven The late Alexander Earl of Eglintoune one hundred ninety eight who loved wit more than wine and men of genius more than sycophants had a great admiration of Johnson but from the remarkable elegance of his own manners was perhaps too delicately sensible of the roughness which sometimes appeared in Johnson s behaviour One evening about this time when his Lordship did me the honour to sup at my lodgings with doctor Robertson and several other men of literary distinction he regretted that Johnson had not been educated with more refinement and lived more in polished society No no my Lord said Signor Baretti do with him what you would he would always have been a bear True answered the Earl with a smile but he would have been a dancing bear To obviate all the reflections which have gone round the world to Johnson s prejudice by applying to him the epithet of a bear one hundred ninety nine let me impress upon my readers a just and happy saying of my friend Goldsmith who knew him well Johnson to be sure has a roughness in his manner but no man alive has a more tender heart He has nothing of the bear but his skin seventeen sixty nine AETAT sixty In seventeen sixty nine so far as I can discover the publick was favoured with nothing of Johnson s composition either for himself or any of his friends two hundred His Meditations two hundred one too strongly prove that he suffered much both in body and mind yet was he perpetually striving against evil and nobly endeavouring to advance his intellectual and devotional improvement Every generous and grateful heart must feel for the distresses of so eminent a benefactor to mankind and now that his unhappiness is certainly known must respect that dignity of character which prevented him from complaining His Majesty having the preceding year instituted the Royal Academy of Arts in London Johnson had now the honour of being appointed Professor in Ancient Literature two hundred two In the course of the year he wrote some letters to missus Thrale passed some part of the summer at Oxford and at Lichfield and when at Oxford wrote the following letter To THE REVEREND mister THOMAS WARTON DEAR SIR Many years ago when I used to read in the library of your College I promised to recompence the College for that permission by adding to their books a Baskerville s Virgil I have now sent it and desire you to reposit it on the shelves in my name two hundred three If you will be pleased to let me know when you have an hour of leisure I will drink tea with you I am engaged for the afternoon to morrow and on Friday all my mornings are my own two hundred four I am c SAM JOHNSON May thirty one seventeen sixty nine I came to London in the autumn and having informed him that I was going to be married in a few months I wished to have as much of his conversation as I could before engaging in a state of life which would probably keep me more in Scotland and prevent me seeing him so often as when I was a single man but I found he was at Brighthelmstone with mister and missus Thrale I was very sorry that I had not his company with me at the Jubilee in honour of Shakspeare at Stratford upon Avon the great poet s native town two hundred five Johnson s connection both with Shakspeare and Garrick founded a double claim to his presence and it would have been highly gratifying to mister Garrick Upon this occasion I particularly lamented that he had not that warmth of friendship for his brilliant pupil which we may suppose would have had a benignant effect on both two hundred six When almost every man of eminence in the literary world was happy to partake in this festival of genius the absence of Johnson could not but be wondered at and regretted The only trace of him there was in the whimsical advertisement of a haberdasher who sold Shakspearian ribbands of various dyes and by way of illustrating their appropriation to the bard introduced a line from the celebrated Prologue two hundred seven at the opening of Drury lane theatre Each change of many colour d life he drew From Brighthelmstone doctor Johnson wrote me the following letter which they who may think that I ought to have suppressed must have less ardent feelings than I have always avowed two hundred eight To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR Why do you charge me with unkindness I have omitted nothing that could do you good or give you pleasure unless it be that I have forborne to tell you my opinion of your Account of Corsica I believe my opinion if you think well of my judgement might have given you pleasure but when it is considered how much vanity is excited by praise I am not sure that it would have done you good Your History is like other histories but your Journal is in a very high degree curious and delightful There is between the History and the Journal that difference which there will always be found between notions borrowed from without and notions generated within Your History was copied from books your Journal rose out of your own experience and observation You express images which operated strongly upon yourself and you have impressed them with great force upon your readers I know not whether I could name any narrative by which curiosity is better excited or better gratified I am glad that you are going to be married and as I wish you well in things of less importance wish you well with proportionate ardour in this crisis of your life What I can contribute to your happiness I should be very unwilling to with hold for I have always loved and valued you and shall love you and value you still more as you become more regular and useful effects which a happy marriage will hardly fail to produce I do not find that I am likely to come back very soon from this place I shall perhaps stay a fortnight longer and a fortnight is a long time to a lover absent from his mistress Would a fortnight ever have an end I am dear Sir Your most affectionate humble servant SAM JOHNSON Brighthelmstone Sept nine seventeen sixty nine After his return to town we met frequently and I continued the practice of making notes of his conversation though not with so much assiduity as I wish I had done At this time indeed I had a sufficient excuse for not being able to appropriate so much time to my Journal for General Paoli two hundred nine after Corsica had been overpowered by the monarchy of France was now no longer at the head of his brave countrymen but having with difficulty escaped from his native island had sought an asylum in Great Britain and it was my duty as well as my pleasure to attend much upon him two hundred ten Such particulars of Johnson s conversation at this period as I have committed to writing I shall here introduce without any strict attention to methodical arrangement Sometimes short notes of different days shall be blended together and sometimes a day may seem important enough to be separately distinguished He said he would not have Sunday kept with rigid severity and gloom but with a gravity and simplicity of behaviour two hundred eleven I told him that David Hume had made a short collection of Scotticisms two hundred twelve I wonder said Johnson that he should find them He would not admit the importance of the question concerning the legality of general warrants two hundred thirteen Such a power he observed must be vested in every government to answer particular cases of necessity and there can be no just complaint but when it is abused for which those who administer government must be answerable It is a matter of such indifference a matter about which the people care so very little that were a man to be sent over Britain to offer them an exemption from it at a halfpenny a piece very few would purchase it This was a specimen of that laxity of talking which I have heard him fairly acknowledge two hundred fourteen for surely while the power of granting general warrants was supposed to be legal and the apprehension of them hung over our heads we did not possess that security of freedom congenial to our happy constitution and which by the intrepid exertions of mister Wilkes has been happily established He said The duration of Parliament whether for seven years or the life of the King appears to me so immaterial that I would not give half a crown to turn the scale one way or the other two hundred fifteen The habeas corpus is the single advantage which our government has over that of other countries On the thirtieth of September we dined together at the Mitre I attempted to argue for the superior happiness of the savage life upon the usual fanciful topicks JOHNSON Sir there can be nothing more false The savages have no bodily advantages beyond those of civilised men They have not better health and as to care or mental uneasiness they are not above it but below it like bears No Sir you are not to talk such paradox two hundred sixteen let me have no more on t It cannot entertain far less can it instruct Lord Monboddo two hundred seventeen one of your Scotch Judges talked a great deal of such nonsense I suffered him but I will not suffer you BOSWELL But Sir does not Rousseau talk such nonsense JOHNSON True Sir but Rousseau knows he is talking nonsense and laughs at the world for staring at him BOSWELL How so Sir JOHNSON Why Sir a man who talks nonsense so well must know that he is talking nonsense But I am afraid chuckling and laughing Monboddo does not know that he is talking nonsense two hundred eighteen BOSWELL Is it wrong then Sir to affect singularity in order to make people stare JOHNSON Yes if you do it by propagating errour and indeed it is wrong in any way There is in human nature a general inclination to make people stare and every wise man has himself to cure of it and does cure himself two hundred nineteen If you wish to make people stare by doing better than others why make them stare till they stare their eyes out But consider how easy it is to make people stare by being absurd I may do it by going into a drawing room without my shoes You remember the gentleman in The Spectator who had a commission of lunacy taken out against him for his extreme singularity such as never wearing a wig but a night cap Now Sir abstractedly the night cap was best but relatively the advantage was overbalanced by his making the boys run after him two hundred twenty Talking of a London life he said The happiness of London is not to be conceived but by those who have been in it I will venture to say there is more learning and science within the circumference of ten miles from where we now sit than in all the rest of the kingdom BOSWELL The only disadvantage is the great distance at which people live from one another JOHNSON Yes Sir but that is occasioned by the largeness of it which is the cause of all the other advantages BOSWELL Sometimes I have been in the humour of wishing to retire to a desart JOHNSON Sir you have desart enough in Scotland Although I had promised myself a great deal of instructive conversation with him on the conduct of the married state of which I had then a near prospect he did not say much upon that topick mister Seward two hundred twenty one heard him once say that a man has a very bad chance for happiness in that state unless he marries a woman of very strong and fixed principles of religion He maintained to me contrary to the common notion that a woman would not be the worse wife for being learned two hundred twenty two in which from all that I have observed of Artemisias two hundred twenty three I humbly differed from him That a woman should be sensible and well informed I allow to be a great advantage and think that Sir Thomas Overbury two hundred twenty four in his rude versification has very judiciously pointed out that degree of intelligence which is to be desired in a female companion Give me next good an understanding wife By Nature wise not learned by much art Some knowledge on her side will all my life More scope of conversation impart Besides her inborne virtue fortifie They are most firmly good who two hundred twenty five best know why When I censured a gentleman of my acquaintance for marrying a second time as it shewed a disregard of his first wife he said Not at all Sir On the contrary were he not to marry again it might be concluded that his first wife had given him a disgust to marriage but by taking a second wife he pays the highest compliment to the first by shewing that she made him so happy as a married man that he wishes to be so a second time two hundred twenty six So ingenious a turn did he give to this delicate question And yet on another occasion he owned that he once had almost asked a promise of missus Johnson that she would not marry again but had checked himself Indeed I cannot help thinking that in his case the request would have been unreasonable for if missus Johnson forgot or thought it no injury to the memory of her first love the husband of her youth and the father of her children to make a second marriage why should she be precluded from a third should she be so inclined In Johnson s persevering fond appropriation of his Tetty even after her decease he seems totally to have overlooked the prior claim of the honest Birmingham trader I presume that her having been married before had at times given him some uneasiness for I remember his observing upon the marriage of one of our common friends He has done a very foolish thing Sir he has married a widow when he might have had a maid two hundred twenty seven We drank tea with missus Williams I had last year the pleasure of seeing missus Thrale at doctor Johnson s one morning and had conversation enough with her to admire her talents and to shew her that I was as Johnsonian as herself doctor Johnson had probably been kind enough to speak well of me for this evening he delivered me a very polite card from mister Thrale and her inviting me to Streatham On the sixth of October I complied with this obliging invitation and found at an elegant villa six miles from town every circumstance that can make society pleasing Johnson though quite at home was yet looked up to with an awe tempered by affection and seemed to be equally the care of his host and hostess I rejoiced at seeing him so happy He played off his wit against Scotland with a good humoured pleasantry which gave me though no bigot to national prejudices an opportunity for a little contest with him I having said that England was obliged to us for gardeners almost all their good gardeners being Scotchmen JOHNSON Why Sir that is because gardening is much more necessary amongst you than with us which makes so many of your people learn it It is all gardening with you Things which grow wild here must be cultivated with great care in Scotland Pray now throwing himself back in his chair and laughing are you ever able to bring the sloe to perfection I boasted that we had the honour of being the first to abolish the unhospitable troublesome and ungracious custom of giving vails to servants two hundred twenty eight JOHNSON Sir you abolished vails because you were too poor to be able to give them missus Thrale disputed with him on the merit of Prior He attacked him powerfully said he wrote of love like a man who had never felt it his love verses were college verses and he repeated the song Alexis shunn d his fellow swains two hundred twenty nine c in so ludicrous a manner as to make us all wonder how any one could have been pleased with such fantastical stuff missus Thrale stood to her gun with great courage in defence of amorous ditties which Johnson despised till he at last silenced her by saying My dear Lady talk no more of this Nonsense can be defended but by nonsense two hundred thirty missus Thrale then praised Garrick s talent for light gay poetry and as a specimen repeated his song in Florizel and Perdita and dwelt with peculiar pleasure on this line I d smile with the simple and feed with the poor two hundred thirty one JOHNSON Nay my dear Lady this will never do Poor David Smile with the simple What folly is that And who would feed with the poor that can help it No no let me smile with the wise and feed with the rich I repeated this sally to Garrick and wondered to find his sensibility as a writer not a little irritated by it To sooth him I observed that Johnson spared none of us and I quoted the passage in Horace two hundred thirty two in which he compares one who attacks his friends for the sake of a laugh to a pushing ox two hundred thirty three that is marked by a bunch of hay put upon his horns faenum habet in cornu Ay said Garrick vehemently he has a whole mow of it Talking of history Johnson said We may know historical facts to be true as we may know facts in common life to be true Motives are generally unknown We cannot trust to the characters we find in history unless when they are drawn by those who knew the persons as those for instance by Sallust and by Lord Clarendon two hundred thirty four He would not allow much merit to Whitefield s oratory His popularity Sir said he is chiefly owing to the peculiarity of his manner He would be followed by crowds were he to wear a night cap in the pulpit or were he to preach from a tree two hundred thirty five I know not from what spirit of contradiction he burst out into a violent declamation against the Corsicans of whose heroism I talked in high terms Sir said he what is all this rout about the Corsicans They have been at war with the Genoese for upwards of twenty years and have never yet taken their fortified towns They might have battered down their walls and reduced them to powder in twenty years They might have pulled the walls in pieces and cracked the stones with their teeth in twenty years It was in vain to argue with him upon the want of artillery he was not to be resisted for the moment On the evening of October ten I presented doctor Johnson to General Paoli I had greatly wished that two men for whom I had the highest esteem should meet two hundred thirty six They met with a manly ease mutually conscious of their own abilities and of the abilities of each other The General spoke Italian and doctor Johnson English and understood one another very well with a little aid of interpretation from me in which I compared myself to an isthmus which joins two great continents Upon Johnson s approach the General said From what I have read of your works Sir and from what mister Boswell has told me of you I have long held you in great veneration The General talked of languages being formed on the particular notions and manners of a people without knowing which we cannot know the language We may know the direct signification of single words but by these no beauty of expression no sally of genius no wit is conveyed to the mind All this must be by allusion to other ideas Sir said Johnson you talk of language as if you had never done any thing else but study it instead of governing a nation The General said Questo e un troppo gran complimento this is too great a compliment Johnson answered I should have thought so Sir if I had not heard you talk The General asked him what he thought of the spirit of infidelity which was so prevalent two hundred thirty seven JOHNSON Sir this gloom of infidelity I hope is only a transient cloud passing through the hemisphere two hundred thirty eight which will soon be dissipated and the sun break forth with his usual splendour You think then said the General that they will change their principles like their clothes JOHNSON Why Sir if they bestow no more thought on principles than on dress it must be so The General said that a great part of the fashionable infidelity was owing to a desire of shewing courage Men who have no opportunities of shewing it as to things in this life take death and futurity as objects on which to display it JOHNSON That is mighty foolish affectation Fear is one of the passions of human nature of which it is impossible to divest it You remember that the Emperour Charles V when he read upon the tomb stone of a Spanish nobleman Here lies one who never knew fear wittily said Then he never snuffed a candle with his fingers He talked a few words of French two hundred thirty nine to the General but finding he did not do it with facility he asked for pen ink and paper and wrote the following note J ai lu dans la geographie de Lucas de Linda un Pater noster ecrit dans une langue tout a fait differente de l Italienne et de toutes autres lesquelles se derivent du Latin L auteur l appelle linguam Corsicae rusticam elle a peut etre passe peu a peu mais elle a certainement prevalue autrefois dans les montagnes et dans la campagne Le meme auteur dit la meme chose en parlant de Sardaigne qu il y a deux langues dans l Isle une des villes l autre de la campagne The General immediately informed him that the lingua rustica was only in Sardinia doctor Johnson went home with me and drank tea till late in the night He said General Paoli had the loftiest port of any man he had ever seen two hundred forty He denied that military men were always the best bred men Perfect good breeding he observed consists in having no particular mark of any profession but a general elegance of manners whereas in a military man you can commonly distinguish the brand of a soldier l homme d epee doctor Johnson shunned to night any discussion of the perplexed question of fate and free will which I attempted to agitate Sir said he we know our will is free and there s an end on t two hundred forty one He honoured me with his company at dinner on the sixteenth of October at my lodgings in Old Bond street with Sir Joshua Reynolds mister Garrick doctor Goldsmith mister Murphy mister Bickerstaff two hundred forty two and mister Thomas Davies Garrick played round him with a fond vivacity taking hold of the breasts of his coat and looking up in his face with a lively archness complimented him on the good health which he seemed then to enjoy while the sage shaking his head beheld him with a gentle complacency One of the company not being come at the appointed hour I proposed as usual upon such occasions to order dinner to be served adding Ought six people to be kept waiting for one Why yes answered Johnson with a delicate humanity if the one will suffer more by your sitting down than the six will do by waiting Goldsmith to divert the tedious minutes strutted about bragging of his dress and I believe was seriously vain of it for his mind was wonderfully prone to such impressions two hundred forty three Come come said Garrick talk no more of that You are perhaps the worst eh eh Goldsmith was eagerly attempting to interrupt him when Garrick went on laughing ironically Nay you will always look like a gentleman two hundred forty four but I am talking of being well or ill drest Well let me tell you said Goldsmith when my tailor brought home my bloom coloured coat he said Sir I have a favour to beg of you When any body asks you who made your clothes be pleased to mention John Filby at the Harrow in Water lane JOHNSON Why Sir that was because he knew the strange colour would attract crowds to gaze at it and thus they might hear of him and see how well he could make a coat even of so absurd a colour two hundred forty five After dinner our conversation first turned upon Pope Johnson said his characters of men were admirably drawn those of women not so well two hundred forty six He repeated to us in his forcible melodious manner the concluding lines of the Dunciad two hundred forty seven While he was talking loudly in praise of those lines one of the company two hundred forty eight ventured to say Too fine for such a poem a poem on what JOHNSON with a disdainful look Why on dunces It was worth while being a dunce then Ah Sir hadst thou lived in those days It is not worth while being a dunce now when there are no wits two hundred forty nine Bickerstaff observed as a peculiar circumstance that Pope s fame was higher when he was alive than it was then two hundred fifty Johnson said his Pastorals were poor things though the versification was fine two hundred fifty one He told us with high satisfaction the anecdote of Pope s inquiring who was the authour of his London and saying he will be soon deterre two hundred fifty two He observed that in Dryden s poetry there were passages drawn from a profundity which Pope could never reach two hundred fifty three He repeated some fine lines on love by the former which I have now forgotten two hundred fifty four and gave great applause to the character of Zimri two hundred fifty five Goldsmith said that Pope s character of Addison two hundred fifty six shewed a deep knowledge of the human heart Johnson said that the description of the temple in the Mourning Bride two hundred fifty seven was the finest poetical passage he had ever read he recollected none in Shakspeare equal to it But said Garrick all alarmed for the God of his idolatry two hundred fifty eight we know not the extent and variety of his powers We are to suppose there are such passages in his works Shakspeare must not suffer from the badness of our memories Johnson diverted by this enthusiastick jealousy went on with greater ardour No Sir Congreve has nature smiling on the tragick eagerness of Garrick but composing himself he added Sir this is not comparing Congreve on the whole with Shakspeare on the whole but only maintaining that Congreve has one finer passage than any that can be found in Shakspeare Sir a man may have no more than ten guineas in the world but he may have those ten guineas in one piece and so may have a finer piece than a man who has ten thousand pounds but then he has only one ten guinea piece What I mean is that you can shew me no passage where there is simply a description of material objects without any intermixture of moral notions which produces such an effect two hundred fifty nine mister Murphy mentioned Shakspeare s description of the night before the battle of Agincourt two hundred sixty but it was observed it had men in it mister Davies suggested the speech of Juliet in which she figures herself awaking in the tomb of her ancestors two hundred sixty one Some one mentioned the description of Dover Cliff two hundred sixty two JOHNSON No Sir it should be all precipice all vacuum The crows impede your fall The diminished appearance of the boats and other circumstances are all very good description but do not impress the mind at once with the horrible idea of immense height The impression is divided you pass on by computation from one stage of the tremendous space to another Had the girl in The Mourning Bride said she could not cast her shoe to the top of one of the pillars in the temple it would not have aided the idea but weakened it Talking of a Barrister who had a bad utterance some one to rouse Johnson wickedly said that he was unfortunate in not having been taught oratory by Sheridan two hundred sixty three JOHNSON Nay Sir if he had been taught by Sheridan he would have cleared the room GARRICK Sheridan has too much vanity to be a good man We shall now see Johnson s mode of defending a man taking him into his own hands and discriminating JOHNSON No Sir There is to be sure in Sheridan something to reprehend and every thing to laugh at but Sir he is not a bad man No Sir were mankind to be divided into good and bad he would stand considerably within the ranks of good And Sir it must be allowed that Sheridan excels in plain declamation though he can exhibit no character I should perhaps have suppressed this disquisition concerning a person of whose merit and worth I think with respect had he not attacked Johnson so outrageously in his Life of Swift and at the same time treated us his admirers as a set of pigmies two hundred sixty four He who has provoked the lash of wit cannot complain that he smarts from it missus Montagu a lady distinguished for having written an Essay on Shakspeare being mentioned REYNOLDS I think that essay does her honour JOHNSON Yes Sir it does her honour but it would do nobody else honour I have indeed not read it all But when I take up the end of a web and find it packthread I do not expect by looking further to find embroidery Sir I will venture to say there is not one sentence of true criticism in her book GARRICK But Sir surely it shews how much Voltaire has mistaken Shakspeare which nobody else has done two hundred sixty five JOHNSON Sir nobody else has thought it worth while And what merit is there in that You may as well praise a schoolmaster for whipping a boy who has construed ill No Sir there is no real criticism in it none shewing the beauty of thought as formed on the workings of the human heart The admirers of this Essay two hundred sixty six may be offended at the slighting manner in which Johnson spoke of it but let it be remembered that he gave his honest opinion unbiased by any prejudice or any proud jealousy of a woman intruding herself into the chair of criticism for Sir Joshua Reynolds has told me that when the Essay first came out and it was not known who had written it Johnson wondered how Sir Joshua could like it two hundred sixty seven At this time Sir Joshua himself had received no information concerning the authour except being assured by one of our most eminent literati that it was clear its authour did not know the Greek tragedies in the original One day at Sir Joshua s table when it was related that missus Montagu in an excess of compliment to the authour of a modern tragedy had exclaimed I tremble for Shakspeare Johnson said When Shakspeare has got for his rival and missus Montagu for his defender he is in a poor state indeed Johnson proceeded The Scotchman two hundred sixty eight has taken the right method in his Elements of Criticism I do not mean that he has taught us any thing but he has told us old things in a new way MURPHY He seems to have read a great deal of French criticism and wants to make it his own as if he had been for years anatomising the heart of man and peeping into every cranny of it GOLDSMITH It is easier to write that book than to read it two hundred sixty nine JOHNSON We have an example of true criticism in Burke s Essay on the Sublime and Beautiful and if I recollect there is also Du Bos two hundred seventy and Bouhours two hundred seventy one who shews all beauty to depend on truth There is no great merit in telling how many plays have ghosts in them and how this Ghost is better than that You must shew how terrour is impressed on the human heart In the description of night in Macbeth two hundred seventy two the beetle and the bat detract from the general idea of darkness inspissated gloom Politicks being mentioned he said This petitioning is a new mode of distressing government and a mighty easy one I will undertake to get petitions either against quarter guineas or half guineas with the help of a little hot wine There must be no yielding to encourage this The object is not important enough We are not to blow up half a dozen palaces because one cottage is burning two hundred seventy three The conversation then took another turn JOHNSON It is amazing what ignorance of certain points one sometimes finds in men of eminence A wit about town who wrote Latin bawdy verses asked me how it happened that England and Scotland which were once two kingdoms were now one and Sir Fletcher Norton two hundred seventy four did not seem to know that there were such publications as the Reviews The ballad of Hardyknute two hundred seventy five has no great merit if it be really ancient People talk of nature But mere obvious nature may be exhibited with very little power of mind On Thursday October nineteen I passed the evening with him at his house He advised me to complete a Dictionary of words peculiar to Scotland of which I shewed him a specimen Sir said he Ray has made a collection of north country words two hundred seventy six By collecting those of your country you will do a useful thing towards the history of the language He bade me also go on with collections which I was making upon the antiquities of Scotland 
4894-7788-0000	train-other-500	Make a large book a folio BOSWELL
none	none	 But of what use will it be Sir JOHNSON Never mind the use do it I complained that he had not mentioned Garrick in his Preface to Shakspeare two hundred seventy seven and asked him if he did not admire him JOHNSON Yes as a poor player who frets and struts his hour upon the stage as a shadow two hundred seventy eight BOSWELL But has he not brought Shakspeare into notice two hundred seventy nine JOHNSON Sir to allow that would be to lampoon the age 
4894-7788-0001	train-other-500	Many of Shakspeare s plays are the worse for being acted
none	none	 Macbeth for instance two hundred eighty BOSWELL 
4894-7788-0002	train-other-500	What Sir is nothing gained by decoration and action
none	none	 Indeed I do wish that you had mentioned Garrick 
4894-7788-0003	train-other-500	JOHNSON My dear Sir had I mentioned him I must have mentioned many more missus Pritchard missus Cibber nay and mister Cibber too
none	none	 he too altered Shakspeare BOSWELL You have read his apology Sir JOHNSON Yes it is very entertaining But as for Cibber himself taking from his conversation all that he ought not to have said two hundred eighty one he was a poor creature I remember when he brought me one of his Odes to have my opinion of it two hundred eighty two 
4894-7788-0004	train-other-500	I could not bear such nonsense and would not let him read it to the end
none	none	 so little respect had I for that great man laughing Yet I remember Richardson wondering that I could treat him with familiarity two hundred eighty three I mentioned to him that I had seen the execution of several convicts at Tyburn two hundred eighty four two days before and that none of them seemed to be under any concern JOHNSON Most of them Sir have never thought at all 
4894-7788-0005	train-other-500	BOSWELL But is not the fear of death natural to man JOHNSON
none	none	 So much so Sir that the whole of life is but keeping away the thoughts of it two hundred eighty five 
4894-7788-0006	train-other-500	He then in a low and earnest tone talked of his meditating upon the aweful hour of his own dissolution and in what manner he should conduct himself upon that occasion I know not said he
4894-7788-0007	train-other-500	whether I should wish to have a friend by me or have it all between GOD and myself Talking of our feeling for the distresses of others JOHNSON
none	none	 Why Sir there is much noise made about it but it is greatly exaggerated No Sir we have a certain degree of feeling to prompt us to do good more than that Providence does not intend It would be misery to no purpose two hundred eighty six BOSWELL But suppose now Sir that one of your intimate friends were apprehended for an offence for which he might be hanged JOHNSON 
4894-7788-0008	train-other-500	I should do what I could to bail him and give him any other assistance but if he were once fairly hanged I should not suffer BOSWELL Would you eat your dinner that day Sir
none	none	 JOHNSON Yes Sir and eat it as if he were eating it with me Why there s Baretti who is to be tried for his life to morrow friends have risen up for him on every side yet if he should be hanged none of them will eat a slice of plumb pudding the less Sir that sympathetic feeling goes a very little way in depressing the mind two hundred eighty seven I told him that I had dined lately at Foote s who shewed me a letter which he had received from Tom Davies telling him that he had not been able to sleep from the concern which he felt on account of This sad affair of Baretti two hundred eighty eight begging of him to try if he could suggest any thing that might be of service and at the same time 
4894-7788-0009	train-other-500	recommending to him an industrious young man who kept a pickle shop JOHNSON Ay Sir here you have a specimen of human sympathy a friend hanged and a cucumber pickled
4894-7788-0010	train-other-500	We know not whether Baretti or the pickle man has kept Davies from sleep nor does he know himself And as to his not sleeping Sir Tom Davies is a very great man Tom has been upon the stage and knows how to do those things
4894-7788-0011	train-other-500	I have not been upon the stage and cannot do those things BOSWELL I have often blamed myself Sir for not feeling for others as sensibly as many say they do JOHNSON Sir don t be duped by them any more
4894-7788-0012	train-other-500	You will find these very feeling people are not very ready to do you good They pay you by feeling BOSWELL Foote has a great deal of humour JOHNSON Yes Sir BOSWELL
none	none	 He has a singular talent of exhibiting character JOHNSON Sir it is not a talent it is a vice 
4894-7788-0013	train-other-500	it is what others abstain from It is not comedy which exhibits the character of a species as that of a miser gathered from many misers it is farce which exhibits individuals BOSWELL
none	none	 Did not he think of exhibiting you Sir JOHNSON Sir fear restrained him he knew I would have broken his bones I would have saved him the trouble of cutting off a leg I would not have left him a leg to cut off two hundred eighty nine BOSWELL Pray Sir is not Foote an infidel 
4894-7788-0014	train-other-500	JOHNSON I do not know Sir that the fellow is an infidel but if he be an infidel he is an infidel as a dog is an infidel
none	none	 that is to say he has never thought upon the subject two hundred ninety BOSWELL 
4894-7788-0015	train-other-500	I suppose Sir he has thought superficially and seized the first notions which occurred to his mind JOHNSON Why then Sir still he is like a dog
none	none	 that snatches the piece next him Did you never observe that dogs have not the power of comparing A dog will take a small bit of meat as readily as a large when both are before him Buchanan he observed has fewer centos two hundred ninety one than any modern Latin poet He not only had great knowledge of the Latin language but was a great poetical genius Both the Scaligers praise him 
4894-7788-0016	train-other-500	He again talked of the passage in Congreve with high commendation and said Shakspeare never has six lines together without a fault Perhaps you may find seven but this does not refute my general assertion
4894-7788-0017	train-other-500	If I come to an orchard and say there s no fruit here and then comes a poring man
none	none	 who finds two apples and three pears and tells me Sir you are mistaken I have found both apples and pears I should laugh at him what would that be to the purpose BOSWELL What do you think of doctor Young s Night Thoughts Sir JOHNSON Why Sir there are very fine things in them two hundred ninety two BOSWELL Is there not less religion in the nation now Sir than there was formerly JOHNSON I don t know Sir that there is BOSWELL For instance there used to be a chaplain in every great family two hundred ninety three which we do not find now JOHNSON Neither do you find any of the state servants which great families used formerly to have There is a change of modes in the whole department of life Next day October twenty he appeared for the only time I suppose in his life as a witness in a Court of Justice being called to give evidence to the character of mister Baretti who having stabbed a man in the street was arraigned at the Old Bailey for murder two hundred ninety four Never did such a constellation of genius enlighten the aweful Sessions House emphatically called JUSTICE HALL mister Burke mister Garrick mister Beauclerk and doctor Johnson and undoubtedly their favourable testimony had due weight with the Court and Jury 
4894-7788-0019	train-other-500	Johnson gave his evidence in a slow deliberate and distinct manner which was uncommonly impressive It is well known that mister Baretti was acquitted On the twenty sixth of October we dined together at the Mitre tavern I found fault with Foote
4894-7788-0020	train-other-500	for indulging his talent of ridicule at the expence of his visitors which I colloquially termed making fools of his company JOHNSON Why Sir when you go to see Foote you do not go to see a saint
none	none	 you go to see a man who will be entertained at your house and then bring you on a publick stage 
4894-7788-0021	train-other-500	who will entertain you at his house for the very purpose of bringing you on a publick stage Sir he does not make fools of his company they whom he exposes are fools already he only brings them into action Talking of trade
4894-7788-0022	train-other-500	he observed It is a mistaken notion that a vast deal of money is brought into a nation by trade It is not so Commodities come from commodities but trade produces no capital accession of wealth However
4894-7788-0023	train-other-500	though there should be little profit in money there is a considerable profit in pleasure as it gives to one nation the productions of another
none	none	 as we have wines and fruits and many other foreign articles brought to us 
4894-7788-0024	train-other-500	BOSWELL Yes Sir and there is a profit in pleasure by its furnishing occupation to such numbers of mankind JOHNSON
none	none	 Why Sir you cannot call that pleasure to which all are averse and which none begin but with the hope of leaving off 
4894-7788-0025	train-other-500	a thing which men dislike before they have tried it and when they have tried it BOSWELL But Sir the mind must be employed and we grow weary when idle JOHNSON That is Sir because others being busy we want company
4894-7788-0026	train-other-500	but if we were all idle there would be no growing weary we should all entertain one another There is indeed this in trade it gives men an opportunity of improving their situation If there were no trade many who are poor would always remain poor
none	none	 But no man loves labour for itself BOSWELL Yes Sir I know a person who does He is a very laborious Judge and he loves the labour two hundred ninety five JOHNSON Sir that is because he loves respect and distinction Could he have them without labour he would like it less BOSWELL He tells me he likes it for itself Why Sir he fancies so because he is not accustomed to abstract We went home to his house to tea missus Williams made it with sufficient dexterity notwithstanding her blindness though her manner of satisfying herself that the cups were full enough appeared to me a little aukward for I fancied she put her finger down a certain way till she felt the tea touch it two hundred ninety six In my first elation at being allowed the privilege of attending doctor Johnson at his late visits to this lady which was like being e secretioribus consiliis two hundred ninety seven I willingly drank cup after cup as if it had been the Heliconian spring But as the charm of novelty went off I grew more fastidious and besides I discovered that she was of a peevish temper two hundred ninety eight There was a pretty large circle this evening doctor Johnson was in very good humour lively and ready to talk upon all subjects mister Fergusson the self taught philosopher told him of a new invented machine which went without horses a man who sat in it turned a handle which worked a spring that drove it forward Then Sir said Johnson what is gained is the man has his choice whether he will move himself alone or himself and the machine too Dominicetti two hundred ninety nine being mentioned he would not allow him any merit There is nothing in all this boasted system No Sir 
4894-7788-0027	train-other-500	medicated baths can be no better than warm water their only effect can be that of tepid moisture One of the company took the other side maintaining that medicines of various sorts and some too of most powerful effect
4894-7788-0028	train-other-500	are introduced into the human frame by the medium of the pores and therefore when warm water is impregnated with salutiferous substances it may produce great effects as a bath This appeared to me very satisfactory Johnson
4894-7788-0029	train-other-500	did not answer it but talking for victory and determined to be master of the field he had recourse to the device which Goldsmith imputed to him in the witty words of one of Cibber s comedies
none	none	 There is no arguing with Johnson for when his pistol misses fire he knocks you down with the butt end of it three hundred He turned to the gentleman Well Sir go to Dominicetti and get thyself fumigated 
4894-7788-0031	train-other-500	but be sure that the steam be directed to thy head for that is the peccant part This produced a triumphant roar of laughter from the motley assembly of philosophers printers and dependents male and female
4894-7788-0032	train-other-500	I know not how so whimsical a thought came into my mind but I asked If Sir you were shut up in a castle and a newborn child with you what would you do JOHNSON Why Sir I should not much like my company
4894-7788-0033	train-other-500	BOSWELL But would you take the trouble of rearing it
none	none	 He seemed as may well be supposed unwilling to pursue the subject 
4894-7788-0034	train-other-500	but upon my persevering in my question replied Why yes Sir I would but I must have all conveniencies If I had no garden I would make a shed on the roof and take it there for fresh air I should feed it
4894-7788-0035	train-other-500	and wash it much and with warm water to please it not with cold water to give it pain BOSWELL But Sir does not heat relax JOHNSON Sir you are not to imagine the water is to be very hot I would not coddle the child
4894-7788-0036	train-other-500	No Sir the hardy method of treating children does no good I ll take you five children from London who shall cuff five Highland children Sir a man bred in London will carry a burthen or run or wrestle
none	none	 as well as a man brought up in the hardiest manner in the country BOSWELL Good living I suppose makes the Londoners strong 
4894-7788-0037	train-other-500	JOHNSON Why Sir I don t know that it does
none	none	 Our Chairmen from Ireland who are as strong men as any 
4894-7788-0038	train-other-500	have been brought up upon potatoes Quantity makes up for quality BOSWELL Would you teach this child that I have furnished you with any thing JOHNSON No I should not be apt to teach it BOSWELL
4894-7788-0039	train-other-500	Would not you have a pleasure in teaching it JOHNSON No Sir I should not have a pleasure in teaching it BOSWELL Have you not a pleasure in teaching men There I have you You have the same pleasure in teaching men that I should have in teaching children
none	none	 JOHNSON Why something about that BOSWELL Do you think Sir that what is called natural affection is born with us It seems to me to be the effect of habit or of gratitude for kindness No child has it for a parent whom it has not seen JOHNSON Why Sir I think there is an instinctive natural affection in parents towards their children 
4894-7788-0040	train-other-500	Russia being mentioned as likely to become a great empire by the rapid increase of population JOHNSON Why Sir I see no prospect of their propagating more
none	none	 They can have no more children than they can get I know of no way to make them breed more than they do It is not from reason and prudence that people marry but from inclination A man is poor he thinks I cannot be worse and so I ll e en take Peggy BOSWELL 
4894-7788-0042	train-other-500	But have not nations been more populous at one period than another JOHNSON Yes Sir but that has been owing to the people being less thinned at one period than another whether by emigrations war or pestilence not by their being more or less prolifick
4894-7788-0043	train-other-500	Births at all times bear the same proportion to the same number of people BOSWELL But to consider the state of our own country
none	none	 does not throwing a number of farms into one hand hurt population JOHNSON Why no Sir the same quantity of food being produced will be consumed by the same number of mouths 
4894-7788-0044	train-other-500	though the people may be disposed of in different ways We see if corn be dear and butchers meat cheap the farmers all apply themselves to the raising of corn till it becomes plentiful and cheap and then butchers meat becomes dear
4894-7788-0045	train-other-500	so that an equality is always preserved No Sir let fanciful men do as they will depend upon it it is difficult to disturb the system of life BOSWELL But Sir
4894-7788-0046	train-other-500	is it not a very bad thing for landlords to oppress their tenants by raising their rents JOHNSON Very bad But Sir it never can have any general influence it may distress some individuals For consider this landlords cannot do without tenants
4894-7788-0047	train-other-500	Now tenants will not give more for land than land is worth If they can make more of their money by keeping a shop or any other way they ll do it
none	none	 and so oblige landlords to let land come back to a reasonable rent 
4894-7788-0048	train-other-500	in order that they may get tenants Land in England is an article of commerce A tenant who pays his landlord his rent thinks himself no more obliged to him than you think yourself obliged to a man in whose shop you buy a piece of goods
4894-7788-0049	train-other-500	He knows the landlord does not let him have his land for less than he can get from others in the same manner as the shopkeeper sells his goods No shopkeeper sells a yard of ribband for sixpence when seven pence is the current price BOSWELL
4894-7788-0050	train-other-500	But Sir is it not better that tenants should be dependant on landlords JOHNSON Why Sir as there are many more tenants than landlords perhaps strictly speaking we should wish not
4894-7788-0051	train-other-500	But if you please you may let your lands cheap and so get the value part in money and part in homage I should agree with you in that BOSWELL So Sir you laugh at schemes of political improvement JOHNSON
4894-7788-0052	train-other-500	Why Sir most schemes of political improvement are very laughable things He observed Providence has wisely ordered that the more numerous men are the more difficult it is for them to agree in any thing and so they are governed
none	none	 There is no doubt that if the poor should reason We ll be the poor no longer we ll make the rich take their turn 
4894-7788-0053	train-other-500	they could easily do it were it not that they can t agree So the common soldiers
none	none	 though so much more numerous than their officers 
4894-7788-0054	train-other-500	are governed by them for the same reason He said Mankind have a strong attachment to the habitations to which they have been accustomed You see the inhabitants of Norway do not with one consent quit it
none	none	 and go to some part of America where there is a mild climate and where they may have the same produce from land with the tenth part of the labour 
4894-7788-0055	train-other-500	No Sir their affection for their old dwellings and the terrour of a general change keep them at home Thus we see many of the finest spots in the world thinly inhabited and many rugged spots well inhabited
none	none	 The London Chronicle three hundred one which was the only news paper he constantly took in 
4894-7788-0056	train-other-500	being brought the office of reading it aloud was assigned to me I was diverted by his impatience He made me pass over so many parts of it that my task was very easy
none	none	 He would not suffer one of the petitions to the King about the Middlesex election to be read three hundred two I had hired a Bohemian as my servant three hundred three while I remained in London and being much pleased with him I asked doctor Johnson whether his being a Roman Catholick should prevent my taking him with me to Scotland 
4894-7788-0057	train-other-500	JOHNSON Why no Sir if he has no objection you can have none BOSWELL So Sir you are no great enemy to the Roman Catholick religion JOHNSON No more Sir than to the Presbyterian religion BOSWELL You are joking
4894-7788-0058	train-other-500	JOHNSON No Sir I really think so
none	none	 Nay Sir of the two I prefer the Popish three hundred four BOSWELL How so Sir 
4894-7788-0059	train-other-500	JOHNSON Why Sir the Presbyterians have no church no apostolical ordination BOSWELL And do you think that absolutely essential Sir JOHNSON Why Sir as it was an apostolical institution I think it is dangerous to be without it
4894-7788-0060	train-other-500	And Sir the Presbyterians have no public worship they have no form of prayer in which they know they are to join They go to hear a man pray and are to judge whether they will join with him BOSWELL But Sir their doctrine is the same with that of the Church of England
4894-7788-0061	train-other-500	Their confession of faith and the thirty nine articles contain the same points even the doctrine of predestination JOHNSON Why yes Sir predestination was a part of the clamour of the times
none	none	 so it is mentioned in our articles but with as little positiveness as could be BOSWELL Is it necessary Sir to believe all the thirty nine articles 
4894-7788-0063	train-other-500	JOHNSON Why Sir that is a question which has been much agitated
none	none	 Some have thought it necessary that they should all be believed 
4894-7788-0064	train-other-500	others have considered them to be only articles of peace
none	none	 that is to say you are not to preach against them three hundred five BOSWELL 
4894-7788-0065	train-other-500	It appears to me Sir that predestination or what is equivalent to it cannot be avoided
none	none	 if we hold an universal prescience in the Deity 
4894-7788-0066	train-other-500	JOHNSON Why Sir does not GOD every day see things going on without preventing them BOSWELL True Sir but if a thing be certainly foreseen it must be fixed and cannot happen otherwise
4894-7788-0067	train-other-500	and if we apply this consideration to the human mind there is no free will
none	none	 nor do I see how prayer can be of any avail 
4894-7788-0068	train-other-500	He mentioned doctor Clarke and Bishop Bramhall on Liberty and Necessity and bid me read South s Sermons on Prayer but avoided the question which has excruciated philosophers and divines beyond any other
4894-7788-0069	train-other-500	I did not press it further
none	none	 when I perceived that he was displeased three hundred six and shrunk from any abridgement 
4894-7788-0070	train-other-500	of an attribute usually ascribed to the Divinity however irreconcilable in its full extent with the grand system of moral government His supposed orthodoxy here cramped the vigorous powers of his understanding
4894-7788-0071	train-other-500	He was confined by a chain which early imagination and long habit made him think massy and strong but which had he ventured to try he could at once have snapt asunder I proceeded
none	none	 What do you think Sir of Purgatory three hundred seven as believed by the Roman Catholicks 
4894-7788-0072	train-other-500	JOHNSON Why Sir it is a very harmless doctrine They are of opinion that the generality of mankind are neither so obstinately wicked as to deserve everlasting punishment nor so good as to merit being admitted into the society of blessed spirits
4894-7788-0073	train-other-500	and therefore that God is graciously pleased to allow of a middle state where they may be purified by certain degrees of suffering You see Sir there is nothing unreasonable in this BOSWELL But then Sir their masses for the dead JOHNSON Why Sir
none	none	 if it be once established that there are souls in purgatory 
4894-7788-0074	train-other-500	it is as proper to pray for them as for our brethren of mankind who are yet in this life BOSWELL The idolatry of the Mass JOHNSON Sir there is no idolatry in the Mass They believe GOD to be there and they adore him
none	none	 BOSWELL The worship of Saints JOHNSON Sir they do not worship saints they invoke them they only ask their prayers three hundred eight I am talking all this time of the doctrines of the Church of Rome 
4894-7788-0075	train-other-500	I grant you that in practice Purgatory is made a lucrative imposition and that the people do become idolatrous as they recommend themselves to the tutelary protection of particular saints I think their giving the sacrament only in one kind is criminal
4894-7788-0076	train-other-500	because it is contrary to the express institution of CHRIST
none	none	 and I wonder how the Council of Trent admitted it 
4894-7788-0077	train-other-500	BOSWELL Confession JOHNSON Why I don t know but that is a good thing The scripture says
none	none	 Confess your faults one to another three hundred nine and the priests confess as well as the laity 
4894-7788-0078	train-other-500	Then it must be considered that their absolution is only upon repentance and often upon penance also You think your sins may be forgiven without penance upon repentance alone
4894-7788-0079	train-other-500	I thus ventured to mention all the common objections against the Roman Catholick Church that I might hear so great a man upon them
none	none	 What he said is here accurately recorded 
4894-7788-0080	train-other-500	But it is not improbable that if one had taken the other side he might have reasoned differently I must however mention that he had a respect for the old religion

4894-7788-0082	train-other-500	he is only superadding to what he already had But a convert from Popery to Protestantism gives up so much of what he has held as sacred as any thing that he retains
none	none	 there is so much laceration of mind three hundred eleven in such a conversion that it can hardly be sincere and lasting three hundred twelve The truth of this reflection 
4894-7788-0083	train-other-500	may be confirmed by many and eminent instances some of which will occur to most of my readers When we were alone I introduced the subject of death and endeavoured to maintain that the fear of it might be got over I told him that David Hume said to me

none	none	 from this state of being to a happier seat three hundred fourteen his thoughts upon this aweful change were in general 
4894-7788-0089	train-other-500	full of dismal apprehensions His mind resembled the vast amphitheatre the Colisaeum at Rome In the centre stood his judgement which like a mighty gladiator combated those apprehensions that like the wild beasts of the Arena
4894-7788-0090	train-other-500	were all around in cells ready to be let out upon him After a conflict he drives them back into their dens but not killing them they were still assailing him To my question
none	none	 whether we might not fortify our minds for the approach of death

none	none	 The act of dying is not of importance it lasts so short a time three hundred fifteen He added with an earnest look 
4894-7788-0092	train-other-500	A man knows it must be so and submits It will do him no good to whine I attempted to continue the conversation He was so provoked that he said Give us no more of this and was thrown into such a state of agitation
4894-7788-0093	train-other-500	that he expressed himself in a way that alarmed and distressed me shewed an impatience that I should leave him and when I was going away called to me sternly Don t let us meet to morrow I went home exceedingly uneasy
4894-7788-0094	train-other-500	All the harsh observations which I had ever heard made upon his character crowded into my mind and I seemed to myself like the man who had put his head into the lion s mouth a great many times with perfect safety but at last had it bit off
4894-7788-0095	train-other-500	Next morning I sent him a note stating that I might have been in the wrong but it was not intentionally he was therefore I could not help thinking too severe upon me That notwithstanding our agreement not to meet that day
4894-7788-0096	train-other-500	I would call on him in my way to the city and stay five minutes by my watch You are said I in my mind since last night surrounded with cloud and storm Let me have a glimpse of sunshine

4894-7788-0097	train-other-500	Upon entering his study I was glad that he was not alone which would have made our meeting more awkward
none	none	 There were with him mister Steevens three hundred sixteen and mister Tyers three hundred seventeen both of whom I now saw for the first time My note had on three hundred eighteen his own reflection softened him 
4894-7788-0098	train-other-500	for he received me very complacently so that I unexpectedly found myself at ease and joined in the conversation He said the criticks had done too much honour
none	none	 to Sir Richard Blackmore by writing so much against him three hundred nineteen That in his Creation he had been helped by various wits 
4894-7788-0099	train-other-500	a line by Phillips and a line by Tickell
none	none	 so that by their aid and that of others the poem had been made out three hundred twenty I defended Blackmore s supposed lines which have been ridiculed as absolute nonsense A painted vest Prince Voltiger had on Which from a naked Pict his grandsire won three hundred twenty one I maintained it to be a poetical conceit A Pict being painted if he is slain in battle and a vest is made of his skin it is a painted vest won from him though he was naked three hundred twenty two Johnson spoke unfavourably of a certain pretty voluminous authour saying He used to write anonymous books and then other books commending those books in which there was something of rascality I whispered him 
4894-7788-0100	train-other-500	Well Sir you are now in good humour JOHNSON Yes Sir I was going to leave him and had got as far as the staircase He stopped me and smiling said Get you gone in
4894-7788-0101	train-other-500	a curious mode of inviting me to stay which I accordingly did for some time longer This little incidental quarrel and reconciliation which perhaps I may be thought to have detailed too minutely
none	none	 must be esteemed as one of many proofs which his friends had that though he might be charged with bad humour at times he was always a good natured man and I have heard Sir Joshua Reynolds three hundred twenty three a nice and delicate observer of manners particularly remark that when upon any occasion Johnson had been rough to any person in company he took the first opportunity of reconciliation by drinking to him or addressing his discourse to him three hundred twenty four but if he found his dignified indirect overtures sullenly neglected he was quite indifferent and considered himself as having done all that he ought to do and the other as now in the wrong Being to set out for Scotland on the tenth of November I wrote to him at Streatham 
4894-7788-0102	train-other-500	begging that he would meet me in town on the ninth but if this should be very inconvenient to him I would go thither His answer was as follows
none	none	 To JAMES BOSWELL esquire 
4894-7788-0103	train-other-500	DEAR SIR Upon balancing the inconveniences of both parties I find it will less incommode you to spend your night here than me to come to town I wish to see you and am ordered by the lady of this house to invite you hither Whether you can come or not
none	none	 I shall not have any occasion of writing to you again before your marriage and therefore tell you now that with great sincerity I wish you happiness I am dear Sir Your most affectionate humble servant SAM JOHNSON Nov nine seventeen sixty nine I was detained in town till it was too late on the ninth so went to him early on the morning of the tenth of November 
4894-7788-0105	train-other-500	Now said he that you are going to marry do not expect more from life than life will afford You may often find yourself out of humour and you may often think your wife not studious enough to please you
4894-7788-0106	train-other-500	and yet you may have reason to consider yourself as upon the whole very happily married Talking of marriage in general he observed Our marriage service is too refined It is calculated only for the best kind of marriages
4894-7788-0107	train-other-500	whereas we should have a form for matches of convenience of which there are many He agreed with me that there was no absolute necessity for having the marriage ceremony performed by a regular clergyman for this was not commanded in scripture
4894-7788-0108	train-other-500	I was volatile enough to repeat to him a little epigrammatick song of mine on matrimony
none	none	 which mister Garrick had a few days before procured to be set to musick by the very ingenious mister Dibden

4894-7788-0111	train-other-500	He was so good as to accompany me to London and see me into the post chaise which was to carry me on my road to Scotland
none	none	 And sure I am that however inconsiderable many of the particulars recorded at this time may appear to some they will be esteemed by the best part of my readers as genuine traits of his character contributing together to give a full fair and distinct view of it seventeen seventy AETAT sixty one In seventeen seventy he published a political pamphlet entitled The False Alarm three hundred twenty five intended to justify the conduct of ministry and their majority in the House of Commons for having virtually assumed it as an axiom that the expulsion of a Member of Parliament was equivalent to exclusion and thus having declared Colonel Lutterel to be duly elected for the county of Middlesex notwithstanding mister Wilkes had a great majority of votes three hundred twenty six This being justly considered as a gross violation of the right of election an alarm for the constitution extended itself all over the kingdom To prove this alarm to be false was the purpose of Johnson s pamphlet but even his vast powers were inadequate to cope with constitutional truth and reason and his argument failed of effect and the House of Commons have since expunged the offensive resolution from their Journals three hundred twenty seven That the House of Commons might have expelled mister Wilkes repeatedly and as often as he should be re chosen was not denied but incapacitation cannot be but by an act of the whole legislature It was wonderful to see how a prejudice in favour of government in general and an aversion to popular clamour could blind and contract such an understanding as Johnson s in this particular case yet the wit the sarcasm the eloquent vivacity which this pamphlet displayed made it be read with great avidity at the time and it will ever be read with pleasure for the sake of its composition That it endeavoured to infuse a narcotick indifference as to publick concerns into the minds of the people and that it broke out sometimes into an extreme coarseness of contemptuous abuse is but too evident It must not however be omitted that when the storm of his violence subsides he takes a fair opportunity to pay a grateful compliment to the King who had rewarded his merit These low born rulers three hundred twenty eight have endeavoured surely without effect to alienate the affections of the people from the only King who for almost a century has much appeared to desire or much endeavoured to deserve them And Every honest man must lament that the faction has been regarded with frigid neutrality by the Tories who being long accustomed to signalise their principles by opposition to the Court do not yet consider that they have at last a King who knows not the name of party and who wishes to be the common father of all his people To this pamphlet which was at once discovered to be Johnson s several answers came out in which care was taken to remind the publick of his former attacks upon government and of his now being a pensioner without allowing for the honourable terms upon which Johnson s pension was granted and accepted or the change of system which the British court had undergone upon the accession of his present Majesty three hundred twenty nine He was however soothed three hundred thirty in the highest strain of panegyrick in a poem called The Remonstrance by the reverend mister Stockdale three hundred thirty one to whom he was upon many occasions a kind protector The following admirable minute made by him describes so well his own state and that of numbers to whom self examination is habitual that I cannot omit it June one seventeen seventy Every man naturally persuades himself that he can keep his resolutions nor is he convinced of his imbecility but by length of time and frequency of experiment three hundred thirty two This opinion of our own constancy is so prevalent that we always despise him who suffers his general and settled purpose to be overpowered by an occasional desire They therefore whom frequent failures have made desperate cease to form resolutions and they who are become cunning do not tell them Those who do not make them are very few but of their effect little is perceived for scarcely any man persists in a course of life planned by choice but as he is restrained from deviation by some external power He who may live as he will seldom lives long in the observation of his own rules three hundred thirty three Of this year I have obtained the following letters To THE REVEREND doctor FARMER three hundred thirty four CAMBRIDGE SIR As no man ought to keep wholly to himself any possession that may be useful to the publick I hope you will not think me unreasonably intrusive if I have recourse to you for such information as you are more able to give me than any other man In support of an opinion which you have already placed above the need of any more support mister Steevens a very ingenious gentleman lately of King s College has collected an account of all the translations which Shakspeare might have seen and used He wishes his catalogue to be perfect and therefore intreats that you will favour him by the insertion of such additions as the accuracy of your inquiries has enabled you to make To this request I take the liberty of adding my own solicitation We have no immediate use for this catalogue and therefore do not desire that it should interrupt or hinder your more important employments But it will be kind to let us know that you receive it I am Sir c SAM JOHNSON Johnson s court Fleet street March twenty one seventeen seventy To THE REVEREND mister THOMAS WARTON DEAR SIR The readiness with which you were pleased to promise me some notes on Shakspeare was a new instance of your friendship I shall not hurry you but am desired by mister Steevens who helps me in this edition to let you know that we shall print the tragedies first and shall therefore want first the notes which belong to them We think not to incommode the readers with a supplement and therefore what we cannot put into its proper place will do us no good We shall not begin to print before the end of six weeks perhaps not so soon I am c SAM JOHNSON London June twenty three seventeen seventy To THE reverend doctor JOSEPH WARTON DEAR SIR I am revising my edition of Shakspeare and remember that I formerly misrepresented your opinion of Lear Be pleased to write the paragraph as you would have it and send it three hundred thirty five If you have any remarks of your own upon that or any other play I shall gladly receive them Make my compliments to missus Warton I sometimes think of wandering for a few days to Winchester but am apt to delay I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON Sept twenty seven seventeen seventy To mister FRANCIS BARBER AT missus CLAPP S BISHOP STORTFORD HERTFORDSHIRE DEAR FRANCIS I am at last sat down to write to you and should very much blame myself for having neglected you so long if I did not impute that and many other failings to want of health three hundred thirty six I hope not to be so long silent again I am very well satisfied with your progress if you can really perform the exercises which you are set and I hope mister Ellis does not suffer you to impose on him or on yourself Make my compliments to mister Ellis and to missus Clapp and mister Smith Let me know what English books you read for your entertainment You can never be wise unless you love reading Do not imagine that I shall forget or forsake you for if when I examine you I find that you have not lost your time you shall want no encouragement from Yours affectionately SAM JOHNSON London Sept twenty five seventeen seventy TO THE SAME DEAR FRANCIS I hope you mind your business I design you shall stay with missus Clapp these holidays If you are invited out you may go if mister Ellis gives leave I have ordered you some clothes which you will receive I believe next week My compliments to missus Clapp and to mister Ellis and mister Smith c I am Your affectionate SAM JOHNSON December seven seventeen seventy During this year there was a total cessation of all correspondence between doctor Johnson and me without any coldness on either side but merely from procrastination continued from day to day and as I was not in London I had no opportunity of enjoying his company and recording his conversation To supply this blank I shall present my readers with some Collectanea obligingly furnished to me by the reverend doctor Maxwell of Falkland in Ireland some time assistant preacher at the Temple and for many years the social friend of Johnson who spoke of him with a very kind regard My acquaintance with that great and venerable character commenced in the year seventeen fifty four I was introduced to him by mister Grierson three hundred thirty seven his Majesty s printer at Dublin a gentleman of uncommon learning and great wit and vivacity mister Grierson died in Germany at the age of twenty seven doctor Johnson highly respected his abilities and often observed that he possessed more extensive knowledge than any man of his years he had ever known His industry was equal to his talents and he particularly excelled in every species of philological learning and was perhaps the best critick of the age he lived in I must always remember with gratitude my obligation to mister Grierson for the honour and happiness of doctor Johnson s acquaintance and friendship which continued uninterrupted and undiminished to his death a connection that was at once the pride and happiness of my life What pity it is that so much wit and good sense as he continually exhibited in conversation should perish unrecorded Few persons quitted his company without perceiving themselves wiser and better than they were before On serious subjects he flashed the most interesting conviction upon his auditors and upon lighter topicks you might have supposed Albano musas de monte locutas three hundred thirty eight Though I can hope to add but little to the celebrity of so exalted a character by any communications I can furnish yet out of pure respect to his memory I will venture to transmit to you some anecdotes concerning him which fell under my own observation The very minutiae of such a character must be interesting and may be compared to the filings of diamonds In politicks he was deemed a Tory but certainly was not so in the obnoxious or party sense of the term for while he asserted the legal and salutary prerogatives of the crown he no less respected the constitutional liberties of the people Whiggism at the time of the Revolution he said was accompanied with certain principles but latterly as a mere party distinction under Walpole three hundred thirty nine and the Pelhams was no better than the politicks of stock jobbers and the religion of infidels He detested the idea of governing by parliamentary corruption and asserted most strenuously that a prince steadily and conspicuously pursuing the interests of his people could not fail of parliamentary concurrence A prince of ability he contended might and should be the directing soul and spirit of his own administration in short his own minister and not the mere head of a party and then and not till then would the royal dignity be sincerely respected Johnson seemed to think that a certain degree of crown influence over the Houses of Parliament not meaning a corrupt and shameful dependence was very salutary nay even necessary in our mixed government three hundred forty For said he if the members were under no crown influence and disqualified from receiving any gratification from Court and resembled as they possibly might Pym and Haslerig and other stubborn and sturdy members of the long Parliament the wheels of government would be totally obstructed Such men would oppose merely to shew their power from envy jealousy and perversity of disposition and not gaining themselves would hate and oppose all who did not loving the person of the prince and conceiving they owed him little gratitude from the mere spirit of insolence and contradiction they would oppose and thwart him upon all occasions The inseparable imperfection annexed to all human governments consisted he said in not being able to create a sufficient fund of virtue and principle to carry the laws into due and effectual execution Wisdom might plan but virtue alone could execute And where could sufficient virtue be found A variety of delegated and often discretionary powers must be entrusted somewhere which if not governed by integrity and conscience would necessarily be abused till at last the constable would sell his for a shilling This excellent person was sometimes charged with abetting slavish and arbitrary principles of government Nothing in my opinion could be a grosser calumny and misrepresentation for how can it be rationally supposed that he should adopt such pernicious and absurd opinions who supported his philosophical character with so much dignity was extremely jealous of his personal liberty and independence and could not brook the smallest appearance of neglect or insult even from the highest personages But let us view him in some instances of more familiar life His general mode of life during my acquaintance seemed to be pretty uniform About twelve o clock I commonly visited him and frequently found him in bed or declaiming over his tea which he drank very plentifully He generally had a levee of morning visitors chiefly men of letters three hundred forty one Hawkesworth Goldsmith Murphy Langton Steevens Beauclerk c c and sometimes learned ladies particularly I remember a French lady three hundred forty two of wit and fashion doing him the honour of a visit He seemed to me to be considered as a kind of publick oracle whom every body thought they had a right to visit and consult three hundred forty three and doubtless they were well rewarded I never could discover how he found time for his compositions three hundred forty four He declaimed all the morning then went to dinner at a tavern where he commonly staid late and then drank his tea at some friend s house over which he loitered a great while but seldom took supper I fancy he must have read and wrote chiefly in the night for I can scarcely recollect that he ever refused going with me to a tavern and he often went to Ranelagh three hundred forty five which he deemed a place of innocent recreation He frequently gave all the silver in his pocket to the poor who watched him between his house and the tavern where he dined three hundred forty six He walked the streets at all hours and said he was never robbed three hundred forty seven for the rogues knew he had little money nor had the appearance of having much Though the most accessible and communicative man alive yet when he suspected he was invited to be exhibited he constantly spurned the invitation Two young women from Staffordshire visited him when I was present to consult him on the subject of Methodism to which they were inclined Come said he you pretty fools dine with Maxwell and me at the Mitre and we will talk over that subject which they did and after dinner he took one of them upon his knee and fondled her for half an hour together Upon a visit to me at a country lodging near Twickenham he asked what sort of society I had there I told him but indifferent as they chiefly consisted of opulent traders retired from business He said he never much liked that class of people For Sir said he they have lost the civility of tradesmen without acquiring the manners of gentlemen three hundred forty eight Johnson was much attached to London he observed that a man stored his mind better there than any where else and that in remote situations a man s body might be feasted but his mind was starved and his faculties apt to degenerate from want of exercise and competition No place he said cured a man s vanity or arrogance so well as London for as no man was either great or good per se but as compared with others not so good or great he was sure to find in the metropolis many his equals and some his superiours He observed that a man in London was in less danger of falling in love indiscreetly than any where else for there the difficulty of deciding between the conflicting pretensions of a vast variety of objects kept him safe He told me that he had frequently been offered country preferment if he would consent to take orders three hundred forty nine but he could not leave the improved society of the capital or consent to exchange the exhilarating joys and splendid decorations of publick life for the obscurity insipidity and uniformity of remote situations Speaking of mister Harte three hundred fifty Canon of Windsor and writer of The History of Gustavus Adolphus he much commended him as a scholar and a man of the most companionable talents he had ever known He said the defects in his history proceeded not from imbecility but from foppery He loved he said the old black letter books they were rich in matter though their style was inelegant wonderfully so considering how conversant the writers were with the best models of antiquity Burton s Anatomy of Melancholy he said was the only book that ever took him out of bed two hours sooner than he wished to rise He frequently exhorted me to set about writing a History of Ireland and archly remarked there had been some good Irish writers and that one Irishman might at least aspire to be equal to another He had great compassion for the miseries and distresses of the Irish nation particularly the Papists and severely reprobated the barbarous debilitating policy of the British government which he said was the most detestable mode of persecution To a gentleman who hinted such policy might be necessary to support the authority of the English government he replied by saying Let the authority of the English government perish rather than be maintained by iniquity Better would it be to restrain the turbulence of the natives by the authority of the sword and to make them amenable to law and justice by an effectual and vigorous police than to grind them to powder by all manner of disabilities and incapacities Better said he to hang or drown people at once than by an unrelenting persecution to beggar and starve them three hundred fifty one The moderation and humanity of the present times have in some measure justified the wisdom of his observations doctor Johnson was often accused of prejudices nay antipathy with regard to the natives of Scotland Surely so illiberal a prejudice never entered his mind and it is well known many natives of that respectable country possessed a large share in his esteem nor were any of them ever excluded from his good offices as far as opportunity permitted True it is he considered the Scotch nationally as a crafty designing people eagerly attentive to their own interest and too apt to overlook the claims and pretentions of other people While they confine their benevolence in a manner exclusively to those of their own country they expect to share in the good offices of other people Now said Johnson this principle is either right or wrong if right we should do well to imitate such conduct if wrong we cannot too much detest it three hundred fifty two Being solicited to compose a funeral sermon for the daughter of a tradesman he naturally enquired into the character of the deceased and being told she was remarkable for her humility and condescension to inferiours he observed that those were very laudable qualities but it might not be so easy to discover who the lady s inferiours were Of a certain player three hundred fifty three he remarked that his conversation usually threatened and announced more than it performed that he fed you with a continual renovation of hope to end in a constant succession of disappointment When exasperated by contradiction he was apt to treat his opponents with too much acrimony as Sir you don t see your way through that question Sir you talk the language of ignorance On my observing to him that a certain gentleman had remained silent the whole evening in the midst of a very brilliant and learned society Sir said he the conversation overflowed and drowned him His philosophy though austere and solemn was by no means morose and cynical and never blunted the laudable sensibilities of his character or exempted him from the influence of the tender passions Want of tenderness he always alledged was want of parts and was no less a proof of stupidity than depravity Speaking of mister Hanway who published An Eight Days Journey from London to Portsmouth Jonas said he acquired some reputation by travelling abroad three hundred fifty four but lost it all by travelling at home three hundred fifty five Of the passion of love he remarked that its violence and ill effects were much exaggerated for who knows any real sufferings on that head more than from the exorbitancy of any other passion He much commended Law s Serious Call which he said was the finest piece of hortatory theology in any language three hundred fifty six Law said he fell latterly into the reveries of Jacob Behmen three hundred fifty seven whom Law alledged to have been somewhat in the same state with saint Paul and to have seen unutterable things three hundred fifty eight he would have resembled saint Paul still more by not attempting to utter them He observed that the established clergy in general did not preach plain enough and that polished periods and glittering sentences flew over the heads of the common people without any impression upon their hearts Something might be necessary he observed to excite the affections of the common people who were sunk in languor and lethargy and therefore he supposed that the new concomitants of methodism might probably produce so desirable an effect three hundred fifty nine The mind like the body he observed delighted in change and novelty and even in religion itself courted new appearances and modifications Whatever might be thought of some methodist teachers he said he could scarcely doubt the sincerity of that man who travelled nine hundred miles in a month and preached twelve times a week for no adequate reward merely temporal could be given for such indefatigable labour three hundred sixty Of doctor Priestley s theological works he remarked that they tended to unsettle every thing and yet settled nothing He was much affected by the death of his mother and wrote to me to come and assist him to compose his mind which indeed I found extremely agitated He lamented that all serious and religious conversation was banished from the society of men and yet great advantages might be derived from it All acknowledged he said what hardly any body practised the obligation we were under of making the concerns of eternity the governing principles of our lives Every man he observed at last wishes for retreat he sees his expectations frustrated in the world and begins to wean himself from it and to prepare for everlasting separation He observed that the influence of London now extended every where and that from all manner of communication being opened there shortly would be no remains of the ancient simplicity or places of cheap retreat to be found He was no admirer of blank verse and said it always failed unless sustained by the dignity of the subject In blank verse he said the language suffered more distortion to keep it out of prose than any inconvenience or limitation to be apprehended from the shackles and circumspection of rhyme three hundred sixty one He reproved me once for saying grace without mention of the name of our LORD JESUS CHRIST and hoped in future I would be more mindful of the apostolical injunction three hundred sixty two He refused to go out of a room before me at mister Langton s house saying he hoped he knew his rank better than to presume to take place of a Doctor in Divinity I mention such little anecdotes merely to shew the peculiar turn and habit of his mind He used frequently to observe that there was more to be endured than enjoyed in the general condition of human life and frequently quoted those lines of Dryden Strange cozenage none would live past years again Yet all hope pleasure from what still remain three hundred sixty three For his part he said he never passed that week in his life which he would wish to repeat were an angel to make the proposal to him He was of opinion that the English nation cultivated both their soil and their reason better than any other people but admitted that the French though not the highest perhaps in any department of literature yet in every department were very high three hundred sixty four Intellectual pre eminence he observed was the highest superiority and that every nation derived their highest reputation from the splendour and dignity of their writers three hundred sixty five Voltaire he said was a good narrator and that his principal merit consisted in a happy selection and arrangement of circumstances Speaking of the French novels compared with Richardson s he said they might be pretty baubles but a wren was not an eagle In a Latin conversation with the Pere Boscovitch at the house of missus Cholmondeley I heard him maintain the superiority of Sir Isaac Newton over all foreign philosophers three hundred sixty six with a dignity and eloquence that surprized that learned foreigner three hundred sixty seven It being observed to him that a rage for every thing English prevailed much in France after Lord Chatham s glorious war he said he did not wonder at it for that we had drubbed those fellows into a proper reverence for us and that their national petulance required periodical chastisement Lord Lyttelton s Dialogues he deemed a nugatory performance That man said he sat down to write a book to tell the world what the world had all his life been telling him three hundred sixty eight Somebody observing that the Scotch Highlanders in the year seventeen forty five had made surprising efforts considering their numerous wants and disadvantages Yes Sir said he their wants were numerous but you have not mentioned the greatest of them all the want of law Speaking of the inward light to which some methodists pretended he said it was a principle utterly incompatible with social or civil security If a man said he pretends to a principle of action of which I can know nothing nay not so much as that he has it but only that he pretends to it how can I tell what that person may be prompted to do When a person professes to be governed by a written ascertained law I can then know where to find him The poem of Fingal three hundred sixty nine he said was a mere unconnected rhapsody a tiresome repetition of the same images In vain shall we look for the lucidus ordo three hundred seventy where there is neither end or object design or moral nec certa recurrit imago Being asked by a young nobleman what was become of the gallantry and military spirit of the old English nobility he replied Why my Lord I ll tell you what is become of it it is gone into the city to look for a fortune Speaking of a dull tiresome fellow whom he chanced to meet he said That fellow seems to me to possess but one idea and that is a wrong one Much enquiry having been made concerning a gentleman who had quitted a company where Johnson was and no information being obtained at last Johnson observed that he did not care to speak ill of any man behind his back but he believed the gentleman was an attorney three hundred seventy one He spoke with much contempt of the notice taken of Woodhouse the poetical shoemaker three hundred seventy two He said it was all vanity and childishness and that such objects were to those who patronised them mere mirrours of their own superiority They had better said he furnish the man with good implements for his trade than raise subscriptions for his poems He may make an excellent shoemaker but can never make a good poet A school boy s exercise may be a pretty thing for a school boy but it is no treat for a man Speaking of Boetius who was the favourite writer of the middle ages three hundred seventy three he said it was very surprizing that upon such a subject and in such a situation he should be magis philosophius quam Christianus Speaking of Arthur Murphy whom he very much loved I don t know said he that Arthur can be classed with the very first dramatick writers yet at present I doubt much whether we have any thing superiour to Arthur three hundred seventy four Speaking of the national debt he said it was an idle dream to suppose that the country could sink under it Let the public creditors be ever so clamorous the interest of millions must ever prevail over that of thousands three hundred seventy five Of doctor Kennicott s Collations he observed that though the text should not be much mended thereby yet it was no small advantage to know that we had as good a text as the most consummate industry and diligence could procure three hundred seventy six Johnson observed that so many objections might be made to every thing that nothing could overcome them but the necessity of doing something No man would be of any profession as simply opposed to not being of it but every one must do something He remarked that a London parish was a very comfortless thing for the clergyman seldom knew the face of one out of ten of his parishioners Of the late mister Mallet he spoke with no great respect said he was ready for any dirty job that he had wrote against Byng at the instigation of the ministry three hundred seventy seven and was equally ready to write for him provided he found his account in it A gentleman who had been very unhappy in marriage married immediately after his wife died Johnson said it was the triumph of hope over experience He observed that a man of sense and education should meet a suitable companion in a wife three hundred seventy eight It was a miserable thing when the conversation could only be such as whether the mutton should be boiled or roasted and probably a dispute about that He did not approve of late marriages observing that more was lost in point of time than compensated for by any possible advantages three hundred seventy nine Even ill assorted marriages were preferable to cheerless celibacy Of old Sheridan he remarked that he neither wanted parts nor literature but that his vanity and Quixotism obscured his merits He said foppery was never cured it was the bad stamina of the mind which like those of the body were never rectified once a coxcomb and always a coxcomb Being told that Gilbert Cowper called him the Caliban of literature Well said he I must dub him the Punchinello three hundred eighty Speaking of the old Earl of Corke and Orrery he said that man spent his life in catching at an object literary eminence which he had not power to grasp three hundred eighty one To find a substitution for violated morality he said was the leading feature in all perversions of religion He often used to quote with great pathos those fine lines of Virgil Optima quaeque dies miseris mortalibus aevi Prima fugit three hundred eighty two subeunt morbi tristisque senectus Et labor et durae rapit inclementia mortis three hundred eighty three Speaking of Homer whom he venerated as the prince of poets Johnson remarked that the advice given to Diomed three hundred eighty four by his father when he sent him to the Trojan war was the noblest exhortation that could be instanced in any heathen writer and comprised in a single line Greek Aien aristeuein kai hupeirochon emmenai allon which if I recollect well is translated by doctor Clarke thus semper appetere praestantissima et omnibus aliis antecellere He observed it was a most mortifying reflexion for any man to consider what he had done compared with what he might have done He said few people had intellectual resources sufficient to forego the pleasures of wine They could not otherwise contrive how to fill the interval between dinner and supper He went with me one Sunday to hear my old Master Gregory Sharpe three hundred eighty five preach at the Temple In the prefatory prayer Sharpe ranted about Liberty as a blessing most fervently to be implored and its continuance prayed for Johnson observed that our liberty was in no sort of danger he would have done much better to pray against our licentiousness One evening at missus Montagu s where a splendid company was assembled consisting of the most eminent literary characters I thought he seemed highly pleased with the respect and attention that were shewn him and asked him on our return home if he was not highly gratified by his visit No Sir said he not highly gratified yet I do not recollect to have passed many evenings with fewer objections Though of no high extraction himself he had much respect for birth and family especially among ladies He said adventitious accomplishments may be possessed by all ranks but one may easily distinguish the born gentlewoman He said the poor in England three hundred eighty six were better provided for than in any other country of the same extent he did not mean little Cantons or petty Republicks Where a great proportion of the people said he are suffered to languish in helpless misery that country must be ill policed and wretchedly governed a decent provision for the poor is the true test of civilization Gentlemen of education he observed were pretty much the same in all countries the condition of the lower orders the poor especially was the true mark of national discrimination When the corn laws were in agitation in Ireland by which that country has been enabled not only to feed itself but to export corn to a large amount three hundred eighty seven Sir Thomas Robinson three hundred eighty eight observed that those laws might be prejudicial to the corn trade of England Sir Thomas said he you talk the language of a savage what Sir would you prevent any people from feeding themselves if by any honest means they can do it three hundred eighty nine It being mentioned that Garrick assisted doctor Brown the authour of the Estimate three hundred ninety in some dramatick composition No Sir said Johnson he would no more suffer Garrick to write a line in his play than he would suffer him to mount his pulpit Speaking of Burke he said It was commonly observed he spoke too often in parliament but nobody could say he did not speak well though too frequently and too familiarly three hundred ninety one Speaking of economy he remarked it was hardly worth while to save anxiously twenty pounds a year If a man could save to that degree so as to enable him to assume a different rank in society then indeed it might answer some purpose He observed a principal source of erroneous judgement was viewing things partially and only on one side as for instance fortune hunters when they contemplated the fortunes singly and separately it was a dazzling and tempting object but when they came to possess the wives and their fortunes together they began to suspect that they had not made quite so good a bargain Speaking of the late Duke of Northumberland living very magnificently when Lord Lieutenant of Ireland somebody remarked it would be difficult to find a suitable successor to him then exclaimed Johnson he is only fit to succeed himself three hundred ninety two He advised me if possible to have a good orchard He knew he said a clergyman of small income who brought up a family very reputably which he chiefly fed with apple dumplings He said he had known several good scholars among the Irish gentlemen but scarcely any of them correct in quantity He extended the same observation to Scotland Speaking of a certain Prelate who exerted himself very laudably in building churches and parsonage houses however said he I do not find that he is esteemed a man of much professional learning or a liberal patron of it yet it is well where a man possesses any strong positive excellence Few have all kinds of merit belonging to their character We must not examine matters too deeply No Sir a fallible being will fail somewhere Talking of the Irish clergy he said Swift was a man of great parts and the instrument of much good to his country three hundred ninety three Berkeley was a profound scholar as well as a man of fine imagination but Usher he said was the great luminary of the Irish church and a greater he added no church could boast of at least in modern times We dined tete a tete at the Mitre as I was preparing to return to Ireland after an absence of many years I regretted much leaving London where I had formed many agreeable connexions Sir said he I don t wonder at it no man fond of letters leaves London without regret But remember Sir you have seen and enjoyed a great deal you have seen life in its highest decorations and the world has nothing new to exhibit No man is so well qualifyed to leave publick life as he who has long tried it and known it well We are always hankering after untried situations and imagining greater felicity from them than they can afford No Sir knowledge and virtue may be acquired in all countries and your local consequence will make you some amends for the intellectual gratifications you relinquish Then he quoted the following lines with great pathos He who has early known the pomps of state For things unknown tis ignorance to condemn And after having viewed the gaudy bait Can boldly say the trifle I contemn With such a one contented could I live Contented could I die three hundred ninety four He then took a most affecting leave of me said he knew it was a point of duty that called me away We shall all be sorry to lose you said he laudo tamen three hundred ninety five seventeen seventy one AETAT sixty two In seventeen seventy one he published another political pamphlet entitled Thoughts on the late Transactions respecting Falkland s Islands three hundred ninety six in which upon materials furnished to him by ministry and upon general topicks expanded in his richest style he successfully endeavoured to persuade the nation that it was wise and laudable to suffer the question of right to remain undecided rather than involve our country in another war It has been suggested by some with what truth I shall not take upon me to decide that he rated the consequence of those islands to Great Britain too low three hundred ninety seven But however this may be every humane mind must surely applaud the earnestness with which he averted the calamity of war a calamity so dreadful that it is astonishing how civilised nay Christian nations can deliberately continue to renew it His description of its miseries in this pamphlet is one of the finest pieces of eloquence in the English language three hundred ninety eight Upon this occasion too we find Johnson lashing the party in opposition with unbounded severity and making the fullest use of what he ever reckoned a most effectual argumentative instrument contempt three hundred ninety nine His character of their very able mysterious champion JUNIUS is executed with all the force of his genius and finished with the highest care He seems to have exulted in sallying forth to single combat against the boasted and formidable hero who bade defiance to principalities and powers and the rulers of this world four hundred This pamphlet it is observable was softened in one particular after the first edition four hundred one for the conclusion of mister George Grenville s character stood thus Let him not however be depreciated in his grave He had powers not universally possessed could he have enforced payment of the Manilla ransom he could have counted it four hundred two Which instead of retaining its sly sharp point was reduced to a mere flat unmeaning expression or if I may use the word truism He had powers not universally possessed and if he sometimes erred he was likewise sometimes right To BENNET LANGTON esquire DEAR SIR After much lingering of my own and much of the ministry I have at length got out my paper four hundred three But delay is not yet at an end Not many had been dispersed before Lord North ordered the sale to stop His reasons I do not distinctly know You may try to find them in the perusal four hundred four Before his order a sufficient number were dispersed to do all the mischief though perhaps not to make all the sport that might be expected from it Soon after your departure I had the pleasure of finding all the danger past with which your navigation four hundred five was threatened I hope nothing happens at home to abate your satisfaction but that Lady Rothes four hundred six and missus Langton and the young ladies are all well I was last night at THE CLUB doctor Percy has written a long ballad four hundred seven in many fits it is pretty enough He has printed and will soon publish it Goldsmith is at Bath with Lord Clare four hundred eight At mister Thrale s where I am now writing all are well I am dear Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON March twenty seventeen seventy one mister Strahan four hundred nine the printer who had been long in intimacy with Johnson in the course of his literary labours who was at once his friendly agent in receiving his pension for him four hundred ten and his banker in supplying him with money when he wanted it who was himself now a Member of Parliament and who loved much to be employed in political negociation four hundred eleven thought he should do eminent service both to government and Johnson if he could be the means of his getting a seat in the House of Commons four hundred twelve With this view he wrote a letter to one of the Secretaries of the Treasury of which he gave me a copy in his own hand writing which is as follows SIR You will easily recollect when I had the honour of waiting upon you some time ago I took the liberty to observe to you that doctor Johnson would make an excellent figure in the House of Commons and heartily wished he had a seat there My reasons are briefly these I know his perfect good affection to his Majesty and his government which I am certain he wishes to support by every means in his power He possesses a great share of manly nervous and ready eloquence is quick in discerning the strength and weakness of an argument can express himself with clearness and precision and fears the face of no man alive His known character as a man of extraordinary sense and unimpeached virtue would secure him the attention of the House and could not fail to give him a proper weight there He is capable of the greatest application and can undergo any degree of labour where he sees it necessary and where his heart and affections are strongly engaged His Majesty s ministers might therefore securely depend on his doing upon every proper occasion the utmost that could be expected from him They would find him ready to vindicate such measures as tended to promote the stability of government and resolute and steady in carrying them into execution Nor is any thing to be apprehended from the supposed impetuosity of his temper To the friends of the King you will find him a lamb to his enemies a lion For these reasons I humbly apprehend that he would be a very able and useful member And I will venture to say the employment would not be disagreeable to him and knowing as I do his strong affection to the King his ability to serve him in that capacity and the extreme ardour with which I am convinced he would engage in that service I must repeat that I wish most heartily to see him in the House If you think this worthy of attention you will be pleased to take a convenient opportunity of mentioning it to Lord North If his Lordship should happily approve of it I shall have the satisfaction of having been in some degree the humble instrument of doing my country in my opinion a very essential service I know your good nature and your zeal for the publick welfare will plead my excuse for giving you this trouble I am with the greatest respect Sir Your most obedient and humble servant WILLIAM STRAHAN New street March thirty seventeen seventy one This recommendation we know was not effectual but how or for what reason can only be conjectured It is not to be believed that mister Strahan would have applied unless Johnson had approved of it I never heard him mention the subject but at a later period of his life when Sir Joshua Reynolds told him that mister Edmund Burke had said that if he had come early into parliament he certainly would have been the greatest speaker that ever was there Johnson exclaimed I should like to try my hand now It has been much agitated among his friends and others whether he would have been a powerful speaker in Parliament had he been brought in when advanced in life I am inclined to think that his extensive knowledge his quickness and force of mind his vivacity and richness of expression his wit and humour and above all his poignancy of sarcasm would have had great effect in a popular assembly and that the magnitude of his figure and striking peculiarity of his manner would have aided the effect But I remember it was observed by mister Flood that Johnson having been long used to sententious brevity and the short flights of conversation might have failed in that continued and expanded kind of argument which is requisite in stating complicated matters in publick speaking and as a proof of this he mentioned the supposed speeches in Parliament written by him for the magazine none of which in his opinion were at all like real debates The opinion of one who was himself so eminent an orator must be allowed to have great weight It was confirmed by Sir William Scott who mentioned that Johnson had told him that he had several times tried to speak in the Society of Arts and Sciences but had found he could not get on From mister William Gerrard Hamilton I have heard that Johnson when observing to him that it was prudent for a man who had not been accustomed to speak in publick to begin his speech in as simple a manner as possible acknowledged that he rose in that society to deliver a speech which he had prepared but said he all my flowers of oratory forsook me I however cannot help wishing that he had tried his hand in Parliament and I wonder that ministry did not make the experiment I at length renewed a correspondence which had been too long discontinued To doctor JOHNSON Edinburgh April eighteen seventeen seventy one MY DEAR SIR I can now fully understand those intervals of silence in your correspondence with me which have often given me anxiety and uneasiness for although I am conscious that my veneration and love for mister Johnson have never in the least abated yet I have deferred for almost a year and a half to write to him In the subsequent part of this letter I gave him an account of my comfortable life as a married man four hundred thirteen and a lawyer in practice at the Scotch bar invited him to Scotland and promised to attend him to the Highlands and Hebrides To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR If you are now able to comprehend that I might neglect to write without diminution of affection you have taught me likewise how that neglect may be uneasily felt without resentment I wished for your letter a long time and when it came it amply recompensed the delay I never was so much pleased as now with your account of yourself and sincerely hope that between publick business improving studies and domestick pleasures neither melancholy nor caprice will find any place for entrance Whatever philosophy may determine of material nature it is certainly true of intellectual nature that it abhors a vacuum our minds cannot be empty and evil will break in upon them if they are not pre occupied by good My dear Sir mind your studies mind your business make your lady happy and be a good Christian After this tristitiam et metus Trades protervis in mare Creticum Portare ventis four hundred fourteen If we perform our duty we shall be safe and steady Sive per four hundred fifteen c whether we climb the Highlands or are tost among the Hebrides and I hope the time will come when we may try our powers both with cliffs and water I see but little of Lord Elibank four hundred sixteen I know not why perhaps by my own fault I am this day going into Staffordshire and Derbyshire for six weeks four hundred seventeen I am dear Sir Your most affectionate And most humble servant SAM JOHNSON London June twenty seventeen seventy one To SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS IN LEICESTER FIELDS DEAR SIR When I came to Lichfield I found that my portrait four hundred eighteen had been much visited and much admired Every man has a lurking wish to appear considerable in his native place and I was pleased with the dignity conferred by such a testimony of your regard Be pleased therefore to accept the thanks of Sir your most obliged And most humble servant SAM JOHNSON Ashbourn in Derbyshire July seventeen seventeen seventy one Compliments to Miss Reynolds To doctor JOHNSON Edinburgh July twenty seven seventeen seventy one MY DEAR SIR The bearer of this mister Beattie four hundred nineteen Professor of Moral Philosophy at Aberdeen is desirous of being introduced to your acquaintance His genius and learning and labours in the service of virtue and religion render him very worthy of it and as he has a high esteem of your character I hope you will give him a favourable reception I ever am c JAMES BOSWELL To BENNET LANGTON esquire AT LANGTON NEAR SPILSBY LINCOLNSHIRE DEAR SIR I am lately returned from Staffordshire and Derbyshire The last letter mentions two others which you have written to me since you received my pamphlet Of these two I never had but one in which you mentioned a design of visiting Scotland and by consequence put my journey to Langton out of my thoughts My summer wanderings are now over and I am engaging in a very great work the revision of my Dictionary four hundred twenty from which I know not at present how to get loose If you have observed or been told any errours or omissions you will do me a great favour by letting me know them Lady Rothes I find has disappointed you and herself Ladies will have these tricks The Queen and missus Thrale both ladies of experience yet both missed their reckoning this summer I hope a few months will recompence your uneasiness Please to tell Lady Rothes how highly I value the honour of her invitation which it is my purpose to obey as soon as I have disengaged myself In the mean time I shall hope to hear often of her Ladyship and every day better news and better till I hear that you have both the happiness which to both is very sincerely wished by Sir Your most affectionate and Most humble servant SAM JOHNSON August twenty nine seventeen seventy one In October I again wrote to him thanking him for his last letter and his obliging reception of mister Beattie informing him that I had been at Alnwick lately and had good accounts of him from doctor Percy In his religious record of this year we observe that he was better than usual both in body and mind and better satisfied with the regularity of his conduct four hundred twenty one But he is still trying his ways four hundred twenty two too rigorously He charges himself with not rising early enough yet he mentions what was surely a sufficient excuse for this supposing it to be a duty seriously required as he all his life appears to have thought it One great hindrance is want of rest my nocturnal complaints grow less troublesome towards morning and I am tempted to repair the deficiencies of the night four hundred twenty three Alas how hard would it be if this indulgence were to be imputed to a sick man as a crime In his retrospect on the following Easter Eve he says When I review the last year I am able to recollect so little done that shame and sorrow though perhaps too weakly come upon me Had he been judging of any one else in the same circumstances how clear would he have been on the favourable side How very difficult and in my opinion almost constitutionally impossible it was for him to be raised early even by the strongest resolutions appears from a note in one of his little paper books containing words arranged for his Dictionary written I suppose about seventeen fifty three I do not remember that since I left Oxford I ever rose early by mere choice but once or twice at Edial and two or three times for the Rambler I think he had fair ground enough to have quieted his mind on this subject by concluding that he was physically incapable of what is at best but a commodious regulation In seventeen seventy two he was altogether quiescent as an authour four hundred twenty four but it will be found from the various evidences which I shall bring together that his mind was acute lively and vigorous To SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS DEAR SIR Be pleased to send to mister Banks whose place of residence I do not know this note which I have sent open that if you please you may read it When you send it do not use your own seal I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON Feb twenty seven seventeen seventy two To JOSEPH BANKS esquire Perpetua ambita his terra praemia lactis Hac habet altrici Capra secunda Jovis four hundred twenty five Sir I return thanks to you and to doctor Solander for the pleasure which I received in yesterday s conversation I could not recollect a motto for your Goat but have given her one You Sir may perhaps have an epick poem from some happier pen than Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON Johnson s court Fleet street February twenty seven seventeen seventy two To doctor JOHNSON MY DEAR SIR It is hard that I cannot prevail on you to write to me oftener But I am convinced that it is in vain to expect from you a private correspondence with any regularity I must therefore look upon you as a fountain of wisdom from whence few rills are communicated to a distance and which must be approached at its source to partake fully of its virtues I am coming to London soon and am to appear in an appeal from the Court of Session in the House of Lords A schoolmaster in Scotland was by a court of inferiour jurisdiction deprived of his office for being somewhat severe in the chastisement of his scholars four hundred twenty six The Court of Session considering it to be dangerous to the interest of learning and education to lessen the dignity of teachers and make them afraid of too indulgent parents instigated by the complaints of their children restored him His enemies have appealed to the House of Lords though the salary is only twenty pounds a year I was Counsel for him here I hope there will be little fear of a reversal but I must beg to have your aid in my plan of supporting the decree It is a general question and not a point of particular law I am c JAMES BOSWELL To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR That you are coming so soon to town I am very glad and still more glad that you are coming as an advocate I think nothing more likely to make your life pass happily away than that consciousness of your own value which eminence in your profession will certainly confer If I can give you any collateral help I hope you do not suspect that it will be wanting My kindness for you has neither the merit of singular virtue nor the reproach of singular prejudice Whether to love you be right or wrong I have many on my side missus Thrale loves you and missus Williams loves you and what would have inclined me to love you if I had been neutral before you are a great favourite of doctor Beattie Of doctor Beattie I should have thought much but that his lady puts him out of my head she is a very lovely woman The ejection which you come hither to oppose appears very cruel unreasonable and oppressive I should think there could not be much doubt of your success My health grows better yet I am not fully recovered I believe it is held that men do not recover very fast after threescore I hope yet to see Beattie s College and have not given up the western voyage But however all this may be or not let us try to make each other happy when we meet and not refer our pleasure to distant times or distant places How comes it that you tell me nothing of your lady I hope to see her some time and till then shall be glad to hear of her I am dear Sir c SAM JOHNSON March fifteen seventeen seventy two To BENNET LANGTON esquire NEAR SPILSBY LINCOLNSHIRE DEAR SIR I congratulate you and Lady Rothes four hundred twenty seven on your little man and hope you will all be many years happy together Poor Miss Langton can have little part in the joy of her family She this day called her aunt Langton to receive the sacrament with her and made me talk yesterday on such subjects as suit her condition It will probably be her viaticum I surely need not mention again that she wishes to see her mother I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON March fourteen seventeen seventy two On the twenty first of March I was happy to find myself again in my friend s study and was glad to see my old acquaintance mister Francis Barber who was now returned home four hundred twenty eight doctor Johnson received me with a hearty welcome saying I am glad you are come and glad you are come upon such an errand alluding to the cause of the schoolmaster BOSWELL I hope Sir he will be in no danger It is a very delicate matter to interfere between a master and his scholars nor do I see how you can fix the degree of severity that a master may use JOHNSON Why Sir till you can fix the degree of obstinacy and negligence of the scholars you cannot fix the degree of severity of the master Severity must be continued until obstinacy be subdued and negligence be cured He mentioned the severity of Hunter his own Master four hundred twenty nine Sir said I Hunter is a Scotch name so it should seem this schoolmaster who beat you so severely was a Scotchman I can now account for your prejudice against the Scotch JOHNSON Sir he was not Scotch and abating his brutality he was a very good master four hundred thirty We talked of his two political pamphlets The False Alarm and Thoughts concerning Falkland s Islands JOHNSON Well Sir which of them did you think the best BOSWELL I liked the second best JOHNSON Why Sir I liked the first best and Beattie liked the first best Sir there is a subtlety of disquisition in the first that is worth all the fire of the second BOSWELL Pray Sir is it true that Lord North paid you a visit and that you got two hundred a year in addition to your pension JOHNSON No Sir Except what I had from the bookseller I did not get a farthing by them four hundred thirty one And between you and me I believe Lord North is no friend to me BOSWELL How so Sir JOHNSON Why Sir you cannot account for the fancies of men Well how does Lord Elibank and how does Lord Monboddo BOSWELL Very well Sir Lord Monboddo still maintains the superiority of the savage life four hundred thirty two JOHNSON What strange narrowness of mind now is that to think the things we have not known are better than the things which we have known BOSWELL Why Sir that is a common prejudice JOHNSON Yes Sir but a common prejudice should not be found in one whose trade it is to rectify errour A gentleman having come in who was to go as a mate in the ship along with mister Banks and doctor Solander doctor Johnson asked what were the names of the ships destined for the expedition The gentleman answered they were once to be called the Drake and the Ralegh but now they were to be called the Resolution and the Adventure four hundred thirty three JOHNSON Much better for had the Ralegh four hundred thirty four returned without going round the world it would have been ridiculous To give them the names of the Drake and the Ralegh was laying a trap for satire BOSWELL Had not you some desire to go upon this expedition Sir JOHNSON Why yes but I soon laid it aside Sir there is very little of intellectual in the course Besides I see but at a small distance So it was not worth my while to go to see birds fly which I should not have seen fly and fishes swim which I should not have seen swim The gentleman being gone and doctor Johnson having left the room for some time a debate arose between the Reverend mister Stockdale and missus Desmoulins whether mister Banks and doctor Solander were entitled to any share of glory from their expedition When doctor Johnson returned to us I told him the subject of their dispute JOHNSON Why Sir it was properly for botany that they went out I believe they thought only of culling of simples four hundred thirty five I thanked him for showing civilities to Beattie Sir said he I should thank you We all love Beattie missus Thrale says if ever she has another husband she ll have Beattie He sunk upon us four hundred thirty six that he was married else we should have shewn his lady more civilities She is a very fine woman But how can you shew civilities to a non entity I did not think he had been married Nay I did not think about it one way or other but he did not tell us of his lady till late He then spoke of saint Kilda four hundred thirty seven the most remote of the Hebrides I told him I thought of buying it JOHNSON Pray do Sir We will go and pass a winter amid the blasts there We shall have fine fish and we will take some dried tongues with us and some books We will have a strong built vessel and some Orkney men to navigate her We must build a tolerable house but we may carry with us a wooden house ready made and requiring nothing but to be put up Consider Sir by buying saint Kilda you may keep the people from falling into worse hands We must give them a clergyman and he shall be one of Beattie s choosing He shall be educated at Marischal College I ll be your Lord Chancellor or what you please BOSWELL Are you serious Sir in advising me to buy saint Kilda for if you should advise me to go to Japan I believe I should do it JOHNSON Why yes Sir I am serious BOSWELL Why then I ll see what can be done I gave him an account of the two parties in the Church of Scotland those for supporting the rights of patrons independent of the people and those against it JOHNSON It should be settled one way or other I cannot wish well to a popular election of the clergy when I consider that it occasions such animosities such unworthy courting of the people such slanders between the contending parties and other disadvantages It is enough to allow the people to remonstrate against the nomination of a minister for solid reasons I suppose he meant heresy or immorality He was engaged to dine abroad and asked me to return to him in the evening at nine which I accordingly did We drank tea with missus Williams who told us a story of second sight four hundred thirty eight which happened in Wales where she was born He listened to it very attentively and said he should be glad to have some instances of that faculty well authenticated His elevated wish for more and more evidence for spirit four hundred thirty nine in opposition to the groveling belief of materialism led him to a love of such mysterious disquisitions He again four hundred forty justly observed that we could have no certainty of the truth of supernatural appearances unless something was told us which we could not know by ordinary means or something done which could not be done but by supernatural power that Pharaoh in reason and justice required such evidence from Moses nay that our Saviour said If I had not done among them the works which none other man did they had not had sin four hundred forty one He had said in the morning that Macaulay s History of saint Kilda was very well written except some foppery about liberty and slavery I mentioned to him that Macaulay told me he was advised to leave out of his book the wonderful story that upon the approach of a stranger all the inhabitants catch cold four hundred forty two but that it had been so well authenticated he determined to retain it JOHNSON Sir to leave things out of a book merely because people tell you they will not be believed is meanness Macaulay acted with more magnanimity We talked of the Roman Catholick religion and how little difference there was in essential matters between ours and it JOHNSON True Sir all denominations of Christians have really little difference in point of doctrine though they may differ widely in external forms There is a prodigious difference between the external form of one of your Presbyterian churches in Scotland and a church in Italy yet the doctrine taught is essentially the same four hundred forty three I mentioned the petition to Parliament for removing the subscription to the Thirty nine Articles four hundred forty four JOHNSON It was soon thrown out Sir they talk of not making boys at the University subscribe to what they do not understand four hundred forty five but they ought to consider that our Universities were founded to bring up members for the Church of England and we must not supply our enemies with arms from our arsenal No Sir the meaning of subscribing is not that they fully understand all the articles but that they will adhere to the Church of England four hundred forty six Now take it in this way and suppose that they should only subscribe their adherence to the Church of England there would be still the same difficulty for still the young men would be subscribing to what they do not understand For if you should ask them what do you mean by the Church of England Do you know in what it differs from the Presbyterian Church from the Romish Church from the Greek Church from the Coptick Church they could not tell you So Sir it comes to the same thing BOSWELL But would it not be sufficient to subscribe the Bible four hundred forty seven JOHNSON Why no Sir for all sects will subscribe the Bible nay the Mahometans will subscribe the Bible for the Mahometans acknowledge JESUS CHRIST as well as Moses but maintain that GOD sent Mahomet as a still greater prophet than either I mentioned the motion which had been made in the House of Commons to abolish the fast of the thirtieth of January four hundred forty eight JOHNSON Why Sir I could have wished that it had been a temporary act perhaps to have expired with the century I am against abolishing it because that would be declaring it wrong to establish it but I should have no objection to make an act continuing it for another century and then letting it expire He disapproved of the Royal Marriage Bill Because said he I would not have the people think that the validity of marriage depends on the will of man or that the right of a King depends on the will of man I should not have been against making the marriage of any of the royal family without the approbation of King and Parliament highly criminal four hundred forty nine In the morning we had talked of old families and the respect due to them JOHNSON Sir you have a right to that kind of respect and are arguing for yourself I am for supporting the principle and am disinterested in doing it as I have no such right four hundred fifty BOSWELL Why Sir it is one more incitement to a man to do well JOHNSON Yes Sir and it is a matter of opinion very necessary to keep society together What is it but opinion by which we have a respect for authority that prevents us who are the rabble from rising up and pulling down you who are gentlemen from your places and saying We will be gentlemen in our turn Now Sir that respect for authority is much more easily granted to a man whose father has had it than to an upstart four hundred fifty one and so Society is more easily supported BOSWELL Perhaps Sir it might be done by the respect belonging to office as among the Romans where the dress the toga inspired reverence JOHNSON Why we know very little about the Romans But surely it is much easier to respect a man who has always had respect than to respect a man who we know was last year no better than ourselves and will be no better next year In republicks there is not a respect for authority but a fear of power BOSWELL At present Sir I think riches seem to gain most respect JOHNSON No Sir riches do not gain hearty respect they only procure external attention A very rich man from low beginnings may buy his election in a borough but caeteris paribus a man of family will be preferred People will prefer a man for whose father their fathers have voted though they should get no more money or even less That shows that the respect for family is not merely fanciful but has an actual operation If gentlemen of family would allow the rich upstarts to spend their money profusely which they are ready enough to do and not vie with them in expence the upstarts would soon be at an end and the gentlemen would remain but if the gentlemen will vie in expence with the upstarts which is very foolish they must be ruined I gave him an account of the excellent mimickry of a friend of mine in Scotland four hundred fifty two observing at the same time that some people thought it a very mean thing JOHNSON Why Sir it is making a very mean use of a man s powers But to be a good mimick requires great powers great acuteness of observation great retention of what is observed and great pliancy of organs to represent what is observed I remember a lady of quality in this town Lady who was a wonderful mimick and used to make me laugh immoderately I have heard she is now gone mad BOSWELL It is amazing how a mimick can not only give you the gestures and voice of a person whom he represents but even what a person would say on any particular subject JOHNSON Why Sir you are to consider that the manner and some particular phrases of a person do much to impress you with an idea of him and you are not sure that he would say what the mimick says in his character BOSWELL I don t think Foote four hundred fifty three a good mimick Sir JOHNSON No Sir his imitations are not like He gives you something different from himself but not the character which he means to assume He goes out of himself without going into other people He cannot take off any person unless he is strongly marked such as George Faulkner four hundred fifty four He is like a painter who can draw the portrait of a man who has a wen upon his face and who therefore is easily known If a man hops upon one leg Foote can hop upon one leg four hundred fifty five But he has not that nice discrimination which your friend seems to possess Foote is however very entertaining with a kind of conversation between wit and buffoonery four hundred fifty six On Monday March twenty three I found him busy preparing a fourth edition of his folio Dictionary mister Peyton one of his original amanuenses was writing for him I put him in mind of a meaning of the word side which he had omitted viz relationship as father s side mother s side He inserted it I asked him if humiliating was a good word He said he had seen it frequently used but he did not know it to be legitimate English He would not admit civilization but only civility four hundred fifty seven With great deference to him I thought civilization from to civilize better in the sense opposed to barbarity than civility as it is better to have a distinct word for each sense than one word with two senses which civility is in his way of using it He seemed also to be intent on some sort of chymical operation I was entertained by observing how he contrived to send mister Peyton on an errand without seeming to degrade him mister Peyton mister Peyton will you be so good as to take a walk to Temple Bar You will there see a chymist s shop at which you will be pleased to buy for me an ounce of oil of vitriol not spirit of vitriol but oil of vitriol It will cost three half pence Peyton immediately went and returned with it and told him it cost but a penny I then reminded him of the schoolmaster s cause and proposed to read to him the printed papers concerning it No Sir said he I can read quicker than I can hear So he read them to himself After he had read for some time we were interrupted by the entrance of mister Kristrom a Swede who was tutor to some young gentlemen in the city He told me that there was a very good History of Sweden by Daline Having at that time an intention of writing the history of that country four hundred fifty eight I asked doctor Johnson whether one might write a history of Sweden without going thither Yes Sir said he one for common use We talked of languages Johnson observed that Leibnitz had made some progress in a work tracing all languages up to the Hebrew Why Sir said he you would not imagine that the French jour day is derived from the Latin dies and yet nothing is more certain and the intermediate steps are very clear From dies comes diurnus Diu is by inaccurate ears or inaccurate pronunciation easily confounded with giu then the Italians form a substantive of the ablative of an adjective and thence giurno or as they make it giorno which is readily contracted into giour or jour He observed that the Bohemian language was true Sclavonick The Swede said it had some similarity with the German JOHNSON Why Sir to be sure such parts of Sclavonia as confine with Germany will borrow German words and such parts as confine with Tartary will borrow Tartar words He said he never had it properly ascertained that the Scotch Highlanders and the Irish understood each other four hundred fifty nine I told him that my cousin Colonel Graham of the Royal Highlanders whom I met at Drogheda four hundred sixty told me they did JOHNSON Sir if the Highlanders understood Irish why translate the New Testament into Erse as was done lately at Edinburgh when there is an Irish translation BOSWELL Although the Erse and Irish are both dialects of the same language there may be a good deal of diversity between them as between the different dialects in Italy The Swede went away and mister Johnson continued his reading of the papers I said I am afraid Sir it is troublesome Why Sir said he I do not take much delight in it but I ll go through it We went to the Mitre and dined in the room where he and I first supped together He gave me great hopes of my cause Sir said he the government of a schoolmaster is somewhat of the nature of military government that is to say it must be arbitrary it must be exercised by the will of one man according to particular circumstances You must shew some learning upon this occasion You must shew that a schoolmaster has a prescriptive right to beat and that an action of assault and battery cannot be admitted against him unless there is some great excess some barbarity This man has maimed none of his boys They are all left with the full exercise of their corporeal faculties In our schools in England many boys have been maimed yet I never heard of an action against a schoolmaster on that account Puffendorf I think maintains the right of a schoolmaster to beat his scholars four hundred sixty one On Saturday March twenty seven I introduced to him Sir Alexander Macdonald four hundred sixty two with whom he had expressed a wish to be acquainted He received him very courteously Sir Alexander observed that the Chancellors in England are chosen from views much inferiour to the office being chosen from temporary political views JOHNSON Why Sir in such a government as ours no man is appointed to an office because he is the fittest for it nor hardly in any other government because there are so many connections and dependencies to be studied four hundred sixty three A despotick prince may choose a man to an office merely because he is the fittest for it The King of Prussia may do it SIR A I think Sir almost all great lawyers such at least as have written upon law have known only law and nothing else JOHNSON Why no Sir Judge Hale was a great lawyer and wrote upon law and yet he knew a great many other things and has written upon other things Selden too SIR A Very true Sir and Lord Bacon But was not Lord Coke a mere lawyer JOHNSON Why I am afraid he was but he would have taken it very ill if you had told him so He would have prosecuted you for scandal BOSWELL Lord Mansfield is not a mere lawyer JOHNSON No Sir I never was in Lord Mansfield s company but Lord Mansfield was distinguished at the University Lord Mansfield when he first came to town drank champagne with the wits as Prior says four hundred sixty four He was the friend of Pope four hundred sixty five SIR A Barristers I believe are not so abusive now as they were formerly I fancy they had less law long ago and so were obliged to take to abuse to fill up the time Now they have such a number of precedents they have no occasion for abuse JOHNSON Nay Sir they had more law long ago than they have now As to precedents to be sure they will increase in course of time but the more precedents there are the less occasion is there for law that is to say the less occasion is there for investigating principles SIR A I have been correcting several Scotch accents four hundred sixty six in my friend Boswell I doubt Sir if any Scotchman ever attains to a perfect English pronunciation JOHNSON Why Sir few of them do because they do not persevere after acquiring a certain degree of it But Sir there can be no doubt that they may attain to a perfect English pronunciation if they will We find how near they come to it and certainly a man who conquers nineteen parts of the Scottish accent may conquer the twentieth But Sir when a man has got the better of nine tenths he grows weary he relaxes his diligence he finds he has corrected his accent so far as not to be disagreeable and he no longer desires his friends to tell him when he is wrong nor does he choose to be told Sir when people watch me narrowly and I do not watch myself they will find me out to be of a particular county four hundred sixty seven In the same manner Dunning four hundred sixty eight may be found out to be a Devonshire man So most Scotchmen may be found out But Sir little aberrations are of no disadvantage I never catched Mallet in a Scotch accent four hundred sixty nine and yet Mallet I suppose was past five and twenty before he came to London Upon another occasion I talked to him on this subject having myself taken some pains to improve my pronunciation by the aid of the late mister Love four hundred seventy of Drury lane theatre when he was a player at Edinburgh and also of old mister Sheridan Johnson said to me Sir your pronunciation is not offensive With this concession I was pretty well satisfied and let me give my countrymen of North Britain an advice not to aim at absolute perfection in this respect not to speak High English as we are apt to call what is far removed from the Scotch but which is by no means good English and makes the fools who use it four hundred seventy one truly ridiculous four hundred seventy two Good English is plain easy and smooth in the mouth of an unaffected English Gentleman A studied and factitious pronunciation which requires perpetual attention and imposes perpetual constraint is exceedingly disgusting A small intermixture of provincial peculiarities may perhaps have an agreeable effect as the notes of different birds concur in the harmony of the grove and please more than if they were all exactly alike I could name some gentlemen of Ireland to whom a slight proportion of the accent and recitative of that country is an advantage The same observation will apply to the gentlemen of Scotland I do not mean that we should speak as broad as a certain prosperous member of Parliament from that country four hundred seventy three though it has been well observed that it has been of no small use to him as it rouses the attention of the House by its uncommonness and is equal to tropes and figures in a good English speaker I would give as an instance of what I mean to recommend to my countrymen the pronunciation of the late Sir Gilbert Elliot four hundred seventy four and may I presume to add that of the present Earl of Marchmont four hundred seventy five who told me with great good humour that the master of a shop in London where he was not known said to him I suppose Sir you are an American Why so Sir said his Lordship Because Sir replied the shopkeeper you speak neither English nor Scotch but something different from both which I conclude is the language of America BOSWELL It may be of use Sir to have a Dictionary to ascertain the pronunciation JOHNSON Why Sir my Dictionary shows you the accents of words if you can but remember them BOSWELL But Sir we want marks to ascertain the pronunciation of the vowels Sheridan I believe has finished such a work JOHNSON Why Sir consider how much easier it is to learn a language by the ear than by any marks Sheridan s Dictionary may do very well but you cannot always carry it about with you and when you want the word you have not the Dictionary It is like a man who has a sword that will not draw It is an admirable sword to be sure but while your enemy is cutting your throat you are unable to use it Besides Sir what entitles Sheridan to fix the pronunciation of English He has in the first place the disadvantage of being an Irishman and if he says he will fix it after the example of the best company why they differ among themselves I remember an instance when I published the Plan for my Dictionary Lord Chesterfield told me that the word great should be pronounced so as to rhyme to state and Sir William Yonge sent me word that it should be pronounced so as to rhyme to seat and that none but an Irishman would pronounce it grait four hundred seventy six Now here were two men of the highest rank the one the best speaker in the House of Lords the other the best speaker in the House of Commons differing entirely I again visited him at night Finding him in a very good humour I ventured to lead him to the subject of our situation in a future state having much curiosity to know his notions on that point JOHNSON Why Sir the happiness of an unembodied spirit will consist in a consciousness of the favour of GOD in the contemplation of truth and in the possession of felicitating ideas BOSWELL But Sir is there any harm in our forming to ourselves conjectures as to the particulars of our happiness though the scripture has said but very little on the subject We know not what we shall be JOHNSON Sir there is no harm What philosophy suggests to us on this topick is probable what scripture tells us is certain doctor Henry More four hundred seventy seven has carried it as far as philosophy can You may buy both his theological and philosophical works in two volumes folio for about eight shillings BOSWELL One of the most pleasing thoughts is that we shall see our friends again JOHNSON Yes Sir but you must consider that when we are become purely rational many of our friendships will be cut off Many friendships are formed by a community of sensual pleasures all these will be cut off We form many friendships with bad men because they have agreeable qualities and they can be useful to us but after death they can no longer be of use to us We form many friendships by mistake imagining people to be different from what they really are After death we shall see every one in a true light Then Sir they talk of our meeting our relations but then all relationship is dissolved and we shall have no regard for one person more than another but for their real value However we shall either have the satisfaction of meeting our friends or be satisfied without meeting them four hundred seventy eight BOSWELL Yet Sir we see in scripture that Dives still retained an anxious concern about his brethren JOHNSON Why Sir we must either suppose that passage to be metaphorical or hold with many divines and all the Purgatorians that departed souls do not all at once arrive at the utmost perfection of which they are capable BOSWELL I think Sir that is a very rational supposition JOHNSON Why yes Sir but we do not know it is a true one There is no harm in believing it but you must not compel others to make it an article of faith for it is not revealed BOSWELL Do you think Sir it is wrong in a man who holds the doctrine of purgatory to pray for the souls of his deceased friends JOHNSON Why no Sir four hundred seventy nine BOSWELL I have been told that in the Liturgy of the Episcopal Church of Scotland there was a form of prayer for the dead JOHNSON Sir it is not in the liturgy which Laud framed for the Episcopal Church of Scotland if there is a liturgy older than that I should be glad to see it BOSWELL As to our employment in a future state the sacred writings say little The Revelation however of saint John gives us many ideas and particularly mentions musick four hundred eighty JOHNSON Why Sir ideas must be given you by means of something which you know four hundred eighty one and as to musick there are some philosophers and divines who have maintained that we shall not be spiritualized to such a degree but that something of matter very much refined will remain In that case musick may make a part of our future felicity BOSWELL I do not know whether there are any well attested stories of the appearance of ghosts You know there is a famous story of the appearance of missus Veal prefixed to Drelincourt on Death JOHNSON I believe Sir that is given up I believe the woman declared upon her death bed that it was a lie four hundred eighty two BOSWELL This objection is made against the truth of ghosts appearing that if they are in a state of happiness it would be a punishment to them to return to this world and if they are in a state of misery it would be giving them a respite JOHNSON Why Sir as the happiness or misery of embodied spirits does not depend upon place but is intellectual we cannot say that they are less happy or less miserable by appearing upon earth We went down between twelve and one to missus Williams s room and drank tea I mentioned that we were to have the remains of mister Gray in prose and verse published by mister Mason four hundred eighty three JOHNSON I think we have had enough of Gray I see they have published a splendid edition of Akenside s works One bad ode may be suffered but a number of them together makes one sick four hundred eighty four BOSWELL Akenside s distinguished poem is his Pleasures of Imagination but for my part I never could admire it so much as most people do JOHNSON Sir I could not read it through BOSWELL I have read it through but I did not find any great power in it I mentioned Elwal the heretick whose trial Sir John Pringle four hundred eighty five had given me to read JOHNSON Sir mister Elwal was I think an ironmonger at Wolverhampton and he had a mind to make himself famous by being the founder of a new sect which he wished much should be called Elwallians He held that every thing in the Old Testament that was not typical was to be of perpetual observance and so he wore a ribband in the plaits of his coat and he also wore a beard I remember I had the honour of dining in company with mister Elwal There was one Barter a miller who wrote against him and you had the controversy between mister ELWAL and mister BARTER To try to make himself distinguished he wrote a letter to King George the Second challenging him to dispute with him in which he said George if you be afraid to come by yourself to dispute with a poor old man you may bring a thousand of your black guards with you and if you should still be afraid you may bring a thousand of your red guards The letter had something of the impudence of Junius to our present King But the men of Wolverhampton were not so inflammable as the Common Council of London four hundred eighty six so mister Elwal failed in his scheme of making himself a man of great consequence four hundred eighty seven On Tuesday March thirty one he and I dined at General Paoli s A question was started whether the state of marriage was natural to man JOHNSON Sir it is so far from being natural for a man and woman to live in a state of marriage that we find all the motives which they have for remaining in that connection and the restraints which civilized society imposes to prevent separation are hardly sufficient to keep them together The General said that in a state of nature a man and woman uniting together would form a strong and constant affection by the mutual pleasure each would receive and that the same causes of dissention would not arise between them as occur between husband and wife in a civilized state JOHNSON Sir they would have dissentions enough though of another kind One would choose to go a hunting in this wood the other in that one would choose to go a fishing in this lake the other in that or perhaps one would choose to go a hunting when the other would choose to go a fishing and so they would part Besides Sir a savage man and a savage woman meet by chance and when the man sees another woman that pleases him better he will leave the first We then fell into a disquisition whether there is any beauty independent of utility The General maintained there was not doctor Johnson maintained that there was and he instanced a coffee cup which he held in his hand the painting of which was of no real use as the cup would hold the coffee equally well if plain yet the painting was beautiful We talked of the strange custom of swearing in conversation four hundred eighty eight The General said that all barbarous nations swore from a certain violence of temper that could not be confined to earth but was always reaching at the powers above He said too that there was greater variety of swearing in proportion as there was a greater variety of religious ceremonies doctor Johnson went home with me to my lodgings in Conduit street and drank tea previous to our going to the Pantheon which neither of us had seen before He said Goldsmith s Life of Parnell four hundred eighty nine is poor not that it is poorly written but that he had poor materials for nobody can write the life of a man but those who have eat and drunk and lived in social intercourse with him I said that if it was not troublesome and presuming too much I would request him to tell me all the little circumstances of his life what schools he attended when he came to Oxford when he came to London c c He did not disapprove of my curiosity as to these particulars but said They ll come out by degrees as we talk together four hundred ninety He censured Ruffhead s Life of Pope four hundred ninety one and said he knew nothing of Pope and nothing of poetry He praised doctor Joseph Warton s Essay on Pope four hundred ninety two but said he supposed we should have no more of it as the authour had not been able to persuade the world to think of Pope as he did BOSWELL Why Sir should that prevent him from continuing his work He is an ingenious Counsel who has made the most of his cause he is not obliged to gain it JOHNSON But Sir there is a difference when the cause is of a man s own making We talked of the proper use of riches JOHNSON If I were a man of a great estate I would drive all the rascals whom I did not like out of the county at an election four hundred ninety three I asked him how far he thought wealth should be employed in hospitality JOHNSON You are to consider that ancient hospitality of which we hear so much was in an uncommercial country when men being idle were glad to be entertained at rich men s tables But in a commercial country a busy country time becomes precious and therefore hospitality is not so much valued No doubt there is still room for a certain degree of it and a man has a satisfaction in seeing his friends eating and drinking around him But promiscuous hospitality is not the way to gain real influence You must help some people at table before others you must ask some people how they like their wine oftener than others You therefore offend more people than you please You are like the French statesman who said when he granted a favour J ai fait dix mecontents et un ingrat four hundred ninety four Besides Sir being entertained ever so well at a man s table impresses no lasting regard or esteem No Sir the way to make sure of power and influence is by lending money confidentially to your neighbours at a small interest or perhaps at no interest at all and having their bonds in your possession four hundred ninety five BOSWELL May not a man Sir employ his riches to advantage in educating young men of merit JOHNSON Yes Sir if they fall in your way but if it be understood that you patronize young men of merit you will be harassed with solicitations You will have numbers forced upon you who have no merit some will force them upon you from mistaken partiality and some from downright interested motives without scruple and you will be disgraced Were I a rich man I would propagate all kinds of trees that will grow in the open air A greenhouse is childish I would introduce foreign animals into the country for instance the reindeer four hundred ninety six The conversation now turned on critical subjects JOHNSON Bayes in The Rehearsal is a mighty silly character If it was intended to be like a particular man it could only be diverting while that man was remembered But I question whether it was meant for Dryden as has been reported for we know some of the passages said to be ridiculed were written since The Rehearsal at least a passage mentioned in the Preface four hundred ninety seven is of a later date I maintained that it had merit as a general satire on the self importance of dramatick authours But even in this light he held it very cheap We then walked to the Pantheon The first view of it did not strike us so much as Ranelagh of which he said the coup d oeil was the finest thing he had ever seen The truth is Ranelagh is of a more beautiful form more of it or rather indeed the whole rotunda appears at once and it is better lighted However as Johnson observed we saw the Pantheon in time of mourning when there was a dull uniformity whereas we had seen Ranelagh when the view was enlivened with a gay profusion of colours four hundred ninety eight missus Bosville four hundred ninety nine of Gunthwait in Yorkshire joined us and entered into conversation with us Johnson said to me afterwards Sir this is a mighty intelligent lady I said there was not half a guinea s worth of pleasure in seeing this place JOHNSON But Sir there is half a guinea s worth of inferiority to other people in not having seen it BOSWELL I doubt Sir whether there are many happy people here JOHNSON Yes Sir there are many happy people here There are many people here who are watching hundreds and who think hundreds are watching them five hundred Happening to meet Sir Adam Fergusson five hundred one I presented him to doctor Johnson Sir Adam expressed some apprehension that the Pantheon would encourage luxury Sir said Johnson I am a great friend to publick amusements for they keep people from vice You now addressing himself to me would have been with a wench had you not been here O I forgot you were married Sir Adam suggested that luxury corrupts a people and destroys the spirit of liberty JOHNSON Sir that is all visionary I would not give half a guinea to live under one form of government rather than another It is of no moment to the happiness of an individual five hundred two Sir the danger of the abuse of power is nothing to a private man What Frenchman is prevented from passing his life as he pleases SIR ADAM But Sir in the British constitution it is surely of importance to keep up a spirit in the people so as to preserve a balance against the crown JOHNSON Sir I perceive you are a vile Whig Why all this childish jealousy of the power of the crown The crown has not power enough When I say that all governments are alike I consider that in no government power can be abused long Mankind will not bear it If a sovereign oppresses his people to a great degree they will rise and cut off his head There is a remedy in human nature against tyranny that will keep us safe under every form of government five hundred three Had not the people of France thought themselves honoured as sharing in the brilliant actions of Lewis XIV they would not have endured him and we may say the same of the King of Prussia s people Sir Adam introduced the ancient Greeks and Romans JOHNSON Sir the mass of both of them were barbarians The mass of every people must be barbarous where there is no printing and consequently knowledge is not generally diffused Knowledge is diffused among our people by the news papers five hundred four Sir Adam mentioned the orators poets and artists of Greece JOHNSON Sir I am talking of the mass of the people We see even what the boasted Athenians were The little effect which Demosthenes s orations had upon them shews that they were barbarians five hundred five Sir Adam was unlucky in his topicks for he suggested a doubt of the propriety of Bishops having seats in the House of Lords JOHNSON How so Sir Who is more proper for having the dignity of a peer than a Bishop provided a Bishop be what he ought to be and if improper Bishops be made that is not the fault of the Bishops but of those who make them On Sunday April five after attending divine service at saint Paul s church I found him alone Of a schoolmaster five hundred six of his acquaintance a native of Scotland he said He has a great deal of good about him but he is also very defective in some respects His inner part is good but his outer part is mighty aukward You in Scotland do not attain that nice critical skill in languages which we get in our schools in England I would not put a boy to him whom I intended for a man of learning But for the sons of citizens who are to learn a little get good morals and then go to trade he may do very well I mentioned a cause in which I had appeared as counsel at the bar of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland where a Probationer five hundred seven as one licensed to preach but not yet ordained is called was opposed in his application to be inducted because it was alledged that he had been guilty of fornication five years before JOHNSON Why Sir if he has repented it is not a sufficient objection A man who is good enough to go to heaven is good enough to be a clergyman This was a humane and liberal sentiment But the character of a clergyman is more sacred than that of an ordinary Christian As he is to instruct with authority he should be regarded with reverence as one upon whom divine truth has had the effect to set him above such transgressions as men less exalted by spiritual habits and yet upon the whole not to be excluded from heaven have been betrayed into by the predominance of passion That clergymen may be considered as sinners in general as all men are cannot be denied but this reflection will not counteract their good precepts so much as the absolute knowledge of their having been guilty of certain specifick immoral acts I told him that by the rules of the Church of Scotland in their Book of Discipline if a scandal as it is called is not prosecuted for five years it cannot afterwards be proceeded upon unless it be of a heinous nature or again become flagrant and that hence a question arose whether fornication was a sin of a heinous nature and that I had maintained that it did not deserve that epithet in as much as it was not one of those sins which argue very great depravity of heart in short was not in the general acceptation of mankind a heinous sin JOHNSON No Sir it is not a heinous sin A heinous sin is that for which a man is punished with death or banishment five hundred eight BOSWELL But Sir after I had argued that it was not an heinous sin an old clergyman rose up and repeating the text of scripture denouncing judgement against whoremongers five hundred nine asked whether considering this there could be any doubt of fornication being a heinous sin JOHNSON Why Sir observe the word whoremonger Every sin if persisted in will become heinous Whoremonger is a dealer in whores five hundred ten as ironmonger is a dealer in iron But as you don t call a man an ironmonger for buying and selling a pen knife so you don t call a man a whoremonger for getting one wench with child five hundred eleven I spoke of the inequality of the livings of the clergy in England and the scanty provisions of some of the Curates JOHNSON Why yes Sir but it cannot be helped You must consider that the revenues of the clergy are not at the disposal of the state like the pay of the army Different men have founded different churches and some are better endowed some worse The State cannot interfere and make an equal division of what has been particularly appropriated Now when a clergyman has but a small living or even two small livings he can afford very little to a curate He said he went more frequently to church when there were prayers only than when there was also a sermon as the people required more an example for the one than the other it being much easier for them to hear a sermon than to fix their minds on prayer On Monday April six I dined with him at Sir Alexander Macdonald s where was a young officer in the regimentals of the Scots Royal who talked with a vivacity fluency and precision so uncommon that he attracted particular attention He proved to be the Honourable Thomas Erskine youngest brother to the Earl of Buchan who has since risen into such brilliant reputation at the bar in Westminster hall five hundred twelve Fielding being mentioned Johnson exclaimed he was a blockhead five hundred thirteen and upon my expressing my astonishment at so strange an assertion he said What I mean by his being a blockhead is that he was a barren rascal BOSWELL Will you not allow Sir that he draws very natural pictures of human life JOHNSON Why Sir it is of very low life Richardson used to say that had he not known who Fielding was he should have believed he was an ostler five hundred fourteen Sir there is more knowledge of the heart in one letter of Richardson s than in all Tom Jones five hundred fifteen I indeed never read Joseph Andrews five hundred sixteen ERSKINE Surely Sir Richardson is very tedious JOHNSON Why Sir if you were to read Richardson for the story your impatience would be so much fretted that you would hang yourself five hundred seventeen But you must read him for the sentiment and consider the story as only giving occasion to the sentiment I have already given my opinion of Fielding but I cannot refrain from repeating here my wonder at Johnson s excessive and unaccountable depreciation of one of the best writers that England has produced Tom Jones has stood the test of publick opinion with such success as to have established its great merit both for the story the sentiments and the manners and also the varieties of diction so as to leave no doubt of its having an animated truth of execution throughout five hundred eighteen A book of travels lately published under the title of Coriat Junior and written by mister Paterson five hundred nineteen was mentioned Johnson said this book was an imitation of Sterne five hundred twenty and not of Coriat whose name Paterson had chosen as a whimsical one Tom Coriat said he was a humourist about the court of James the First He had a mixture of learning of wit and of buffoonery He first travelled through Europe and published his travels five hundred twenty one He afterwards travelled on foot through Asia and had made many remarks but he died at Mandoa and his remarks were lost We talked of gaming and animadverted on it with severity JOHNSON Nay gentlemen let us not aggravate the matter It is not roguery to play with a man who is ignorant of the game while you are master of it and so win his money for he thinks he can play better than you as you think you can play better than he and the superiour skill carries it ERSKINE He is a fool but you are not a rogue JOHNSON That s much about the truth Sir It must be considered that a man who only does what every one of the society to which he belongs would do is not a dishonest man In the republick of Sparta it was agreed that stealing was not dishonourable if not discovered I do not commend a society where there is an agreement that what would not otherwise be fair shall be fair but I maintain that an individual of any society who practises what is allowed is not a dishonest man BOSWELL So then Sir you do not think ill of a man who wins perhaps forty thousand pounds in a winter JOHNSON Sir I do not call a gamester a dishonest man but I call him an unsocial man an unprofitable man Gaming is a mode of transferring property without producing any intermediate good Trade gives employment to numbers and so produces intermediate good mister Erskine told us that when he was in the island of Minorca he not only read prayers but preached two sermons to the regiment five hundred twenty two He seemed to object to the passage in scripture where we are told that the angel of the Lord smote in one night forty thousand Assyrians five hundred twenty three Sir said Johnson you should recollect that there was a supernatural interposition they were destroyed by pestilence You are not to suppose that the angel of the LORD went about and stabbed each of them with a dagger or knocked them on the head man by man After mister Erskine was gone a discussion took place whether the present Earl of Buchan when Lord Cardross did right to refuse to go Secretary of the Embassy to Spain when Sir James Gray a man of inferiour rank went Ambassadour five hundred twenty four doctor Johnson said that perhaps in point of interest he did wrong but in point of dignity he did well Sir Alexander insisted that he was wrong and said that mister Pitt intended it as an advantageous thing for him Why Sir said Johnson mister Pitt might think it an advantageous thing for him to make him a vintner and get him all the Portugal trade but he would have demeaned himself strangely had he accepted of such a situation Sir had he gone Secretary while his inferiour was Ambassadour he would have been a traitor to his rank and family I talked of the little attachment which subsisted between near relations in London Sir said Johnson in a country so commercial as ours where every man can do for himself there is not so much occasion for that attachment No man is thought the worse of here whose brother was hanged In uncommercial countries many of the branches of a family must depend on the stock so in order to make the head of the family take care of them they are represented as connected with his reputation that self love being interested he may exert himself to promote their interest You have first large circles or clans as commerce increases the connection is confined to families By degrees that too goes off as having become unnecessary and there being few opportunities of intercourse One brother is a merchant in the city and another is an officer in the guards How little intercourse can these two have I argued warmly for the old feudal system five hundred twenty five Sir Alexander opposed it and talked of the pleasure of seeing all men free and independent JOHNSON I agree with mister Boswell that there must be a high satisfaction in being a feudal Lord but we are to consider that we ought not to wish to have a number of men unhappy for the satisfaction of one five hundred twenty six I maintained that numbers namely the vassals or followers were not unhappy for that there was a reciprocal satisfaction between the Lord and them he being kind in his authority over them they being respectful and faithful to him On Thursday April nine I called on him to beg he would go and dine with me at the Mitre tavern He had resolved not to dine at all this day I know not for what reason and I was so unwilling to be deprived of his company that I was content to submit to suffer a want which was at first somewhat painful but he soon made me forget it and a man is always pleased with himself when he finds his intellectual inclinations predominate He observed that to reason philosophically on the nature of prayer was very unprofitable Talking of ghosts five hundred twenty seven he said he knew one friend who was an honest man and a sensible man who told him he had seen a ghost old mister Edward Cave the printer at saint John s Gate He said mister Cave did not like to talk of it and seemed to be in great horrour whenever it was mentioned BOSWELL Pray Sir what did he say was the appearance JOHNSON Why Sir something of a shadowy being I mentioned witches and asked him what they properly meant JOHNSON Why Sir they properly mean those who make use of the aid of evil spirits BOSWELL There is no doubt Sir a general report and belief of their having existed five hundred twenty eight JOHNSON You have not only the general report and belief but you have many voluntary solemn confessions He did not affirm anything positively upon a subject which it is the fashion of the times to laugh at as a matter of absurd credulity He only seemed willing as a candid enquirer after truth however strange and inexplicable to shew that he understood what might be urged for it five hundred twenty nine On Friday April ten I dined with him at General Oglethorpe s where we found doctor Goldsmith Armorial bearings having been mentioned Johnson said they were as ancient as the siege of Thebes which he proved by a passage in one of the tragedies of Euripides five hundred thirty I started the question whether duelling was consistent with moral duty The brave old General fired at this and said with a lofty air Undoubtedly a man has a right to defend his honour GOLDSMITH turning to me I ask you first Sir what would you do if you were affronted I answered I should think it necessary to fight five hundred thirty one Why then replied Goldsmith that solves the question JOHNSON No Sir it does not solve the question It does not follow that what a man would do is therefore right I said I wished to have it settled whether duelling was contrary to the laws of Christianity Johnson immediately entered on the subject and treated it in a masterly manner and so far as I have been able to recollect his thoughts were these Sir as men become in a high degree refined various causes of offence arise which are considered to be of such importance that life must be staked to atone for them though in reality they are not so A body that has received a very fine polish may be easily hurt Before men arrive at this artificial refinement if one tells his neighbour he lies his neighbour tells him he lies if one gives his neighbour a blow his neighbour gives him a blow but in a state of highly polished society an affront is held to be a serious injury It must therefore be resented or rather a duel must be fought upon it as men have agreed to banish from their society one who puts up with an affront without fighting a duel Now Sir it is never unlawful to fight in self defence He then who fights a duel does not fight from passion against his antagonist but out of self defence to avert the stigma of the world and to prevent himself from being driven out of society I could wish there was not that superfluity of refinement but while such notions prevail no doubt a man may lawfully fight a duel five hundred thirty two Let it be remembered that this justification is applicable only to the person who receives an affront All mankind must condemn the aggressor The General told us that when he was a very young man I think only fifteen five hundred thirty three serving under Prince Eugene of Savoy he was sitting in a company at table with a Prince of Wirtemberg The Prince took up a glass of wine and by a fillip made some of it fly in Oglethorpe s face Here was a nice dilemma To have challenged him instantly might have fixed a quarrelsome character upon the young soldier to have taken no notice of it might have been considered as cowardice Oglethorpe therefore keeping his eye upon the Prince and smiling all the time as if he took what his Highness had done in jest said Man Prince I forget the French words he used the purport however was That s a good joke but we do it much better in England and threw a whole glass of wine in the Prince s face An old General who sat by said Il a bien fait mon Prince vous l avez commence and thus all ended in good humour doctor Johnson said Pray General give us an account of the siege of Belgrade five hundred thirty four Upon which the General pouring a little wine upon the table described every thing with a wet finger Here we were here were the Turks c c Johnson listened with the closest attention A question was started how far people who disagree in a capital point can live in friendship together Johnson said they might Goldsmith said they could not as they had not the idem velle atque idem nolle five hundred thirty five the same likings and the same aversions JOHNSON Why Sir you must shun the subject as to which you disagree For instance I can live very well with Burke I love his knowledge his genius his diffusion and affluence of conversation but I would not talk to him of the Rockingham party GOLDSMITH But Sir when people live together who have something as to which they disagree and which they want to shun they will be in the situation mentioned in the story of Bluebeard You may look into all the chambers but one But we should have the greatest inclination to look into that chamber to talk of that subject JOHNSON with a loud voice Sir I am not saying that you could live in friendship with a man from whom you differ as to some point I am only saying that I could do it You put me in mind of Sappho in Ovid five hundred thirty six Goldsmith told us that he was now busy in writing a natural history five hundred thirty seven and that he might have full leisure for it he had taken lodgings at a farmer s house near to the six mile stone on the Edgeware road and had carried down his books in two returned post chaises He said he believed the farmer s family thought him an odd character similar to that in which the Spectator appeared to his landlady and her children he was The Gentleman five hundred thirty eight mister Mickle the translator of The Lusiad five hundred thirty nine and I went to visit him at this place a few days afterwards He was not at home but having a curiosity to see his apartment we went in and found curious scraps of descriptions of animals scrawled upon the wall with a black lead pencil five hundred forty The subject of ghosts being introduced Johnson repeated what he had told me of a friend of his an honest man and a man of sense having asserted to him that he had seen an apparition five hundred forty one Goldsmith told us he was assured by his brother the Reverend mister Goldsmith that he also had seen one General Oglethorpe told us that Prendergast an officer in the Duke of Marlborough s army had mentioned to many of his friends that he should die on a particular day That upon that day a battle took place with the French that after it was over and Prendergast was still alive his brother officers while they were yet in the field jestingly asked him where was his prophecy now Prendergast gravely answered I shall die notwithstanding what you see Soon afterwards there came a shot from a French battery to which the orders for a cessation of arms had not yet reached and he was killed upon the spot Colonel Cecil who took possession of his effects found in his pocket book the following solemn entry Here the date Dreamt or five hundred forty two Sir John Friend meets me here the very day on which he was killed was mentioned Prendergast had been connected with Sir John Friend who was executed for high treason General Oglethorpe said he was with Colonel Cecil when Pope came and enquired into the truth of this story which made a great noise at the time and was then confirmed by the Colonel On Saturday April eleven he appointed me to come to him in the evening when he should be at leisure to give me some assistance for the defence of Hastie the schoolmaster of Campbelltown for whom I was to appear in the House of Lords 
5186_7793_000001_000001	train-clean-360	When I came I found him unwilling to exert himself I pressed him to write down his thoughts upon the subject 
5186_7793_000001_000002	train-clean-360	He said There s no occasion for my writing 
5186_7793_000001_000003	train-clean-360	I ll talk to you He was however at last prevailed on to dictate to me while I wrote as follows 
5186_7793_000002_000000	train-clean-360	 The charge is that he has used immoderate and cruel correction Correction in itself is not cruel children being not reasonable can be governed only by fear 
none	none	To impress this fear is therefore one of the first duties of those who have the care of children It is the duty of a parent and has never been thought inconsistent with parental tenderness It is the duty of a master who is in his highest exaltation when he is loco parentis 
5186_7793_000002_000004	train-clean-360	Yet as good things become evil by excess correction by being immoderate may become cruel 
none	none	But when is correction immoderate When it is more frequent or more severe than is required ad monendum et docendum for reformation and instruction No severity is cruel which obstinacy makes necessary for the greatest cruelty would be to desist and leave the scholar too careless for instruction and too much hardened for reproof Locke in his treatise of Education mentions a mother with applause who whipped an infant eight times before she had subdued it for had she stopped at the seventh act of correction her daughter says he would have been ruined five hundred forty three The degrees of obstinacy in young minds are very different as different must be the degrees of persevering severity 
5186_7793_000002_000010	train-clean-360	A stubborn scholar must be corrected till he is subdued 
none	none	The discipline of a school is military There must be either unbounded licence or absolute authority The master who punishes not only consults the future happiness of him who is the immediate subject of correction but he propagates obedience through the whole school and establishes regularity by exemplary justice The victorious obstinacy of a single boy would make his future endeavours of reformation or instruction totally ineffectual Obstinacy therefore must never be victorious Yet it is well known that there sometimes occurs a sullen and hardy resolution that laughs at all common punishment and bids defiance to all common degrees of pain 
5186_7793_000002_000016	train-clean-360	Correction must be proportioned to occasions 
none	none	The flexible will be reformed by gentle discipline and the refractory must be subdued by harsher methods 
5186_7793_000002_000018	train-clean-360	The degrees of scholastick as of military punishment no stated rules can ascertain It must be enforced till it overpowers temptation till stubbornness becomes flexible and perverseness regular 
none	none	Custom and reason have indeed set some bounds to scholastick penalties The schoolmaster inflicts no capital punishments nor enforces his edicts by either death or mutilation The civil law has wisely determined that a master who strikes at a scholar s eye shall be considered as criminal But punishments however severe that produce no lasting evil may be just and reasonable because they may be necessary Such have been the punishments used by the respondent 
5186_7793_000002_000024	train-clean-360	No scholar has gone from him either blind or lame or with any of his limbs or powers injured or impaired They were irregular and he punished them they were obstinate and he enforced his punishment 
none	none	But however provoked he never exceeded the limits of moderation for he inflicted nothing beyond present pain and how much of that was required no man is so little able to determine as those who have determined against him the parents of the offenders 
5186_7793_000002_000026	train-clean-360	It has been said that he used unprecedented and improper instruments of correction 
5186_7793_000002_000027	train-clean-360	Of this accusation the meaning is not very easy to be found No instrument of correction is more proper than another but as it is better adapted to produce present pain without lasting mischief Whatever were his instruments no lasting mischief has ensued and therefore however unusual in hands so cautious they were proper 
none	none	It has been objected that the respondent admits the charge of cruelty by producing no evidence to confute it Let it be considered that his scholars are either dispersed at large in the world or continue to inhabit the place in which they were bred Those who are dispersed cannot be found those who remain are the sons of his persecutors and are not likely to support a man to whom their fathers are enemies If it be supposed that the enmity of their fathers proves the justice of the charge it must be considered how often experience shews us that men who are angry on one ground will accuse on another with how little kindness in a town of low trade a man who lives by learning is regarded and how implicitly where the inhabitants are not very rich a rich man is hearkened to and followed 
5186_7793_000002_000032	train-clean-360	In a place like Campbelltown it is easy for one of the principal inhabitants to make a party 
none	none	It is easy for that party to heat themselves with imaginary grievances It is easy for them to oppress a man poorer than themselves and natural to assert the dignity of riches by persisting in oppression The argument which attempts to prove the impropriety of restoring him to the school by alledging that he has lost the confidence of the people is not the subject of juridical consideration for he is to suffer if he must suffer not for their judgement but for his own actions It may be convenient for them to have another master but it is a convenience of their own making It would be likewise convenient for him to find another school but this convenience he cannot obtain The question is not what is now convenient but what is generally right If the people of Campbelltown be distressed by the restoration of the respondent they are distressed only by their own fault by turbulent passions and unreasonable desires by tyranny which law has defeated and by malice which virtue has surmounted This Sir said he you are to turn in your mind and make the best use of it you can in your speech Of our friend Goldsmith he said Sir he is so much afraid of being unnoticed that he often talks merely lest you should forget that he is in the company BOSWELL Yes he stands forward JOHNSON True Sir but if a man is to stand forward he should wish to do it not in an aukward posture not in rags not so as that he shall only be exposed to ridicule BOSWELL For my part I like very well to hear honest Goldsmith talk away carelessly JOHNSON Why yes Sir but he should not like to hear himself On Tuesday April fourteen the decree of the Court of Session in the schoolmaster s cause was reversed in the House of Lords after a very eloquent speech by Lord Mansfield who shewed himself an adept in school discipline but I thought was too rigorous towards my client five hundred forty four On the evening of the next day I supped with doctor Johnson at the Crown and Anchor tavern in the Strand in company with mister Langton and his brother in law Lord Binning I repeated a sentence of Lord Mansfield s speech of which by the aid of mister Longlands the solicitor on the other side who obligingly allowed me to compare his note with my own I have a full copy My Lords severity is not the way to govern either boys or men Nay said Johnson it is the way to govern them I know not whether it be the way to mend them I talked of the recent expulsion of six students from the University of Oxford who were methodists and would not desist from publickly praying and exhorting five hundred forty five JOHNSON Sir that expulsion was extremely just and proper five hundred forty six What have they to do at an University who are not willing to be taught but will presume to teach Where is religion to be learnt but at an University Sir they were examined and found to be mighty ignorant fellows BOSWELL But was it not hard Sir to expel them for I am told they were good beings JOHNSON I believe they might be good beings but they were not fit to be in the University of Oxford five hundred forty seven A cow is a very good animal in the field but we turn her out of a garden Lord Elibank used to repeat this as an illustration uncommonly happy Desirous of calling Johnson forth to talk and exercise his wit though I should myself be the object of it I resolutely ventured to undertake the defence of convivial indulgence in wine though he was not to night in the most genial humour five hundred forty eight After urging the common plausible topicks I at last had recourse to the maxim in vino veritas a man who is well warmed with wine will speak truth five hundred forty nine JOHNSON Why Sir that may be an argument for drinking if you suppose men in general to be liars But Sir I would not keep company with a fellow who lyes as long as he is sober and whom you must make drunk before you can get a word of truth out of him five hundred fifty mister Langton told us he was about to establish a school upon his estate but it had been suggested to him that it might have a tendency to make the people less industrious JOHNSON No Sir While learning to read and write is a distinction the few who have that distinction may be the less inclined to work but when every body learns to read and write it is no longer a distinction five hundred fifty one A man who has a laced waistcoat is too fine a man to work but if every body had laced waistcoats we should have people working in laced waistcoats There are no people whatever more industrious none who work more than our manufacturers five hundred fifty two yet they have all learnt to read and write Sir you must not neglect doing a thing immediately good from fear of remote evil from fear of its being abused five hundred fifty three A man who has candles may sit up too late which he would not do if he had not candles but nobody will deny that the art of making candles by which light is continued to us beyond the time that the sun gives us light is a valuable art and ought to be preserved BOSWELL But Sir would it not be better to follow Nature and go to bed and rise just as nature gives us light or with holds it JOHNSON No Sir for then we should have no kind of equality in the partition of our time between sleeping and waking It would be very different in different seasons and in different places In some of the northern parts of Scotland how little light is there in the depth of winter We talked of Tacitus five hundred fifty four and I hazarded an opinion that with all his merit for penetration shrewdness of judgement and terseness of expression he was too compact too much broken into hints as it were and therefore too difficult to be understood To my great satisfaction doctor Johnson sanctioned this opinion Tacitus Sir seems to me rather to have made notes for an historical work than to have written a history five hundred fifty five At this time it appears from his Prayers and Meditations that he had been more than commonly diligent in religious duties particularly in reading the Holy Scriptures It was Passion Week that solemn season which the Christian world has appropriated to the commemoration of the mysteries of our redemption and during which whatever embers of religion are in our breasts will be kindled into pious warmth I paid him short visits both on Friday and Saturday and seeing his large folio Greek Testament before him beheld him with a reverential awe and would not intrude upon his time five hundred fifty six While he was thus employed to such good purpose and while his friends in their intercourse with him constantly found a vigorous intellect and a lively imagination it is melancholy to read in his private register My mind is unsettled and my memory confused I have of late turned my thoughts with a very useless earnestness upon past incidents I have yet got no command over my thoughts an unpleasing incident is almost certain to hinder my rest five hundred fifty seven What philosophick heroism was it in him to appear with such manly fortitude to the world while he was inwardly so distressed We may surely believe that the mysterious principle of being made perfect through suffering five hundred fifty eight was to be strongly exemplified in him On Sunday April nineteen being Easter day General Paoli and I paid him a visit before dinner We talked of the notion that blind persons can distinguish colours by the touch Johnson said that Professor Sanderson five hundred fifty nine mentions his having attempted to do it but that he found he was aiming at an impossibility that to be sure a difference in the surface makes the difference of colours but that difference is so fine that it is not sensible to the touch The General mentioned jugglers and fraudulent gamesters who could know cards by the touch 
5186_7793_000012_000004	train-clean-360	doctor Johnson said the cards used by such persons must be less polished than ours commonly are 
5186_7793_000013_000000	train-clean-360	We talked of sounds 
none	none	The General said there was no beauty in a simple sound but only in an harmonious composition of sounds I presumed to differ from this opinion and mentioned the soft and sweet sound of a fine woman s voice JOHNSON No Sir if a serpent or a toad uttered it you would think it ugly BOSWELL So you would think Sir were a beautiful tune to be uttered by one of those animals JOHNSON No Sir it would be admired We have seen fine fiddlers whom we liked as little as toads laughing Talking on the subject of taste in the arts he said that difference of taste was in truth difference of skill five hundred sixty BOSWELL But Sir is there not a quality called taste five hundred sixty one which consists merely in perception or in liking For instance we find people differ much as to what is the best style of English composition 
5186_7793_000014_000004	train-clean-360	Some think Swift s the best others prefer a fuller and grander way of writing JOHNSON Sir you must first define what you mean by style before you can judge who has a good taste in style and who has a bad 
none	none	The two classes of persons whom you have mentioned don t differ as to good and bad They both agree that Swift has a good neat style five hundred sixty two but one loves a neat style another loves a style of more splendour In like manner one loves a plain coat another loves a laced coat but neither will deny that each is good in its kind While I remained in London this spring I was with him at several other times both by himself and in company I dined with him one day at the Crown and Anchor tavern in the Strand with Lord Elibank mister Langton and doctor Vansittart of Oxford Without specifying each particular day I have preserved the following memorable things I regretted the reflection in his Preface to Shakspeare against Garrick to whom we cannot but apply the following passage I collated such copies as I could procure and wished for more but have not found the collectors of these rarities very communicative five hundred sixty three I told him that Garrick had complained to me of it and had vindicated himself by assuring me that Johnson was made welcome to the full use of his collection and that he left the key of it with a servant with orders to have a fire and every convenience for him I found Johnson s notion was that Garrick wanted to be courted for them and that on the contrary Garrick should have courted him and sent him the plays of his own accord But indeed considering the slovenly and careless manner in which books were treated by Johnson it could not be expected that scarce and valuable editions should have been lent to him five hundred sixty four A gentleman five hundred sixty five having to some of the usual arguments for drinking added this You know Sir drinking drives away care and makes us forget whatever is disagreeable Would not you allow a man to drink for that reason JOHNSON Yes Sir if he sat next you 
5186_7793_000018_000000	train-clean-360	I expressed a liking for mister Francis Osborne s works and asked him what he thought of that writer 
5186_7793_000018_000001	train-clean-360	He answered A conceited fellow 
none	none	Were a man to write so now the boys would throw stones at him He however did not alter my opinion of a favourite authour to whom I was first directed by his being quoted in The Spectator five hundred sixty six and in whom I have found much shrewd and lively sense expressed indeed in a style somewhat quaint which however I do not dislike His book has an air of originality We figure to ourselves an ancient gentleman talking to us When one of his friends endeavoured to maintain that a country gentleman might contrive to pass his life very agreeably Sir said he you cannot give me an instance of any man who is permitted to lay out his own time contriving not to have tedious hours five hundred sixty seven This observation however is equally applicable to gentlemen who live in cities and are of no profession He said there is no permanent national character it varies according to circumstances Alexander the Great swept India now the Turks sweep Greece A learned gentleman who in the course of conversation wished to inform us of this simple fact that the Counsel upon the circuit at Shrewsbury were much bitten by fleas took I suppose seven or eight minutes in relating it circumstantially He in a plenitude of phrase told us that large bales of woollen cloth were lodged in the town hall that by reason of this fleas nestled there in prodigious numbers that the lodgings of the counsel were near to the town hall and that those little animals moved from place to place with wonderful agility Johnson sat in great impatience till the gentleman had finished his tedious narrative and then burst out playfully however It is a pity Sir that you have not seen a lion for a flea has taken you such a time that a lion must have served you a twelve month five hundred sixty eight He would not allow Scotland to derive any credit from Lord Mansfield for he was educated in England Much said he may be made of a Scotchman if he be caught young five hundred sixty nine Talking of a modern historian and a modern moralist he said There is more thought in the moralist than in the historian There is but a shallow stream of thought in history BOSWELL But surely Sir an historian has reflection JOHNSON Why yes Sir and so has a cat when she catches a mouse for her kitten But she cannot write like neither can five hundred seventy He said I am very unwilling to read the manuscripts of authours and give them my opinion five hundred seventy one 
5186_7793_000024_000001	train-clean-360	If the authours who apply to me have money I bid them boldly print without a name if they have written in order to get money I tell them to go to the booksellers and make the best bargain they can BOSWELL But Sir if a bookseller should bring you a manuscript to look at JOHNSON Why Sir I would desire the bookseller to take it away 
none	none	I mentioned a friend of mine who had resided long in Spain and was unwilling to return to Britain JOHNSON
5186_7793_000025_000002	train-clean-360	 Sir he is attached to some woman BOSWELL I rather believe Sir it is the fine climate which keeps him there JOHNSON Nay Sir how can you talk so 
none	none	What is climate to happiness five hundred seventy two Place me in the heart of Asia should I not be exiled 
5186_7793_000025_000005	train-clean-360	What proportion does climate bear to the complex system of human life 
none	none	You may advise me to go to live at Bologna to eat sausages The sausages there are the best in the world they lose much by being carried On Saturday May nine mister Dempster five hundred seventy three and I had agreed to dine by ourselves at the British Coffee house Johnson on whom I happened to call in the morning said he would join us which he did and we spent a very agreeable day though I recollect but little of what passed 
5186_7793_000027_000000	train-clean-360	He said Walpole was a minister given by the King to the people Pitt was a minister given by the people to the King as an adjunct 
none	none	The misfortune of Goldsmith in conversation is this he goes on without knowing how he is to get off His genius is great but his knowledge is small As they say of a generous man it is a pity he is not rich we may say of Goldsmith it is a pity he is not knowing He would not keep his knowledge to himself Before leaving London this year I consulted him upon a question purely of Scotch law It was held of old and continued for a long period to be an established principle in that law that whoever intermeddled with the effects of a person deceased without the interposition of legal authority to guard against embezzlement should be subjected to pay all the debts of the deceased as having been guilty of what was technically called vicious intromission The Court of Session had gradually relaxed the strictness of this principle where the interference proved had been inconsiderable In a case five hundred seventy four which came before that Court the preceding winter I had laboured to persuade the Judges to return to the ancient law It was my own sincere opinion that they ought to adhere to it but I had exhausted all my powers of reasoning in vain Johnson thought as I did and in order to assist me in my application to the Court for a revision and alteration of the judgement he dictated to me the following argument This we are told is a law which has its force only from the long practice of the Court and may therefore be suspended or modified as the Court shall think proper Concerning the power of the Court to make or to suspend a law we have no intention to inquire It is sufficient for our purpose that every just law is dictated by reason and that the practice of every legal Court is regulated by equity It is the quality of reason to be invariable and constant and of equity to give to one man what in the same case is given to another The advantage which humanity derives from law is this that the law gives every man a rule of action and prescribes a mode of conduct which shall entitle him to the support and protection of society That the law may be a rule of action it is necessary that it be known it is necessary that it be permanent and stable 
5186_7793_000031_000005	train-clean-360	The law is the measure of civil right but if the measure be changeable the extent of the thing measured never can be settled 
5186_7793_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 To permit a law to be modified at discretion is to leave the community without law 
none	none	It is to withdraw the direction of that publick wisdom by which the deficiencies of private understanding are to be supplied It is to suffer the rash and ignorant to act at discretion and then to depend for the legality of that action on the sentence of the Judge He that is thus governed lives not by law but by opinion not by a certain rule to which he can apply his intention before he acts but by an uncertain and variable opinion which he can never know but after he has committed the act on which that opinion shall be passed He lives by a law if a law it be which he can never know before he has offended it To this case may be justly applied that important principle misera est servitus ubi jus est aut incognitum aut vagum If Intromission be not criminal till it exceeds a certain point and that point be unsettled and consequently different in different minds the right of Intromission and the right of the Creditor arising from it are all jura vaga and by consequence are jura incognita and the result can be no other than a misera servitus an uncertainty concerning the event of action a servile dependence on private opinion It may be urged and with great plausibility that there may be Intromission without fraud which however true will by no means justify an occasional and arbitrary relaxation of the law The end of law is protection as well as vengeance Indeed vengeance is never used but to strengthen protection That society only is well governed where life is freed from danger and from suspicion where possession is so sheltered by salutary prohibitions that violation is prevented more frequently than punished Such a prohibition was this while it operated with its original force The creditor of the deceased was not only without loss but without fear He was not to seek a remedy for an injury suffered for injury was warded off As the law has been sometimes administered it lays us open to wounds because it is imagined to have the power of healing To punish fraud when it is detected is the proper act of vindictive justice but to prevent frauds and make punishment unnecessary is the great employment of legislative wisdom 
5186_7793_000034_000002	train-clean-360	To permit Intromission and to punish fraud is to make law no better than a pitfall 
none	none	To tread upon the brink is safe but to come a step further is destruction But surely it is better to enclose the gulf and hinder all access than by encouraging us to advance a little to entice us afterwards a little further and let us perceive our folly only by our destruction As law supplies the weak with adventitious strength it likewise enlightens the ignorant with extrinsick understanding Law teaches us to know when we commit injury and when we suffer it It fixes certain marks upon actions by which we are admonished to do or to forbear them Qui sibi bene temperat in licitis says one of the fathers nunquam cadet in illicita He who never intromits at all will never intromit with fraudulent intentions The relaxation of the law against vicious intromission has been very favourably represented by a great master of jurisprudence five hundred seventy five whose words have been exhibited with unnecessary pomp and seem to be considered as irresistibly decisive The great moment of his authority makes it necessary to examine his position Some ages ago says he before the ferocity of the inhabitants of this part of the island was subdued the utmost severity of the civil law was necessary to restrain individuals from plundering each other Thus the man who intermeddled irregularly with the moveables of a person deceased was subjected to all the debts of the deceased without limitation This makes a branch of the law of Scotland known by the name of vicious intromission and so rigidly was this regulation applied in our Courts of Law that the most trifling moveable abstracted mala fide subjected the intermeddler to the foregoing consequences which proved in many instances a most rigorous punishment But this severity was necessary in order to subdue the undisciplined nature of our people It is extremely remarkable that in proportion to our improvement in manners this regulation has been gradually softened and applied by our sovereign Court with a sparing hand I find myself under a necessity of observing that this learned and judicious writer has not accurately distinguished the deficiencies and demands of the different conditions of human life which from a degree of savageness and independence in which all laws are vain passes or may pass by innumerable gradations to a state of reciprocal benignity in which laws shall be no longer necessary Men are first wild and unsocial living each man to himself taking from the weak and losing to the strong In their first coalitions of society much of this original savageness is retained Of general happiness the product of general confidence there is yet no thought Men continue to prosecute their own advantages by the nearest way and the utmost severity of the civil law is necessary to restrain individuals from plundering each other The restraints then necessary are restraints from plunder from acts of publick violence and undisguised oppression The ferocity of our ancestors as of all other nations produced not fraud but rapine They had not yet learned to cheat and attempted only to rob As manners grow more polished with the knowledge of good men attain likewise dexterity in evil Open rapine becomes less frequent and violence gives way to cunning Those who before invaded pastures and stormed houses now begin to enrich themselves by unequal contracts and fraudulent intromissions It is not against the violence of ferocity but the circumventions of deceit that this law was framed and I am afraid the increase of commerce and the incessant struggle for riches which commerce excites give us no prospect of an end speedily to be expected of artifice and fraud It therefore seems to be no very conclusive reasoning which connects those two propositions the nation is become less ferocious and therefore the laws against fraud and covin five hundred seventy six shall be relaxed Whatever reason may have influenced the Judges to a relaxation of the law it was not that the nation was grown less fierce and I am afraid it cannot be affirmed that it is grown less fraudulent Since this law has been represented as rigorously and unreasonably penal it seems not improper to consider what are the conditions and qualities that make the justice or propriety of a penal law To make a penal law reasonable and just two conditions are necessary and two proper 
5186_7793_000040_000001	train-clean-360	It is necessary that the law should be adequate to its end that if it be observed it shall prevent the evil against which it is directed 
none	none	It is secondly necessary that the end of the law be of such importance as to deserve the security of a penal sanction The other conditions of a penal law which though not absolutely necessary are to a very high degree fit are that to the moral violation of the law there are many temptations and that of the physical observance there is great facility All these conditions apparently concur to justify the law which we are now considering

none	none	Of the two secondary considerations it cannot be denied that both are in our favour The temptation to intromit is frequent and strong so strong and so frequent as to require the utmost activity of justice and vigilance of caution to withstand its prevalence and the method by which a man may entitle himself to legal intromission is so open and so facile that to neglect it is a proof of fraudulent intention for why should a man omit to do but for reasons which he will not confess that which he can do so easily and that which he knows to be required by the law

disappointed that you did not come to Scotland last autumn However I must own that your letter prevents me from complaining not only because I am sensible that the state of your health was but too good an excuse but because you write in a strain which shews that you have agreeable views of the scheme which we have so long proposed I communicated to Beattie what you said of his book in your last letter to me He writes to me thus You judge very rightly in supposing that doctor Johnson s favourable opinion of any book must give me great delight Indeed it is impossible for me to say how much I am gratified by it for there is not a man upon earth whose good opinion I would be more ambitious to cultivate His talents and his virtues I reverence more than any words can express The extraordinary civilities five hundred eighty three the paternal attentions I should rather say and the many instructions I have had the honour to receive from him will to me be a perpetual source of pleasure in the recollection Dum memor ipse mei dum spiritus has reget artus five hundred eighty four I had still some thoughts while the summer lasted of being obliged to go to London on some little business otherwise I should certainly have troubled him with a letter several months ago and given some vent to my gratitude and admiration This I intend to do as soon as I am left a little at leisure Mean time if you have occasion to write to him I beg you will offer him my most respectful compliments and assure him of the sincerity of my attachment and the warmth of my gratitude I am c JAMES BOSWELL seventeen seventy three AETAT sixty four In seventeen seventy three his only publication was an edition of his folio Dictionary with additions and corrections five hundred eighty five nor did he so far as is known furnish any productions of his fertile pen to any of his numerous friends or dependants except the Preface five hundred eighty six to his old amanuensis Macbean s Dictionary of Ancient Geography five hundred eighty seven His Shakspeare indeed which had been received with high approbation by the publick and gone through several editions was this year re published by George Steevens esquire a gentleman not only deeply skilled in ancient learning and of very extensive reading in English literature especially the early writers but at the same time of acute discernment and elegant taste five hundred eighty eight It is almost unnecessary to say that by his great and valuable additions to doctor Johnson s work he justly obtained considerable reputation Divisum imperium cum Jove Caesar habet five hundred eighty nine To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR I have read your kind letter much more than the elegant Pindar which it accompanied I am always glad to find myself not forgotten and to be forgotten by you would give me great uneasiness My northern friends have never been unkind to me I have from you dear Sir testimonies of affection which I have not often been able to excite and doctor Beattie rates the testimony which I was desirous of paying to his merit much higher than I should have thought it reasonable to expect I have heard of your masquerade five hundred ninety What says your synod to such innovations I am not studiously scrupulous nor do I think a masquerade either evil in itself or very likely to be the occasion of evil yet as the world thinks it a very licentious relaxation of manners I would not have been one of the first masquers in a country where no masquerade had ever been before five hundred ninety one A new edition of my great Dictionary is printed from a copy which I was persuaded to revise but having made no preparation I was able to do very little Some superfluities I have expunged and some faults I have corrected and here and there have scattered a remark but the main fabrick of the work remains as it was I had looked very little into it since I wrote it and I think I found it full as often better as worse than I expected Baretti and Davies have had a furious quarrel five hundred ninety two a quarrel I think irreconcileable doctor Goldsmith has a new comedy which is expected in the spring No name is yet given it five hundred ninety three The chief diversion arises from a stratagem by which a lover is made to mistake his future father in law s house for an inn This you see borders upon farce The dialogue is quick and gay and the incidents are so prepared as not to seem improbable I am sorry that you lost your cause of Intromission because I yet think the arguments on your side unanswerable But you seem I think to say that you gained reputation even by your defeat and reputation you will daily gain if you keep Lord Auchinleck s precept in your mind and endeavour to consolidate in your mind a firm and regular system of law instead of picking up occasional fragments My health seems in general to improve but I have been troubled for many weeks with a vexatious catarrh which is sometimes sufficiently distressful I have not found any great effects from bleeding and physick and am afraid that I must expect help from brighter days and softer air Write to me now and then and whenever any good befalls you make haste to let me know it for no one will rejoice at it more than dear Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON London Feb twenty four seventeen seventy three You continue to stand very high in the favour of missus Thrale While a former edition of my work was passing through the press I was unexpectedly favoured with a packet from Philadelphia from mister James Abercrombie a gentleman of that country who is pleased to honour me with very high praise of my Life of doctor Johnson To have the fame of my illustrious friend and his faithful biographer echoed from the New World is extremely flattering and my grateful acknowledgements shall be wafted across the Atlantick mister Abercrombie has politely conferred on me a considerable additional obligation by transmitting to me copies of two letters from doctor Johnson to American gentlemen Gladly Sir says he would I have sent you the originals but being the only relicks of the kind in America they are considered by the possessors of such inestimable value that no possible consideration would induce them to part with them In some future publication of yours relative to that great and good man they may perhaps be thought worthy of insertion To mister B D five hundred ninety four SIR That in the hurry of a sudden departure you should yet find leisure to consult my convenience is a degree of kindness and an instance of regard not only beyond my claims but above my expectation You are not mistaken in supposing that I set a high value on my American friends and that you should confer a very valuable favour upon me by giving me an opportunity of keeping myself in their memory I have taken the liberty of troubling you with a packet to which I wish a safe and speedy conveyance because I wish a safe and speedy voyage to him that conveys it I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON London Johnson s court Fleet street March four seventeen seventy three To THE REVEREND mister WHITE five hundred ninety five DEAR SIR Your kindness for your friends accompanies you across the Atlantick It was long since observed by Horace five hundred ninety six that no ship could leave care behind you have been attended in your voyage by other powers by benevolence and constancy and I hope care did not often shew her face in their company I received the copy of Rasselas The impression is not magnificent but it flatters an authour because the printer seems to have expected that it would be scattered among the people The little book has been well received and is translated into Italian five hundred ninety seven French five hundred ninety eight German and Dutch five hundred ninety nine It has now one honour more by an American edition I know not that much has happened since your departure that can engage your curiosity Of all publick transactions the whole world is now informed by the newspapers Opposition seems to despond and the dissenters though they have taken advantage of unsettled times and a government much enfeebled seem not likely to gain any immunities six hundred doctor Goldsmith has a new comedy in rehearsal at Covent Garden to which the manager predicts ill success six hundred one I hope he will be mistaken I think it deserves a very kind reception I shall soon publish a new edition of my large Dictionary I have been persuaded to revise it and have mended some faults but added little to its usefulness No book has been published since your departure of which much notice is taken Faction only fills the town with pamphlets and greater subjects are forgotten in the noise of discord Thus have I written only to tell you how little I have to tell Of myself I can only add that having been afflicted many weeks with a very troublesome cough I am now recovered I take the liberty which you give me of troubling you with a letter of which you will please to fill up the direction I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON Johnson s court Fleet street London March four seventeen seventy three On Saturday April three the day after my arrival in London this year I went to his house late in the evening and sat with missus Williams till he came home I found in the London Chronicle doctor Goldsmith s apology six hundred two to the publick for beating Evans a bookseller on account of a paragraph in a newspaper published by him which Goldsmith thought impertinent to him and to a lady of his acquaintance six hundred three The apology was written so much in doctor Johnson s manner that both missus Williams and I supposed it to be his but when he came home he soon undeceived us When he said to missus Williams Well doctor Goldsmith s manifesto has got into your paper six hundred four I asked him if doctor Goldsmith had written it with an air that made him see I suspected it was his though subscribed by Goldsmith JOHNSON Sir doctor Goldsmith would no more have asked me to write such a thing as that for him than he would have asked me to feed him with a spoon or to do anything else that denoted his imbecility I as much believe that he wrote it as if I had seen him do it Sir had he shewn it to any one friend he would not have been allowed to publish it He has indeed done it very well but it is a foolish thing well done I suppose he has been so much elated with the success of his new comedy that he has thought every thing that concerned him must be of importance to the publick BOSWELL I fancy Sir this is the first time that he has been engaged in such an adventure JOHNSON Why Sir I believe it is the first time he has beat he may have been beaten before six hundred five This Sir is a new plume to him I mentioned Sir John Dalrymple s Memoirs of Great Britain and Ireland and his discoveries to the prejudice of Lord Russel and Algernon Sydney JOHNSON Why Sir every body who had just notions of government thought them rascals before It is well that all mankind now see them to be rascals BOSWELL But Sir may not those discoveries be true without their being rascals JOHNSON Consider Sir would any of them have been willing to have had it known that they intrigued with France Depend upon it Sir he who does what he is afraid should be known has something rotten about him This Dalrymple seems to be an honest fellow six hundred six for he tells equally what makes against both sides But nothing can be poorer than his mode of writing it is the mere bouncing of a school boy Great He but greater She and such stuff six hundred seven I could not agree with him in this criticism for though Sir John Dalrymple s style is not regularly formed in any respect and one cannot help smiling sometimes at his affected grandiloquence there is in his writing a pointed vivacity and much of a gentlemanly spirit At mister Thrale s in the evening he repeated his usual paradoxical declamation against action in publick speaking six hundred eight Action can have no effect upon reasonable minds It may augment noise but it never can enforce argument If you speak to a dog you use action you hold up your hand thus because he is a brute and in proportion as men are removed from brutes action will have the less influence upon them missus THRALE What then Sir becomes of Demosthenes s saying Action action action JOHNSON Demosthenes Madam spoke to an assembly of brutes to a barbarous people six hundred nine I thought it extraordinary that he should deny the power of rhetorical action upon human nature when it is proved by innumerable facts in all stages of society Reasonable beings are not solely reasonable They have fancies which may be pleased passions which may be roused Lord Chesterfield being mentioned Johnson remarked that almost all of that celebrated nobleman s witty sayings were puns six hundred ten He however allowed the merit of good wit to his Lordship s saying of Lord Tyrawley six hundred eleven and himself when both very old and infirm Tyrawley and I have been dead these two years but we don t choose to have it known He talked with approbation of an intended edition of The Spectator with notes two volumes of which had been prepared by a gentleman eminent in the literary world and the materials which he had collected for the remainder had been transferred to another hand six hundred twelve He observed that all works which describe manners require notes in sixty or seventy years or less and told us he had communicated all he knew that could throw light upon The Spectator He said Addison had made his Sir Andrew Freeport a true Whig arguing against giving charity to beggars and throwing out other such ungracious sentiments but that he had thought better and made amends by making him found an hospital for decayed farmers six hundred thirteen He called for the volume of The Spectator in which that account is contained and read it aloud to us He read so well that every thing acquired additional weight and grace from his utterance six hundred fourteen The conversation having turned on modern imitations of ancient ballads and some one having praised their simplicity he treated them with that ridicule which he always displayed when that subject was mentioned six hundred fifteen He disapproved of introducing scripture phrases into secular discourse This seemed to me a question of some difficulty A scripture expression may be used like a highly classical phrase to produce an instantaneous strong impression and it may be done without being at all improper Yet I own there is danger that applying the language of our sacred book to ordinary subjects may tend to lessen our reverence for it If therefore it be introduced at all it should be with very great caution On Thursday April eight I sat a good part of the evening with him but he was very silent He said Burnet s History of his own times is very entertaining six hundred sixteen The style indeed is mere chitchat six hundred seventeen I do not believe that Burnet intentionally lyed but he was so much prejudiced that he took no pains to find out the truth He was like a man who resolves to regulate his time by a certain watch but will not inquire whether the watch is right or not six hundred eighteen Though he was not disposed to talk he was unwilling that I should leave him and when I looked at my watch and told him it was twelve o clock he cried What s that to you and me and ordered Frank to tell missus Williams that we were coming to drink tea with her which we did It was settled that we should go to church together next day On the ninth of April being Good Friday I breakfasted with him on tea and cross buns six hundred nineteen Doctor Levet as Frank called him making the tea He carried me with him to the church of saint Clement Danes where he had his seat and his behaviour was as I had imaged to myself solemnly devout six hundred twenty I never shall forget the tremulous earnestness with which he pronounced the awful petition in the Litany In the hour of death and at six hundred twenty one the day of judgement good LORD deliver us We went to church both in the morning and evening In the interval between the two services we did not dine but he read in the Greek New Testament and I turned over several of his books In Archbishop Laud s Diary I found the following passage which I read to doctor Johnson sixteen twenty three February one Sunday I stood by the most illustrious Prince Charles six hundred twenty two at dinner He was then very merry and talked occasionally of many things with his attendants Among other things he said that if he were necessitated to take any particular profession of life he could not be a lawyer adding his reasons I cannot saith he defend a bad nor yield in a good cause JOHNSON Sir this is false reasoning because every cause has a bad side six hundred twenty three and a lawyer is not overcome though the cause which he has endeavoured to support be determined against him I told him that Goldsmith had said to me a few days before As I take my shoes from the shoemaker and my coat from the taylor so I take my religion from the priest I regretted this loose way of talking JOHNSON Sir he knows nothing he has made up his mind about nothing six hundred twenty four To my great surprize he asked me to dine with him on Easter day I never supposed that he had a dinner at his house for I had not then heard of any one of his friends having been entertained at his table He told me I generally have a meat pye on Sunday it is baked at a publick oven which is very properly allowed because one man can attend it and thus the advantage is obtained of not keeping servants from church to dress dinners six hundred twenty five April eleven being Easter Sunday after having attended Divine Service at saint Paul s I repaired to doctor Johnson s I had gratified my curiosity much in dining with JEAN JAQUES ROUSSEAU six hundred twenty six while he lived in the wilds of Neufchatel I had as great a curiosity to dine with doctor SAMUEL JOHNSON in the dusky recess of a court in Fleet street I supposed we should scarcely have knives and forks and only some strange uncouth ill drest dish but I found every thing in very good order We had no other company but missus Williams and a young woman whom I did not know As a dinner here was considered as a singular phenomenon and as I was frequently interrogated on the subject my readers may perhaps be desirous to know our bill of fare Foote I remember in allusion to Francis the negro was willing to suppose that our repast was black broth But the fact was that we had a very good soup a boiled leg of lamb and spinach a veal pye and a rice pudding six hundred twenty seven Of doctor John Campbell the authour he said He is a very inquisitive and a very able man and a man of good religious principles though I am afraid he has been deficient in practice Campbell is radically right and we may hope that in time there will be good practice six hundred twenty eight He owned that he thought Hawkesworth was one of his imitators six hundred twenty nine but he did not think Goldsmith was Goldsmith he said had great merit BOSWELL But Sir he is much indebted to you for his getting so high in the publick estimation JOHNSON Why Sir he has perhaps got sooner to it by his intimacy with me Goldsmith though his vanity often excited him to occasional competition had a very high regard for Johnson which he at this time expressed in the strongest manner in the Dedication of his comedy entitled She Stoops to Conquer six hundred thirty Johnson observed that there were very few books printed in Scotland before the Union He had seen a complete collection of them in the possession of the honorable Archibald Campbell a non juring Bishop six hundred thirty one I wish this collection had been kept entire Many of them are in the library of the Faculty of Advocates at Edinburgh I told doctor Johnson that I had some intention to write the life of the learned and worthy Thomas Ruddiman six hundred thirty two He said I should take pleasure in helping you to do honour to him But his farewell letter to the Faculty of Advocates when he resigned the office of their Librarian should have been in Latin I put a question to him upon a fact in common life which he could not answer nor have I found any one else who could What is the reason that women servants though obliged to be at the expense of purchasing their own clothes have much lower wages than men servants to whom a great proportion of that article is furnished and when in fact our female house servants work much harder than the male six hundred thirty three He told me that he had twelve or fourteen times attempted to keep a journal of his life but never could persevere six hundred thirty four He advised me to do it The great thing to be recorded said he is the state of your own mind six hundred thirty five and you should write down every thing that you remember for you cannot judge at first what is good or bad and write immediately while the impression is fresh for it will not be the same a week afterwards six hundred thirty six I again solicited him to communicate to me the particulars of his early life He said You shall have them all for twopence I hope you shall know a great deal more of me before you write my Life He mentioned to me this day many circumstances which I wrote down when I went home and have interwoven in the former part of this narrative On Tuesday April thirteen he and doctor Goldsmith and I dined at General Oglethorpe s Goldsmith expatiated on the common topick that the race of our people was degenerated and that this was owing to luxury JOHNSON Sir in the first place I doubt the fact six hundred thirty seven I believe there are as many tall men in England now as ever there were But secondly supposing the stature of our people to be diminished that is not owing to luxury for Sir consider to how very small a proportion of our people luxury can reach Our soldiery surely are not luxurious who live on six pence a day six hundred thirty eight and the same remark will apply to almost all the other classes Luxury so far as it reaches the poor will do good to the race of people it will strengthen and multiply them Sir no nation was ever hurt by luxury for as I said before it can reach but to a very few I admit that the great increase of commerce and manufactures hurts the military spirit of a people because it produces a competition for something else than martial honours a competition for riches It also hurts the bodies of the people for you will observe there is no man who works at any particular trade but you may know him from his appearance to do so One part or other of his body being more used than the rest he is in some degree deformed but Sir that is not luxury A tailor sits cross legged but that is not luxury GOLDSMITH Come you re just going to the same place by another road JOHNSON Nay Sir I say that is not luxury Let us take a walk from Charing cross to White chapel through I suppose the greatest series of shops in the world what is there in any of these shops if you except gin shops that can do any human being any harm GOLDSMITH Well Sir I ll accept your challenge The very next shop to Northumberland house is a pickle shop JOHNSON Well Sir do we not know that a maid can in one afternoon make pickles sufficient to serve a whole family for a year nay that five pickle shops can serve all the kingdom Besides Sir there is no harm done to any body by the making of pickles or the eating of pickles We drank tea with the ladies and Goldsmith sung Tony Lumpkin s song in his comedy She Stoops to Conquer and a very pretty one to an Irish tune six hundred thirty nine which he had designed for Miss Hardcastle but as missus Bulkeley who played the part could not sing it was left out He afterwards wrote it down for me by which means it was preserved and now appears amongst his poems six hundred forty doctor Johnson in his way home stopped at my lodgings in Piccadilly and sat with me drinking tea a second time till a late hour I told him that missus Macaulay said she wondered how he could reconcile his political principles with his moral his notions of inequality and subordination with wishing well to the happiness of all mankind who might live so agreeably had they all their portions of land and none to domineer over another JOHNSON Why Sir I reconcile my principles very well because mankind are happier in a state of inequality and subordination six hundred forty one Were they to be in this pretty state of equality they would soon degenerate into brutes they would become Monboddo s nation six hundred forty two their tails would grow Sir all would be losers were all to work for all they would have no intellectual improvement All intellectual improvement arises from leisure all leisure arises from one working for another Talking of the family of Stuart six hundred forty three he said It should seem that the family at present on the throne has now established as good a right as the former family by the long consent of the people and that to disturb this right might be considered as culpable At the same time I own that it is a very difficult question when considered with respect to the house of Stuart To oblige people to take oaths as to the disputed right is wrong I know not whether I could take them but I do not blame those who do So conscientious and so delicate was he upon this subject which has occasioned so much clamour against him Talking of law cases he said The English reports in general are very poor only the half of what has been said is taken down and of that half much is mistaken Whereas in Scotland the arguments on each side are deliberately put in writing to be considered by the Court I think a collection of your cases upon subjects of importance with the opinions of the Judges upon them would be valuable On Thursday April fifteen I dined with him and doctor Goldsmith at General Paoli s We found here Signor Martinelli of Florence authour of a History of England in Italian printed at London I spoke of Allan Ramsay s Gentle Shepherd in the Scottish dialect as the best pastoral that had ever been written not only abounding with beautiful rural imagery and just and pleasing sentiments but being a real picture of manners and I offered to teach doctor Johnson to understand it No Sir said he I won t learn it You shall retain your superiority by my not knowing it This brought on a question whether one man is lessened by another s acquiring an equal degree of knowledge with him six hundred forty four Johnson asserted the affirmative I maintained that the position might be true in those kinds of knowledge which produce wisdom power and force so as to enable one man to have the government of others but that a man is not in any degree lessened by others knowing as well as he what ends in mere pleasure eating fine fruits drinking delicious wines reading exquisite poetry The General observed that Martinelli was a Whig JOHNSON I am sorry for it It shows the spirit of the times he is obliged to temporise BOSWELL I rather think Sir that Toryism prevails in this reign JOHNSON I know not why you should think so Sir You see your friend Lord Lyttelton six hundred forty five a nobleman is obliged in his History to write the most vulgar Whiggism An animated debate took place whether Martinelli should continue his History of England to the present day GOLDSMITH To be sure he should JOHNSON No Sir he would give great offence He would have to tell of almost all the living great what they do not wish told GOLDSMITH It may perhaps be necessary for a native to be more cautious but a foreigner who comes among us without prejudice may be considered as holding the place of a Judge and may speak his mind freely JOHNSON Sir a foreigner when he sends a work from the press ought to be on his guard against catching the errour and mistaken enthusiasm of the people among whom he happens to be GOLDSMITH Sir he wants only to sell his history and to tell truth one an honest the other a laudable motive JOHNSON Sir they are both laudable motives It is laudable in a man to wish to live by his labours but he should write so as he may live by them not so as he may be knocked on the head I would advise him to be at Calais before he publishes his history of the present age A foreigner who attaches himself to a political party in this country is in the worst state that can be imagined he is looked upon as a mere intermeddler A native may do it from interest BOSWELL Or principle GOLDSMITH There are people who tell a hundred political lies every day and are not hurt by it Surely then one may tell truth with safety JOHNSON Why Sir in the first place he who tells a hundred lies has disarmed the force of his lies six hundred forty six But besides a man had rather have a hundred lies told of him than one truth which he does not wish should be told GOLDSMITH For my part I d tell truth and shame the devil JOHNSON Yes Sir but the devil will be angry I wish to shame the devil as much you do but I should choose to be out of the reach of his claws GOLDSMITH His claws can do you no harm when you have the shield of truth It having been observed that there was little hospitality in London JOHNSON Nay Sir any man who has a name or who has the power of pleasing will be very generally invited in London The man Sterne I have been told has had engagements for three months six hundred forty seven GOLDSMITH And a very dull fellow JOHNSON Why no Sir six hundred forty eight Martinelli told us that for several years he lived much with Charles Townshend and that he ventured to tell him he was a bad joker JOHNSON Why Sir thus much I can say upon the subject One day he and a few more agreed to go and dine in the country and each of them was to bring a friend in his carriage with him Charles Townshend asked Fitzherbert to go with him but told him You must find somebody to bring you back I can only carry you there Fitzherbert did not much like this arrangement He however consented observing sarcastically It will do very well for then the same jokes will serve you in returning as in going six hundred forty nine An eminent publick character six hundred fifty being mentioned JOHNSON I remember being present when he shewed himself to be so corrupted or at least something so different from what I think right as to maintain that a member of parliament should go along with his party right or wrong Now Sir this is so remote from native virtue from scholastick virtue that a good man must have undergone a great change before he can reconcile himself to such a doctrine It is maintaining that you may lie to the publick for you lie when you call that right which you think wrong or the reverse six hundred fifty one A friend of ours who is too much an echo of that gentleman observed that a man who does not stick uniformly to a party is only waiting to be bought Why then said I he is only waiting to be what that gentleman is already We talked of the King s coming to see Goldsmith s new play I wish he would six hundred fifty two said Goldsmith adding however with an affected indifference Not that it would do me the least good JOHNSON Well then Sir let us say it would do him good laughing No Sir this affectation will not pass it is mighty idle In such a state as ours who would not wish to please the Chief Magistrate GOLDSMITH I do wish to please him I remember a line in Dryden And every poet is the monarch s friend It ought to be reversed JOHNSON Nay there are finer lines in Dryden on this subject For colleges on bounteous Kings depend And never rebel was to arts a friend six hundred fifty three General Paoli observed that successful rebels might six hundred fifty four MARTINELLI Happy rebellions GOLDSMITH We have no such phrase GENERAL PAOLI But have you not the thing GOLDSMITH Yes all our happy revolutions They have hurt our constitution and will hurt it till we mend it by another HAPPY REVOLUTION I never before discovered that my friend Goldsmith had so much of the old prejudice in him General Paoli talking of Goldsmith s new play said Il a fait un compliment tres gracieux a une certaine grande dame meaning a Duchess of the first rank six hundred fifty five I expressed a doubt whether Goldsmith intended it in order that I might hear the truth from himself It perhaps was not quite fair to endeavour to bring him to a confession as he might not wish to avow positively his taking part against the Court He smiled and hesitated The General at once relieved him by this beautiful image Monsieur Goldsmith est comme la mer qui jette des perles et beau coup d autres belle choses sans s en appercevoir GOLDSMITH Tres bien dit et tres elegamment A person was mentioned who it was said could take down in short hand the speeches in parliament with perfect exactness JOHNSON Sir it is impossible I remember one Angel who came to me to write for him a Preface or Dedication to a book upon short hand six hundred fifty six and he professed to write as fast as a man could speak In order to try him I took down a book and read while he wrote and I favoured him for I read more deliberately than usual I had proceeded but a very little way when he begged I would desist for he could not follow me six hundred fifty seven Hearing now for the first time of this Preface or Dedication I said What an expense Sir do you put us to in buying books to which you have written Prefaces or Dedications JOHNSON Why I have dedicated to the Royal family all round that is to say to the last generation of the Royal family six hundred fifty eight GOLDSMITH And perhaps Sir not one sentence of wit in a whole Dedication JOHNSON Perhaps not Sir BOSWELL What then is the reason for applying to a particular person to do that which any one may do as well JOHNSON Why Sir one man has greater readiness at doing it than another I spoke of mister Harris six hundred fifty nine of Salisbury as being a very learned man and in particular an eminent Grecian JOHNSON I am not sure of that His friends give him out as such but I know not who of his friends are able to judge of it GOLDSMITH He is what is much better he is a worthy humane man JOHNSON Nay Sir that is not to the purpose of our argument six hundred sixty that will as much prove that he can play upon the fiddle as well as Giardini as that he is an eminent Grecian GOLDSMITH The greatest musical performers have but small emoluments Giardini I am told does not get above seven hundred a year JOHNSON That is indeed but little for a man to get who does best that which so many endeavour to do There is nothing I think in which the power of art is shown so much as in playing on the fiddle In all other things we can do something at first Any man will forge a bar of iron if you give him a hammer not so well as a smith but tolerably A man will saw a piece of wood and make a box though a clumsy one but give him a fiddle and a fiddle stick and he can do nothing On Monday April nineteen he called on me with missus Williams in mister Strahan s coach and carried me out to dine with mister Elphinston six hundred sixty one at his academy at Kensington A printer having acquired a fortune sufficient to keep his coach was a good topick for the credit of literature six hundred sixty two missus Williams said that another printer mister Hamilton had not waited so long as mister Strahan but had kept his coach several years sooner six hundred sixty three JOHNSON He was in the right Life is short The sooner that a man begins to enjoy his wealth the better mister Elphinston talked of a new book that was much admired and asked doctor Johnson if he had read it JOHNSON I have looked into it What said Elphinston have you not read it through Johnson offended at being thus pressed and so obliged to own his cursory mode of reading answered tartly No Sir do you read books through six hundred sixty four He this day again defended duelling six hundred sixty five and put his argument upon what I have ever thought the most solid basis that if publick war be allowed to be consistent with morality private war must be equally so Indeed we may observe what strained arguments are used to reconcile war with the Christian religion But in my opinion it is exceedingly clear that duelling having better reasons for its barbarous violence is more justifiable than war in which thousands go forth without any cause of personal quarrel and massacre each other On Wednesday April twenty one I dined with him at mister Thrale s A gentleman six hundred sixty six attacked Garrick for being vain JOHNSON No wonder Sir that he is vain a man who is perpetually flattered in every mode that can be conceived So many bellows have blown the fire that one wonders he is not by this time become a cinder BOSWELL And such bellows too Lord Mansfield with his cheeks like to burst Lord Chatham like an AEolus I have read such notes from them to him as were enough to turn his head six hundred sixty seven JOHNSON True When he whom every body else flatters flatters me I then am truely happy missus THRALE The sentiment is in Congreve I think JOHNSON Yes Madam in The Way of the World If there s delight in love tis when I see That heart which others bleed for bleed for me six hundred sixty eight No Sir I should not be surprised though Garrick chained the ocean and lashed the winds BOSWELL Should it not be Sir lashed the ocean and chained the winds JOHNSON No Sir recollect the original In Corum atque Eurum solitus saevire flagellis Barbarus AEolio nunquam hoc in carcere passos Ipsum compedibus qui viscxerat Ennosigoeum six hundred sixty nine This does very well when both the winds and the sea are personified and mentioned by their mythological names as in Juvenal but when they are mentioned in plain language the application of the epithets suggested by me is the most obvious and accordingly my friend himself in his imitation of the passage which describes Xerxes has The waves he lashes and enchains the wind The modes of living in different countries and the various views with which men travel in quest of new scenes having been talked of a learned gentleman six hundred seventy who holds a considerable office in the law expatiated on the happiness of a savage life six hundred seventy one and mentioned an instance of an officer who had actually lived for some time in the wilds of America of whom when in that state he quoted this reflection with an air of admiration as if it had been deeply philosophical Here am I free and unrestrained amidst the rude magnificence of Nature with this Indian woman by my side and this gun with which I can procure food when I want it what more can be desired for human happiness It did not require much sagacity to foresee that such a sentiment would not be permitted to pass without due animadversion JOHNSON Do not allow yourself Sir to be imposed upon by such gross absurdity It is sad stuff it is brutish If a bull could speak he might as well exclaim Here am I with this cow and this grass what being can enjoy greater felicity We talked of the melancholy end of a gentleman six hundred seventy two who had destroyed himself JOHNSON It was owing to imaginary difficulties in his affairs which had he talked with any friend would soon have vanished BOSWELL Do you think Sir that all who commit suicide are mad JOHNSON Sir they are often not universally disordered in their intellects but one passion presses so upon them that they yield to it and commit suicide as a passionate man will stab another He added I have often thought that after a man has taken the resolution to kill himself it is not courage in him to do any thing however desperate because he has nothing to fear GOLDSMITH I don t see that JOHNSON Nay but my dear Sir why should not you see what every one else sees GOLDSMITH It is for fear of something that he has resolved to kill himself and will not that timid disposition restrain him JOHNSON It does not signify that the fear of something made him resolve it is upon the state of his mind after the resolution is taken that I argue Suppose a man either from fear or pride or conscience or whatever motive has resolved to kill himself when once the resolution is taken he has nothing to fear He may then go and take the King of Prussia by the nose at the head of his army He cannot fear the rack who is resolved to kill himself When Eustace Budgel six hundred seventy three was walking down to the Thames determined to drown himself he might if he pleased without any apprehension of danger have turned aside and first set fire to saint James s palace On Tuesday April twenty seven mister Beauclerk and I called on him in the morning As we walked up Johnson s court I said I have a veneration for this court and was glad to find that Beauclerk had the same reverential enthusiasm six hundred seventy four We found him alone We talked of mister Andrew Stuart s elegant and plausible Letters to Lord Mansfield six hundred seventy five a copy of which had been sent by the authour to doctor Johnson JOHNSON They have not answered the end They have not been talked of I have never heard of them This is owing to their not being sold People seldom read a book which is given to them and few are given The way to spread a work is to sell it at a low price No man will send to buy a thing that costs even sixpence without an intention to read it BOSWELL May it not be doubted Sir whether it be proper to publish letters arraigning the ultimate decision of an important cause by the supreme judicature of the nation JOHNSON No Sir I do not think it was wrong to publish these letters If they are thought to do harm why not answer them But they will do no harm if mister Douglas be indeed the son of Lady Jane he cannot be hurt if he be not her son and yet has the great estate of the family of Douglas he may well submit to have a pamphlet against him by Andrew Stuart Sir I think such a publication does good as it does good to show us the possibilities of human life And Sir you will not say that the Douglas cause was a cause of easy decision when it divided your Court as much as it could do to be determined at all When your Judges were seven and seven the casting vote of the President must be given on one side or other no matter for my argument on which one or the other must be taken as when I am to move there is no matter which leg I move first And then Sir it was otherwise determined here No Sir a more dubious determination of any question cannot be imagined six hundred seventy six He said Goldsmith should not be for ever attempting to shine in conversation he has not temper for it he is so much mortified when he fails Sir a game of jokes is composed partly of skill partly of chance a man may be beat at times by one who has not the tenth part of his wit Now Goldsmith s putting himself against another is like a man laying a hundred to one who cannot spare the hundred It is not worth a man s while A man should not lay a hundred to one unless he can easily spare it though he has a hundred chances for him he can get but a guinea and he may lose a hundred Goldsmith is in this state When he contends if he gets the better it is a very little addition to a man of his literary reputation if he does not get the better he is miserably vexed Johnson s own superlative powers of wit set him above any risk of such uneasiness Garrick had remarked to me of him a few days before Rabelais and all other wits are nothing compared with him You may be diverted by them but Johnson gives you a forcible hug and shakes laughter out of you whether you will or no Goldsmith however was often very fortunate in his witty contests even when he entered the lists with Johnson himself Sir Joshua Reynolds was in company with them one day when Goldsmith said that he thought he could write a good fable mentioned the simplicity which that kind of composition requires and observed that in most fables the animals introduced seldom talk in character For instance said he the fable of the little fishes who saw birds fly over their heads and envying them petitioned Jupiter to be changed into birds The skill continued he consists in making them talk like little fishes While he indulged himself in this fanciful reverie he observed Johnson shaking his sides and laughing Upon which he smartly proceeded Why doctor Johnson this is not so easy as you seem to think for if you were to make little fishes talk they would talk like WHALES Johnson though remarkable for his great variety of composition never exercised his talents in fable except we allow his beautiful tale six hundred seventy seven published in missus Williams s Miscellanies six hundred seventy eight to be of that species I have however found among his manuscript collections the following sketch of one Glow worm six hundred seventy nine lying in the garden saw a candle in a neighbouring palace and complained of the littleness of his own light another observed wait a little soon dark have outlasted Greek poll many of these glaring lights which are only brighter as they haste to nothing On Thursday April twenty nine I dined with him at General Oglethorpe s where were Sir Joshua Reynolds mister Langton doctor Goldsmith and mister Thrale I was very desirous to get doctor Johnson absolutely fixed in his resolution to go with me to the Hebrides this year and I told him that I had received a letter from doctor Robertson the historian upon the subject with which he was much pleased and now talked in such a manner of his long intended tour that I was satisfied he meant to fulfil his engagement The custom of eating dogs at Otaheite being mentioned Goldsmith observed that this was also a custom in China that a dog butcher is as common there as any other butcher and that when he walks abroad all the dogs fall on him JOHNSON That is not owing to his killing dogs Sir I remember a butcher at Lichfield whom a dog that was in the house where I lived always attacked It is the smell of carnage which provokes this let the animals he has killed be what they may GOLDSMITH Yes there is a general abhorrence in animals at the signs of massacre If you put a tub full of blood into a stable the horses are like to go mad JOHNSON I doubt that GOLDSMITH Nay Sir it is a fact well authenticated THRALE You had better prove it before you put it into your book on natural history You may do it in my stable if you will JOHNSON Nay Sir I would not have him prove it If he is content to take his information from others he may get through his book with little trouble and without much endangering his reputation But if he makes experiments for so comprehensive a book as his there would be no end to them his erroneous assertions would then fall upon himself and he might be blamed for not having made experiments as to every particular The character of Mallet having been introduced and spoken of slightingly by Goldsmith JOHNSON Why Sir Mallet had talents enough to keep his literary reputation alive as long as he himself lived six hundred eighty and that let me tell you is a good deal GOLDSMITH But I cannot agree that it was so His literary reputation was dead long before his natural death I consider an authour s literary reputation to be alive only while his name will ensure a good price for his copy from the booksellers I will get you to Johnson a hundred guineas for any thing whatever that you shall write if you put your name to it six hundred eighty one doctor Goldmith s new play She Stoops to Conquer being mentioned JOHNSON I know of no comedy for many years that has so much exhilarated an audience that has answered so much the great end of comedy making an audience merry six hundred eighty two Goldsmith having said that Garrick s compliment to the Queen which he introduced into the play of The Chances six hundred eighty three which he had altered and revised this year was mean and gross flattery JOHNSON Why Sir I would not write I would not give solemnly under my hand a character beyond what I thought really true but a speech on the stage let it flatter ever so extravagantly is formular six hundred eighty four It has always been formular to flatter Kings and Queens so much so that even in our church service we have our most religious King used indiscriminately whoever is King Nay they even flatter themselves we have been graciously pleased to grant No modern flattery however is so gross as that of the Augustan age where the Emperour was deified Praesens Divus habebitur Augustus six hundred eighty five And as to meanness rising into warmth how is it mean in a player a showman a fellow who exhibits himself for a shilling to flatter his Queen six hundred eighty six The attempt indeed was dangerous for if it had missed what became of Garrick and what became of the Queen As Sir William Temple says of a great General it is necessary not only that his designs be formed in a masterly manner but that they should be attended with success six hundred eighty seven Sir it is right at a time when the Royal Family is not generally liked six hundred eighty eight to let it be seen that the people like at least one of them SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS I do not perceive why the profession of a player should be despised six hundred eighty nine for the great and ultimate end of all the employments of mankind is to produce amusement Garrick produces more amusement than any body BOSWELL You say doctor Johnson that Garrick exhibits himself for a shilling In this respect he is only on a footing with a lawyer who exhibits himself for his fee and even will maintain any nonsense or absurdity if the case requires it Garrick refuses a play or a part which he does not like a lawyer never refuses JOHNSON Why Sir what does this prove only that a lawyer is worse Boswell is now like Jack in The Tale of a Tub six hundred ninety who when he is puzzled by an argument hangs himself He thinks I shall cut him down but I ll let him hang laughing vociferously SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS mister Boswell thinks that the profession of a lawyer being unquestionably honourable if he can show the profession of a player to be more honourable he proves his argument On Friday April thirty I dined with him at mister Beauclerk s where were Lord Charlemont Sir Joshua Reynolds and some more members of the LITERARY CLUB whom he had obligingly invited to meet me as I was this evening to be balloted for as candidate for admission into that distinguished society Johnson had done me the honour to propose me six hundred ninety one and Beauclerk was very zealous for me Goldsmith being mentioned JOHNSON It is amazing how little Goldsmith knows He seldom comes where he is not more ignorant than any one else SIR JOSHUA REYNOLDS Yet there is no man whose company is more liked JOHNSON To be sure Sir When people find a man of the most distinguished abilities as a writer their inferiour while he is with them it must be highly gratifying to them What Goldsmith comically says of himself is very true he always gets the better when he argues alone meaning that he is master of a subject in his study and can write well upon it but when he comes into company grows confused and unable to talk six hundred ninety two Take him as a poet his Traveller is a very fine performance ay and so is his Deserted Village were it not sometimes too much the echo of his Traveller Whether indeed we take him as a poet as a comick writer or as an historian he stands in the first class BOSWELL An historian My dear Sir you surely will not rank his compilation of the Roman History with the works of other historians of this age JOHNSON Why who are before him six hundred ninety three BOSWELL Hume Robertson six hundred ninety four Lord Lyttelton JOHNSON his antipathy to the Scotch beginning to rise I have not read Hume but doubtless Goldsmith s History is better than the verbiage of Robertson six hundred ninety five or the foppery of Dalrymple six hundred ninety six BOSWELL Will you not admit the superiority of Robertson in whose History we find such penetration such painting JOHNSON Sir you must consider how that penetration and that painting are employed It is not history it is imagination He who describes what he never saw draws from fancy Robertson paints minds as Sir Joshua paints faces in a history piece he imagines an heroic countenance You must look upon Robertson s work as romance and try it by that standard six hundred ninety seven History it is not Besides Sir it is the great excellence of a writer to put into his book as much as his book will hold Goldsmith has done this in his History Now Robertson might have put twice as much into his book Robertson is like a man who has packed gold in wool the wool takes up more room than the gold No Sir I always thought Robertson would be crushed by his own weight would be buried under his own ornaments Goldsmith tells you shortly all you want to know Robertson detains you a great deal too long No man will read Robertson s cumbrous detail a second time but Goldsmith s plain narrative will please again and again I would say to Robertson what an old tutor of a college said to one of his pupils Read over your compositions and where ever you meet with a passage which you think is particularly fine strike it out Goldsmith s abridgement is better than that of Lucius Florus or Eutropius and I will venture to say that if you compare him with Vertot six hundred ninety eight in the same places of the Roman History you will find that he excels Vertot Sir he has the art of compiling and of saying every thing he has to say in a pleasing manner six hundred ninety nine He is now writing a Natural History and will make it as entertaining as a Persian Tale I cannot dismiss the present topick without observing that it is probable that doctor Johnson who owned that he often talked for victory rather urged plausible objections to doctor Robertson s excellent historical works in the ardour of contest than expressed his real and decided opinion for it is not easy to suppose that he should so widely differ from the rest of the literary world seven hundred JOHNSON I remember once being with Goldsmith in Westminster abbey While we surveyed the Poets Corner I said to him Forsitan et nostrum nomen miscebitur istis seven hundred one When we got to Temple bar he stopped me pointed to the heads upon it seven hundred two and slily whispered me Forsitan et nostrum nomen miscebitur ISTIS seven hundred three Johnson praised John Bunyan highly His Pilgrim s Progress has great merit both for invention imagination and the conduct of the story and it has had the best evidence of its merit the general and continued approbation of mankind Few books I believe have had a more extensive sale It is remarkable that it begins very much like the poem of Dante yet there was no translation of Dante when Bunyan wrote There is reason to think that he had read Spenser seven hundred four A proposition which had been agitated that monuments to eminent persons should for the time to come be erected in saint Paul s church as well as in Westminster abbey was mentioned and it was asked who should be honoured by having his monument first erected there seven hundred five Somebody suggested Pope JOHNSON Why Sir as Pope was a Roman Catholick I would not have his to be first I think Milton s rather should have the precedence seven hundred six I think more highly of him now than I did at twenty seven hundred seven There is more thinking in him and in Butler than in any of our poets Some of the company expressed a wonder why the authour of so excellent a book as The Whole Duty of Man seven hundred eight should conceal himself JOHNSON There may be different reasons assigned for this any one of which would be very sufficient He may have been a clergyman and may have thought that his religious counsels would have less weight when known to come from a man whose profession was Theology He may have been a man whose practice was not suitable to his principles so that his character might injure the effect of his book which he had written in a season of penitence Or he may have been a man of rigid self denial so that he would have no reward for his pious labours while in this world but refer it all to a future state The gentlemen went away to their club and I was left at Beauclerk s till the fate of my election should be announced to me I sat in a state of anxiety which even the charming conversation of Lady Di Beauclerk could not entirely dissipate In a short time I received the agreeable intelligence that I was chosen seven hundred nine I hastened to the place of meeting and was introduced to such a society as can seldom be found mister Edmund Burke whom I then saw for the first time and whose splendid talents had long made me ardently wish for his acquaintance doctor Nugent mister Garrick doctor Goldsmith mister afterwards Sir William Jones seven hundred ten and the company with whom I had dined Upon my entrance Johnson placed himself behind a chair on which he leaned as on a desk or pulpit and with humorous formality gave me a Charge pointing out the conduct expected from me as a good member of this club Goldsmith produced some very absurd verses which had been publickly recited to an audience for money seven hundred eleven JOHNSON I can match this nonsense There was a poem called Eugenio which came out some years ago and concludes thus And now ye trifling self assuming elves Brimful of pride of nothing of yourselves Survey Eugenio view him o er and o er Then sink into yourselves and be no more seven hundred twelve Nay Dryden in his poem on the Royal Society seven hundred thirteen has these lines Then we upon our globe s last verge shall go And see the ocean leaning on the sky From thence our rolling neighbours we shall know And on the lunar world securely pry Talking of puns Johnson who had a great contempt for that species of wit seven hundred fourteen deigned to allow that there was one good pun in Menagiana I think on the word corps seven hundred fifteen Much pleasant conversation passed which Johnson relished with great good humour But his conversation alone or what led to it or was interwoven with it is the business of this work seven hundred sixteen On Saturday May one we dined by ourselves at our old rendezvous the Mitre tavern He was placid but not much disposed to talk He observed that The Irish mix better with the English than the Scotch do their language is nearer to English as a proof of which they succeed very well as players which Scotchmen do not Then Sir they have not that extreme nationality which we find in the Scotch I will do you Boswell the justice to say that you are the most unscottified of your countrymen You are almost the only instance of a Scotchman that I have known who did not at every other sentence bring in some other Scotchman seven hundred seventeen We drank tea with missus Williams I introduced a question which has been much agitated in the Church of Scotland whether the claim of lay patrons to present ministers to parishes be well founded and supposing it to be well founded whether it ought to be exercised without the concurrence of the people That Church is composed of a series of judicatures a Presbytery a Synod and finally a General Assembly before all of which this matter may be contended and in some cases the Presbytery having refused to induct or settle as they call it the person presented by the patron it has been found necessary to appeal to the General Assembly He said I might see the subject well treated in the Defence of Pluralities seven hundred eighteen and although he thought that a patron should exercise his right with tenderness to the inclinations of the people of a parish he was very clear as to his right Then supposing the question to be pleaded before the General Assembly he dictated to me what follows Against the right of patrons is commonly opposed by the inferiour judicatures the plea of conscience Their conscience tells them that the people ought to choose their pastor their conscience tells them that they ought not to impose upon a congregation a minister ungrateful and unacceptable to his auditors Conscience is nothing more than a conviction felt by ourselves of something to be done or something to be avoided and in questions of simple unperplexed morality conscience is very often a guide that may be trusted But before conscience can determine the state of the question is supposed to be completely known In questions of law or of fact conscience is very often confounded with opinion No man s conscience can tell him the right of another man seven hundred nineteen they must be known by rational investigation or historical enquiry Opinion which he that holds it may call his conscience may teach some men that religion would be promoted and quiet preserved by granting to the people universally the choice of their ministers But it is a conscience very ill informed that violates the rights of one man for the convenience of another Religion cannot be promoted by injustice and it was never yet found that a popular election was very quietly transacted That justice would be violated by transferring to the people the right of patronage is apparent to all who know whence that right had its original The right of patronage was not at first a privilege torn by power from unresisting poverty It is not an authority at first usurped in times of ignorance and established only by succession and by precedents It is not a grant capriciously made from a higher tyrant to a lower It is a right dearly purchased by the first possessors and justly inherited by those that succeeded them When Christianity was established in this island a regular mode of publick worship was prescribed Publick worship requires a publick place and the proprietors of lands as they were converted built churches for their families and their vassals For the maintenance of ministers they settled a certain portion of their lands and a district through which each minister was required to extend his care was by that circumscription constituted a parish This is a position so generally received in England that the extent of a manor and of a parish are regularly received for each other The churches which the proprietors of lands had thus built and thus endowed they justly thought themselves entitled to provide with ministers and where the episcopal government prevails the Bishop has no power to reject a man nominated by the patron but for some crime that might exclude him from the priesthood For the endowment of the church being the gift of the landlord he was consequently at liberty to give it according to his choice to any man capable of performing the holy offices The people did not choose him because the people did not pay him We hear it sometimes urged that this original right is passed out of memory and is obliterated and obscured by many translations of property and changes of government that scarce any church is now in the hands of the heirs of the builders and that the present persons have entered subsequently upon the pretended rights by a thousand accidental and unknown causes Much of this perhaps is true But how is the right of patronage extinguished If the right followed the lands it is possessed by the same equity by which the lands are possessed It is in effect part of the manor and protected by the same laws with every other privilege Let us suppose an estate forfeited by treason and granted by the Crown to a new family With the lands were forfeited all the rights appendant to those lands by the same power that grants the lands the rights also are granted The right lost to the patron falls not to the people but is either retained by the Crown or what to the people is the same thing is by the Crown given away Let it change hands ever so often it is possessed by him that receives it with the same right as it was conveyed It may indeed like all our possessions be forcibly seized or fraudulently obtained But no injury is still done to the people for what they never had they have never lost Caius may usurp the right of Titius but neither Caius nor Titius injure the people and no man s conscience however tender or however active can prompt him to restore what may be proved to have been never taken away Supposing what I think cannot be proved that a popular election of ministers were to be desired our desires are not the measure of equity It were to be desired that power should be only in the hands of the merciful and riches in the possession of the generous but the law must leave both riches and power where it finds them and must often leave riches with the covetous and power with the cruel Convenience may be a rule in little things where no other rule has been established But as the great end of government is to give every man his own no inconvenience is greater than that of making right uncertain Nor is any man more an enemy to publick peace than he who fills weak heads with imaginary claims and breaks the series of civil subordination by inciting the lower classes of mankind to encroach upon the higher Having thus shown that the right of patronage being originally purchased may be legally transferred and that it is now in the hands of lawful possessors at least as certainly as any other right we have left to the advocates of the people no other plea than that of convenience Let us therefore now consider what the people would really gain by a general abolition of the right of patronage What is most to be desired by such a change is that the country should be supplied with better ministers But why should we suppose that the parish will make a wiser choice than the patron If we suppose mankind actuated by interest the patron is more likely to choose with caution because he will suffer more by choosing wrong By the deficiencies of his minister or by his vices he is equally offended with the rest of the congregation but he will have this reason more to lament them that they will be imputed to his absurdity or corruption The qualifications of a minister are well known to be learning and piety Of his learning the patron is probably the only judge in the parish and of his piety not less a judge than others and is more likely to enquire minutely and diligently before he gives a presentation than one of the parochial rabble who can give nothing but a vote It may be urged that though the parish might not choose better ministers they would at least choose ministers whom they like better and who would therefore officiate with greater efficacy That ignorance and perverseness should always obtain what they like was never considered as the end of government of which it is the great and standing benefit that the wise see for the simple and the regular act for the capricious But that this argument supposes the people capable of judging and resolute to act according to their best judgments though this be sufficiently absurd it is not all its absurdity It supposes not only wisdom but unanimity in those who upon no other occasions are unanimous or wise If by some strange concurrence all the voices of a parish should unite in the choice of any single man though I could not charge the patron with injustice for presenting a minister I should censure him as unkind and injudicious But it is evident that as in all other popular elections there will be contrariety of judgment and acrimony of passion a parish upon every vacancy would break into factions and the contest for the choice of a minister would set neighbours at variance and bring discord into families The minister would be taught all the arts of a candidate would flatter some and bribe others and the electors as in all other cases would call for holidays and ale and break the heads of each other during the jollity of the canvas The time must however come at last when one of the factions must prevail and one of the ministers get possession of the church On what terms does he enter upon his ministry but those of enmity with half his parish By what prudence or what diligence can he hope to conciliate the affections of that party by whose defeat he has obtained his living Every man who voted against him will enter the church with hanging head and downcast eyes afraid to encounter that neighbour by whose vote and influence he has been overpowered He will hate his neighbour for opposing him and his minister for having prospered by the opposition and as he will never see him but with pain he will never see him but with hatred Of a minister presented by the patron the parish has seldom any thing worse to say than that they do not know him Of a minister chosen by a popular contest all those who do not favour him have nursed up in their bosoms principles of hatred and reasons of rejection Anger is excited principally by pride The pride of a common man is very little exasperated by the supposed usurpation of an acknowledged superiour He bears only his little share of a general evil and suffers in common with the whole parish but when the contest is between equals the defeat has many aggravations and he that is defeated by his next neighbour is seldom satisfied without some revenge and it is hard to say what bitterness of malignity would prevail in a parish where these elections should happen to be frequent and the enmity of opposition should be re kindled before it had cooled Though I present to my readers doctor Johnson s masterly thoughts on the subject I think it proper to declare that notwithstanding I am myself a lay patron I do not entirely subscribe to his opinion On Friday May seven I breakfasted with him at mister Thrale s in the Borough While we were alone I endeavoured as well as I could to apologise for a lady seven hundred twenty who had been divorced from her husband by act of Parliament I said that he had used her very ill had behaved brutally to her and that she could not continue to live with him without having her delicacy contaminated that all affection for him was thus destroyed that the essence of conjugal union being gone there remained only a cold form a mere civil obligation that she was in the prime of life with qualities to produce happiness that these ought not to be lost and that the gentleman on whose account she was divorced had gained her heart while thus unhappily situated Seduced perhaps by the charms of the lady in question I thus attempted to palliate what I was sensible could not be justified for when I had finished my harangue my venerable friend gave me a proper check My dear Sir never accustom your mind to mingle virtue and vice The woman s a whore and there s an end on t He described the father seven hundred twenty one of one of his friends thus Sir he was so exuberant a talker at publick meeting that the gentlemen of his county were afraid of him No business could be done for his declamation He did not give me full credit when I mentioned that I had carried on a short conversation by signs with some Esquimaux who were then in London particularly with one of them who was a priest He thought I could not make them understand me No man was more incredulous as to particular facts which were at all extraordinary seven hundred twenty two and therefore no man was more scrupulously inquisitive in order to discover the truth I dined with him this day at the house of my friends Messieurs Edward and Charles Dilly seven hundred twenty three booksellers in the Poultry there were present their elder brother mister Dilly of Bedfordshire doctor Goldsmith mister Langton mister Claxton Reverend doctor Mayo a dissenting minister the Reverend mister Toplady seven hundred twenty four and my friend the Reverend mister Temple Hawkesworth s compilation of the voyages to the South Sea being mentioned JOHNSON Sir if you talk of it as a subject of commerce it will be gainful seven hundred twenty five if as a book that is to increase human knowledge I believe there will not be much of that Hawkesworth can tell only what the voyagers have told him and they have found very little only one new animal I think BOSWELL But many insects Sir JOHNSON Why Sir as to insects Ray reckons of British insects twenty thousand species They might have staid at home and discovered enough in that way Talking of birds I mentioned mister Daines Barrington s ingenious Essay against the received notion of their migration JOHNSON I think we have as good evidence for the migration of woodcocks as can be desired We find they disappear at a certain time of the year and appear again at a certain time of the year and some of them when weary in their flight have been known to alight on the rigging of ships far out at sea One of the company observed that there had been instances of some of them found in summer in Essex JOHNSON Sir that strengthens our argument Exceptio probat regulam Some being found shews that if all remained many would be found A few sick or lame ones may be found GOLDSMITH There is a partial migration of the swallows the stronger ones migrate the others do not seven hundred twenty six BOSWELL I am well assured that the people of Otaheite who have the bread tree the fruit of which serves them for bread laughed heartily when they were informed of the tedious process necessary with us to have bread plowing sowing harrowing reaping threshing grinding baking JOHNSON Why Sir all ignorant savages will laugh when they are told of the advantages of civilized life Were you to tell men who live without houses how we pile brick upon brick and rafter upon rafter and that after a house is raised to a certain height a man tumbles off a scaffold and breaks his neck he would laugh heartily at our folly in building but it does not follow that men are better without houses No Sir holding up a slice of a good loaf this is better than the bread tree seven hundred twenty seven He repeated an argument which is to be found in his Rambler seven hundred twenty eight against the notion that the brute creation is endowed with the faculty of reason birds build by instinct they never improve they build their first nest as well as any one they ever build GOLDSMITH Yet we see if you take away a bird s nest with the eggs in it she will make a slighter nest and lay again JOHNSON Sir that is because at first she has full time and makes her nest deliberately In the case you mention she is pressed to lay and must therefore make her nest quickly and consequently it will be slight GOLDSMITH The identification of birds is what is least known in natural history though one of the most curious things in it I introduced the subject of toleration seven hundred twenty nine JOHNSON Every society has a right to preserve publick peace and order and therefore has a good right to prohibit the propagation of opinions which have a dangerous tendency To say the magistrate has this right is using an inadequate word it is the society for which the magistrate is agent He may be morally or theologically wrong in restraining the propagation of opinions which he thinks dangerous but he is politically right MAYO I am of opinion Sir that every man is entitled to liberty of conscience in religion and that the magistrate cannot restrain that right JOHNSON Sir I agree with you Every man has a right to liberty of conscience and with that the magistrate cannot interfere People confound liberty of thinking with liberty of talking nay with liberty of preaching Every man has a physical right to think as he pleases for it cannot be discovered how he thinks He has not a moral right for he ought to inform himself and think justly But Sir no member of a society has a right to teach any doctrine contrary to what the society holds to be true The magistrate I say may be wrong in what he thinks but while he thinks himself right he may and ought to enforce what he thinks seven hundred thirty MAYO Then Sir we are to remain always in errour and truth never can prevail and the magistrate was right in persecuting the first Christians JOHNSON Sir the only method by which religious truth can be established is by martyrdom The magistrate has a right to enforce what he thinks and he who is conscious of the truth has a right to suffer I am afraid there is no other way of ascertaining the truth but by persecution on the one hand and enduring it on the other seven hundred thirty one GOLDSMITH But how is a man to act Sir Though firmly convinced of the truth of his doctrine may he not think it wrong to expose himself to persecution Has he a right to do so Is it not as it were committing voluntary suicide JOHNSON Sir as to voluntary suicide as you call it there are twenty thousand men in an army who will go without scruple to be shot at and mount a breach for five pence a day GOLDSMITH But have they a moral right to do this JOHNSON Nay Sir if you will not take the universal opinion of mankind I have nothing to say If mankind cannot defend their own way of thinking I cannot defend it Sir if a man is in doubt whether it would be better for him to expose himself to martyrdom or not he should not do it He must be convinced that he has a delegation from heaven GOLDSMITH I would consider whether there is the greater chance of good or evil upon the whole If I see a man who had fallen into a well I would wish to help him out but if there is a greater probability that he shall pull me in than that I shall pull him out I would not attempt it So were I to go to Turkey I might wish to convert the Grand Signor to the Christian faith but when I considered that I should probably be put to death without effectuating my purpose in any degree I should keep myself quiet JOHNSON Sir you must consider that we have perfect and imperfect obligations Perfect obligations which are generally not to do something are clear and positive as thou shalt not kill But charity for instance is not definable by limits It is a duty to give to the poor but no man can say how much another should give to the poor or when a man has given too little to save his soul In the same manner it is a duty to instruct the ignorant and of consequence to convert infidels to Christianity but no man in the common course of things is obliged to carry this to such a degree as to incur the danger of martyrdom as no man is obliged to strip himself to the shirt in order to give charity I have said that a man must be persuaded that he has a particular delegation from heaven GOLDSMITH How is this to be known Our first reformers who were burnt for not believing bread and wine to be CHRIST JOHNSON interrupting him Sir they were not burnt for not believing bread and wine to be CHRIST but for insulting those who did believe it And Sir when the first reformers began they did not intend to be martyred as many of them ran away as could BOSWELL But Sir there was your countryman Elwal seven hundred thirty two who you told me challenged King George with his black guards and his red guards JOHNSON My countryman Elwal Sir should have been put in the stocks a proper pulpit for him and he d have had a numerous audience A man who preaches in the stocks will always have hearers enough BOSWELL But Elwal thought himself in the right JOHNSON We are not providing for mad people there are places for them in the neighbourhood meaning Moorfields MAYO But Sir is it not very hard that I should not be allowed to teach my children what I really believe to be the truth JOHNSON Why Sir you might contrive to teach your children extra scandalum but Sir the magistrate if he knows it has a right to restrain you Suppose you teach your children to be thieves MAYO This is making a joke of the subject JOHNSON Nay Sir take it thus that you teach them the community of goods for which there are as many plausible arguments as for most erroneous doctrines You teach them that all things at first were in common and that no man had a right to any thing but as he laid his hands upon it and that this still is or ought to be the rule amongst mankind Here Sir you sap a great principle in society property And don t you think the magistrate would have a right to prevent you Or suppose you should teach your children the notion of the Adamites and they should run naked into the streets would not the magistrate have a right to flog em into their doublets MAYO I think the magistrate has no right to interfere till there is some overt act BOSWELL So Sir though he sees an enemy to the state charging a blunderbuss he is not to interfere till it is fired off MAYO He must be sure of its direction against the state JOHNSON The magistrate is to judge of that He has no right to restrain your thinking because the evil centers in yourself If a man were sitting at this table and chopping off his fingers the magistrate as guardian of the community has no authority to restrain him however he might do it from kindness as a parent Though indeed upon more consideration I think he may as it is probable that he who is chopping off his own fingers may soon proceed to chop off those of other people If I think it right to steal mister Dilly s plate I am a bad man but he can say nothing to me If I make an open declaration that I think so he will keep me out of his house If I put forth my hand I shall be sent to Newgate This is the gradation of thinking preaching and acting if a man thinks erroneously he may keep his thoughts to himself and nobody will trouble him if he preaches erroneous doctrine society may expel him if he acts in consequence of it the law takes place and he is hanged seven hundred thirty three MAYO But Sir ought not Christians to have liberty of conscience JOHNSON I have already told you so Sir You are coming back to where you were BOSWELL doctor Mayo is always taking a return post chaise and going the stage over again He has it at half price JOHNSON doctor Mayo like other champions for unlimited toleration has got a set of words seven hundred thirty four Sir it is no matter politically whether the magistrate be right or wrong Suppose a club were to be formed to drink confusion to King George the Third and a happy restoration to Charles the Third seven hundred thirty five this would be very bad with respect to the State but every member of that club must either conform to its rules or be turned out of it Old Baxter I remember maintains that the magistrate should tolerate all things that are tolerable This is no good definition of toleration upon any principle but it shews that he thought some things were not tolerable TOPLADY Sir you have untwisted this difficult subject with great dexterity seven hundred thirty six During this argument Goldsmith sat in restless agitation from a wish to get in and shine seven hundred thirty seven Finding himself excluded he had taken his hat to go away seven hundred thirty eight but remained for some time with it in his hand like a gamester who at the close of a long night lingers for a little while to see if he can have a favourable opening to finish with success Once when he was beginning to speak he found himself overpowered by the loud voice of Johnson who was at the opposite end of the table and did not perceive Goldsmith s attempt Thus disappointed of his wish to obtain the attention of the company Goldsmith in a passion threw down his hat looking angrily at Johnson and exclaiming in a bitter tone Take it When Toplady was going to speak Johnson uttered some sound which led Goldsmith to think that he was beginning again and taking the words from Toplady Upon which he seized this opportunity of venting his own envy and spleen under the pretext of supporting another person Sir said he to Johnson the gentleman has heard you patiently for an hour pray allow us now to hear him seven hundred thirty nine JOHNSON sternly Sir I was not interrupting the gentleman I was only giving him a signal of my attention Sir you are impertinent Goldsmith made no reply but continued in the company for some time A gentleman present seven hundred forty ventured to ask doctor Johnson if there was not a material difference as to toleration of opinions which lead to action and opinions merely speculative for instance would it be wrong in the magistrate to tolerate those who preach against the doctrine of the TRINITY Johnson was highly offended and said I wonder Sir how a gentleman of your piety can introduce this subject in a mixed company He told me afterwards that the impropriety was that perhaps some of the company might have talked on the subject in such terms as might have shocked him seven hundred forty one or he might have been forced to appear in their eyes a narrow minded man The gentleman with submissive deference said he had only hinted at the question from a desire to hear doctor Johnson s opinion upon it JOHNSON Why then Sir I think that permitting men to preach any opinion contrary to the doctrine of the established church tends in a certain degree to lessen the authority of the church and consequently to lessen the influence of religion It may be considered said the gentleman whether it would not be politick to tolerate in such a case JOHNSON Sir we have been talking of right this is another question I think it is not politick to tolerate in such a case Though he did not think it fit that so aweful a subject should be introduced in a mixed company and therefore at this time waved the theological question yet his own orthodox belief in the sacred mystery of the TRINITY is evinced beyond doubt by the following passage in his private devotions O LORD hear my prayer prayers for JESUS CHRIST S sake to whom with thee and the HOLY GHOST three persons and one GOD be all honour and glory world without end Amen seven hundred forty two BOSWELL Pray mister Dilly how does doctor Leland s seven hundred forty three History of Ireland sell JOHNSON bursting forth with a generous indignation The Irish are in a most unnatural state for we see there the minority prevailing over the majority seven hundred forty four There is no instance even in the ten persecutions seven hundred forty five of such severity as that which the protestants of Ireland have exercised against the Catholicks Did we tell them we have conquered them it would be above board to punish them by confiscation and other penalties as rebels was monstrous injustice seven hundred forty six King William was not their lawful sovereign he had not been acknowledged by the Parliament of Ireland when they appeared in arms against him I here suggested something favourable of the Roman Catholicks TOPLADY Does not their invocation of saints suppose omnipresence in the saints JOHNSON No Sir it supposes only pluri presence and when spirits are divested of matter it seems probable that they should see with more extent than when in an embodied state There is therefore no approach to an invasion of any of the divine attributes in the invocation of saints But I think it is will worship and presumption I see no command for it and therefore think it is safer not to practise it seven hundred forty seven He and mister Langton and I went together to THE CLUB where we found mister Burke mister Garrick and some other members and amongst them our friend Goldsmith who sat silently brooding over Johnson s reprimand to him after dinner Johnson perceived this and said aside to some of us I ll make Goldsmith forgive me and then called to him in a loud voice doctor Goldsmith something passed to day where you and I dined I ask your pardon seven hundred forty eight Goldsmith answered placidly It must be much from you Sir that I take ill And so at once the difference was over and they were on as easy terms as ever and Goldsmith rattled away as usual seven hundred forty nine In our way to the club to night when I regretted that Goldsmith would upon every occasion endeavour to shine by which he often exposed himself mister Langton observed that he was not like Addison who was content with the fame of his writings and did not aim also at excellency in conversation for which he found himself unfit and that he said to a lady who complained of his having talked little in company Madam I have but nine pence in ready money but I can draw for a thousand pound seven hundred fifty I observed that Goldsmith had a great deal of gold in his cabinet but not content with that was always taking out his purse JOHNSON Yes Sir and that so often an empty purse Goldsmith s incessant desire of being conspicuous in company was the occasion of his sometimes appearing to such disadvantage as one should hardly have supposed possible in a man of his genius seven hundred fifty one When his literary reputation had risen deservedly high and his society was much courted he became very jealous of the extraordinary attention which was every where paid to Johnson One evening in a circle of wits he found fault with me for talking of Johnson as entitled to the honour of unquestionable superiority Sir said he you are for making a monarchy of what should be a republick He was still more mortified when talking in a company with fluent vivacity and as he flattered himself to the admiration of all who were present a German who sat next him and perceived Johnson rolling himself as if about to speak suddenly stopped him saying Stay stay Toctor Shonson is going to say something This was no doubt very provoking especially to one so irritable as Goldsmith who frequently mentioned it with strong expressions of indignation seven hundred fifty two It may also be observed that Goldsmith was sometimes content to be treated with an easy familiarity but upon occasions would be consequential and important An instance of this occurred in a small particular Johnson had a way of contracting the names of his friends as Beauclerk Beau Boswell Bozzy Langton Lanky Murphy Mur Sheridan Sherry seven hundred fifty three I remember one day when Tom Davies was telling that doctor Johnson said We are all in labour for a name to Goldy s play Goldsmith seemed displeased that such a liberty should be taken with his name and said I have often desired him not to call me Goldy seven hundred fifty four Tom was remarkably attentive to the most minute circumstance about Johnson I recollect his telling me once on my arrival in London Sir our great friend has made an improvement on his appellation of old mister Sheridan He calls him now Sherry derry To THE REVEREND mister BAGSHAW AT BROMLEY seven hundred fifty five SIR I return you my sincere thanks for your additions to my Dictionary but the new edition has been published some time and therefore I cannot now make use of them Whether I shall ever revise it more I know not If many readers had been as judicious as diligent and as communicative as yourself my work had been better The world must at present take it as it is I am Sir Your most obliged And most humble servant SAM JOHNSON May eight seventeen seventy three On Sunday May eight seven hundred fifty six I dined with Johnson at mister Langton s seven hundred fifty seven with doctor Beattie and some other company He descanted on the subject of Literary Property There seems said he to be in authours a stronger right of property than that by occupancy a metaphysical seven hundred fifty eight right a right as it were of creation which should from its nature be perpetual but the consent of nations is against it and indeed reason and the interests of learning are against it for were it to be perpetual no book however useful could be universally diffused amongst mankind should the proprietor take it into his head to restrain its circulation No book could have the advantage of being edited with notes however necessary to its elucidation should the proprietor perversely oppose it For the general good of the world therefore whatever valuable work has once been created by an authour and issued out by him should be understood as no longer in his power but as belonging to the publick at the same time the authour is entitled to an adequate reward This he should have by an exclusive right to his work for a considerable number of years seven hundred fifty nine He attacked Lord Monboddo s strange speculation on the primitive state of human nature seven hundred sixty observing Sir it is all conjecture about a thing useless even were it known to be true Knowledge of all kinds is good Conjecture as to things useful is good but conjecture as to what it would be useless to know such as whether men went upon all four is very idle On Monday May nine seven hundred sixty one as I was to set out on my return to Scotland next morning I was desirous to see as much of doctor Johnson as I could But I first called on Goldsmith to take leave of him The jealousy and envy which though possessed of many most amiable qualities he frankly avowed broke out violently at this interview Upon another occasion when Goldsmith confessed himself to be of an envious disposition I contended with Johnson that we ought not to be angry with him he was so candid in owning it Nay Sir said Johnson we must be angry that a man has such a superabundance of an odious quality that he cannot keep it within his own breast but it boils over In my opinion however Goldsmith had not more of it than other people have but only talked of it freely seven hundred sixty two He now seemed very angry that Johnson was going to be a traveller said he would be a dead weight for me to carry and that I should never be able to lug him along through the Highlands and Hebrides Nor would he patiently allow me to enlarge upon Johnson s wonderful abilities but exclaimed Is he like Burke who winds into a subject like a serpent But said I Johnson is the Hercules who strangled serpents in his cradle I dined with doctor Johnson at General Paoli s He was obliged by indisposition to leave the company early he appointed me however to meet him in the evening at mister now Sir Robert Chambers s in the Temple where he accordingly came though he continued to be very ill Chambers as is common on such occasions prescribed various remedies to him JOHNSON fretted by pain Pr ythee don t tease me Stay till I am well and then you shall tell me how to cure myself He grew better and talked with a noble enthusiasm of keeping up the representation of respectable families His zeal on this subject was a circumstance in his character exceedingly remarkable when it is considered that he himself had no pretensions to blood I heard him once say I have great merit in being zealous for subordination and the honours of birth for I can hardly tell who was my grandfather seven hundred sixty three He maintained the dignity and propriety of male succession in opposition to the opinion of one of our friends seven hundred sixty four who had that day employed mister Chambers to draw his will devising his estate to his three sisters in preference to a remote heir male Johnson called them three dowdies and said with as high a spirit as the boldest Baron in the most perfect days of the feudal system An ancient estate should always go to males It is mighty foolish to let a stranger have it because he marries your daughter and takes your name As for an estate newly acquired by trade you may give it if you will to the dog Towser and let him keep his own name I have known him at times exceedingly diverted at what seemed to others a very small sport seven hundred sixty five He now laughed immoderately without any reason that we could perceive at our friend s making his will called him the testator and added I dare say he thinks he has done a mighty thing He won t stay till he gets home to his seat in the country to produce this wonderful deed he ll call up the landlord of the first inn on the road and after a suitable preface upon mortality and the uncertainty of life will tell him that he should not delay making his will and here Sir will he say is my will which I have just made with the assistance of one of the ablest lawyers in the kingdom and he will read it to him laughing all the time He believes he has made this will but he did not make it you Chambers made it for him I trust you have had more conscience than to make him say being of sound understanding ha ha ha I hope he has left me a legacy I d have his will turned into verse like a ballad In this playful manner did he run on exulting in his own pleasantry which certainly was not such as might be expected from the authour of The Rambler but which is here preserved that my readers may be acquainted even with the slightest occasional characteristicks of so eminent a man mister Chambers did not by any means relish this jocularity upon a matter of which pars magna fuit seven hundred sixty six and seemed impatient till he got rid of us Johnson could not stop his merriment but continued it all the way till we got without the Temple gate He then burst into such a fit of laughter that he appeared to be almost in a convulsion and in order to support himself laid hold of one of the posts at the side of the foot pavement and sent forth peals so loud that in the silence of the night his voice seemed to resound from Temple bar to Fleet ditch This most ludicrous exhibition of the aweful melancholy and venerable Johnson seven hundred sixty seven happened well to counteract the feelings of sadness which I used to experience when parting with him for a considerable time I accompanied him to his door where he gave me his blessing He records of himself this year Between Easter and Whitsuntide having always considered that time as propitious to study I attempted to learn the Low Dutch language seven hundred sixty eight It is to be observed that he here admits an opinion of the human mind being influenced by seasons which he ridicules in his writings seven hundred sixty nine His progress he says was interrupted by a fever which by the imprudent use of a small print left an inflammation in his useful eye seven hundred seventy We cannot but admire his spirit when we know that amidst a complication of bodily and mental distress he was still animated with the desire of intellectual improvement seven hundred seventy one Various notes of his studies appear on different days in his manuscript diary of this year such as Inchoavi lectionem Pentateuchi Finivi lectionem Conf Fab Burdonum seven hundred seventy two Legi primum actum Troadum Legi Dissertationem Clerici postremam de Pent two of Clark s Sermons L Appolonii pugnam Betriciam L centum versus Homeri Let this serve as a specimen of what accessions of literature he was perpetually infusing into his mind while he charged himself with idleness This year died missus Salusbury mother of missus Thrale a lady whom he appears to have esteemed much and whose memory he honoured with an Epitaph seven hundred seventy three In a letter from Edinburgh dated the twenty ninth of May I pressed him to persevere in his resolution to make this year the projected visit to the Hebrides of which he and I had talked for many years and which I was confident would afford us much entertainment TO JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR When your letter came to me I was so darkened by an inflammation in my eye that I could not for some time read it I can now write without trouble and can read large prints My eye is gradually growing stronger and I hope will be able to take some delight in the survey of a Caledonian loch Chambers is going a Judge with six thousand a year to Bengal seven hundred seventy four He and I shall come down together as far as Newcastle and thence I shall easily get to Edinburgh Let me know the exact time when your Courts intermit I must conform a little to Chambers s occasions and he must conform a little to mine The time which you shall fix must be the common point to which we will come as near as we can Except this eye I am very well Beattie is so caressed and invited and treated and liked and flattered by the great that I can see nothing of him I am in great hope that he will be well provided for and then we will live upon him at the Marischal College without pity or modesty seven hundred seventy five seven hundred seventy six left the town without taking leave of me and is gone in deep dudgeon to seven hundred seventy seven Is not this very childish Where is now my legacy seven hundred seventy eight I hope your dear lady and her dear baby are both well I shall see them too when I come and I have that opinion of your choice as to suspect that when I have seen missus Boswell I shall be less willing to go away I am dear Sir Your affectionate humble servant SAM JOHNSON Johnson s court Fleet street July five seventeen seventy three Write to me as soon as you can Chambers is now at Oxford I again wrote to him informing him that the Court of Session rose on the twelfth of August hoping to see him before that time and expressing perhaps in too extravagant terms my admiration of him and my expectation of pleasure from our intended tour To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR I shall set out from London on Friday the sixth seven hundred seventy nine of this month and purpose not to loiter much by the way Which day I shall be at Edinburgh I cannot exactly tell I suppose I must drive to an inn and send a porter to find you I am afraid Beattie will not be at his College soon enough for us and I shall be sorry to miss him but there is no staying for the concurrence of all conveniences We will do as well as we can I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON August three seventeen seventy three TO THE SAME DEAR SIR Not being at mister Thrale s when your letter came I had written the enclosed paper and sealed it bringing it hither for a frank I found yours If any thing could repress my ardour it would be such a letter as yours To disappoint a friend is unpleasing and he that forms expectations like yours must be disappointed Think only when you see me that you see a man who loves you and is proud and glad that you love him I am Sir Your most affectionate SAM JOHNSON August three seventeen seventy three TO THE SAME Newcastle Aug eleven seventeen seventy one DEAR SIR I came hither last night and hope but do not absolutely promise to be in Edinburgh on Saturday Beattie will not come so soon I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON My compliments to your lady TO THE SAME mister Johnson sends his compliments to mister Boswell being just arrived at Boyd s Saturday night His stay in Scotland was from the eighteenth of August seven hundred eighty on which day he arrived till the twenty second of November when he set out on his return to London and I believe ninety four days seven hundred eighty one were never passed by any man in a more vigorous exertion He came by the way of Berwick upon Tweed to Edinburgh where he remained a few days and then went by saint Andrew s Aberdeen Inverness and Fort Augustus to the Hebrides to visit which was the principal object he had in view He visited the isles of Sky Rasay colonel Mull Inchkenneth and Icolmkill He travelled through Argyleshire by Inverary and from thence by Lochlomond and Dumbarton to Glasgow then by Loudon to Auchinleck in Ayrshire the seat of my family and then by Hamilton back to Edinburgh where he again spent some time He thus saw the four Universities of Scotland seven hundred eighty two its three principal cities and as much of the Highland and insular life as was sufficient for his philosophical contemplation I had the pleasure of accompanying him during the whole of this journey He was respectfully entertained by the great the learned and the elegant wherever he went nor was he less delighted with the hospitality which he experienced in humbler life seven hundred eighty three His various adventures and the force and vivacity of his mind as exercised during this peregrination upon innumerable topicks have been faithfully and to the best of my abilities displayed in my Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides to which as the publick has been pleased to honour it by a very extensive circulation seven hundred eighty four I beg leave to refer as to a separate and remarkable portion of his life seven hundred eighty five which may be there seen in detail and which exhibits as striking a view of his powers in conversation as his works do of his excellence in writing Nor can I deny to myself the very flattering gratification of inserting here the character which my friend mister Courtenay has been pleased to give of that work With Reynolds pencil vivid bold and true So fervent Boswell gives him to our view In every trait we see his mind expand The master rises by the pupil s hand We love the writer praise his happy vein Grac d with the naivete of the sage Montaigne Hence not alone are brighter parts display d But e en the specks of character pourtray d We see the Rambler with fastidious smile Mark the lone tree and note the heath clad isle But when th heroick tale of Flora s seven hundred eighty six charms Deck d in a kilt he wields a chieftain s arms The tuneful piper sounds a martial strain And Samuel sings The King shall have his ain During his stay at Edinburgh after his return from the Hebrides he was at great pains to obtain information concerning Scotland and it will appear from his subsequent letters that he was not less solicitous for intelligence on this subject after his return to London To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR I came home last night without any incommodity danger or weariness and am ready to begin a new journey I shall go to Oxford on Monday seven hundred eighty seven I know missus Boswell wished me well to go seven hundred eighty eight her wishes have not been disappointed missus Williams has received Sir A s seven hundred eighty nine letter Make my compliments to all those to whom my compliments may be welcome Let the box seven hundred ninety be sent as soon as it can and let me know when to expect it Enquire if you can the order of the Clans Macdonald is first Maclean second further I cannot go Quicken doctor Webster seven hundred ninety one I am Sir Yours affectionately SAM JOHNSON Nov twenty seven seventeen seventy three mister BOSWELL TO doctor JOHNSON Edinburgh Dec two seventeen seventy three You shall have what information I can procure as to the order of the Clans A gentleman of the name of Grant tells me that there is no settled order among them and he says that the Macdonalds were not placed upon the right of the army at Culloden seven hundred ninety two the Stuarts were I shall however examine witnesses of every name that I can find here doctor Webster shall be quickened too I like your little memorandums they are symptoms of your being in earnest with your book of northern travels Your box shall be sent next week by sea You will find in it some pieces of the broom bush which you saw growing on the old castle of Auchinleck The wood has a curious appearance when sawn across You may either have a little writing stand made of it or get it formed into boards for a treatise on witchcraft by way of a suitable binding mister BOSWELL TO doctor JOHNSON Edinburgh Dec eighteen seventeen seventy three You promised me an inscription for a print to be taken from an historical picture of Mary Queen of Scots being forced to resign her crown which mister Hamilton at Rome has painted for me The two following have been sent to me Maria Scotorum Regina meliori seculo digna jus regiitm civibus seditiosis invita resignat Cives seditiosi Mariam Scotorum Reginam sese muneri abdicare invitam cogunt Be so good as to read the passage in Robertson and see if you cannot give me a better inscription I must have it both in Latin and English so if you should not give me another Latin one you will at least choose the best of these two and send a translation of it His humane forgiving disposition was put to a pretty strong test on his return to London by a liberty which mister Thomas Davies had taken with him in his absence which was to publish two volumes entitled Miscellaneous and fugitive Pieces which he advertised in the news papers By the Authour of the Rambler In this collection several of doctor Johnson s acknowledged writings several of his anonymous performances and some which he had written for others were inserted but there were also some in which he had no concern whatever seven hundred ninety three He was at first very angry as he had good reason to be But upon consideration of his poor friend s narrow circumstances and that he had only a little profit in view and meant no harm he soon relented and continued his kindness to him as formerly seven hundred ninety four In the course of his self examination with retrospect to this year he seems to have been much dejected for he says January one seventeen seventy four This year has passed with so little improvement that I doubt whether I have not rather impaired than increased my learning seven hundred ninety five and yet we have seen how he read and we know how he talked during that period He was now seriously engaged in writing an account of our travels in the Hebrides in consequence of which I had the pleasure of a more frequent correspondence with him To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR My operations have been hindered by a cough at least I flatter myself that if my cough had not come I should have been further advanced But I have had no intelligence from doctor W Webster nor from the Excise office nor from you No account of the little borough seven hundred ninety six Nothing of the Erse language I have yet heard nothing of my box You must make haste and gather me all you can and do it quickly or I will and shall do without it Make my compliments to missus Boswell and tell her that I do not love her the less for wishing me away I gave her trouble enough and shall be glad in recompense to give her any pleasure I would send some porter into the Hebrides if I knew which way it could be got to my kind friends there Enquire and let me know Make my compliments to all the Doctors of Edinburgh and to all my friends from one end of Scotland to the other Write to me and send me what intelligence you can and if any thing is too bulky for the post let me have it by the carrier I do not like trusting winds and waves I am dear Sir Your most c SAM JOHNSON Jan twenty nine seventeen seventy four To THE SAME DEAR SIR In a day or two after I had written the last discontented letter I received my box which was very welcome But still I must entreat you to hasten doctor Webster and continue to pick up what you can that may be useful mister Oglethorpe was with me this morning you know his errand He was not unwelcome Tell missus Boswell that my good intentions towards her still continue I should be glad to do any thing that would either benefit or please her Chambers is not yet gone but so hurried or so negligent or so proud that I rarely see him I have indeed for some weeks past been very ill of a cold and cough and have been at missus Thrale s that I might be taken care of I am much better novae redeunt in praelia vires seven hundred ninety seven but I am yet tender and easily disordered How happy it was that neither of us were ill in the Hebrides The question of Literary Property is this day before the Lords seven hundred ninety eight Murphy seven hundred ninety nine drew up the Appellants case that is the plea against the perpetual right I have not seen it nor heard the decision I would not have the right perpetual I will write to you as any thing occurs and do you send me something about my Scottish friends I have very great kindness for them Let me know likewise how fees come in and when we are to see you I am Sir Yours affectionately SAM JOHNSON London Feb seven seventeen seventy four He at this time wrote the following letters to mister Steevens his able associate in editing Shakspeare To George Steevens esquire in Hampstead Sir If I am asked when I have seen mister Steevens you know what answer I must give if I am asked when I shall see him I wish you would tell me what to say If you have Lesley s History of Scotland or any other book about Scotland except Boetius and Buchanan it will be a kindness if you send them to Sir Your humble servant SAM JOHNSON Feb seven seventeen seventy four To the same Sir We are thinking to augment our club and I am desirous of nominating you if you care to stand the ballot and can attend on Friday nights at least twice in five weeks less than this is too little and rather more will be expected Be pleased to let me know before Friday I am Sir Your most c SAM JOHNSON Feb twenty one seventeen seventy four To the same Sir Last night you became a member of the club if you call on me on Friday I will introduce you A gentleman proposed after you was rejected I thank you for Neander but wish he were not so fine eight hundred I will take care of him I am Sir Your humble servant SAM JOHNSON March five seventeen seventy four To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR doctor Webster s informations were much less exact and much less determinate than I expected they are indeed much less positive than if he can trust his own book eight hundred one which he laid before me he is able to give But I believe it will always be found that he who calls much for information will advance his work but slowly I am however obliged to you dear Sir for your endeavours to help me and hope that between us something will some time be done if not on this on some occasion Chambers is either married or almost married to Miss Wilton a girl of sixteen exquisitely beautiful whom he has with his lawyer s tongue persuaded to take her chance with him in the East We have added to the club eight hundred two Charles Fox eight hundred three Sir Charles Bunbury eight hundred four doctor Fordyce eight hundred five and mister Steevens eight hundred six Return my thanks to doctor Webster Tell doctor Robertson I have not much to reply to his censure of my negligence and tell doctor Blair that since he has written hither what I said to him we must now consider ourselves as even forgive one another and begin again eight hundred seven I care not how soon for he is a very pleasing man Pay my compliments to all my friends and remind Lord Elibank of his promise to give me all his works I hope missus Boswell and little Miss are well When shall I see them again She is a sweet lady only she was so glad to see me go that I have almost a mind to come again that she may again have the same pleasure Enquire if it be practicable to send a small present of a cask of porter to Dunvegan Rasay and colonel I would not wish to be thought forgetful of civilities I am Sir Your humble servant SAM JOHNSON March five seventeen seventy four On the fifth of March I wrote to him requesting his counsel whether I should this spring come to London I stated to him on the one hand some pecuniary embarrassments which together with my wife s situation at that time made me hesitate and on the other the pleasure and improvement which my annual visit to the metropolis always afforded me and particularly mentioned a peculiar satisfaction which I experienced in celebrating the festival of Easter in saint Paul s cathedral that to my fancy it appeared like going up to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover and that the strong devotion which I felt on that occasion diffused its influence on my mind through the rest of the year eight hundred eight To JAMES BOSWELL esquire Not dated eight hundred nine but written about the fifteenth of March DEAR SIR I am ashamed to think that since I received your letter I have passed so many days without answering it I think there is no great difficulty in resolving your doubts The reasons for which you are inclined to visit London are I think not of sufficient strength to answer the objections That you should delight to come once a year to the fountain of intelligence and pleasure is very natural but both information and pleasure must be regulated by propriety Pleasure which cannot be obtained but by unseasonable or unsuitable expence must always end in pain and pleasure which must be enjoyed at the expence of another s pain can never be such as a worthy mind can fully delight in What improvement you might gain by coming to London you may easily supply or easily compensate by enjoining yourself some particular study at home or opening some new avenue to information Edinburgh is not yet exhausted and I am sure you will find no pleasure here which can deserve either that you should anticipate any part of your future fortune or that you should condemn yourself and your lady to penurious frugality for the rest of the year I need not tell you what regard you owe to missus Boswell s entreaties or how much you ought to study the happiness of her who studies yours with so much diligence and of whose kindness you enjoy such good effects Life cannot subsist in society but by reciprocal concessions She permitted you to ramble last year you must permit her now to keep you at home Your last reason is so serious that I am unwilling to oppose it Yet you must remember that your image of worshipping once a year in a certain place in imitation of the Jews is but a comparison and simile non est idem if the annual resort to Jerusalem was a duty to the Jews it was a duty because it was commanded and you have no such command therefore no such duty It may be dangerous to receive too readily and indulge too fondly opinions from which perhaps no pious mind is wholly disengaged of local sanctity and local devotion You know what strange effects they have produced over a great part of the Christian world I am now writing and you when you read this are reading under the Eye of Omnipresence To what degree fancy is to be admitted into religious offices it would require much deliberation to determine I am far from intending totally to exclude it Fancy is a faculty bestowed by our Creator and it is reasonable that all His gifts should be used to His glory that all our faculties should company operate in His worship but they are to company operate according to the will of Him that gave them according to the order which His wisdom has established As ceremonies prudential or convenient are less obligatory than positive ordinances as bodily worship is only the token to others or ourselves of mental adoration so Fancy is always to act in subordination to Reason We may take Fancy for a companion but must follow Reason as our guide We may allow Fancy to suggest certain ideas in certain places but Reason must always be heard when she tells us that those ideas and those places have no natural or necessary relation When we enter a church we habitually recall to mind the duty of adoration but we must not omit adoration for want of a temple because we know and ought to remember that the Universal Lord is every where present and that therefore to come to Jona eight hundred ten or to Jerusalem though it may be useful cannot be necessary Thus I have answered your letter and have not answered it negligently I love you too well to be careless when you are serious I think I shall be very diligent next week about our travels which I have too long neglected I am dear Sir Your most c SAM JOHNSON Compliments to Madam and Miss To The Same DEAR SIR The lady who delivers this has a lawsuit in which she desires to make use of your skill and eloquence and she seems to think that she shall have something more of both for a recommendation from me which though I know how little you want any external incitement to your duty I could not refuse her because I know that at least it will not hurt her to tell you that I wish her well I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON May ten seventeen seventy four mister BOSWELL TO doctor JOHNSON Edinburgh May twelve seventeen seventy four Lord Hailes has begged of me to offer you his best respects and to transmit to you specimens of Annals of Scotland from the Accession of Malcolm Kenmore to the Death of James V in drawing up which his Lordship has been engaged for some time His Lordship writes to me thus If I could procure doctor Johnson s criticisms they would be of great use to me in the prosecution of my work as they would be judicious and true I have no right to ask that favour of him If you could it would highly oblige me doctor Blair requests you may be assured that he did not write to London what you said to him and that neither by word nor letter has he made the least complaint of you but on the contrary has a high respect for you and loves you much more since he saw you in Scotland It would both divert and please you to see his eagerness about this matter To JAMES BOSWELL esquire Streatham June twenty one seventeen seventy four DEAR SIR Yesterday I put the first sheets of the Journey to the Hebrides to the press I have endeavoured to do you some justice in the first paragraph eight hundred eleven It will be one volume in octavo not thick It will be proper to make some presents in Scotland You shall tell me to whom I shall give and I have stipulated twenty five for you to give in your own name eight hundred twelve Some will take the present better from me others better from you In this you who are to live in the place ought to direct Consider it Whatever you can get for my purpose send me and make my compliments to your lady and both the young ones I am Sir your c SAM JOHNSON mister BOSWELL TO doctor JOHNSON Edinburgh June twenty four seventeen seventy four You do not acknowledge the receipt of the various packets which I have sent to you Neither can I prevail with you to answer my letters though you honour me with returns eight hundred thirteen You have said nothing to me about poor Goldsmith eight hundred fourteen nothing about Langton eight hundred fifteen I have received for you from the Society for propagating Christian Knowledge in Scotland eight hundred sixteen the following Erse books The New Testament Baxter s Call The Confession of Faith of the Assembly of Divines at Westminster The Mother s Catechism A Gaelick and English Vocabulary eight hundred seventeen To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR I wish you could have looked over my book before the printer but it could not easily be I suspect some mistakes but as I deal perhaps more in notions than in facts the matter is not great and the second edition will be mended if any such there be The press will go on slowly for a time because I am going into Wales to morrow I should be very sorry if I appeared to treat such a character as Lord Hailes otherwise than with high respect I return the sheets eight hundred eighteen to which I have done what mischief I could and finding it so little thought not much of sending them The narrative is clear lively and short I have done worse to Lord Hailes than by neglecting his sheets I have run him in debt doctor Horne the President of Magdalen College in Oxford wrote to me about three months ago that he purposed to reprint Walton s Lives and desired me to contribute to the work my answer was that Lord Hailes intended the same publication and doctor Home has resigned it to him eight hundred nineteen His Lordship must now think seriously about it Of poor dear doctor Goldsmith there is little to be told more than the papers have made publick He died of a fever made I am afraid more violent by uneasiness of mind His debts began to be heavy and all his resources were exhausted Sir Joshua eight hundred twenty is of opinion that he owed not less than two thousand pounds eight hundred twenty one Was ever poet so trusted before You may if you please put the inscription thus Maria Scotorum Regina nata fifteen a suis in exilium acta fifteen ab hospita neci data fifteen You must find the years Of your second daughter you certainly gave the account yourself though you have forgotten it While missus Boswell is well never doubt of a boy missus Thrale brought I think five girls running but while I was with you she had a boy I am obliged to you for all your pamphlets and of the last I hope to make some use I made some of the former I am dear Sir Your most affectionate servant SAM JOHNSON July four seventeen seventy four My compliments to all the three ladies TO BENNET LANGTON esquire AT LANGTON NEAR SPILSBY LINCOLNSHIRE DEAR SIR You have reason to reproach me that I have left your last letter so long unanswered but I had nothing particular to say Chambers you find is gone far and poor Goldsmith is gone much further He died of a fever exasperated as I believe by the fear of distress He had raised money and squandered it by every artifice of acquisition and folly of expence But let not his frailties be remembered he was a very great man eight hundred twenty two I have just begun to print my Journey to the Hebrides and am leaving the press to take another journey into Wales whither mister Thrale is going to take possession of at least five hundred a year fallen to his lady All at Streatham that are alive eight hundred twenty three are well I have never recovered from the last dreadful illness eight hundred twenty four but flatter myself that I grow gradually better much however yet remains to mend Greek Kurie eleaeson eight hundred twenty five If you have the Latin version of Busy curious thirsty fly eight hundred twenty six be so kind as to transcribe and send it but you need not be in haste for I shall be I know not where for at least five weeks I wrote the following tetastrick on poor Goldsmith Greek Ton taphon eisoraas ton Olibaroio koniaen Aphrosi mae semnaen Xeine podessi patei Oisi memaele phusis metron charis erga palaion Klaiete posaetaen istorikon phusikon eight hundred twenty seven Please to make my most respectful compliments to all the ladies and remember me to young George and his sisters I reckon George begins to shew a pair of heels Do not be sullen now eight hundred twenty eight but let me find a letter when I come back I am dear Sir Your affectionate humble servant SAM JOHNSON July five seventeen seventy four To mister ROBERT LEVET Llewenny eight hundred twenty nine in Denbighshire Aug sixteen seventeen seventy four DEAR SIR mister Thrale s affairs have kept him here a great while nor do I know exactly when we shall come hence I have sent you a bill upon mister Strahan I have made nothing of the Ipecacuanha but have taken abundance of pills and hope that they have done me good Wales so far as I have yet seen of it is a very beautiful and rich country all enclosed and planted Denbigh is not a mean town Make my compliments to all my friends and tell Frank I hope he remembers my advice When his money is out let him have more I am Sir Your humble servant SAM JOHNSON mister BOSWELL TO doctor JOHNSON Edinburgh Aug thirty seventeen seventy four You have given me an inscription for a portrait of Mary Queen of Scots in which you in a short and striking manner point out her hard fate But you will be pleased to keep in mind that my picture is a representation of a particular scene in her history her being forced to resign her crown while she was imprisoned in the castle of Lochlevin I must therefore beg that you will be kind enough to give me an inscription suited to that particular scene or determine which of the two formerly transmitted to you is the best and at any rate favour me with an English translation It will be doubly kind if you comply with my request speedily Your critical notes on the specimen of Lord Hailes s Annals of Scotland are excellent I agreed with you in every one of them He himself objected only to the alteration of free to brave in the passage where he says that Edward departed with the glory due to the conquerour of a free people He says to call the Scots brave would only add to the glory of their conquerour You will make allowance for the national zeal of our annalist I now send a few more leaves of the Annals which I hope you will peruse and return with observations as you did upon the former occasion Lord Hailes writes to me thus mister Boswell will be pleased to express the grateful sense which Sir David Dalrymple eight hundred thirty has of doctor Johnson s attention to his little specimen The further specimen will show that Even in an Edward he can see desert eight hundred thirty one It gives me much pleasure to hear that a republication of Isaac Walton s Lives is intended You have been in a mistake in thinking that Lord Hailes had it in view I remember one morning eight hundred thirty two while he sat with you in my house he said that there should be a new edition of Walton s Lives and you said that they should be benoted a little This was all that passed on that subject You must therefore inform doctor Horne that he may resume his plan I enclose a note concerning it and if doctor Horne will write to me all the attention that I can give shall be cheerfully bestowed upon what I think a pious work the preservation and elucidation of Walton by whose writings I have been most pleasingly edified mister BOSWELL TO doctor JOHNSON Edinburgh Sept sixteen seventeen seventy four Wales has probably detained you longer than I supposed You will have become quite a mountaineer by visiting Scotland one year and Wales another You must next go to Switzerland Cambria will complain if you do not honour her also with some remarks And I find concessere columnae eight hundred thirty three the booksellers expect another book I am impatient to see your Tour to Scotland and the Hebrides eight hundred thirty four Might you not send me a copy by the post as soon as it is printed off TO JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR Yesterday I returned from my Welch journey I was sorry to leave my book suspended so long but having an opportunity of seeing with so much convenience a new part of the island I could not reject it I have been in five of the six counties of North Wales and have seen saint Asaph and Bangor the two seats of their Bishops have been upon Penmanmaur eight hundred thirty five and Snowden eight hundred thirty six and passed over into Anglesea But Wales is so little different from England that it offers nothing to the speculation of the traveller When I came home I found several of your papers with some pages of Lord Hailes s Annals which I will consider I am in haste to give you some account of myself lest you should suspect me of negligence in the pressing business which I find recommended to my care and which I knew nothing of till now when all care is vain eight hundred thirty seven In the distribution of my books I purpose to follow your advice adding such as shall occur to me I am not pleased with your notes of remembrance added to your names for I hope I shall not easily forget them I have received four Erse books without any direction and suspect that they are intended for the Oxford library If that is the intention I think it will be proper to add the metrical psalms and whatever else is printed in Erse that the present may be complete The donor s name should be told I wish you could have read the book before it was printed but our distance does not easily permit it I am sorry Lord Hailes does not intend to publish Walton I am afraid it will not be done so well if it be done at all I purpose now to drive the book forward Make my compliments to missus Boswell and let me hear often from you I am dear Sir Your affectionate humble servant SAM JOHNSON London Octob one seventeen seventy four This tour to Wales which was made in company with mister and missus Thrale though it no doubt contributed to his health and amusement did not give an occasion to such a discursive exercise of his mind as our tour to the Hebrides I do not find that he kept any journal or notes of what he saw there eight hundred thirty eight All that I heard him say of it was that instead of bleak and barren mountains there were green and fertile ones and that one of the castles in Wales would contain all the castles that he had seen in Scotland Parliament having been dissolved eight hundred thirty nine and his friend mister Thrale who was a steady supporter of government having again to encounter the storm of a contested election he wrote a short political pamphlet entitled The Patriot addressed to the electors of Great Britain a title which to factious men who consider a patriot only as an opposer of the measures of government will appear strangely misapplied It was however written with energetick vivacity and except those passages in which it endeavours to vindicate the glaring outrage of the House of Commons in the case of the Middlesex election and to justify the attempt to reduce our fellow subjects in America to unconditional submission it contained an admirable display of the properties of a real patriot in the original and genuine sense a sincere steady rational and unbiassed friend to the interests and prosperity of his King and country It must be acknowledged however that both in this and his two former pamphlets there was amidst many powerful arguments not only a considerable portion of sophistry but a contemptuous ridicule of his opponents which was very provoking To mister PERKINS eight hundred forty SIR You may do me a very great favour missus Williams a gentlewoman whom you may have seen at mister Thrale s is a petitioner for mister Hetherington s charity petitions are this day issued at Christ s Hospital I am a bad manager of business in a crowd and if I should send a mean man he may be put away without his errand I must therefore intreat that you will go and ask for a petition for Anna Williams whose paper of enquiries was delivered with answers at the counting house of the hospital on Thursday the twentieth My servant will attend you thither and bring the petition home when you have it The petition which they are to give us is a form which they deliver to every petitioner and which the petitioner is afterwards to fill up and return to them again This we must have or we cannot proceed according to their directions You need I believe only ask for a petition if they enquire for whom you ask you can tell them I beg pardon for giving you this trouble but it is a matter of great importance I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON October twenty five seventeen seventy four To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR There has appeared lately in the papers an account of a boat overset between Mull and Ulva in which many passengers were lost and among them Maclean of colonel We you know were once drowned eight hundred forty one I hope therefore that the story is either wantonly or erroneously told Pray satisfy me by the next post I have printed two hundred and forty pages I am able to do nothing much worth doing to dear Lord Hailes s book I will however send back the sheets and hope by degrees to answer all your reasonable expectations mister Thrale has happily surmounted a very violent and acrimonious opposition eight hundred forty two but all joys have their abatement missus Thrale has fallen from her horse and hurt herself very much The rest of our friends I believe are well My compliments to missus Boswell I am Sir Your most affectionate servant SAM JOHNSON London October twenty seven seventeen seventy four This letter which shows his tender concern for an amiable young gentleman to whom he had been very much obliged in the Hebrides I have inserted according to its date though before receiving it I had informed him of the melancholy event that the young Laird of colonel was unfortunately drowned eight hundred forty three To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR Last night I corrected the last page of our Journey to the Hebrides The printer has detained it all this time for I had before I went into Wales written all except two sheets The Patriot was called for by my political friends on Friday was written on Saturday and I have heard little of it So vague are conjectures at a distance eight hundred forty four As soon as I can I will take care that copies be sent to you for I would wish that they might be given before they are bought but I am afraid that mister Strahan will send to you and to the booksellers at the same time Trade is as diligent as courtesy I have mentioned all that you recommended Pray make my compliments to missus Boswell and the younglings The club has I think not yet met Tell me and tell me honestly what you think and what others say of our travels Shall we touch the continent eight hundred forty five I am dear Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON Nov twenty six seventeen seventy four In his manuscript diary of this year there is the following entry Nov twenty seven Advent Sunday I considered that this day being the beginning of the ecclesiastical year was a proper time for a new course of life I began to read the Greek Testament regularly at one hundred sixty verses every Sunday This day I began the Acts In this week I read Virgil s Pastorals I learned to repeat the Pollio and Gallus I read carelessly the first Georgick Such evidences of his unceasing ardour both for divine and human lore when advanced into his sixty fifth year and notwithstanding his many disturbances from disease must make us at once honour his spirit and lament that it should be so grievously clogged by its material tegument It is remarkable that he was very fond of the precision which calculation produces eight hundred forty six Thus we find in one of his manuscript diaries twelve pages in fourto Gr Test and thirty pages in Beza s folio comprize the whole in forty days doctor JOHNSON TO JOHN HOOLE esquire eight hundred forty seven DEAR SIR I have returned your play eight hundred forty eight which you will find underscored with red where there was a word which I did not like The red will be washed off with a little water The plot is so well framed the intricacy so artful and the disentanglement so easy the suspense so affecting and the passionate parts so properly interposed that I have no doubt of its success I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON December nineteen seventeen seventy four seventeen seventy five AETAT sixty six The first effort of his pen in seventeen seventy five was Proposals for publishing the Works of missus Charlotte Lennox eight hundred forty nine Dagger in three volumes quarto In his diary January two I find this entry Wrote Charlotte s Proposals But indeed the internal evidence would have been quite sufficient Her claim to the favour of the public was thus enforced Most of the pieces as they appeared singly have been read with approbation perhaps above their merits but of no great advantage to the writer She hopes therefore that she shall not be considered as too indulgent to vanity or too studious of interest if from that labour which has hitherto been chiefly gainful to others she endeavours to obtain at last some profit for herself and her children She cannot decently enforce her claim by the praise of her own performances nor can she suppose that by the most artful and laboured address any additional notice could be procured to a publication of which Her MAJESTY has condescended to be the PATRONESS He this year also wrote the Preface to Baretti s Easy Lessons in Italian and English eight hundred fifty To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR You never did ask for a book by the post till now and I did not think on it You see now it is done I sent one to the King and I hear he likes it eight hundred fifty one I shall send a parcel into Scotland for presents and intend to give to many of my friends In your catalogue you left out Lord Auchinleck Let me know as fast as you read it how you like it and let me know if any mistake is committed or any thing important left out I wish you could have seen the sheets My compliments to missus Boswell and to Veronica eight hundred fifty two and to all my friends I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON January fourteen seventeen seventy five mister BOSWELL TO doctor JOHNSON Edinburgh Jan nineteen seventeen seventy five Be pleased to accept of my best thanks for your Journey to the Hebrides which came to me by last night s post I did really ask the favour twice but you have been even with me by granting it so speedily Bis dat qui cito dat eight hundred fifty three Though ill of a bad cold you kept me up the greatest part of the last night for I did not stop till I had read every word of your book I looked back to our first talking of a visit a visit to the Hebrides which was many years ago when sitting by ourselves in the Mitre tavern eight hundred fifty four in London I think about witching time o night eight hundred fifty five and then exulted in contemplating our scheme fulfilled and a monumentum perenne eight hundred fifty six of it erected by your superiour abilities I shall only say that your book has afforded me a high gratification I shall afterwards give you my thoughts on particular passages In the mean time I hasten to tell you of your having mistaken two names which you will correct in London as I shall do here that the gentlemen who deserve the valuable compliments which you have paid them may enjoy their honours In page one hundred six for Gordon read Murchison and in page three hundred fifty seven for Maclean read Macleod eight hundred fifty seven But I am now to apply to you for immediate aid in my profession which you have never refused to grant when I requested it I enclose you a petition for doctor Memis a physician at Aberdeen in which Sir John Dalrymple has exerted his talents and which I am to answer as Counsel for the managers of the Royal Infirmary in that city mister Jopp the Provost who delivered to you your freedom eight hundred fifty eight is one of my clients and as a citizen of Aberdeen you will support him The fact is shortly this In a translation of the charter of the Infirmary from Latin into English made under the authority of the managers the same phrase in the original is in one place rendered Physician but when applied to doctor Memis is rendered Doctor of Medicine doctor Memis complained of this before the translation was printed but was not indulged with having it altered and he has brought an action for damages on account of a supposed injury as if the designation given to him was an inferiour one tending to make it be supposed he is not a Physician and consequently to hurt his practice My father has dismissed the action as groundless and now he has appealed to the whole Court eight hundred fifty nine TO JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR I long to hear how you like the book it is I think much liked here But Macpherson is very furious eight hundred sixty can you give me any more intelligence about him or his Fingal Do what you can and do it quickly Is Lord Hailes on our side Pray let me know what I owed you when I left you that I may send it to you I am going to write about the Americans eight hundred sixty one If you have picked up any hints among your lawyers who are great masters of the law of nations or if your own mind suggests any thing let me know But mum it is a secret I will send your parcel of books as soon as I can but I cannot do as I wish However you find every thing mentioned in the book which you recommended Langton is here we are all that ever we were eight hundred sixty two He is a worthy fellow without malice though not without resentment Poor Beauclerk is so ill that his life is thought to be in danger eight hundred sixty three Lady Di nurses him with very great assiduity Reynolds has taken too much to strong liquor eight hundred sixty four and seems to delight in his new character This is all the news that I have but as you love verses I will send you a few which I made upon Inchkenneth eight hundred sixty five but remember the condition you shall not show them except to Lord Hailes whom I love better than any man whom I know so little If he asks you to transcribe them for him you may do it but I think he must promise not to let them be copied again nor to show them as mine I have at last sent back Lord Hailes s sheets I never think about returning them because I alter nothing You will see that I might as well have kept them However I am ashamed of my delay and if I have the honour of receiving any more promise punctually to return them by the next post Make my compliments to dear missus Boswell and to Miss Veronica I am dear Sir Yours most faithfully SAM JOHNSON eight hundred sixty six Jan twenty one seventeen seventy five mister BOSWELL TO doctor JOHNSON Edinburgh Jan twenty seven seventeen seventy five You rate our lawyers here too high when you call them great masters of the law of nations As for myself I am ashamed to say I have read little and thought little on the subject of America I will be much obliged to you if you will direct me where I shall find the best information of what is to be said on both sides It is a subject vast in its present extent and future consequences The imperfect hints which now float in my mind tend rather to the formation of an opinion that our government has been precipitant and severe in the resolutions taken against the Bostonians eight hundred sixty seven Well do you know that I have no kindness for that race But nations or bodies of men should as well as individuals have a fair trial and not be condemned on character alone Have we not express contracts with our colonies which afford a more certain foundation of judgement than general political speculations on the mutual rights of States and their provinces or colonies Pray let me know immediately what to read and I shall diligently endeavour to gather for you any thing that I can find Is Burke s speech on American taxation published by himself Is it authentick I remember to have heard you say that you had never considered East Indian affairs though surely they are of much importance to Great Britain Under the recollection of this I shelter myself from the reproach of ignorance about the Americans If you write upon the subject I shall certainly understand it But since you seem to expect that I should know something of it without your instruction and that my own mind should suggest something I trust you will put me in the way What does Becket eight hundred sixty eight mean by the Originals of Fingal and other poems of Ossian which he advertises to have lain in his shop TO JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR You sent me a case to consider in which I have no facts but what are against us nor any principles on which to reason It is vain to try to write thus without materials The fact seems to be against you at least I cannot know nor say any thing to the contrary I am glad that you like the book so well I hear no more of Macpherson I shall long to know what Lord Hailes says of it Lend it him privately I shall send the parcel as soon as I can Make my compliments to missus Boswell I am Sir c SAM JOHNSON Jan twenty eight seventeen seventy five mister BOSWELL TO doctor JOHNSON Edinburgh Feb two seventeen seventy five As to Macpherson I am anxious to have from yourself a full and pointed account of what has passed between you and him It is confidently told here that before your book came out he sent to you to let you know that he understood you meant to deny the authenticity of Ossian s poems that the originals were in his possession that you might have inspection of them and might take the evidence of people skilled in the Erse language and that he hoped after this fair offer you would not be so uncandid as to assert that he had refused reasonable proof That you paid no regard to his message but published your strong attack upon him and then he wrote a letter to you in such terms as he thought suited to one who had not acted as a man of veracity You may believe it gives me pain to hear your conduct represented as unfavourable while I can only deny what is said on the ground that your character refutes it without having any information to oppose Let me I beg it of you be furnished with a sufficient answer to any calumny upon this occasion Lord Hailes writes to me for we correspond more than we talk together As to Fingal I see a controversy arising and purpose to keep out of its way There is no doubt that I might mention some circumstances but I do not choose to commit them to paper eight hundred sixty nine What his opinion is I do not know He says I am singularly obliged to doctor Johnson for his accurate and useful criticisms Had he given some strictures on the general plan of the work it would have added much to his favours He is charmed with your verses on Inchkenneth says they are very elegant but bids me tell you he doubts whether be according to the rubrick but that is your concern for you know he is a Presbyterian Legitimas faciunt pectora pura preces eight hundred seventy To doctor LAWRENCE eight hundred seventy one Feb seven seventeen seventy five SIR One of the Scotch physicians is now prosecuting a corporation that in some publick instrument have stiled him Doctor of Medicine instead of Physician Boswell desires being advocate for the corporation to know whether Doctor of Medicine is not a legitimate title and whether it may be considered as a disadvantageous distinction I am to write to night be pleased to tell me I am Sir your most c SAM JOHNSON To JAMES BOSWELL esquire My DEAR BOSWELL I am surprised that knowing as you do the disposition of your countrymen to tell lies in favour of each other eight hundred seventy two you can be at all affected by any reports that circulate among them Macpherson never in his life offered me a sight of any original or of any evidence of any kind but thought only of intimidating me by noise and threats till my last answer that I would not be deterred from detecting what I thought a cheat by the menaces of a ruffian put an end to our correspondence The state of the question is this He and doctor Blair whom I consider as deceived say that he copied the poem from old manuscripts His copies if he had them and I believe him to have none are nothing Where are the manuscripts They can be shown if they exist but they were never shown De non existentibus et non apparentibus says our law eadem est ratio No man has a claim to credit upon his own word when better evidence if he had it may be easily produced But so far as we can find the Erse language was never written till very lately for the purposes of religion A nation that cannot write or a language that was never written has no manuscripts But whatever he has he never offered to show If old manuscripts should now be mentioned I should unless there were more evidence than can be easily had suppose them another proof of Scotch conspiracy in national falsehood Do not censure the expression you know it to be true doctor Memis s question is so narrow as to allow no speculation and I have no facts before me but those which his advocate has produced against you I consulted this morning the President of the London College of Physicians eight hundred seventy three who says that with us Doctor of Physick we do not say Doctor of Medicine is the highest title that a practicer of physick can have that Doctor implies not only Physician but teacher of physick that every Doctor is legally a Physician but no man not a Doctor can practice physick but by licence particularly granted The Doctorate is a licence of itself It seems to us a very slender cause of prosecution I am now engaged but in a little time I hope to do all you would have My compliments to Madam and Veronica I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON February seven seventeen seventy five What words were used by mister Macpherson in his letter to the venerable Sage I have never heard but they are generally said to have been of a nature very different from the language of literary contest doctor Johnson s answer appeared in the newspapers of the day and has since been frequently re published but not with perfect accuracy I give it as dictated to me by himself written down in his presence and authenticated by a note in his own hand writing This I think is a true copy eight hundred seventy four mister JAMES MACPHERSON I received your foolish and impudent letter Any violence offered me I shall do my best to repel and what I cannot do for myself the law shall do for me I hope I shall never be deterred from detecting what I think a cheat by the menaces of a ruffian What would you have me retract I thought your book an imposture I think it an imposture still For this opinion I have given my reasons to the publick which I here dare you to refute Your rage I defy Your abilities since your Homer eight hundred seventy five are not so formidable and what I hear of your morals inclines me to pay regard not to what you shall say but to what you shall prove You may print this if you will SAM JOHNSON eight hundred seventy six mister Macpherson little knew the character of doctor Johnson if he supposed that he could be easily intimidated for no man was ever more remarkable for personal courage He had indeed an aweful dread of death or rather of something after death eight hundred seventy seven and what rational man who seriously thinks of quitting all that he has ever known and going into a new and unknown state of being can be without that dread But his fear was from reflection his courage natural His fear in that one instance was the result of philosophical and religious consideration He feared death but he feared nothing else not even what might occasion death eight hundred seventy eight Many instances of his resolution may be mentioned One day at mister Beauclerk s house in the country when two large dogs were fighting he went up to them and beat them till they separated eight hundred seventy nine and at another time when told of the danger there was that a gun might burst if charged with many balls he put in six or seven and fired it off against a wall mister Langton told me that when they were swimming together near Oxford he cautioned doctor Johnson against a pool which was reckoned particularly dangerous upon which Johnson directly swam into it He told me himself that one night he was attacked in the street by four men to whom he would not yield but kept them all at bay till the watch came up and carried both him and them to the round house eight hundred eighty In the playhouse at Lichfield as mister Garrick informed me Johnson having for a moment quitted a chair which was placed for him between the side scenes a gentleman took possession of it and when Johnson on his return civilly demanded his seat rudely refused to give it up upon which Johnson laid hold of it and tossed him and the chair into the pit Foote who so successfully revived the old comedy by exhibiting living characters had resolved to imitate Johnson on the stage expecting great profits from his ridicule of so celebrated a man Johnson being informed of his intention and being at dinner at mister Thomas Davies s the bookseller from whom I had the story he asked mister Davies what was the common price of an oak stick and being answered six pence Why then Sir said he give me leave to send your servant to purchase me a shilling one I ll have a double quantity for I am told Foote means to take me off as he calls it and I am determined the fellow shall not do it with impunity Davies took care to acquaint Foote of this which effectually checked the wantonness of the mimick eight hundred eighty one mister Macpherson s menaces made Johnson provide himself with the same implement of defence eight hundred eighty two and had he been attacked I have no doubt that old as he was he would have made his corporal prowess be felt as much as his intellectual His Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland eight hundred eighty three is a most valuable performance It abounds in extensive philosophical views of society and in ingenious sentiment and lively description A considerable part of it indeed consists of speculations which many years before he saw the wild regions which we visited together probably had employed his attention though the actual sight of those scenes undoubtedly quickened and augmented them mister Orme the very able historian eight hundred eighty four agreed with me in this opinion which he thus strongly expressed There are in that book thoughts which by long revolution in the great mind of Johnson have been formed and polished like pebbles rolled in the ocean That he was to some degree of excess a true born Englishman eight hundred eighty five so as to have entertained an undue prejudice against both the country and the people of Scotland must be allowed eight hundred eighty six But it was a prejudice of the head and not of the heart He had no ill will to the Scotch for if he had been conscious of that he would never have thrown himself into the bosom of their country and trusted to the protection of its remote inhabitants with a fearless confidence His remark upon the nakedness of the country from its being denuded of trees eight hundred eighty seven was made after having travelled two hundred miles along the eastern coast where certainly trees are not to be found near the road and he said it was a map of the road eight hundred eighty eight which he gave His disbelief of the authenticity of the poems ascribed to Ossian a Highland bard was confirmed in the course of his journey by a very strict examination of the evidence offered for it and although their authenticity was made too much a national point by the Scotch there were many respectable persons in that country who did not concur in this so that his judgement upon the question ought not to be decried even by those who differ from him As to myself I can only say upon a subject now become very uninteresting that when the fragments of Highland poetry first came out I was much pleased with their wild peculiarity and was one of those who subscribed to enable their editor mister Macpherson then a young man to make a search in the Highlands and Hebrides for a long poem in the Erse language which was reported to be preserved somewhere in those regions But when there came forth an Epick Poem in six books with all the common circumstances of former compositions of that nature and when upon an attentive examination of it there was found a perpetual recurrence of the same images which appear in the fragments and when no ancient manuscript to authenticate the work was deposited in any publick library though that was insisted on as a reasonable proof who could forbear to doubt eight hundred eighty nine Johnson s grateful acknowledgements of kindnesses received in the course of this tour completely refute the brutal reflections which have been thrown out against him as if he had made an ungrateful return and his delicacy in sparing in his book those who we find from his letters to missus Thrale were just objects of censure eight hundred ninety is much to be admired His candour and amiable disposition is conspicuous from his conduct when informed by mister Macleod of Rasay that he had committed a mistake which gave that gentleman some uneasiness He wrote him a courteous and kind letter and inserted in the news papers an advertisement correcting the mistake eight hundred ninety one The observations of my friend mister Dempster in a letter eight hundred ninety two written to me soon after he had read doctor Johnson s book are so just and liberal that they cannot be too often repeated There is nothing in the book from beginning to end that a Scotchman need to take amiss What he says of the country is true and his observations on the people are what must naturally occur to a sensible observing and reflecting inhabitant of a convenient metropolis where a man on thirty pounds a year may be better accommodated with all the little wants of life than colonel or Sir Allan I am charmed with his researches concerning the Erse language and the antiquity of their manuscripts I am quite convinced and I shall rank Ossian and his Fingals and Oscars amongst the nursery tales not the true history of our country in all time to come Upon the whole the book cannot displease for it has no pretensions The authour neither says he is a geographer nor an antiquarian nor very learned in the history of Scotland nor a naturalist nor a fossilist eight hundred ninety three The manners of the people and the face of the country are all he attempts to describe or seems to have thought of Much were it to be wished that they who have travelled into more remote and of course more curious regions had all possessed his good sense Of the state of learning his observations on Glasgow University show he has formed a very sound judgement He understands our climate too and he has accurately observed the changes however slow and imperceptible to us which Scotland has undergone in consequence of the blessings of liberty and internal peace mister Knox another native of Scotland who has since made the same tour and published an account of it is equally liberal I have read says he his book again and again travelled with him from Berwick to Glenelg through countries with which I am well acquainted sailed with him from Glenelg to Rasay Sky Rum colonel Mull and Icolmkill but have not been able to correct him in any matter of consequence I have often admired the accuracy the precision and the justness of what he advances respecting both the country and the people The Doctor has every where delivered his sentiments with freedom and in many instances with a seeming regard for the benefit of the inhabitants and the ornament of the country His remarks on the want of trees and hedges for shade as well as for shelter to the cattle are well founded and merit the thanks not the illiberal censure of the natives He also felt for the distresses of the Highlanders and explodes with great propriety the bad management of the grounds and the neglect of timber in the Hebrides Having quoted Johnson s just compliments on the Rasay family eight hundred ninety four he says On the other hand I found this family equally lavish in their encomiums upon the Doctor s conversation and his subsequent civilities to a young gentleman of that country who upon waiting upon him at London was well received and experienced all the attention and regard that a warm friend could bestow mister Macleod having also been in London waited upon the Doctor who provided a magnificent and expensive entertainment in honour of his old Hebridean acquaintance And talking of the military road by Fort Augustus he says By this road though one of the most rugged in Great Britain the celebrated doctor Johnson passed from Inverness to the Hebride Isles His observations on the country and people are extremely correct judicious and instructive eight hundred ninety five mister Tytler the acute and able vindicator of Mary Queen of Scots in one of his letters to mister James Elphinstone published in that gentleman s Forty Years Correspondence says I read doctor Johnson s Tour with very great pleasure Some few errours he has fallen into but of no great importance and those are lost in the numberless beauties of his work If I had leisure I could perhaps point out the most exceptionable places but at present I am in the country and have not his book at hand It is plain he meant to speak well of Scotland and he has in my apprehension done us great honour in the most capital article the character of the inhabitants His private letters to missus Thrale written during the course of his journey which therefore may be supposed to convey his genuine feelings at the time abound in such benignant sentiments towards the people who showed him civilities eight hundred ninety six that no man whose temper is not very harsh and sour can retain a doubt of the goodness of his heart It is painful to recollect with what rancour he was assailed by numbers of shallow irritable North Britons on account of his supposed injurious treatment of their country and countrymen in his Journey Had there been any just ground for such a charge would the virtuous and candid Dempster eight hundred ninety seven have given his opinion of the book in the terms which I have quoted Would the patriotick Knox eight hundred ninety eight have spoken of it as he has done Would mister Tytler surely a Scot if ever Scot there were have expressed himself thus And let me add that citizen of the world as I hold myself to be I have that degree of predilection for my natale solum nay I have that just sense of the merit of an ancient nation which has been ever renowned for its valour which in former times maintained its independence against a powerful neighbour and in modern times has been equally distinguished for its ingenuity and industry in civilized life that I should have felt a generous indignation at any injustice done to it Johnson treated Scotland no worse than he did even his best friends whose characters he used to give as they appeared to him both in light and shade Some people who had not exercised their minds sufficiently condemned him for censuring his friends But Sir Joshua Reynolds whose philosophical penetration and justness of thinking were not less known to those who lived with him than his genius in his art is admired by the world explained his conduct thus He was fond of discrimination which he could not show without pointing out the bad as well as the good in every character and as his friends were those whose characters he knew best they afforded him the best opportunity for showing the acuteness of his judgement He expressed to his friend mister Windham of Norfolk his wonder at the extreme jealousy of the Scotch and their resentment at having their country described by him as it really was when to say that it was a country as good as England would have been a gross falsehood None of us said he would be offended if a foreigner who has travelled here should say that vines and olives don t grow in England And as to his prejudice against the Scotch which I always ascribed to that nationality which he observed in them he said to the same gentleman When I find a Scotchman to whom an Englishman is as a Scotchman that Scotchman shall be as an Englishman to me eight hundred ninety nine His intimacy with many gentlemen of Scotland and his employing so many natives of that country as his amanuenses nine hundred prove that his prejudice was not virulent and I have deposited in the British Museum amongst other pieces of his writing the following note in answer to one from me asking if he would meet me at dinner at the Mitre though a friend of mine a Scotchman was to be there mister Johnson does not see why mister Boswell should suppose a Scotchman less acceptable than any other man He will be at the Mitre My much valued friend doctor Barnard now Bishop of Killaloe having once expressed to him an apprehension that if he should visit Ireland he might treat the people of that country more unfavourably than he had done the Scotch he answered with strong pointed double edged wit Sir you have no reason to be afraid of me The Irish are not in a conspiracy to cheat the world by false representations of the merits of their countrymen nine hundred one No Sir the Irish are a FAIR PEOPLE they never speak well of one another Johnson told me of an instance of Scottish nationality which made a very unfavourable impression upon his mind A Scotchman of some consideration in London solicited him to recommend by the weight of his learned authority to be master of an English school a person of whom he who recommended him confessed he knew no more but that he was his countryman Johnson was shocked at this unconscientious conduct nine hundred two All the miserable cavillings against his Journey in news papers nine hundred three magazines and other fugitive publications I can speak from certain knowledge only furnished him with sport At last there came out a scurrilous volume larger than Johnson s own filled with malignant abuse under a name real or fictitious of some low man in an obscure corner of Scotland though supposed to be the work of another Scotchman who has found means to make himself well known both in Scotland and England The effect which it had upon Johnson was to produce this pleasant observation to mister Seward to whom he lent the book This fellow must be a blockhead They don t know how to go about their abuse Who will read a five shilling book against me No Sir if they had wit they should have kept pelting me with pamphlets nine hundred four mister BOSWELL TO doctor JOHNSON Edinburgh Feb eighteen seventeen seventy five You would have been very well pleased if you had dined with me to day I had for my guests Macquharrie young Maclean of colonel the successor of our friend a very amiable man though not marked with such active qualities as his brother mister Maclean of Torloisk in Mull a gentleman of Sir Allan s family and two of the clan Grant so that the Highland and Hebridean genius reigned We had a great deal of conversation about you and drank your health in a bumper The toast was not proposed by me which is a circumstance to be remarked for I am now so connected with you that any thing that I can say or do to your honour has not the value of an additional compliment It is only giving you a guinea out of that treasure of admiration which already belongs to you and which is no hidden treasure for I suppose my admiration of you is company existent with the knowledge of my character I find that the Highlanders and Hebrideans in general are much fonder of your Journey than the low country or hither Scots One of the Grants said to day that he was sure you were a man of a good heart and a candid man and seemed to hope he should be able to convince you of the antiquity of a good proportion of the poems of Ossian After all that has passed I think the matter is capable of being proved to a certain degree I am told that Macpherson got one old Erse MS from Clanranald for the restitution of which he executed a formal obligation and it is affirmed that the Gaelick call it Erse or call it Irish has been written in the Highlands and Hebrides for many centuries It is reasonable to suppose that such of the inhabitants as acquired any learning possessed the art of writing as well as their Irish neighbours and Celtick cousins and the question is can sufficient evidence be shewn of this Those who are skilled in ancient writings can determine the age of MSS or at least can ascertain the century in which they were written and if men of veracity who are so skilled shall tell us that MSS in the possession of families in the Highlands and isles are the works of a remote age I think we should be convinced by their testimony There is now come to this city Ranald Macdonald from the Isle of Egg who has several MSS of Erse poetry which he wishes to publish by subscription I have engaged to take three copies of the book the price of which is to be six shillings as I would subscribe for all the Erse that can be printed be it old or new that the language may be preserved This man says that some of his manuscripts are ancient and to be sure one of them which was shewn to me does appear to have the duskyness of antiquity The enquiry is not yet quite hopeless and I should think that the exact truth may be discovered if proper means be used I am c JAMES BOSWELL To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR I am sorry that I could get no books for my friends in Scotland mister Strahan has at last promised to send two dozen to you If they come put the names of my friends into them you may cut them out nine hundred five and paste them with a little starch in the book You then are going wild about Ossian Why do you think any part can be proved The dusky manuscript of Egg is probably not fifty years old if it be an hundred it proves nothing The tale of Clanranald is no proof Has Clanranald told it Can he prove it There are I believe no Erse manuscripts None of the old families had a single letter in Erse that we heard of You say it is likely that they could write The learned if any learned there were could but knowing by that learning some written language in that language they wrote as letters had never been applied to their own If there are manuscripts let them be shewn with some proof that they are not forged for the occasion You say many can remember parts of Ossian I believe all those parts are versions of the English at least there is no proof of their antiquity Macpherson is said to have made some translations himself and having taught a boy to write it ordered him to say that he had learnt it of his grandmother The boy when he grew up told the story This missus Williams heard at mister Strahan s table Don t be credulous you know how little a Highlander can be trusted nine hundred six Macpherson is so far as I know very quiet Is not that proof enough Every thing is against him No visible manuscript no inscription in the language no correspondence among friends no transaction of business of which a single scrap remains in the ancient families Macpherson s pretence is that the character was Saxon If he had not talked unskilfully of manuscripts he might have fought with oral tradition much longer As to mister Grant s information I suppose he knows much less of the matter than ourselves In the mean time the bookseller says that the sale nine hundred seven is sufficiently quick They printed four thousand Correct your copy wherever it is wrong and bring it up Your friends will all be glad to see you I think of going myself into the country about May I am sorry that I have not managed to send the book sooner I have left four for you and do not restrict you absolutely to follow my directions in the distribution You must use your own discretion Make my compliments to missus Boswell I suppose she is now just beginning to forgive me I am dear Sir your humble servant SAM JOHNSON Feb twenty five seventeen seventy five On Tuesday March twenty one I arrived in London nine hundred eight and on repairing to doctor Johnson s before dinner found him in his study sitting with mister Peter Garrick the elder brother of David strongly resembling him in countenance and voice but of more sedate and placid manners nine hundred nine Johnson informed me that though mister Beauclerk was in great pain it was hoped he was not in danger nine hundred ten and that he now wished to consult doctor Heberden to try the effect of a new understanding Both at this interview and in the evening at mister Thrale s where he and mister Peter Garrick and I met again he was vehement on the subject of the Ossian controversy observing We do not know that there are any ancient Erse manuscripts and we have no other reason to disbelieve that there are men with three heads but that we do not know that there are any such men He also was outrageous upon his supposition that my countrymen loved Scotland better than truth nine hundred eleven saying All of them nay not all but droves of them would come up and attest any thing for the honour of Scotland He also persevered in his wild allegation that he questioned if there was a tree between Edinburgh and the English border older than himself nine hundred twelve I assured him he was mistaken and suggested that the proper punishment would be that he should receive a stripe at every tree above a hundred years old that was found within that space He laughed and said I believe I might submit to it for a banbee The doubts which in my correspondence with him I had ventured to state as to the justice and wisdom of the conduct of Great Britain towards the American colonies while I at the same time requested that he would enable me to inform myself upon that momentous subject he had altogether disregarded and had recently published a pamphlet entitled Taxation no Tyranny an answer to the Resolutions and Address of the American Congress nine hundred thirteen He had long before indulged most unfavourable sentiments of our fellow subjects in America nine hundred fourteen For as early as seventeen sixty nine I was told by doctor John Campbell that he had said of them Sir they are a race of convicts nine hundred fifteen and ought to be thankful for any thing we allow them short of hanging Of this performance I avoided to talk with him for I had now formed a clear and settled opinion nine hundred sixteen that the people of America were well warranted to resist a claim that their fellow subjects in the mother country should have the entire command of their fortunes by taxing them without their own consent and the extreme violence which it breathed appeared to me so unsuitable to the mildness of a Christian philosopher and so directly opposite to the principles of peace which he had so beautifully recommended in his pamphlet respecting Falkland s Islands nine hundred seventeen that I was sorry to see him appear in so unfavourable a light Besides I could not perceive in it that ability of argument or that felicity of expression for which he was upon other occasions so eminent Positive assertion sarcastical severity and extravagant ridicule which he himself reprobated as a test of truth were united in this rhapsody That this pamphlet was written at the desire of those who were then in power I have no doubt and indeed he owned to me that it had been revised and curtailed by some of them He told me that they had struck out one passage which was to this effect That the Colonists could with no solidity argue from their not having been taxed while in their infancy that they should not now he taxed We do not put a calf into the plow we wait till he is an ox He said They struck it out either critically as too ludicrous or politically as too exasperating I care not which It was their business If an architect says I will build five stories and the man who employs him says I will have only three the employer is to decide Yes Sir said I in ordinary cases But should it be so when the architect gives his skill and labour gratis Unfavourable as I am constrained to say my opinion of this pamphlet was yet since it was congenial with the sentiments of numbers at that time and as everything relating to the writings of doctor Johnson is of importance in literary history I shall therefore insert some passages which were struck out it does not appear why either by himself or those who revised it They appear printed in a few proof leaves of it in my possession marked with corrections in his own hand writing I shall distinguish them by Italicks In the paragraph where he says the Americans were incited to resistance by European intelligence from Men whom they thought their friends but who were friends only to themselves nine hundred eighteen there followed and made by their selfishness the enemies of their country And the next paragraph ran thus On the original contrivers of mischief rather than on those whom they have deluded let an insulted nation pour out its vengeance The paragraph which came next was in these words Unhappy is that country in which men can hope for advancement by favouring its enemies The tranquillity of stable government is not always easily preserved against the machinations of single innovators but what can be the hope of quiet when factions hostile to the legislature can be openly formed and openly avowed After the paragraph which now concludes the pamphlet there followed this in which he certainly means the great Earl of Chatham nine hundred nineteen and glances at a certain popular Lord Chancellor nine hundred twenty If by the fortune of war they drive us utterly away what they will do next can only be conjectured If a new monarchy is erected they will want a KING He who first takes into his hand the sceptre of America should have a name of good omen WILLIAM has been known both as conqueror and deliverer and perhaps England however contemned might yet supply them with ANOTHER WILLIAM Whigs indeed are not willing to be governed and it is possible that KING WILLIAM may be strongly inclined to guide their measures but Whigs have been cheated like other mortals and suffered their leader to become their tyrant under the name of their PROTECTOR What more they will receive from England no man can tell In their rudiments of empire they may want a CHANCELLOR Then came this paragraph Their numbers are at present not quite sufficient for the greatness which in some form of government or other is to rival the ancient monarchies but by doctor Franklin s rule of progression nine hundred twenty one they will in a century and a quarter be more than equal to the inhabitants of Europe When the Whigs of America are thus multiplied let the Princes of the earth tremble in their palaces If they should continue to double and to double their own hemisphere would not contain them But let not our boldest oppugners of authority look forward with delight to this futurity of Whiggism How it ended I know not as it is cut off abruptly at the foot of the last of these proof pages nine hundred twenty two His pamphlets in support of the measures of administration were published on his own account and he afterwards collected them into a volume with the title of Political Tracts by the Authour of the Rambler with this motto Fallitur egregio quisquis sub Principe credit Servitium nunquam libertas gratior extat Quam sub Rege pio CLAUDIANUS nine hundred twenty three These pamphlets drew upon him numerous attacks nine hundred twenty four Against the common weapons of literary warfare he was hardened but there were two instances of animadversion which I communicated to him and from what I could judge both from his silence and his looks appeared to me to impress him much One was A Letter to doctor Samuel Johnson occasioned by his late political Publications It appeared previous to his Taxation no Tyranny and was written by doctor Joseph Towers nine hundred twenty five In that performance doctor Johnson was treated with the respect due to so eminent a man while his conduct as a political writer was boldly and pointedly arraigned as inconsistent with the character of one who if he did employ his pen upon politics It might reasonably be expected should distinguish himself not by party violence and rancour but by moderation and by wisdom It concluded thus I would however wish you to remember should you again address the publick under the character of a political writer that luxuriance of imagination or energy of language will ill compensate for the want of candour of justice and of truth And I shall only add that should I hereafter be disposed to read as I heretofore have done the most excellent of all your performances The Rambler the pleasure which I have been accustomed to find in it will be much diminished by the reflection that the writer of so moral so elegant and so valuable a work was capable of prostituting his talents in such productions as The False Alarm the Thoughts on the Transactions respecting Falkland s Islands and The Patriot I am willing to do justice to the merit of doctor Towers of whom I will say that although I abhor his Whiggish democratical notions and propensities for I will not call them principles I esteem him as an ingenious knowing and very convivial man The other instance was a paragraph of a letter to me from my old and most intimate friend the Reverend mister Temple who wrote the character of Gray which has had the honour to be adopted both by mister Mason and doctor Johnson in their accounts of that poet nine hundred twenty seven The words were How can your great I will not say your pious but your moral friend support the barbarous measures of administration which they have not the face to ask even their infidel pensioner Hume to defend nine hundred twenty six However confident of the rectitude of his own mind Johnson may have felt sincere uneasiness that his conduct should be erroneously imputed to unworthy motives by good men and that the influence of his valuable writings should on that account be in any degree obstructed or lessened nine hundred twenty eight He complained to a Right Honourable friend nine hundred twenty nine of distinguished talents and very elegant manners with whom he maintained a long intimacy and whose generosity towards him will afterwards appear nine hundred thirty that his pension having been given to him as a literary character he had been applied to by administration to write political pamphlets and he was even so much irritated that he declared his resolution to resign his pension His friend shewed him the impropriety of such a measure and he afterwards expressed his gratitude and said he had received good advice To that friend he once signified a wish to have his pension secured to him for his life but he neither asked nor received from government any reward whatsoever for his political labours nine hundred thirty one On Friday March twenty four I met him at the LITERARY CLUB where were mister Beauclerk mister Langton mister Colman doctor Percy mister Vesey Sir Charles Bunbury doctor George Fordyce mister Steevens and mister Charles Fox Before he came in we talked of his Journey to the Western Islands and of his coming away willing to believe the second sight nine hundred thirty two which seemed to excite some ridicule I was then so impressed with the truth of many of the stories of it which I had been told that I avowed my conviction saying He is only willing to believe I do believe The evidence is enough for me though not for his great mind What will not fill a quart bottle will fill a pint bottle I am filled with belief nine hundred thirty three Are you said Colman then cork it up I found his Journey the common topick of conversation in London at this time wherever I happened to be At one of Lord Mansfield s formal Sunday evening conversations strangely called Levees his Lordship addressed me We have all been reading your travels mister Boswell I answered I was but the humble attendant of doctor Johnson The Chief Justice replied with that air and manner which none who ever saw and heard him can forget He speaks ill of nobody but Ossian Johnson was in high spirits this evening at the club and talked with great animation and success He attacked Swift as he used to do upon all occasions The Tale of a Tub is so much superiour to his other writings that one can hardly believe he was the authour of it nine hundred thirty four there is in it such a vigour of mind such a swarm of thoughts so much of nature and art and life nine hundred thirty five I wondered to hear him say of Gulliver s Travels When once you have thought of big men and little men it is very easy to do all the rest I endeavoured to make a stand for Swift and tried to rouse those who were much more able to defend him but in vain Johnson at last of his own accord allowed very great merit to the inventory of articles found in the pocket of the Man Mountain particularly the description of his watch which it was conjectured was his GOD as he consulted it upon all occasions He observed that Swift put his name to but two things after he had a name to put The Plan for the Improvement of the English Language and the last Drapier s Letter nine hundred thirty six From Swift there was an easy transition to mister Thomas Sheridan JOHNSON Sheridan is a wonderful admirer of the tragedy of Douglas and presented its authour with a gold medal Some years ago at a coffee house in Oxford I called to him mister Sheridan mister Sheridan how came you to give a gold medal to Home for writing that foolish play nine hundred thirty seven This you see was wanton and insolent but I meant to be wanton and insolent A medal has no value but as a stamp of merit And was Sheridan to assume to himself the right of giving that stamp If Sheridan was magnificent enough to bestow a gold medal as an honorary reward of dramatick excellence he should have requested one of the Universities to choose the person on whom it should be conferred Sheridan had no right to give a stamp of merit it was counterfeiting Apollo s coin nine hundred thirty eight On Monday March twenty seven I breakfasted with him at mister Strahan s He told us that he was engaged to go that evening to missus Abington s benefit She was visiting some ladies whom I was visiting and begged that I would come to her benefit I told her I could not hear but she insisted so much on my coming that it would have been brutal to have refused her This was a speech quite characteristical He loved to bring forward his having been in the gay circles of life and he was perhaps a little vain of the solicitations of this elegant and fashionable actress He told us the play was to be The Hypocrite altered from Cibber s Nonjuror nine hundred thirty nine so as to satirize the Methodists I do not think said he the character of The Hypocrite justly applicable to the Methodists but it was very applicable to the Nonjurors nine hundred forty I once said to doctor Madan nine hundred forty one a clergyman of Ireland who was a great Whig that perhaps a Nonjuror would have been less criminal in taking the oaths imposed by the ruling power than refusing them because refusing them necessarily laid him under almost an irresistible temptation to be more criminal for a man must live and if he precludes himself from the support furnished by the establishment will probably be reduced to very wicked shifts to maintain himself nine hundred forty two BOSWELL I should think Sir that a man who took the oaths contrary to his principles was a determined wicked man because he was sure he was committing perjury whereas a Nonjuror might be insensibly led to do what was wrong without being so directly conscious of it JOHNSON Why Sir a man who goes to bed to his patron s wife is pretty sure that he is committing wickedness BOSWELL Did the nonjuring clergymen do so Sir JOHNSON I am afraid many of them did I was startled at his argument and could by no means think it convincing Had not his own father complied with the requisition of government nine hundred forty three as to which he once observed to me when I pressed him upon it That Sir he was to settle with himself he would probably have thought more unfavourably of a Jacobite who took the oaths had he not resembled My father as he swore nine hundred forty four mister Strahan talked of launching into the great ocean of London in order to have a chance for rising into eminence and observing that many men were kept back from trying their fortunes there because they were born to a competency said Small certainties are the bane of men of talents nine hundred forty five which Johnson confirmed mister Strahan put Johnson in mind of a remark which he had made to him There are few ways in which a man can be more innocently employed than in getting money The more one thinks of this said Strahan the juster it will appear mister Strahan had taken a poor boy from the country as an apprentice upon Johnson s recommendation Johnson having enquired after him said mister Strahan let me have five guineas on account and I ll give this boy one Nay if a man recommends a boy and does nothing for him it is sad work Call him down I followed him into the court yard nine hundred forty six behind mister Strahan s house and there I had a proof of what I had heard him profess that he talked alike to all Some people tell you that they let themselves down to the capacity of their hearers I never do that I speak uniformly in as intelligible a manner as I can nine hundred forty seven Well my boy how do you go on Pretty well Sir but they are afraid I an t strong enough for some parts of the business JOHNSON Why I shall be sorry for it for when you consider with how little mental power and corporeal labour a printer can get a guinea a week it is a very desirable occupation for you Do you hear take all the pains you can and if this does not do we must think of some other way of life for you There s a guinea Here was one of the many many instances of his active benevolence At the same time the slow and sonorous solemnity with which while he bent himself down he addressed a little thick short legged boy contrasted with the boy s aukwardness and awe could not but excite some ludicrous emotions nine hundred forty eight I met him at Drury lane play house in the evening Sir Joshua Reynolds at missus Abington s request had promised to bring a body of wits to her benefit and having secured forty places in the front boxes had done me the honour to put me in the group Johnson sat on the seat directly behind me nine hundred forty nine and as he could neither see nor hear at such a distance from the stage he was wrapped up in grave abstraction and seemed quite a cloud amidst all the sunshine of glitter and gaiety nine hundred fifty I wondered at his patience in sitting out a play of five acts and a farce of two He said very little but after the prologue to Bon Ton nine hundred fifty one had been spoken which he could hear pretty well from the more slow and distinct utterance he talked of prologue writing and observed Dryden has written prologues superiour to any that David Garrick has written but David Garrick has written more good prologues than Dryden has done It is wonderful that he has been able to write such variety of them nine hundred fifty two At mister Beauclerk s where I supped was mister Garrick whom I made happy with Johnson s praise of his prologues and I suppose in gratitude to him he took up one of his favourite topicks the nationality of the Scotch which he maintained in a pleasant manner with the aid of a little poetical fiction Come come don t deny it they are really national Why now the Adams nine hundred fifty three are as liberal minded men as any in the world but I don t know how it is all their workmen are Scotch You are to be sure wonderfully free from that nationality but so it happens that you employ the only Scotch shoe black in London He imitated the manner of his old master with ludicrous exaggeration repeating with pauses and half whistlings interjected Os homini sublime dedit calumque tueri Jussit et erectos ad sidera tollere vultus nine hundred fifty four looking downwards all the time and while pronouncing the four last words absolutely touching the ground with a kind of contorted gesticulation Garrick however when he pleased could imitate Johnson very exactly nine hundred fifty five for that great actor with his distinguished powers of expression which were so universally admired possessed also an admirable talent of mimickry He was always jealous that Johnson spoke lightly of him nine hundred fifty six I recollect his exhibiting him to me one day as if saying Davy has some convivial pleasantry about him but tis a futile fellow nine hundred fifty seven which he uttered perfectly with the tone and air of Johnson I cannot too frequently request of my readers while they peruse my account of Johnson s conversation to endeavour to keep in mind his deliberate and strong utterance His mode of speaking was indeed very impressive nine hundred fifty eight and I wish it could be preserved as musick is written according to the very ingenious method of mister Steele nine hundred fifty nine who has shown how the recitation of mister Garrick and other eminent speakers might be transmitted to posterity in score nine hundred sixty Next day I dined with Johnson at mister Thrale s He attacked Gray calling him a dull fellow BOSWELL I understand he was reserved and might appear dull in company but surely he was not dull in poetry JOHNSON Sir he was dull in company dull in his closet dull every where nine hundred sixty one He was dull in a new way and that made many people think him GREAT He was a mechanical poet He then repeated some ludicrous lines which have escaped my memory and said Is not that GREAT like his Odes missus Thrale maintained that his Odes were melodious upon which he exclaimed Weave the warp and weave the woof I added in a solemn tone The winding sheet of Edward s race There is a good line Ay said he and the next line is a good one pronouncing it contemptuously Give ample verge and room enough nine hundred sixty two No Sir there are but two good nine hundred sixty three stanzas in Gray s poetry which are in his Elegy in a Country Church yard He then repeated the stanza For who to dumb forgetfulness a prey c mistaking one word for instead of precincts he said confines He added The other stanza I forget nine hundred sixty four A young lady nine hundred sixty five who had married a man much her inferiour in rank being mentioned a question arose how a woman s relations should behave to her in such a situation and while I recapitulate the debate and recollect what has since happened nine hundred sixty six I cannot but be struck in a manner that delicacy forbids me to express While I contended that she ought to be treated with an inflexible steadiness of displeasure missus Thrale was all for mildness and forgiveness and according to the vulgar phrase making the best of a bad bargain JOHNSON Madam we must distinguish Were I a man of rank I would not let a daughter starve who had made a mean marriage but having voluntarily degraded herself from the station which she was originally entitled to hold I would support her only in that which she herself had chosen and would not put her on a level with my other daughters You are to consider Madam that it is our duty to maintain the subordination of civilized society and when there is a gross and shameful deviation from rank it should be punished so as to deter others from the same perversion After frequently considering this subject I am more and more confirmed in what I then meant to express and which was sanctioned by the authority and illustrated by the wisdom of Johnson and I think it of the utmost consequence to the happiness of Society to which subordination is absolutely necessary nine hundred sixty seven It is weak and contemptible and unworthy in a parent to relax in such a case It is sacrificing general advantage to private feelings And let it be considered that the claim of a daughter who has acted thus to be restored to her former situation is either fantastical or unjust If there be no value in the distinction of rank what does she suffer by being kept in the situation to which she has descended If there be a value in that distinction it ought to be steadily maintained If indulgence be shewn to such conduct and the offenders know that in a longer or shorter time they shall be received as well as if they had not contaminated their blood by a base alliance the great check upon that inordinate caprice which generally occasions low marriages will be removed and the fair and comfortable order of improved life will be miserably disturbed nine hundred sixty eight Lord Chesterfield s Letters being mentioned Johnson said It was not to be wondered at that they had so great a sale considering that they were the letters of a statesman a wit one who had been so much in the mouths of mankind one long accustomed virum volitare per ora nine hundred sixty nine On Friday March thirty one I supped with him and some friends at a tavern nine hundred seventy One of the company nine hundred seventy one attempted with too much forwardness to rally him on his late appearance at the theatre but had reason to repent of his temerity Why Sir did you go to missus Abington s benefit Did you see JOHNSON No Sir Did you hear JOHNSON No Sir Why then Sir did you go JOHNSON Because Sir she is a favourite of the publick and when the publick cares the thousandth part for you that it does for her I will go to your benefit too nine hundred seventy two Next morning I won a small bet from lady Diana Beauclerk by asking him as to one of his particularities which her Ladyship laid I durst not do It seems he had been frequently observed at the Club to put into his pocket the Seville oranges after he had squeezed the juice of them into the drink which he made for himself Beauclerk and Garrick talked of it to me and seemed to think that he had a strange unwillingness to be discovered We could not divine what he did with them and this was the bold question to be put I saw on his table the spoils of the preceding night some fresh peels nicely scraped and cut into pieces O Sir said I I now partly see what you do with the squeezed oranges which you put into your pocket at the Club JOHNSON I have a great love for them BOSWELL And pray Sir what do you do with them You scrape them it seems very neatly and what next JOHNSON Let them dry Sir BOSWELL And what next JOHNSON Nay Sir you shall know their fate no further BOSWELL Then the world must be left in the dark It must be said assuming a mock solemnity he scraped them and let them dry but what he did with them next he never could be prevailed upon to tell JOHNSON Nay Sir you should say it more emphatically he could not be prevailed upon even by his dearest friends to tell nine hundred seventy three He had this morning received his Diploma as Doctor of Laws from the University of Oxford He did not vaunt of his new dignity but I understood he was highly pleased with it I shall here insert the progress and completion of that high academical honour in the same manner as I have traced his obtaining that of Master of Arts To the Reverend doctor FOTHERGILL Vice Chancellor of the University of Oxford to be communicated to the Heads of Houses and proposed in Convocation mister VICE CHANCELLOR AND GENTLEMEN nine hundred seventy four The honour of the degree of M A by diploma formerly conferred upon mister SAMUEL JOHNSON in consequence of his having eminently distinguished himself by the publication of a series of Essays excellently calculated to form the manners of the people and in which the cause of religion and morality has been maintained and recommended by the strongest powers of argument and elegance of language reflected an equal degree of lustre upon the University itself The many learned labours which have since that time employed the attention and displayed the abilities of that great man so much to the advancement of literature and the benefit of the community render him worthy of more distinguished honours in the Republick of letters and I persuade myself that I shall act agreeably to the sentiments of the whole University in desiring that it may be proposed in Convocation to confer on him the degree of Doctor in Civil Law by diploma to which I readily give my consent and am mister Vice Chancellor and Gentlemen Your affectionate friend and servant NORTH nine hundred seventy five Downing street March twenty three seventeen seventy five DIPLOMA

Id Apr seventeen seventy five He revised some sheets of Lord Hailes s Annals of Scotland and wrote a few notes on the margin with red ink which he bade me tell his Lordship did not sink into the paper and might be wiped off with a wet sponge so that he did not spoil his manuscript I observed to him that there were very few of his friends so accurate as that I could venture to put down in writing what they told me as his sayings Johnson Why should you write down my sayings Boswell I write them when they are good Johnson Nay you may as well write down the sayings of any one else that are good But where I might with great propriety have added can I find such I visited him by appointment in the evening and we drank tea with missus Williams He told me that he had been in the company of a gentleman nine hundred seventy nine whose extraordinary travels had been much the subject of conversation But I found that he had not listened to him with that full confidence without which there is little satisfaction in the society of travellers I was curious to hear what opinion so able a judge as Johnson had formed of his abilities and I asked if he was not a man of sense Johnson Why Sir he is not a distinct relater and I should say he is neither abounding nor deficient in sense I did not perceive any superiority of understanding BOSWELL But will you not allow him a nobleness of resolution in penetrating into distant regions JOHNSON That Sir is not to the present purpose We are talking of his sense A fighting cock has a nobleness of resolution Next day Sunday April two I dined with him at mister Hoole s We talked of Pope JOHNSON He wrote his Dunciad for fame That was his primary motive Had it not been for that the dunces might have railed against him till they were weary without his troubling himself about them He delighted to vex them no doubt but he had more delight in seeing how well he could vex them nine hundred eighty The Odes to Obscurity and Oblivion in ridicule of cool Mason and warm Gray nine hundred eighty one being mentioned Johnson said They are Colman s best things Upon its being observed that it was believed these Odes were made by Colman and Lloyd jointly JOHNSON Nay Sir how can two people make an Ode Perhaps one made one of them and one the other nine hundred eighty two I observed that two people had made a play and quoted the anecdote of Beaumont and Fletcher who were brought under suspicion of treason because while concerting the plan of a tragedy when sitting together at a tavern one of them was overheard saying to the other I ll kill the King JOHNSON The first of these Odes is the best but they are both good They exposed a very bad kind of writing BOSWELL Surely Sir mister Mason s Elfrida is a fine Poem at least you will allow there are some good passages in it JOHNSON There are now and then some good imitations of Milton s bad manner I often wondered at his low estimation of the writings of Gray and Mason Of Gray s poetry I have in a former part of this work nine hundred eighty three expressed my high opinion and for that of mister Mason I have ever entertained a warm admiration nine hundred eighty four His Elfrida is exquisite both in poetical description and moral sentiment and his Caractacus is a noble drama nine hundred eighty five Nor can I omit paying my tribute of praise to some of his smaller poems which I have read with pleasure and which no criticism shall persuade me not to like If I wondered at Johnson s not tasting the works of Mason and Gray still more have I wondered at their not tasting his works that they should be insensible to his energy of diction to his splendour of images and comprehension of thought Tastes may differ as to the violin the flute the hautboy in short all the lesser instruments but who can be insensible to the powerful impressions of the majestick organ His Taxation no Tyranny being mentioned he said I think I have not been attacked enough for it Attack is the re action I never think I have hit hard unless it rebounds nine hundred eighty six BOSWELL I don t know Sir what you would be at Five or six shots of small arms in every newspaper and repeated cannonading in pamphlets might I think satisfy you nine hundred eighty seven But Sir you ll never make out this match of which we have talked with a certain political lady since you are so severe against her principles nine hundred eighty eight JOHNSON Nay Sir I have the better chance for that She is like the Amazons of old she must be courted by the sword But I have not been severe upon her BOSWELL Yes Sir you have made her ridiculous JOHNSON That was already done Sir To endeavour to make her ridiculous is like blacking the chimney I put him in mind that the landlord at Ellon nine hundred eighty nine in Scotland said that he heard he was the greatest man in England next to Lord Mansfield Ay Sir said he the exception defined the idea A Scotchman could go no farther The force of Nature could no farther go nine hundred ninety Lady Miller s collection of verses by fashionable people which were put into her Vase at Batheaston villa nine hundred ninety one near Bath in competition for honorary prizes being mentioned he held them very cheap Bouts rimes said he is a mere conceit and an old conceit now I wonder how people were persuaded to write in that manner for this lady nine hundred ninety two I named a gentleman of his acquaintance who wrote for the Vase JOHNSON He was a blockhead for his pains BOSWELL The Duchess of Northumberland wrote nine hundred ninety three JOHNSON Sir the Duchess of Northumberland may do what she pleases nobody will say anything to a lady of her high rank But I should be apt to throw s nine hundred ninety four verses in his face I talked of the chearfulness of Fleet street owing to the constant quick succession of people which we perceive passing through it JOHNSON Why Sir Fleet street has a very animated appearance but I think the full tide of human existence is at Charing cross nine hundred ninety five He made the common remark on the unhappiness which men who have led a busy life experience when they retire in expectation of enjoying themselves at ease and that they generally languish for want of their habitual occupation and wish to return to it He mentioned as strong an instance of this as can well be imagined An eminent tallow chandler in London who had acquired a considerable fortune gave up the trade in favour of his foreman and went to live at a country house near town He soon grew weary and paid frequent visits to his old shop where he desired they might let him know their melting days and he would come and assist them which he accordingly did Here Sir was a man to whom the most disgusting circumstance in the business to which he had been used was a relief from idleness nine hundred ninety six On Wednesday April five I dined with him at Messieurs Dilly s with mister John Scott of Amwell nine hundred ninety seven the Quaker mister Langton mister Miller now Sir John and doctor Thomas Campbell nine hundred ninety eight an Irish Clergyman whom I took the liberty of inviting to mister Billy s table having seen him at mister Thrale s and been told that he had come to England chiefly with a view to see doctor Johnson for whom he entertained the highest veneration He has since published A Philosophical Survey of the South of Ireland a very entertaining book which has however one fault that it assumes the fictitious character of an Englishman We talked of publick speaking JOHNSON We must not estimate a man s powers by his being able or not able to deliver his sentiments in publick Isaac Hawkins Browne nine hundred ninety nine one of the first wits of this country got into Parliament and never opened his mouth For my own part I think it is more disgraceful never to try to speak than to try it and fail as it is more disgraceful not to fight than to fight and be beaten This argument appeared to me fallacious for if a man has not spoken it may be said that he would have done very well if he had tried whereas if he has tried and failed there is nothing to be said for him Why then I asked is it thought disgraceful for a man not to fight and not disgraceful not to speak in publick JOHNSON Because there may be other reasons for a man s not speaking in publick than want of resolution he may have nothing to say laughing Whereas Sir you know courage is reckoned the greatest of all virtues because unless a man has that virtue he has no security for preserving any other He observed that the statutes against bribery were intended to prevent upstarts with money from getting into Parliament one thousand adding that if he were a gentleman of landed property he would turn out all his tenants who did not vote for the candidate whom he supported ten oh one LANGTON Would not that Sir be checking the freedom of election JOHNSON Sir the law does not mean that the privilege of voting should be independent of old family interest of the permanent property of the country On Thursday April six I dined with him at mister Thomas Davies s with mister Hicky ten oh two the painter and my old acquaintance mister Moody the player doctor Johnson as usual spoke contemptuously of Colley Cibber It is wonderful that a man who for forty years had lived with the great and the witty should have acquired so ill the talents of conversation and he had but half to furnish for one half of what he said was oaths ten oh three He however allowed considerable merit to some of his comedies and said there was no reason to believe that the Careless Husband was not written by himself ten oh four Davies said he was the first dramatick writer who introduced genteel ladies upon the stage Johnson refuted this observation by instancing several such characters in comedies before his time DAVIES trying to defend himself from a charge of ignorance I mean genteel moral characters I think said Hicky gentility and morality are inseparable BOSWELL By no means Sir The genteelest characters are often the most immoral Does not Lord Chesterfield give precepts for uniting wickedness and the graces A man indeed is not genteel when he gets drunk but most vices may be committed very genteelly a man may debauch his friend s wife genteely he may cheat at cards genteelly HICKY I do not think that is genteel BOSWELL Sir it may not be like a gentleman but it may be genteel JOHNSON You are meaning two different things One means exteriour grace the other honour It is certain that a man may be very immoral with exteriour grace Lovelace in Clarissa is a very genteel and a very wicked character Tom Hervey ten oh five who died t other day though a vicious man was one of the genteelest men that ever lived Tom Davies instanced Charles the Second JOHNSON taking fire at any attack upon that Prince for whom he had an extraordinary partiality ten oh six Charles the Second was licentious in his practice but he always had a reverence for what was good Charles the Second knew his people and rewarded merit ten oh seven The Church was at no time better filled than in his reign He was the best King we have had from his time till the reign of his present Majesty except James the Second who was a very good King but unhappily believed that it was necessary for the salvation of his subjects that they should be Roman Catholicks He had the merit of endeavouring to do what he thought was for the salvation of the souls of his subjects till he lost a great Empire We who thought that we should not be saved if we were Roman Catholicks had the merit of maintaining our religion at the experience of submitting ourselves to the government of King William ten oh eight for it could not be done otherwise to the government of one of the most worthless scoundrels that ever existed No Charles the Second was not such a man as naming another King He did not destroy his father s will ten oh nine He took money indeed from France but he did not betray those over whom he ruled ten ten He did not let the French fleet pass ours George the First knew nothing and desired to know nothing did nothing and desired to do nothing and the only good thing that is told of him is that he wished to restore the crown to its hereditary successor ten eleven He roared with prodigious violence against George the Second When he ceased Moody interjected in an Irish tone and with a comick look Ah poor George the Second I mentioned that doctor Thomas Campbell had come from Ireland to London principally to see doctor Johnson He seemed angry at this observation DAVIES Why you know Sir there came a man from Spain to see Livy ten twelve and Corelli came to England to see Purcell ten thirteen and when he heard he was dead went directly back again to Italy JOHNSON I should not have wished to be dead to disappoint Campbell had he been so foolish as you represent him but I should have wished to have been a hundred miles off This was apparently perverse and I do believe it was not his real way of thinking he could not but like a man who came so far to see him He laughed with some complacency when I told him Campbell s odd expression to me concerning him That having seen such a man was a thing to talk of a century hence as if he could live so long ten fourteen We got into an argument whether the Judges who went to India might with propriety engage in trade Johnson warmly maintained that they might For why he urged should not Judges get riches as well as those who deserve them less I said they should have sufficient salaries and have nothing to take off their attention from the affairs of the publick JOHNSON No Judge Sir can give his whole attention to his office and it is very proper that he should employ what time he has to himself to his own advantage in the most profitable manner Then Sir said Davies who enlivened the dispute by making it somewhat dramatick he may become an insurer and when he is going to the bench he may be stopped Your Lordship cannot go yet here is a bunch of invoices several ships are about to sail JOHNSON Sir you may as well say a Judge should not have a house for they may come and tell him Your Lordship s house is on fire and so instead of minding the business of his Court he is to be occupied in getting the engine with the greatest speed There is no end of this Every Judge who has land trades to a certain extent in corn or in cattle and in the land itself undoubtedly His steward acts for him and so do clerks for a great merchant A Judge may be a farmer but he is not to geld his own pigs ten fifteen A Judge may play a little at cards for his amusement but he is not to play at marbles or at chuck farthing in the Piazza No Sir there is no profession to which a man gives a very great proportion of his time It is wonderful when a calculation is made how little the mind is actually employed in the discharge of any profession No man would be a Judge upon the condition of being totally a Judge The best employed lawyer has his mind at work but for a small proportion of his time a great deal of his occupation is merely mechanical ten sixteen I once wrote for a magazine I made a calculation that if I should write but a page a day at the same rate I should in ten years write nine volumes in folio of an ordinary size and print BOSWELL Such as Carte s History JOHNSON Yes Sir When a man writes from his own mind he writes very rapidly ten seventeen The greatest part of a writer s time is spent in reading in order to write a man will turn over half a library to make one book I argued warmly against the Judges trading and mentioned Hale as an instance of a perfect Judge who devoted himself entirely to his office JOHNSON Hale Sir attended to other things besides law he left a great estate BOSWELL That was because what he got accumulated without any exertion and anxiety on his part While the dispute went on Moody once tried to say something upon our side Tom Davies clapped him on the back to encourage him Beauclerk to whom I mentioned this circumstance said that he could not conceive a more humiliating situation than to be clapped on the back by Tom Davies We spoke of Rolt to whose Dictionary of Commerce doctor Johnson wrote the Preface ten eighteen JOHNSON Old Gardner the bookseller employed Rolt and Smart to write a monthly miscellany called The Universal Visitor ten nineteen There was a formal written contract which Allen the printer saw Gardner thought as you do of the Judge They were bound to write nothing else they were to have I think a third of the profits of this sixpenny pamphlet and the contract was for ninety nine years I wish I had thought of giving this to Thurlow in the cause about Literary Property What an excellent instance would it have been of the oppression of booksellers towards poor authours ten twenty smiling Davies zealous for the honour of the Trade ten twenty one said Gardner was not properly a bookseller JOHNSON Nay Sir he certainly was a bookseller He had served his time regularly was a member of the Stationers company kept a shop in the face of mankind purchased copyright and was a bibliopole ten twenty two Sir in every sense I wrote for some months in The Universal Visitor for poor Smart while he was mad not then knowing the terms on which he was engaged to write and thinking I was doing him good I hoped his wits would soon return to him Mine returned to me and I wrote in The Universal Visitor no longer Friday April seven I dined with him at a Tavern with a numerous company ten twenty three JOHNSON I have been reading Twiss s Travels in Spain which are just come out They are as good as the first book of travels that you will take up They are as good as those of Keysler ten twenty four or Blainville ten twenty five nay as Addison s if you except the learning They are not so good as Brydone s ten twenty six but they are better than Pococke s ten twenty seven I have not indeed cut the leaves yet but I have read in them where the pages are open and I do not suppose that what is in the pages which are closed is worse than what is in the open pages It would seem he added that Addison had not acquired much Italian learning for we do not find it introduced into his writings ten twenty eight The only instance that I recollect is his quoting Stavo bene per star meglio sto qui ten twenty nine I mentioned Addison s having borrowed many of his classical remarks from Leandro Alberti ten thirty mister Beauclerk said It was alledged that he had borrowed also from another Italian authour JOHNSON Why Sir all who go to look for what the Classicks have said of Italy must find the same passages and I should think it would be one of the first things the Italians would do on the revival of learning to collect all that the Roman authors have said of their country Ossian being mentioned JOHNSON Supposing the Irish and Erse languages to be the same which I do not believe ten thirty one yet as there is no reason to suppose that the inhabitants of the Highlands and Hebrides ever wrote their native language it is not to be credited that a long poem was preserved among them If we had no evidence of the art of writing being practised in one of the counties of England we should not believe that a long poem was preserved there though in the neighbouring counties where the same language was spoken the inhabitants could write BEAUCLERK The ballad of Lilliburlero was once in the mouths of all the people of this country and is said to have had a great effect in bringing about the Revolution ten thirty two Yet I question whether any body can repeat it now which shews how improbable it is that much poetry should be preserved by tradition One of the company suggested an internal objection to the antiquity of the poetry said to be Ossian s that we do not find the wolf in it which must have been the case had it been of that age The mention of the wolf had led Johnson to think of other wild beasts and while Sir Joshua Reynolds and mister Langton were carrying on a dialogue about something which engaged them earnestly he in the midst of it broke out Pennant tells of Bears what he added I have forgotten They went on which he being dull of hearing did not perceive or if he did was not willing to break off his talk so he continued to vociferate his remarks and Bear like a word in a catch as Beauclerk said was repeatedly heard at intervals which coming from him who by those who did not know him had been so often assimilated to that ferocious animal ten thirty three while we who were sitting around could hardly stifle laughter produced a very ludicrous effect Silence having ensued he proceeded We are told that the black bear is innocent but I should not like to trust myself with him mister Gibbon muttered in a low tone of voice I should not like to trust myself with you This piece of sarcastick pleasantry was a prudent resolution if applied to a competition of abilities ten thirty four Patriotism having become one of our topicks Johnson suddenly uttered in a strong determined tone an apophthegm at which many will start Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel ten thirty five But let it be considered that he did not mean a real and generous love of our country but that pretended patriotism which so many in all ages and countries have made a cloak for self interest I maintain that certainly all patriots were not scoundrels Being urged not by Johnson to name one exception I mentioned an eminent person ten thirty six whom we all greatly admired JOHNSON Sir I do not say that he is not honest but we have no reason to conclude from his political conduct that he is honest Were he to accept of a place from this ministry he would lose that character of firmness which he has and might be turned out of his place in a year This ministry is neither stable ten thirty seven nor grateful to their friends as Sir Robert Walpole was so that he may think it more for his interest to take his chance of his party coming in missus Prichard being mentioned he said Her playing was quite mechanical It is wonderful how little mind she had Sir she had never read the tragedy of Macbeth all through She no more thought of the play out of which her part was taken than a shoemaker thinks of the skin out of which the piece of leather of which he is making a pair of shoes is cut ten thirty eight On Saturday May eight ten thirty nine I dined with him at mister Thrale s where we met the Irish doctor Campbell ten forty Johnson had supped the night before at missus Abington s with some fashionable people whom he named and he seemed much pleased with having made one in so elegant a circle Nor did he omit to pique his mistress ten forty one a little with jealousy of her housewifery for he said with a smile missus Abington s jelly my dear Lady was better than yours missus Thrale who frequently practised a coarse mode of flattery by repeating his bon mots in his hearing ten forty two told us that he had said a certain celebrated actor was just fit to stand at the door of an auction room with a long pole and cry Pray gentlemen walk in and that a certain authour upon hearing this had said that another still more celebrated actor was fit for nothing better than that and would pick your pocket after you came out ten forty three JOHNSON Nay my dear lady there is no wit in what our friend added there is only abuse You may as well say of any man that he will pick a pocket Besides the man who is stationed at the door does not pick people s pockets that is done within by the auctioneer missus Thrale told us that Tom Davies repeated in a very bald manner the story of doctor Johnson s first repartee to me which I have related exactly ten forty four He made me say I was born in Scotland instead of I come from Scotland so that Johnson saying That Sir is what a great many of your countrymen cannot help had no point or even meaning and that upon this being mentioned to mister Fitzherbert he observed It is not every man that can carry a bon mot On Monday April ten I dined with him at General Oglethorpe s with mister Langton and the Irish doctor Campbell whom the General had obligingly given me leave to bring with me This learned gentleman was thus gratified with a very high intellectual feast by not only being in company with doctor Johnson but with General Oglethorpe who had been so long a celebrated name both at home and abroad ten forty five I must again and again intreat of my readers not to suppose that my imperfect record of conversation contains the whole of what was said by Johnson or other eminent persons who lived with him What I have preserved however has the value of the most perfect authenticity He this day enlarged upon Pope s melancholy remark Man never is but always to be blest ten forty six He asserted that the present was never a happy state to any human being but that as every part of life of which we are conscious was at some point of time a period yet to come in which felicity was expected there was some happiness produced by hope ten forty seven Being pressed upon this subject and asked if he really was of opinion that though in general happiness was very rare in human life a man was not sometimes happy in the moment that was present he answered Never but when he is drunk ten forty eight He urged General Oglethorpe to give the world his Life He said I know no man whose Life would be more interesting If I were furnished with materials I should be very glad to write it ten forty nine mister Scott ten fifty of Amwell s Elegies were lying in the room doctor Johnson observed They are very well but such as twenty people might write Upon this I took occasion to controvert Horace s maxim mediocribus esse poetis Non Di non homines non concessere columnae ten fifty one For here I observed was a very middle rate poet who pleased many readers and therefore poetry of a middle sort was entitled to some esteem nor could I see why poetry should not like every thing else have different gradations of excellence and consequently of value Johnson repeated the common remark that as there is no necessity for our having poetry at all it being merely a luxury an instrument of pleasure it can have no value unless when exquisite in its kind I declared myself not satisfied Why then Sir said he Horace and you must settle it He was not much in the humour of talking No more of his conversation for some days appears in my journal ten fifty two except that when a gentleman told him he had bought a suit of lace for his lady he said Well Sir you have done a good thing and a wise thing I have done a good thing said the gentleman but I do not know that I have done a wise thing JOHNSON Yes Sir no money is better spent than what is laid out for domestick satisfaction A man is pleased that his wife is drest as well as other people and a wife is pleased that she is drest On Friday April fourteen being Good Friday I repaired to him in the morning according to my usual custom on that day and breakfasted with him I observed that he fasted so very strictly ten fifty three that he did not even taste bread and took no milk with his tea I suppose because it is a kind of animal food He entered upon the state of the nation and thus discoursed Sir the great misfortune now is that government has too little power All that it has to bestow must of necessity be given to support itself so that it cannot reward merit No man for instance can now be made a Bishop for his learning and piety ten fifty four his only chance for promotion is his being connected with somebody who has parliamentary interest Our several ministries in this reign have outbid each other in concessions to the people Lord Bute though a very honourable man a man who meant well a man who had his blood full of prerogative was a theoretical statesman a book minister ten fifty five and thought this country could be governed by the influence of the Crown alone Then Sir he gave up a great deal He advised the King to agree that the Judges should hold their places for life instead of losing them at the accession of a new King Lord Bute I suppose thought to make the King popular by this concession but the people never minded it and it was a most impolitick measure There is no reason why a Judge should hold his office for life more than any other person in publick trust A Judge may be partial otherwise than to the Crown we have seen Judges partial to the populace ten fifty six A Judge may become corrupt and yet there may not be legal evidence against him A Judge may become froward from age A Judge may grow unfit for his office in many ways It was desirable that there should be a possibility of being delivered from him by a new King That is now gone by an act of Parliament ex gratia of the Crown ten fifty seven Lord Bute advised the King to give up a very large sum of money ten fifty eight for which nobody thanked him It was of consequence to the King but nothing to the publick among whom it was divided When I say Lord Bute advised I mean that such acts were done when he was minister and we are to suppose that he advised them Lord Bute shewed an undue partiality to Scotchmen He turned out doctor Nichols ten fifty nine a very eminent man from being physician to the King to make room for one of his countrymen a man very low in his profession ten sixty He had ten sixty one and ten sixty two to go on errands for him He had occasion for people to go on errands for him but he should not have had Scotchmen and certainly he should not have suffered them to have access to him before the first people in England I told him that the admission of one of them before the first people in England which had given the greatest offence was no more than what happens at every minister s levee where those who attend are admitted in the order that they have come which is better than admitting them according to their rank for if that were to be the rule a man who has waited all the morning might have the mortification to see a peer newly come go in before him and keep him waiting still JOHNSON True Sir but should not have come to the levee to be in the way of people of consequence He saw Lord Bute at all times and could have said what he had to say at any time as well as at the levee There is now no Prime Minister there is only an agent for government in the House of Commons ten sixty three We are governed by the Cabinet but there is no one head there since Sir Robert Walpole s time BOSWELL What then Sir is the use of Parliament JOHNSON Why Sir Parliament is a larger council to the King and the advantage of such a council is having a great number of men of property concerned in the legislature who for their own interest will not consent to bad laws And you must have observed Sir that administration is feeble and timid and cannot act with that authority and resolution which is necessary Were I in power I would turn out every man who dared to oppose me Government has the distribution of offices that it may be enabled to maintain its authority ten sixty four Lord Bute he added took down too fast without building up something new BOSWELL Because Sir he found a rotten building The political coach was drawn by a set of bad horses it was necessary to change them JOHNSON But he should have changed them one by one I told him that I had been informed by mister Orme ten sixty five that many parts of the East Indies were better mapped than the Highlands of Scotland JOHNSON That a country may be mapped it must be travelled over Nay said I meaning to laugh with him at one of his prejudices can t you say it is not worth mapping As we walked to saint Clement s church and saw several shops open upon this most solemn fast day of the Christian world I remarked that one disadvantage arising from the immensity of London was that nobody was heeded by his neighbour there was no fear of censure for not observing Good Friday as it ought to be kept and as it is kept in country towns He said it was upon the whole very well observed even in London He however owned that London was too large but added It is nonsense to say the head is too big for the body It would be as much too big though the body were ever so large that is to say though the country were ever so extensive It has no similarity to a head connected with a body doctor Wetherell Master of University College Oxford accompanied us home from church and after he was gone there came two other gentlemen one of whom uttered the common place complaints that by the increase of taxes labour would be dear other nations would undersell us and our commerce would be ruined JOHNSON smiling Never fear Sir Our commerce is in a very good state and suppose we had no commerce at all we could live very well on the produce of our own country I cannot omit to mention that I never knew any man who was less disposed to be querulous than Johnson Whether the subject was his own situation or the state of the publick or the state of human nature in general though he saw the evils his mind was turned to resolution and never to whining or complaint ten sixty six We went again to saint Clement s in the afternoon He had found fault with the preacher in the morning for not choosing a text adapted to the day The preacher in the afternoon had chosen one extremely proper It is finished After the evening service he said Come you shall go home with me and sit just an hour But he was better than his word for after we had drunk tea ten sixty seven with missus Williams he asked me to go up to his study with him where we sat a long while together in a serene undisturbed frame of mind sometimes in silence and sometimes conversing as we felt ourselves inclined or more properly speaking as he was inclined for during all the course of my long intimacy with him my respectful attention never abated and my wish to hear him was such that I constantly watched every dawning of communication from that great and illuminated mind He observed All knowledge is of itself of some value There is nothing so minute or inconsiderable that I would not rather know it than not In the same manner all power of whatever sort is of itself desirable A man would not submit to learn to hem a ruffle of his wife or his wife s maid but if a mere wish could attain it he would rather wish to be able to hem a ruffle He again advised me to keep a journal ten sixty eight fully and minutely but not to mention such trifles as that meat was too much or too little done or that the weather was fair or rainy He had till very near his death a contempt for the notion that the weather affects the human frame ten sixty nine I told him that our friend Goldsmith had said to me that he had come too late into the world for that Pope and other poets had taken up the places in the Temple of Fame so that as but a few at any period can possess poetical reputation a man of genius can now hardly acquire it JOHNSON That is one of the most sensible things I have ever heard of Goldsmith ten seventy It is difficult to get literary fame and it is every day growing more difficult Ah Sir that should make a man think of securing happiness in another world which all who try sincerely for it may attain In comparison of that how little are all other things The belief of immortality is impressed upon all men and all men act under an impression of it however they may talk and though perhaps they may be scarcely sensible of it I said it appeared to me that some people had not the least notion of immortality and I mentioned a distinguished gentleman of our acquaintance JOHNSON Sir if it were not for the notion of immortality he would cut a throat to fill his pockets When I quoted this to Beauclerk who knew much more of the gentleman than we did he said in his acid manner He would cut a throat to fill his pockets if it were not for fear of being hanged doctor Johnson proceeded Sir there is a great cry about infidelity ten seventy one but there are in reality very few infidels I have heard a person originally a Quaker but now I am afraid a Deist say that he did not believe there were in all England above two hundred infidels He was pleased to say If you come to settle here we will have one day in the week on which we will meet by ourselves That is the happiest conversation where there is no competition no vanity but a calm quiet interchange of sentiments ten seventy two In his private register this evening is thus marked Boswell sat with me till night we had some serious talk ten seventy three It also appears from the same record that after I left him he was occupied in religious duties in giving Francis his servant some directions for preparation to communicate in reviewing his life and resolving on better conduct ten seventy four The humility and piety which he discovers on such occasions is truely edifying No saint however in the course of his religious warfare was more sensible of the unhappy failure of pious resolves than Johnson He said one day talking to an acquaintance on this subject Sir Hell is paved with good intentions ten seventy five On Sunday April sixteen being Easter Day after having attended the solemn service at saint Paul s ten seventy six I dined with doctor Johnson and missus Williams I maintained that Horace was wrong in placing happiness in Nil admirari ten seventy seven for that I thought admiration one of the most agreeable of all our feelings ten seventy eight and I regretted that I had lost much of my disposition to admire which people generally do as they advance in life JOHNSON Sir as a man advances in life he gets what is better than admiration judgement to estimate things at their true value I still insisted that admiration was more pleasing than judgement as love is more pleasing than friendship The feeling of friendship is like that of being comfortably filled with roast beef love like being enlivened with champagne JOHNSON No Sir admiration and love are like being intoxicated with champagne judgement and friendship like being enlivened Waller has hit upon the same thought with you ten seventy nine but I don t believe you have borrowed from Waller I wish you would enable yourself to borrow more ten eighty He then took occasion to enlarge on the advantages of reading and combated the idle superficial notion that knowledge enough may be acquired in conversation The foundation said he must be laid by reading General principles must be had from books which however must be brought to the test of real life In conversation you never get a system What is said upon a subject is to be gathered from a hundred people The parts of a truth which a man gets thus are at such a distance from each other that he never attains to a full view To BENNET LANGTON esquire DEAR SIR I have enquired more minutely about the medicine for the rheumatism which I am sorry to hear that you still want The receipt is this Take equal quantities of flour of sulphur and flour of mustard seed make them an electuary with honey or treacle and take a bolus as big as a nutmeg several times a day as you can bear it drinking after it a quarter of a pint of the infusion of the root of Lovage Lovage in Ray s Nomenclature is Levisticum perhaps the Botanists may know the Latin name Of this medicine I pretend not to judge There is all the appearance of its efficacy which a single instance can afford the patient was very old the pain very violent and the relief I think speedy and lasting My opinion of alterative medicine is not high but quid tentasse nocebit if it does harm or does no good it may be omitted but that it may do good you have I hope reason to think is desired by Sir your most affectionate Humble servant SAM JOHNSON April seventeen seventeen seventy five On Tuesday April eighteen he and I were engaged to go with Sir Joshua Reynolds to dine with mister Cambridge ten eighty one at his beautiful villa on the banks of the Thames near Twickenham doctor Johnson s tardiness was such that Sir Joshua who had an appointment at Richmond early in the day was obliged to go by himself on horseback leaving his coach to Johnson and me Johnson was in such good spirits that every thing seemed to please him as we drove along Our conversation turned on a variety of subjects He thought portrait painting an improper employment for a woman ten eighty two Publick practice of any art he observed and staring in men s faces is very indelicate in a female I happened to start a question whether when a man knows that some of his intimate friends are invited to the house of another friend with whom they are all equally intimate he may join them without an invitation JOHNSON No Sir he is not to go when he is not invited They may be invited on purpose to abuse him smiling As a curious instance how little a man knows or wishes to know his own character in the world or rather as a convincing proof that Johnson s roughness was only external and did not proceed from his heart I insert the following dialogue JOHNSON It is wonderful Sir how rare a quality good humour is in life We meet with very few good humoured men I mentioned four of our friends ten eighty three none of whom he would allow to be good humoured One was acid another was muddy ten eighty four and to the others he had objections which have escaped me Then shaking his head and stretching himself at ease in the coach and smiling with much complacency he turned to me and said I look upon myself as a good humoured fellow The epithet fellow applied to the great Lexicographer the stately Moralist the masterly Critick as if he had been Sam Johnson a mere pleasant companion was highly diverting and this light notion of himself struck me with wonder I answered also smiling No no Sir that will not do You are good natured but not good humoured ten eighty five you are irascible You have not patience with folly and absurdity I believe you would pardon them if there were time to deprecate your vengeance but punishment follows so quick after sentence that they cannot escape I had brought with me a great bundle of Scotch magazines and news papers in which his Journey to the Western Islands was attacked in every mode and I read a great part of them to him knowing they would afford him entertainment I wish the writers of them had been present they would have been sufficiently vexed One ludicrous imitation of his style by mister Maclaurin ten eighty six now one of the Scotch Judges with the title of Lord Dreghorn was distinguished by him from the rude mass This said he is the best But I could caricature my own style much better myself He defended his remark upon the general insufficiency of education in Scotland and confirmed to me the authenticity of his witty saying on the learning of the Scotch Their learning is like bread in a besieged town every man gets a little but no man gets a full meal ten eighty seven There is said he in Scotland a diffusion of learning a certain portion of it widely and thinly spread A merchant there has as much learning as one of their clergy ten eighty eight He talked of Isaac Walton s Lives which was one of his most favourite books doctor Donne s Life he said was the most perfect of them He observed that it was wonderful that Walton who was in a very low situation in life should have been familiarly received by so many great men and that at a time when the ranks of society were kept more separate than they are now He supposed that Walton had then given up his business as a linen draper and sempster and was only an authour ten eighty nine and added that he was a great panegyrist BOSWELL No quality will get a man more friends than a disposition to admire the qualities of others I do not mean flattery but a sincere admiration JOHNSON Nay Sir flattery pleases very generally ten ninety In the first place the flatterer may think what he says to be true but in the second place whether he thinks so or not he certainly thinks those whom he flatters of consequence enough to be flattered No sooner had we made our bow to mister Cambridge in his library than Johnson ran eagerly to one side of the room intent on poring over the backs of the books ten ninety one Sir Joshua observed aside He runs to the books as I do to the pictures but I have the advantage I can see much more of the pictures than he can of the books mister Cambridge upon this politely said doctor Johnson I am going with your pardon to accuse myself for I have the same custom which I perceive you have But it seems odd that one should have such a desire to look at the backs of books Johnson ever ready for contest instantly started from his reverie wheeled about and answered Sir the reason is very plain Knowledge is of two kinds We know a subject ourselves or we know where we can find information upon it When we enquire into any subject the first thing we have to do is to know what books have treated of it This leads us to look at catalogues and the backs of books in libraries Sir Joshua observed to me the extraordinary promptitude with which Johnson flew upon an argument Yes said I he has no formal preparation no flourishing with his sword he is through your body in an instant ten ninety two Johnson was here solaced with an elegant entertainment a very accomplished family and much good company among whom was mister Harris ten ninety three of Salisbury who paid him many compliments on his Journey to the Western Islands The common remark as to the utility of reading history being made JOHNSON We must consider how very little history there is I mean real authentick history That certain Kings reigned and certain battles were fought we can depend upon as true but all the colouring all the philosophy of history is conjecture ten ninety four BOSWELL Then Sir you would reduce all history to no better than an almanack ten ninety five a mere chronological series of remarkable events mister Gibbon who must at that time have been employed upon his History ten ninety six of which he published the first volume in the following year was present but did not step forth in defence of that species of writing He probably did not like to trust himself with JOHNSON ten ninety seven Johnson observed that the force of our early habits was so great that though reason approved nay though our senses relished a different course almost every man returned to them I do not believe there is any observation upon human nature better founded than this and in many cases it is a very painful truth for where early habits have been mean and wretched the joy and elevation resulting from better modes of life must be damped by the gloomy consciousness of being under an almost inevitable doom to sink back into a situation which we recollect with disgust It surely may be prevented by constant attention and unremitting exertion to establish contrary habits of superiour efficacy The Beggar s Opera and the common question whether it was pernicious in its effects having been introduced JOHNSON As to this matter which has been very much contested I myself am of opinion that more influence has been ascribed to The Beggar s Opera than it in reality ever had for I do not believe that any man was ever made a rogue by being present at its representation At the same time I do not deny that it may have some influence by making the character of a rogue familiar and in some degree pleasing ten ninety eight Then collecting himself as it were to give a heavy stroke There is in it such a labefactation of all principles as may be injurious to morality While he pronounced this response we sat in a comical sort of restraint smothering a laugh which we were afraid might burst out In his Life of Gay he has been still more decisive as to the inefficiency of The Beggar s Opera in corrupting society ten ninety nine But I have ever thought somewhat differently for indeed not only are the gaiety and heroism of a highwayman very captivating to a youthful imagination but the arguments for adventurous depredation are so plausible the allusions so lively and the contrasts with the ordinary and more painful modes of acquiring property are so artfully displayed that it requires a cool and strong judgement to resist so imposing an aggregate yet I own I should be very sorry to have The Beggar s Opera suppressed for there is in it so much of real London life so much brilliant wit and such a variety of airs which from early association of ideas engage soothe and enliven the mind that no performance which the theatre exhibits delights me more The late worthy Duke of Queensberry eleven hundred as Thomson in his Seasons justly characterises him told me that when Gay first shewed him The Beggar s Opera his Grace s observation was This is a very odd thing Gay I am satisfied that it is either a very good thing or a very bad thing It proved the former beyond the warmest expectations of the authour or his friends mister Cambridge however shewed us to day that there was good reason enough to doubt concerning its success He was told by Quin that during the first night of its appearance it was long in a very dubious state that there was a disposition to damn it and that it was saved by the song eleven oh one Oh ponder well be not severe the audience being much affected by the innocent looks of Polly when she came to those two lines which exhibit at once a painful and ridiculous image For on the rope that hangs my Dear Depends poor Polly s life Quin himself had so bad an opinion of it that he refused the part of Captain Macheath and gave it to Walker eleven oh two who acquired great celebrity by his grave yet animated performance of it eleven oh three We talked of a young gentleman s marriage with an eminent singer eleven oh four and his determination that she should no longer sing in publick though his father was very earnest she should because her talents would be liberally rewarded so as to make her a good fortune It was questioned whether the young gentleman who had not a shilling in the world eleven oh five but was blest with very uncommon talents was not foolishly delicate or foolishly proud and his father truely rational without being mean Johnson with all the high spirit of a Roman senator exclaimed He resolved wisely and nobly to be sure He is a brave man Would not a gentleman be disgraced by having his wife singing publickly for hire No Sir there can be no doubt here I know not if I should not prepare myself for a publick singer as readily as let my wife be one Johnson arraigned the modern politicks of this country as entirely devoid of all principle of whatever kind Politicks said he are now nothing more than means of rising in the world With this sole view do men engage in politicks and their whole conduct proceeds upon it How different in that respect is the state of the nation now from what it was in the time of Charles the First during the Usurpation and after the Restoration in the time of Charles the Second Hudibras affords a strong proof how much hold political principles had then upon the minds of men There is in Hudibras a great deal of bullion which will always last But to be sure the brightest strokes of his wit owed their force to the impression of the characters which was upon men s minds at the time to their knowing them at table and in the street in short being familiar with them and above all to his satire being directed against those whom a little while before they had hated and feared eleven oh six The nation in general has ever been loyal has been at all times attached to the monarch though a few daring rebels have been wonderfully powerful for a time The murder of Charles the First was undoubtedly not committed with the approbation or consent of the people Had that been the case Parliament would not have ventured to consign the regicides to their deserved punishment And we know what exuberance of joy there was when Charles the Second was restored If Charles the Second had bent all his mind to it had made it his sole object he might have been as absolute as Louis the Fourteenth A gentleman observed he would have done no harm if he had JOHNSON Why Sir absolute princes seldom do any harm But they who are governed by them are governed by chance There is no security for good government CAMBRIDGE There have been many sad victims to absolute government JOHNSON So Sir have there been to popular factions BOSWELL The question is which is worst one wild beast or many Johnson praised The Spectator particularly the character of Sir Roger de Coverley He said Sir Roger did not die a violent death as has been generally fancied He was not killed he died only because others were to die and because his death afforded an opportunity to Addison for some very fine writing We have the example of Cervantes making Don Quixote die eleven oh seven I never could see why Sir Roger is represented as a little cracked It appears to me that the story of the widow was intended to have something superinduced upon it but the superstructure did not come eleven oh eight Somebody found fault with writing verses in a dead language maintaining that they were merely arrangements of so many words and laughed at the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge for sending forth collections of them not only in Greek and Latin but even in Syriac Arabick and other more unknown tongues JOHNSON I would have as many of these as possible I would have verses in every language that there are the means of acquiring Nobody imagines that an University is to have at once two hundred poets but it should be able to show two hundred scholars Pieresc s eleven oh nine death was lamented I think in forty languages And I would have had at every coronation and every death of a King every Gaudium and every Luctus University verses in as many languages as can be acquired I would have the world to be thus told Here is a school where every thing may be learnt Having set out next day on a visit to the Earl of Pembroke at Wilton eleven ten and to my friend mister Temple eleven eleven at Mamhead in Devonshire and not having returned to town till the second of May I did not see doctor Johnson for a considerable time and during the remaining part of my stay in London kept very imperfect notes of his conversation which had I according to my usual custom written out at large soon after the time much might have been preserved which is now irretrievably lost I can now only record some particular scenes and a few fragments of his memorabilia But to make some amends for my relaxation of diligence in one respect I have to present my readers with arguments upon two law cases with which he favoured me On Saturday the sixth of May we dined by ourselves at the Mitre and he dictated to me what follows to obviate the complaint already mentioned eleven twelve which had been made in the form of an action in the Court of Session by doctor Memis of Aberdeen that in the same translation of a charter in which physicians were mentioned he was called Doctor of Medicine There are but two reasons for which a physician can decline the title of Doctor of Medicine because he supposes himself disgraced by the doctorship or supposes the doctorship disgraced by himself To be disgraced by a title which he shares in common with every illustrious name of his profession with Boerhaave with Arbuthnot and with Cullen can surely diminish no man s reputation It is I suppose to the doctorate from which he shrinks that he owes his right of practising physick A doctor of Medicine is a physician under the protection of the laws and by the stamp of authority The physician who is not a Doctor usurps a profession and is authorised only by himself to decide upon health and sickness and life and death That this gentleman is a Doctor his diploma makes evident a diploma not obtruded upon him but obtained by solicitation and for which fees were paid With what countenance any man can refuse the title which he has either begged or bought is not easily discovered All verbal injury must comprise in it either some false position or some unnecessary declaration of defamatory truth That in calling him Doctor a false appellation was given him he himself will not pretend who at the same time that he complains of the title would be offended if we supposed him to be not a Doctor If the title of Doctor be a defamatory truth it is time to dissolve our colleges for why should the publick give salaries to men whose approbation is reproach It may likewise deserve the notice of the publick to consider what help can be given to the professors of physick who all share with this unhappy gentleman the ignominious appellation and of whom the very boys in the street are not afraid to say There goes the Doctor What is implied by the term Doctor is well known It distinguishes him to whom it is granted as a man who has attained such knowledge of his profession as qualifies him to instruct others A Doctor of Laws is a man who can form lawyers by his precepts A Doctor of Medicine is a man who can teach the art of curing diseases There is an old axiom which no man has yet thought fit to deny Nil dat quod non habet Upon this principle to be Doctor implies skill for nemo docet quod non didicit In England whoever practises physick not being a Doctor must practise by a licence but the doctorate conveys a licence in itself By what accident it happened that he and the other physicians were mentioned in different terms where the terms themselves were equivalent or where in effect that which was applied to him was the most honourable perhaps they who wrote the paper cannot now remember Had they expected a lawsuit to have been the consequence of such petty variation I hope they would have avoided it eleven thirteen But probably as they meant no ill they suspected no danger and therefore consulted only what appeared to them propriety or convenience A few days afterwards I consulted him upon a cause Paterson and others against Alexander and others which had been decided by a casting vote in the Court of Session determining that the Corporation of Stirling was corrupt and setting aside the election of some of their officers because it was proved that three of the leading men who influenced the majority had entered into an unjustifiable compact of which however the majority were ignorant He dictated to me after a little consideration the following sentences upon the subject There is a difference between majority and superiority majority is applied to number and superiority to power and power like many other things is to be estimated non numero sed pondere Now though the greater number is not corrupt the greater weight is corrupt so that corruption predominates in the borough taken collectively though perhaps taken numerically the greater part may be uncorrupt That borough which is so constituted as to act corruptly is in the eye of reason corrupt whether it be by the uncontrolable power of a few or by an accidental pravity of the multitude The objection in which is urged the injustice of making the innocent suffer with the guilty is an objection not only against society but against the possibility of society All societies great and small subsist upon this condition that as the individuals derive advantages from union they may likewise suffer inconveniences that as those who do nothing and sometimes those who do ill will have the honours and emoluments of general virtue and general prosperity so those likewise who do nothing or perhaps do well must be involved in the consequences of predominant corruption This in my opinion was a very nice case but the decision was affirmed in the House of Lords On Monday May eight we went together and visited the mansions of Bedlam eleven fourteen I had been informed that he had once been there before with mister Wedderburne now Lord Loughborough mister Murphy and mister Foote and I had heard Foote give a very entertaining account of Johnson s happening to have his attention arrested by a man who was very furious and who while beating his straw eleven fifteen supposed it was William Duke of Cumberland whom he was punishing for his cruelties in Scotland in seventeen forty six eleven sixteen There was nothing peculiarly remarkable this day but the general contemplation of insanity was very affecting I accompanied him home and dined and drank tea with him Talking of an acquaintance of ours eleven seventeen distinguished for knowing an uncommon variety of miscellaneous articles both in antiquities and polite literature he observed You know Sir he runs about with little weight upon his mind And talking of another very ingenious gentleman eleven eighteen who from the warmth of his temper was at variance with many of his acquaintance and wished to avoid them he said Sir he leads the life of an outlaw On Friday May twelve eleven nineteen as he had been so good as to assign me a room in his house where I might sleep occasionally when I happened to sit with him to a late hour I took possession of it this night found every thing in excellent order and was attended by honest Francis with a most civil assiduity I asked Johnson whether I might go to a consultation with another lawyer upon Sunday as that appeared to me to be doing work as much in my way as if an artisan should work on the day appropriated for religious rest JOHNSON Why Sir when you are of consequence enough to oppose the practice of consulting upon Sunday you should do it but you may go now It is not criminal though it is not what one should do who is anxious for the preservation and increase of piety to which a peculiar observance of Sunday is a great help The distinction is clear between what is of moral and what is of ritual obligation On Saturday May thirteen I breakfasted with him by invitation accompanied by mister Andrew Crosbie eleven twenty a Scotch Advocate whom he had seen at Edinburgh and the honorable Colonel now General Edward Stopford brother to Lord Courtown who was desirous of being introduced to him His tea and rolls and butter and whole breakfast apparatus were all in such decorum and his behaviour was so courteous that Colonel Stopford was quite surprised and wondered at his having heard so much said of Johnson s slovenliness and roughness I have preserved nothing of what passed except that Crosbie pleased him much by talking learnedly of alchymy as to which Johnson was not a positive unbeliever but rather delighted in considering what progress had actually been made in the transmutation of metals what near approaches there had been to the making of gold and told us that it was affirmed that a person in the Russian dominions had discovered the secret but died without revealing it as imagining it would be prejudicial to society He added that it was not impossible but it might in time be generally known It being asked whether it was reasonable for a man to be angry at another whom a woman had preferred to him JOHNSON I do not see Sir that it is reasonable for a man to be angry at another whom a woman has preferred to him but angry he is no doubt and he is loath to be angry at himself Before setting out for Scotland on the twenty third eleven twenty one I was frequently in his company at different places but during this period have recorded only two remarks one concerning Garrick He has not Latin enough He finds out the Latin by the meaning rather than the meaning by the Latin eleven twenty two And another concerning writers of travels who he observed were more defective than any other writers eleven twenty three I passed many hours with him on the seventeenth eleven twenty four of which I find all my memorial is much laughing It should seem he had that day been in a humour for jocularity and merriment and upon such occasions I never knew a man laugh more heartily We may suppose that the high relish of a state so different from his habitual gloom produced more than ordinary exertions of that distinguishing faculty of man which has puzzled philosophers so much to explain eleven twenty five Johnson s laugh was as remarkable as any circumstance in his manner It was a kind of good humoured growl Tom Davies described it drolly enough He laughs like a rhinoceros To BENNET LANGTON esquire DEAR SIR I have an old amanuensis eleven twenty six in great distress I have given what I think I can give and begged till I cannot tell where to beg again I put into his hands this morning four guineas If you could collect three guineas more it would clear him from his present difficulty I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON May twenty one seventeen seventy five To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR I make no doubt but you are now safely lodged in your own habitation and have told all your adventures to missus Boswell and Miss Veronica Pray teach Veronica to love me Bid her not mind mamma missus Thrale has taken cold and been very much disordered but I hope is grown well mister Langton went yesterday to Lincolnshire and has invited Nicolaida eleven twenty seven to follow him Beauclerk talks of going to Bath I am to set out on Monday so there is nothing but dispersion I have returned Lord Hailes s entertaining sheets eleven twenty eight but must stay till I come back for more because it will be inconvenient to send them after me in my vagrant state I promised missus Macaulay eleven twenty nine that I would try to serve her son at Oxford I have not forgotten it nor am unwilling to perform it If they desire to give him an English education it should be considered whether they cannot send him for a year or two to an English school If he comes immediately from Scotland he can make no figure in our Universities The schools in the north I believe are cheap and when I was a young man were eminently good There are two little books published by the Foulis eleven thirty Telemachus and Collins s Poems each a shilling I would be glad to have them Make my compliments to missus Boswell though she does not love me You see what perverse things ladies are and how little fit to be trusted with feudal estates When she mends and loves me there may be more hope of her daughters I will not send compliments to my friends by name because I would be loath to leave any out in the enumeration Tell them as you see them how well I speak of Scotch politeness and Scotch hospitality and Scotch beauty and of every thing Scotch but Scotch oat cakes and Scotch prejudices Let me know the answer of Rasay eleven thirty one and the decision relating to Sir Allan eleven thirty two I am my dearest Sir with great affection Your most obliged and Most humble servant SAM JOHNSON May twenty seven seventeen seventy five After my return to Scotland I wrote three letters to him from which I extract the following passages I have seen Lord Hailes since I came down He thinks it wonderful that you are pleased to take so much pains in revising his Annals I told him that you said you were well rewarded by the entertainment which you had in reading them There has been a numerous flight of Hebrideans in Edinburgh this summer whom I have been happy to entertain at my house mister Donald Macqueen eleven thirty three and Lord Monboddo supped with me one evening They joined in controverting your proposition that the Gaelick of the Highlands and Isles of Scotland was not written till of late My mind has been somewhat dark this summer eleven thirty four I have need of your warming and vivifying rays and I hope I shall have them frequently I am going to pass some time with my father at Auchinleck To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR I am returned from the annual ramble into the middle counties eleven thirty five Having seen nothing I had not seen before I have nothing to relate Time has left that part of the island few antiquities and commerce has left the people no singularities I was glad to go abroad and perhaps glad to come home which is in other words I was I am afraid weary of being at home and weary of being abroad Is not this the state of life But if we confess this weariness let us not lament it for all the wise and all the good say that we may cure it For the black fumes which rise in your mind I can prescribe nothing but that you disperse them by honest business or innocent pleasure and by reading sometimes easy and sometimes serious Change of place is useful and I hope that your residence at Auchinleck will have many good effects eleven thirty six That I should have given pain to Rasay I am sincerely sorry and am therefore very much pleased that he is no longer uneasy He still thinks that I have represented him as personally giving up the Chieftainship I meant only that it was no longer contested between the two houses and supposed it settled perhaps by the cession of some remote generation in the house of Dunvegan I am sorry the advertisement was not continued for three or four times in the paper That Lord Monboddo and mister Macqueen should controvert a position contrary to the imaginary interest of literary or national prejudice might be easily imagined but of a standing fact there ought to be no controversy If there are men with tails catch an homo caudatus if there was writing of old in the Highlands or Hebrides in the Erse language produce the manuscripts Where men write they will write to one another and some of their letters in families studious of their ancestry will be kept In Wales there are many manuscripts I have now three parcels of Lord Hailes s history which I purpose to return all the next week that his respect for my little observations should keep his work in suspense makes one of the evils of my journey It is in our language I think a new mode of history which tells all that is wanted and I suppose all that is known without laboured splendour of language or affected subtilty of conjecture The exactness of his dates raises my wonder He seems to have the closeness of Henault eleven thirty seven without his constraint missus Thrale was so entertained with your Journal eleven thirty eight that she almost read herself blind She has a great regard for you Of missus Boswell though she knows in her heart that she does not love me I am always glad to hear any good and hope that she and the little dear ladies will have neither sickness nor any other affliction But she knows that she does not care what becomes of me and for that she may be sure that I think her very much to blame Never my dear Sir do you take it into your head to think that I do not love you you may settle yourself in full confidence both of my love and my esteem I love you as a kind man I value you as a worthy man and hope in time to reverence you as a man of exemplary piety I hold you as Hamlet has it in my heart of hearts eleven thirty nine and therefore it is little to say that I am Sir Your affectionate humble servant SAM JOHNSON London Aug twenty seven seventeen seventy five TO THE SAME SIR If in these papers eleven forty there is little alteration attempted do not suppose me negligent I have read them perhaps more closely than the rest but I find nothing worthy of an objection Write to me soon and write often and tell me all your honest heart I am Sir Yours affectionately SAM JOHNSON Aug thirty seventeen seventy five TO THE SAME MY DEAR SIR I now write to you lest in some of your freaks and humours you should fancy yourself neglected Such fancies I must entreat you never to admit at least never to indulge for my regard for you is so radicated and fixed that it is become part of my mind and cannot be effaced but by some cause uncommonly violent therefore whether I write or not set your thoughts at rest I now write to tell you that I shall not very soon write again for I am to set out to morrow on another journey Your friends are all well at Streatham and in Leicester fields eleven forty one Make my compliments to missus Boswell if she is in good humour with me I am Sir c SAM JOHNSON September fourteen seventeen seventy five What he mentions in such light terms as I am to set out to morrow on another journey I soon afterwards discovered was no less than a tour to France with mister and missus Thrale This was the only time in his life that he went upon the Continent To mister ROBERT LEVET Sept eighteen eleven forty two seventeen seventy five Calais DEAR SIR We are here in France after a very pleasing passage of no more than six hours I know not when I shall write again and therefore I write now though you cannot suppose that I have much to say You have seen France yourself eleven forty three From this place we are going to Rouen and from Rouen to Paris where mister Thrale designs to stay about five or six weeks We have a regular recommendation to the English resident so we shall not be taken for vagabonds We think to go one way and return another and for see as much as we can I will try to speak a little French eleven forty four I tried hitherto but little but I spoke sometimes If I heard better I suppose I should learn faster I am Sir Your humble servant SAM JOHNSON To THE SAME Paris Oct twenty two seventeen seventy five DEAR SIR We are still here commonly very busy in looking about us We have been to day at Versailles You have seen it and I shall not describe it We came yesterday from Fontainbleau where the Court is now We went to see the King and Queen at dinner and the Queen was so impressed by Miss eleven forty five that she sent one of the Gentlemen to enquire who she was I find all true that you have ever told me of Paris mister Thrale is very liberal and keeps us two coaches and a very fine table but I think our cookery very bad eleven forty six missus Thrale got into a convent of English nuns and I talked with her through the grate and I am very kindly used by the English Benedictine friars But upon the whole I cannot make much acquaintance here and though the churches palaces and some private houses are very magnificent there is no very great pleasure after having seen many in seeing more at least the pleasure whatever it be must some time have an end and we are beginning to think when we shall come home mister Thrale calculates that as we left Streatham on the fifteenth of September we shall see it again about the fifteenth of November I think I had not been on this side of the sea five days before I found a sensible improvement in my health I ran a race in the rain this day and beat Baretti Baretti is a fine fellow and speaks French I think quite as well as English eleven forty seven Make my compliments to missus Williams and give my love to Francis and tell my friends that I am not lost I am dear Sir Your affectionate humble c SAM JOHNSON To doctor SAMUEL JOHNSON Edinburgh Oct twenty four seventeen seventy five MY DEAR SIR If I had not been informed that you were at Paris you should have had a letter from me by the earliest opportunity announcing the birth of my son on the ninth instant I have named him Alexander eleven forty eight after my father I now write as I suppose your fellow traveller mister Thrale will return to London this week to attend his duty in Parliament and that you will not stay behind him I send another parcel of Lord Hailes s Annals I have undertaken to solicit you for a favour to him which he thus requests in a letter to me I intend soon to give you The Life of Robert Bruce which you will be pleased to transmit to doctor Johnson I wish that you could assist me in a fancy which I have taken of getting doctor Johnson to draw a character of Robert Bruce from the account that I give of that prince If he finds materials for it in my work it will be a proof that I have been fortunate in selecting the most striking incidents I suppose by The Life of Robert Bruce his Lordship means that part of his Annals which relates the history of that prince and not a separate work Shall we have A Journey to Paris from you in the winter You will I hope at any rate be kind enough to give me some account of your French travels very soon for I am very impatient What a different scene have you viewed this autumn from that which you viewed in autumn seventeen seventy three I ever am my dear Sir Your much obliged and Affectionate humble servant JAMES BOSWELL TO JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR I am glad that the young Laird is born and an end as I hope put to the only difference that you can ever have with missus Boswell eleven forty nine I know that she does not love me but I intend to persist in wishing her well till I get the better of her Paris is indeed a place very different from the Hebrides but it is to a hasty traveller not so fertile of novelty nor affords so many opportunities of remark I cannot pretend to tell the publick any thing of a place better known to many of my readers than to myself We can talk of it when we meet I shall go next week to Streatham from whence I purpose to send a parcel of the History every post Concerning the character of Bruce I can only say that I do not see any great reason for writing it but I shall not easily deny what Lord Hailes and you concur in desiring I have been remarkably healthy all the journey and hope you and your family have known only that trouble and danger which has so happily terminated Among all the congratulations that you may receive I hope you believe none more warm or sincere than those of dear Sir Your most affectionate SAM JOHNSON November sixteen seventeen seventy five eleven fifty TO missus LUCY PORTER IN LICHFIELD eleven fifty one DEAR MADAM This week I came home from Paris I have brought you a little box which I thought pretty but I know not whether it is properly a snuff box or a box for some other use I will send it when I can find an opportunity I have been through the whole journey remarkably well My fellow travellers were the same whom you saw at Lichfield eleven fifty two only we took Baretti with us Paris is not so fine a place as you would expect The palaces and churches however are very splendid and magnificent and what would please you there are many very fine pictures but I do not think their way of life commodious or pleasant eleven fifty three Let me know how your health has been all this while I hope the fine summer has given you strength sufficient to encounter the winter Make my compliments to all my friends and if your fingers will let you write to me or let your maid write if it be troublesome to you I am dear Madam Your most affectionate humble servant SAM JOHNSON November sixteen seventeen seventy five TO THE SAME DEAR MADAM Some weeks ago I wrote to you to tell you that I was just come home from a ramble and hoped that I should have heard from you I am afraid winter has laid hold on your fingers and hinders you from writing However let somebody write if you cannot and tell me how you do and a little of what has happened at Lichfield among our friends I hope you are all well When I was in France I thought myself growing young but am afraid that cold weather will take part of my new vigour from me Let us however take care of ourselves and lose no part of our health by negligence I never knew whether you received the Commentary on the New Testament and the Travels and the glasses Do my dear love write to me and do not let us forget each other This is the season of good wishes and I wish you all good I have not lately seen mister Porter eleven fifty four nor heard of him Is he with you Be pleased to make my compliments to missus Adey and missus Cobb and all my friends and when I can do any good let me know I am dear Madam Yours most affectionately SAM JOHNSON December seventeen seventy five It is to be regretted that he did not write an account of his travels in France for as he is reported to have once said that he could write the Life of a Broomstick eleven fifty five so notwithstanding so many former travellers have exhausted almost every subject for remark in that great kingdom his very accurate observation and peculiar vigour of thought and illustration would have produced a valuable work During his visit to it which lasted but about two months he wrote notes or minutes of what he saw He promised to show me them but I neglected to put him in mind of it and the greatest part of them has been lost or perhaps destroyed in a precipitate burning of his papers a few days before his death which must ever be lamented One small paper book however entitled FRANCE II has been preserved and is in my possession It is a diurnal register of his life and observations from the tenth of October to the fourth of November inclusive being twenty six days and shows an extraordinary attention to various minute particulars Being the only memorial of this tour that remains my readers I am confident will peruse it with pleasure though his notes are very short and evidently written only to assist his own recollection Oct ten Tuesday We saw the Ecole Militaire in which one hundred and fifty young boys are educated for the army They have arms of different sizes according to the age flints of wood The building is very large but nothing fine except the council room The French have large squares in the windows they make good iron palisades Their meals are gross We visited the Observatory a large building of a great height The upper stones of the parapet very large but not cramped with iron The flat on the top is very extensive but on the insulated part there is no parapet Though it was broad enough I did not care to go upon it Maps were printing in one of the rooms We walked to a small convent of the Fathers of the Oratory In the reading desk of the refectory lay the lives of the Saints Oct eleven Wednesday We went to see Hotel de Chatlois eleven fifty six a house not very large but very elegant One of the rooms was gilt to a degree that I never saw before The upper part for servants and their masters was pretty Thence we went to mister Monville s a house divided into small apartments furnished with effeminate and minute elegance Porphyry Thence we went to saint Roque s church which is very large the lower part of the pillars incrusted with marble Three chapels behind the high altar the last a mass of low arches Altars I believe all round We passed through Place de Vendome a fine square about as big as Hanover square Inhabited by the high families Lewis XIV on horse back in the middle Monville is the son of a farmer general In the house of Chatlois is a room furnished with japan fitted up in Europe We dined with Boccage eleven fifty seven the Marquis Blanchetti and his lady The sweetmeats taken by the Marchioness Blanchetti after observing that they were dear mister Le Roy Count Manucci the Abbe the Prior eleven fifty eight and Father Wilson who staid with me till I took him

an hour before half an hour after dinner and again from half an hour after seven to eight They may sleep eight hours Bodily labour wanted in monasteries The poor taken to hospitals and miserably kept Monks in the convent fifteen accounted poor Oct twelve Thursday We went to the Gobelins Tapestry makes a good picture imitates flesh exactly One piece with a gold ground the birds not exactly coloured Thence we went to the King s cabinet very neat not perhaps perfect Gold ore Candles of the candle tree Seeds Woods Thence to Gagnier s house where I saw rooms nine furnished with a profusion of wealth and elegance which I never had seen before Vases Pictures The Dragon china The lustre said to be of crystal and to have cost three thousand five hundredL The whole furniture said to have cost one hundred twenty five thousandL Damask hangings covered with pictures Porphyry This house struck me Then we waited on the ladies to Monville s Captain Irwin with us eleven fifty nine Spain County towns all beggars At Dijon he could not find the way to Orleans Cross roads of France very bad Five soldiers Woman Soldiers escaped The Colonel would not lose five men for the death of one woman The magistrate cannot seize a soldier but by the Colonel s permission Good inn at Nismes Moors of Barbary fond of Englishmen Gibraltar eminently healthy It has beef from Barbary There is a large garden Soldiers sometimes fall from the rock Oct thirteen Friday I staid at home all day only went to find the Prior who was not at home I read something in Canus eleven sixty Nec admiror nec multum laudo Oct fourteen Saturday We went to the house of mister Argenson which was almost wainscotted with looking glasses and covered with gold The ladies closet wainscotted with large squares of glass over painted paper They always place mirrours to reflect their rooms Then we went to Julien s the Treasurer of the Clergy thirty thousandL a year The house has no very large room but is set with mirrours and covered with gold Books of wood here and in another library At D s eleven sixty one I looked into the books in the lady s closet and in contempt shewed them to mister T Prince Titi eleven sixty two Bibl des Fees and other books She was offended and shut up as we heard afterwards her apartment Then we went to Julien Le Roy the King s watch maker a man of character in his business who shewed a small clock made to find the longitude eleven sixty three A decent man Afterwards we saw the Palais Marchand eleven sixty four and the Courts of Justice civil and criminal Queries on the Sellette eleven sixty five This building has the old Gothick passages and a great appearance of antiquity Three hundred prisoners sometimes in the gaol eleven sixty six Much disturbed hope no ill will be eleven sixty seven In the afternoon I visited mister Freron the journalist eleven sixty eight He spoke Latin very scantily but seemed to understand me His house not splendid but of commodious size His family wife son and daughter not elevated but decent I was pleased with my reception He is to translate my books which I am to send him with notes Oct fifteen Sunday At Choisi a royal palace on the

glass The battles of the great Conde are painted in one of the rooms The present Prince a grandsire at thirty nine eleven seventy nine The sight of palaces and other great buildings leaves no very distinct images unless to those who talk of them As I entered my wife was in my mind eleven eighty she would have been pleased Having now nobody to please I am little pleased N In France there is no middle rank eleven eighty one So many shops open that Sunday is little distinguished at Paris The palaces of Louvre and Thuilleries granted out in lodgings In the Palais de Bourbon gilt globes of metal at the fire place The French beds commended Much of the marble only paste The Colosseum a mere wooden building at least much of it Oct eighteen Wednesday We went to Fontainebleau which we found a large mean town crowded with people The forest thick with woods very extensive Manucci eleven eighty two secured us lodgings The appearance of the country pleasant No hills few streams only one hedge I remember no chapels nor crosses on the road Pavement still and rows of trees N Nobody but mean people walk in Paris eleven eighty three Oct nineteen Thursday At Court we saw the apartments the King s bed chamber and council chamber extremely splendid Persons of all ranks in the external rooms through which the family passes servants and masters Brunet with us the second time The introductor came to us civil to me Presenting I had scruples Not necessary We went and saw the King eleven eighty four and Queen at dinner We saw the other ladies at dinner Madame Elizabeth eleven eighty five with the Princess of Guimene At night we went to a comedy I neither saw nor heard Drunken women missus Th preferred one to the other Oct twenty Friday We saw the Queen mount in the forest Brown habit rode aside one lady rode aside The Queen s horse light grey martingale She galloped We then went to the apartments and admired them Then wandered through the palace In the passages stalls and shops Painting in Fresco by a great master worn out We saw the King s horses and dogs The dogs almost all English Degenerate The horses not much commended The stables cool the kennel filthy At night the ladies went to the opera I refused but should have been welcome The King fed himself with his left hand as we Saturday twenty one In the night I got ground We came home to Paris I think we did not see the chapel Tree broken by the wind The French chairs made all of boards painted N Soldiers at the court of justice Soldiers not amenable to the magistrates Dijon woman eleven eighty six Faggots in the palace Every thing slovenly except in the chief rooms Trees in the roads some tall none old many very young and small Women s saddles seem ill made Queen s bridle woven with silver Tags to strike the horse Sunday Oct twenty two To Versailles eleven eighty seven a mean town Carriages of business passing Mean shops against the wall Our way lay through Seve where the China manufacture Wooden bridge at Seve in the way to Versailles The palace of great extent The front long I saw it not perfectly The Menagerie Cygnets dark their black feet on the ground tame Halcyons or gulls Stag and hind young Aviary very large the net wire Black stag of China small Rhinoceros the horn broken and pared away which I suppose will grow the basis I think four inches cross the skin folds like loose cloth doubled over his body and cross his hips a vast animal though young as big perhaps as four oxen The young elephant with his tusks just appearing The brown bear put out his paws all very tame The lion The tigers I did not well view The camel or dromedary with two bunches called the Huguin eleven eighty eight taller than any horse Two camels with one bunch Among the birds was a pelican who being let out went to a fountain and swam about to catch fish His feet well webbed he dipped his head and turned his long bill sidewise He caught two or three fish but did not eat them Trianon is a kind of retreat appendant to Versailles It has an open portico the pavement and I think the pillars of marble There are many rooms which I do not distinctly remember A table of porphyry about five feet long and between two and three broad given to Louis XIV by the Venetian State In the council room almost all that was not door or window was I think looking glass Little Trianon is a small palace like a gentleman s house The upper floor paved with brick Little Vienne The court is ill paved The rooms at the top are small fit to sooth the imagination with privacy In the front of Versailles are small basons of water on the terrace and other basons I think below them There are little courts The great gallery is wainscotted with mirrors not very large but joined by frames I suppose the large plates were not yet made The play house was very large The chapel I do not remember if we saw We saw one chapel but I am not certain whether there or at Trianon The foreign office paved with bricks The dinner half a Louis each and I think a Louis over Money given at Menagerie three livres at palace six livres Oct twenty three Monday Last night I wrote to Levet We went to see the looking glasses wrought They come from Normandy in cast plates perhaps the third of an inch thick At Paris they are ground upon a marble table by rubbing one plate upon another with grit between them The various sands of which there are said to be five I could not learn The handle by which the upper glass is moved has the form of a wheel which may be moved in all directions The plates are sent up with their surfaces ground but not polished and so continue till they are bespoken lest time should spoil the surface as we were told Those that are to be polished are laid on a table covered with several thick cloths hard strained that the resistance may be equal they are then rubbed with a hand rubber held down hard by a contrivance which I did not well understand The powder which is used last seemed to me to be iron dissolved in aqua fortis they called it as Baretti said marc de beau forte which he thought was dregs They mentioned vitriol and salt petre The cannon ball swam in the quicksilver To silver them a leaf of beaten tin is laid and rubbed with quicksilver to which it unites Then more quicksilver is poured upon it which by its mutual attraction rises very high Then a paper is laid at the nearest end of the plate over which the glass is slided till it lies upon the plate having driven much of the quicksilver before it It is then I think pressed upon cloths and then set sloping to drop the superfluous mercury the slope is daily heightened towards a perpendicular In the way I saw the Greve the Mayor s house and the Bastile eleven eighty nine We then went to Sans terre a brewer He brews with about as much malt as mister Thrale and sells his beer at the same price though he pays no duty for malt and little more than half as much for beer Beer is sold retail at sixd a bottle He brews four thousand barrels a year There are seventeen brewers in Paris of whom none is supposed to brew more than he reckoning them at three thousand each they make fifty one thousand a year They make their malt for malting is here no trade The moat of the Bastile is dry Oct twenty four Tuesday We visited the King s library I saw the Speculum humanae Salvationis rudely printed with ink sometimes pale sometimes black part supposed to be with wooden types and part with pages cut on boards The Bible supposed to be older than that of Mentz in sixty two eleven ninety it has no date it is supposed to have been printed with wooden types I am in doubt the print is large and fair in two folios Another book was shown me supposed to have been printed with wooden types I think Durandi Sanctuarium eleven ninety one in fifty eight This is inferred from the difference of form sometimes seen in the same letter which might be struck with different puncheons The regular similitude of most letters proves better that they are metal I saw nothing but the Speculum which I had not seen I think before Thence to the Sorbonne The library very large not in lattices like the King s Marbone and Durandi q collection fourteen vol Scriptores de rebus Gallicis many folios Histoire Genealogique of France nine vol Gallia Christiana the first edition fourto the last f twelve vol The Prior and Librarian dined with us I waited on them home Their garden pretty with covered walks but small yet may hold many students The Doctors of the Sorbonne are all equal choose those who succeed to vacancies Profit little Oct twenty five Wednesday I went with the Prior to saint Cloud to see doctor Hooke We walked round the palace and had some talk I dined with our whole company at the Monastery In the library Beroald Cymon Titus from Boccace Oratio Proverbialis to the Virgin from Petrarch Falkland to Sandys Dryden s Preface to the third vol of Miscellanies eleven ninety two Oct twenty six Thursday We saw the china at Seve cut glazed painted Bellevue a pleasing house not great fine prospect Meudon an old palace Alexander in Porphyry hollow between eyes and nose thin cheeks Plato and Aristotle Noble terrace overlooks the town saint Cloud Gallery not very high nor grand but pleasing In the rooms Michael Angelo drawn by himself Sir Thomas More Des Cartes Bochart Naudacus Mazarine Gilded wainscot so common that it is not minded Gough and Keene Hooke came to us at the inn A message from Drumgold Oct twenty seven Friday I staid at home Gough and Keene and missus S s friend dined with us This day we began to have a fire The weather is grown very cold and I fear has a bad effect upon my breath which has grown much more free and easy in this country Sat Oct twenty eight I visited the Grand Chartreux built by saint Louis It is built for forty but contains only twenty four and will not maintain more The friar that spoke to us had a pretty apartment eleven ninety three mister Baretti says four rooms I remember but three His books seemed to be French His garden was neat he gave me grapes We saw the Place de Victoire with the statues of the King and the captive nations We saw the palace and gardens of Luxembourg but the gallery was shut We climbed to the top stairs I dined with Colbrooke who had much company Foote Sir George Rodney Motteux Udson Taaf Called on the Prior and found him in bed Hotel a guinea a day Coach three guineas a week Valet de place eleven ninety four three l eleven ninety five a day Avantcoureur a guinea a week Ordinary dinner six l a head Our ordinary seems to be about five guineas a day Our extraordinary expences as diversions gratuities clothes I cannot reckon Our travelling is ten guineas a day White stockings eighteenl Wig Hat Sunday Oct twenty nine We saw the boarding school The Enfans trouves eleven ninety six A room with about eighty six children in cradles as sweet as a parlour They lose a third eleven ninety seven take in to perhaps more than seven years old put them to trades pin to them the papers sent with them Want nurses Saw their chapel Went to saint Eustatia saw an innumerable company of girls catechised in many bodies perhaps one hundred to a catechist Boys taught at one time girls at another The sermon the preacher wears a cap which he takes off at the name his action uniform not very violent Oct thirty Monday We saw the library of saint Germain eleven ninety eight A very noble collection Codex Divinorum Officiorum fourteen fifty nine a letter square like that of the Offices perhaps the same The Codex by Fust and Gernsheym Meursius twelve v fol Amadis in French three v fol CATHOLICON sine colophone but of fourteen sixty Two other editions eleven ninety nine one by Augustin de Civitate Dei without name date or place but of Fust s square letter as it seems I dined with colonel Drumgold had a pleasing afternoon Some of the books of saint Germain s stand in presses from the wall like those at Oxford Oct thirty one Tuesday I lived at the Benedictines meagre day soup meagre herrings eels both with sauce fryed fish lentils tasteless in themselves In the library where I found Maffeus s de Historia Indica Promontorium flectere to double the Cape I parted very tenderly from the Prior and Friar Wilkes twelve hundred Maitre des Arts two y Bacc Theol three y Licentiate two y Doctor Th two y in all nine years For the Doctorate three disputations Major Minor Sorbonica Several colleges suppressed and transferred to that which was the Jesuits College Nov one Wednesday We left Paris saint Denis a large town the church not very large but the middle isle is very lofty and aweful On the left are chapels built beyond the line of the wall which destroy the symmetry of the sides The organ is higher above the pavement than any I have ever seen The gates are of brass On the middle gate is the history of our Lord The painted windows are historical and said to be eminently beautiful We were at another church belonging to a convent of which the portal is a dome we could not enter further and it was almost dark Nov two Thursday We came this day to Chantilly a seat belonging to the Prince of Conde This place is eminently beautified by all varieties of waters starting up in fountains falling in cascades running in streams and spread in lakes The water seems to be too near the house All this water is brought from a source or river three leagues off by an artificial canal which for one league is carried under ground The house is magnificent The cabinet seems well stocked what I remember was the jaws of a hippopotamus and a young hippopotamus preserved which however is so small that I doubt its reality It seems too hairy for an abortion and too small for a mature birth Nothing was in spirits all was dry The dog the deer the ant bear with long snout The toucan long broad beak The stables were of very great length The kennel had no scents There was a mockery of a village The Menagerie had few animals twelve oh one For doctor Blagden see post seventeen eighty in mister Langton s Collection Two faussans twelve oh two or Brasilian weasels spotted very wild There is a forest and I think a park I walked till I was very weary and next morning felt my feet battered and with pains in the toes Nov three Friday We came to Compiegne a very large town with a royal palace built round a pentagonal court The court is raised upon vaults and has I suppose an entry on one side by a gentle rise Talk of painting twelve oh three The church is not very large but very elegant and splendid I had at first great difficulty to walk but motion grew continually easier At night we came to Noyon an episcopal city The cathedral is very beautiful the pillars alternately gothick and Corinthian We entered a very noble parochial church Noyon is walled and is said to be three miles round Nov four Saturday We rose very early and came through saint Quintin to Cambray not long after three We went to an English nunnery to give a letter to Father Welch the confessor who came to visit us in the evening Nov five Sunday We saw the cathedral It is very beautiful with chapels on each side The choir splendid The balustrade in one part brass The Neff twelve oh four very high and grand The altar silver as far as it is seen The vestments very splendid At the Benedictines church Here his Journal twelve oh five ends abruptly Whether he wrote any more after this time I know not but probably not much as he arrived in England about the twelfth of November These short notes of his tour though they may seem minute taken singly make together a considerable mass of information and exhibit such an ardour of enquiry and acuteness of examination as I believe are found in but few travellers especially at an advanced age They completely refute the idle notion which has been propagated that he could not see twelve oh six and if he had taken the trouble to revise and digest them he undoubtedly could have expanded them into a very entertaining narrative When I met him in London the following year the account which he gave me of his French tour was Sir I have seen all the visibilities of Paris and around it but to have formed an acquaintance with the people there would have required more time than I could stay I was just beginning to creep into acquaintance twelve oh seven by means of Colonel Drumgold a very high man Sir head of L Ecole Militaire a most complete character for he had first been a professor of rhetorick and then became a soldier And Sir I was very kindly treated by the English Benedictines and have a cell appropriated to me in their convent He observed The great in France live very magnificently but the rest very miserably There is no happy middle state as in England twelve oh eight The shops of Paris are mean the meat in the markets is such as would be sent to a gaol in England twelve oh nine and mister Thrale justly observed that the cookery of the French was forced upon them by necessity for they could not eat their meat unless they added some taste to it The French are an indelicate people they will spit upon any place twelve ten At Madame s twelve eleven a literary lady of rank the footman took the sugar in his fingers twelve twelve and threw it into my coffee I was going to put it aside but hearing it was made on purpose for me I e en tasted Tom s fingers The same lady would needs make tea a l Angloise The spout of the tea pot did not pour freely she bad the footman blow into it twelve thirteen France is worse than Scotland in every thing but climate Nature has done more for the French but they have done less for themselves than the Scotch have done It happened that Foote was at Paris at the same time with doctor Johnson and his description of my friend while there was abundantly ludicrous He told me that the French were quite astonished at his figure and manner and at his dress which he obstinately continued exactly as in London twelve fourteen his brown clothes black stockings and plain shirt He mentioned that an Irish gentleman said to Johnson Sir you have not seen the best French players JOHNSON Players Sir I look on them as no better than creatures set upon tables and joint stools to make faces and produce laughter like dancing dogs But Sir you will allow that some players are better than others JOHNSON Yes Sir as some dogs dance better than others While Johnson was in France he was generally very resolute in speaking Latin It was a maxim with him that a man should not let himself down by speaking a language which he speaks imperfectly Indeed we must have often observed how inferiour how much like a child a man appears who speaks a broken tongue When Sir Joshua Reynolds at one of the dinners of the Royal Academy presented him to a Frenchman of great distinction he would not deign to speak French but talked Latin though his Excellency did not understand it owing perhaps to Johnson s English pronunciation twelve fifteen yet upon another occasion he was observed to speak French to a Frenchman of high rank who spoke English and being asked the reason with some expression of surprise he answered because I think my French is as good as his English Though Johnson understood French perfectly he could not speak it readily as I have observed at his first interview with General Paoli in seventeen sixty nine twelve sixteen yet he wrote it I imagine pretty well as appears from some of his letters in missus Piozzi s collection of which I shall transcribe one A Madame La Comtesse de twelve seventeen July sixteen seventeen seventy five twelve eighteen Oui Madame le moment est arrive et il faut que je parte Mais pourquoi faut il partir Est ce que je m ennuye Je m ennuyerai ailleurs Est ce que je cherche ou quelque plaisir ou quelque soulagement Je ne cherche rien je n espere rien Aller voir ce que jai vu etre un peu rejoue un peu degoute me resouvenir que la vie se passe en vain me plaindre de moi m endurcir aux dehors void le tout de ce qu on compte pour les delices de l annee Que Dieu vous donne Madame tous les agremens de la vie avec un esprit qui peut en jouir sans s y livrer trop Here let me not forget a curious anecdote as related to me by mister Beauclerk which I shall endeavour to exhibit as well as I can in that gentleman s lively manner and in justice to him it is proper to add that doctor Johnson told me I might rely both on the correctness of his memory and the fidelity of his narrative When Madame de Boufflers was first in England twelve nineteen said Beauclerk she was desirous to see Johnson I accordingly went with her to his chambers in the Temple where she was entertained with his conversation for some time When our visit was over she and I left him and were got into Inner Temple lane when all at once I heard a noise like thunder This was occasioned by Johnson who it seems upon a little recollection had taken it into his head that he ought to have done the honours of his literary residence to a foreign lady of quality and eager to shew himself a man of gallantry was hurrying down the stair case in violent agitation He overtook us before we reached the Temple gate and brushing in between me and Madame de Boufflers seized her hand and conducted her to her coach His dress was a rusty brown morning suit a pair of old shoes by way of slippers a little shrivelled wig sticking on the top of his head and the sleeves of his shirt and the knees of his breeches hanging loose A considerable crowd of people gathered round and were not a little struck by this singular appearance He spoke Latin with wonderful fluency and elegance When Pere Boscovich twelve twenty was in England Johnson dined in company with him at Sir Joshua Reynolds s and at doctor Douglas s now Bishop of Salisbury Upon both occasions that celebrated foreigner expressed his astonishment at Johnson s Latin conversation When at Paris Johnson thus characterised Voltaire to Freron the Journalist Vir est acerrimi ingenii et paucarum literarum TO doctor SAMUEL JOHNSON Edinburgh Dec five seventeen seventy five MY DEAR SIR mister Alexander Maclean the young Laird of colonel being to set out to morrow for London I give him this letter to introduce him to your acquaintance The kindness which you and I experienced from his brother whose unfortunate death we sincerely lament twelve twenty one will make us always desirous to shew attention to any branch of the family Indeed you have so much of the true Highland cordiality that I am sure you would have thought me to blame if I had neglected to recommend to you this Hebridean prince in whose island we were hospitably entertained I ever am with respectful attachment my dear Sir Your most obliged And most humble servant JAMES BOSWELL mister Maclean returned with the most agreeable accounts of the polite attention with which he was received by doctor Johnson In the course of this year doctor Burney informs me that he very frequently met doctor Johnson at mister Thrale s at Streatham where they had many long conversations often sitting up as long as the fire and candles lasted and much longer than the patience of the servants subsisted twelve twenty two A few of Johnson s sayings which that gentleman recollects shall here be inserted I never take a nap after dinner but when I have had a bad night and then the nap takes me The writer of an epitaph should not be considered as saying nothing but what is strictly true Allowance must be made for some degree of exaggerated praise In lapidary inscriptions a man is not upon oath twelve twenty three There is now less flogging in our great schools than formerly but then less is learned there so that what the boys get at one end they lose at the other twelve twenty four More is learned in publick than in private schools twelve twenty five from emulation there is the collision of mind with mind or the radiation of many minds pointing to one centre Though few boys make their own exercises yet if a good exercise is given up out of a great number of boys it is made by somebody I hate by roads in education Education is as well known and has long been as well known as ever it can be twelve twenty six Endeavouring to make children prematurely wise is useless labour Suppose they have more knowledge at five or six years old than other children what use can be made of it It will be lost before it is wanted and the waste of so much time and labour of the teacher can never be repaid Too much is expected from precocity and too little performed Miss twelve twenty seven was an instance of early cultivation but in what did it terminate In marrying a little Presbyterian parson who keeps an infant boarding school so that all her employment now is To suckle fools and chronicle small beer twelve twenty eight She tells the children This is a cat and that is a dog with four legs and a tail see there you are much better than a cat or a dog for you can speak twelve twenty nine If I had bestowed such an education on a daughter and had discovered that she thought of marrying such a fellow I would have sent her to the Congress After having talked slightingly of musick he was observed to listen very attentively while Miss Thrale played on the harpsichord and with eagerness he called to her Why don t you dash away like Burney doctor Burney upon this said to him I believe Sir we shall make a musician of you at last Johnson with candid complacency replied Sir I shall be glad to have a new sense given to me twelve thirty He had come down one morning to the breakfast room and been a considerable time by himself before any body appeared When on a subsequent day he was twitted by missus Thrale for being very late which he generally was he defended himself by alluding to the extraordinary morning when he had been too early Madam I do not like to come down to vacuity doctor Burney having remarked that mister Garrick was beginning to look old he said Why Sir you are not to wonder at that no man s face has had more wear and tear twelve thirty one Not having heard from him for a longer time than I supposed he would be silent I wrote to him December eighteen not in good spirits Sometimes I have been afraid that the cold which has gone over Europe this year like a sort of pestilence twelve thirty two has seized you severely sometimes my imagination which is upon occasions prolifick of evil hath figured that you may have somehow taken offence at some part of my conduct To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR Never dream of any offence How should you offend me I consider your friendship as a possession which I intend to hold till you take it from me and to lament if ever by my fault I should lose it However when such suspicions find their way into your mind always give them vent I shall make haste to disperse them but hinder their first ingress if you can Consider such thoughts as morbid Such illness as may excuse my omission to Lord Hailes I cannot honestly plead I have been hindered I know not how by a succession of petty obstructions I hope to mend immediately and to send next post to his Lordship mister Thrale would have written to you if I had omitted he sends his compliments and wishes to see you You and your lady will now have no more wrangling about feudal inheritance twelve thirty three How does the young Laird of Auchinleck I suppose Miss Veronica is grown a reader and discourser I have just now got a cough but it has never yet hindered me from sleeping I have had quieter nights than are common with me I cannot but rejoice that Joseph twelve thirty four has had the wit to find the way back He is a fine fellow and one of the best travellers in the world Young colonel brought me your letter He is a very pleasing youth I took him two days ago to the Mitre and we dined together I was as civil as I had the means of being I have had a letter from Rasay acknowledging with great appearance of satisfaction the insertion in the Edinburgh paper twelve thirty five I am very glad that it was done My compliments to missus Boswell who does not love me and of all the rest I need only send them to those that do and I am afraid it will give you very little trouble to distribute them I am my dear dear Sir Your affectionate humble servant SAM JOHNSON December twenty three seventeen seventy five seventeen seventy six AETAT sixty seven In seventeen seventy six Johnson wrote so far as I can discover nothing for the publick but that his mind was still ardent and fraught with generous wishes to attain to still higher degrees of literary excellence is proved by his private notes of this year which I shall insert in their proper place To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR I have at last sent you all Lord Hailes s papers While I was in France I looked very often into Henault twelve thirty six but Lord Hailes in my opinion leaves him far and far behind Why I did not dispatch so short a perusal sooner when I look back I am utterly unable to discover but human moments are stolen away by a thousand petty impediments which leave no trace behind them I have been afflicted through the whole Christmas with the general disorder of which the worst effect was a cough which is now much mitigated though the country on which I look from a window at Streatham is now covered with a deep snow missus Williams is very ill every body else is as usual Among the papers I found a letter to you which I think you had not opened and a paper for The Chronicle which I suppose it not necessary now to insert I return them both I have within these few days had the honour of receiving Lord Hailes s first volume for which I return my most respectful thanks I wish you my dearest friend and your haughty lady for I know she does not love me and the young ladies and the young Laird all happiness Teach the young gentleman in spite of his mamma to think and speak well of Sir Your affectionate humble servant SAM JOHNSON Jan ten seventeen seventy six At this time was in agitation a matter of great consequence to me and my family which I should not obtrude upon the world were it not that the part which doctor Johnson s friendship for me made him take in it was the occasion of an exertion of his abilities which it would be injustice to conceal That what he wrote upon the subject may be understood it is necessary to give a state of the question which I shall do as briefly as I can In the year fifteen oh four the barony or manour of Auchinleck pronounced Affleck twelve thirty seven in Ayrshire which belonged to a family of the same name with the lands having fallen to the Crown by forfeiture James the Fourth King of Scotland granted it to Thomas Boswell a branch of an ancient family in the county of Fife stiling him in the charter dilecto familiari nostro and assigning as the cause of the grant pro bono et fideli servitio nobis praestito Thomas Boswell was slain in battle fighting along with his Sovereign at the fatal field of Flodden in fifteen thirteen twelve thirty eight From this very honourable founder of our family the estate was transmitted in a direct series of heirs male to David Boswell my father s great grand uncle who had no sons but four daughters who were all respectably married the eldest to Lord Cathcart David Boswell being resolute in the military feudal principle of continuing the male succession passed by his daughters and settled the estate on his nephew by his next brother who approved of the deed and renounced any pretensions which he might possibly have in preference to his son But the estate having been burthened with large portions to the daughters and other debts it was necessary for the nephew to sell a considerable part of it and what remained was still much encumbered The frugality of the nephew preserved and in some degree relieved the estate His son my grandfather an eminent lawyer not only re purchased a great part of what had been sold but acquired other lands and my father who was one of the Judges of Scotland and had added considerably to the estate now signified his inclination to take the privilege allowed by our law twelve thirty nine to secure it to his family in perpetuity by an entail which on account of his marriage articles could not be done without my consent In the plan of entailing the estate I heartily concurred with him though I was the first to be restrained by it but we unhappily differed as to the series of heirs which should be established or in the language of our law called to the succession My father had declared a predilection for heirs general that is males and females indiscriminately He was willing however that all males descending from his grandfather should be preferred to females but would not extend that privilege to males deriving their descent from a higher source I on the other hand had a zealous partiality for heirs male however remote which I maintained by arguments which appeared to me to have considerable weight twelve forty And in the particular case of our family I apprehended that we were under an implied obligation in honour and good faith to transmit the estate by the same tenure which we held it which was as heirs male excluding nearer females I therefore as I thought conscientiously objected to my father s scheme My opposition was very displeasing to my father who was entitled to great respect and deference and I had reason to apprehend disagreeable consequences from my non compliance with his wishes twelve forty one After much perplexity and uneasiness I wrote to doctor Johnson stating the case with all its difficulties at full length and earnestly requesting that he would consider it at leisure and favour me with his friendly opinion and advice To James Boswell esquire Dear Sir I was much impressed by your letter and if I can form upon your case any resolution satisfactory to myself will very gladly impart it but whether I am quite equal to it I do not know It is a case compounded of law and justice and requires a mind versed in juridical disquisitions Could not you tell your whole mind to Lord Hailes He is you know both a Christian and a Lawyer I suppose he is above partiality and above loquacity and I believe he will not think the time lost in which he may quiet a disturbed or settle a wavering mind Write to me as any thing occurs to you and if I find myself stopped by want of facts necessary to be known I will make inquiries of you as my doubts arise If your former resolutions should be found only fanciful you decide rightly in judging that your father s fancies may claim the preference but whether they are fanciful or rational is the question I really think Lord Hailes could help us Make my compliments to dear missus Boswell and tell her that I hope to be wanting in nothing that I can contribute to bring you all out of your troubles I am dear Sir most affectionately Your humble servant SAM JOHNSON London Jan fifteen seventeen seventy six TO THE SAME DEAR SIR I am going to write upon a question which requires more knowledge of local law and more acquaintance with the general rules of inheritance than I can claim but I write because you request it Land is like any other possession by natural right wholly in the power of its present owner and may be sold given or bequeathed absolutely or conditionally as judgment shall direct or passion incite But natural right would avail little without the protection of law and the primary notion of law is restraint in the exercise of natural right A man is therefore in society not fully master of what he calls his own but he still retains all the power which law does not take from him In the exercise of the right which law either leaves or gives regard is to be paid to moral obligations Of the estate which we are now considering your father still retains such possession with such power over it that he can sell it and do with the money what he will without any legal impediment But when he extends his power beyond his own life by settling the order of succession the law makes your consent necessary Let us suppose that he sells the land to risk the money in some specious adventure and in that adventure loses the whole his posterity would be disappointed but they could not think themselves injured or robbed If he spent it upon vice or pleasure his successors could only call him vicious and voluptuous they could not say that he was injurious or unjust He that may do more may do less He that by selling or squandering may disinherit a whole family may certainly disinherit part by a partial settlement Laws are formed by the manners and exigencies of particular times and it is but accidental that they last longer than their causes the limitation of feudal succession to the male arose from the obligation of the tenant to attend his chief in war As times and opinions are always changing I know not whether it be not usurpation to prescribe rules to posterity by presuming to judge of what we cannot know and I know not whether I fully approve either your design or your father s to limit that succession which descended to you unlimited If we are to leave sartum tectum twelve forty two to posterity what we have without any merit of our own received from our ancestors should not choice and free will be kept unviolated Is land to be treated with more reverence than liberty If this consideration should restrain your father from disinheriting some of the males does it leave you the power of disinheriting all the females Can the possessor of a feudal estate make any will Can he appoint out of the inheritance any portions to his daughters There seems to be a very shadowy difference between the power of leaving land and of leaving money to be raised from land between leaving an estate to females and leaving the male heir in effect only their steward Suppose at one time a law that allowed only males to inherit and during the continuance of this law many estates to have descended passing by the females to remoter heirs Suppose afterwards the law repealed in correspondence with a change of manners and women made capable of inheritance would not then the tenure of estates be changed Could the women have no benefit from a law made in their favour Must they be passed by upon moral principles for ever because they were once excluded by a legal prohibition Or may that which passed only to males by one law pass likewise to females by another You mention your resolution to maintain the right of your brothers twelve forty three I do not see how any of their rights are invaded As your whole difficulty arises from the act of your ancestor who diverted the succession from the females you enquire very properly what were his motives and what was his intention for you certainly are not bound by his act more than he intended to bind you nor hold your land on harder or stricter terms than those on which it was granted Intentions must be gathered from acts When he left the estate to his nephew by excluding his daughters was it or was it not in his power to have perpetuated the succession to the males If he could have done it he seems to have shown by omitting it that he did not desire it to be done and upon your own principles you will not easily prove your right to destroy that capacity of succession which your ancestors have left If your ancestor had not the power of making a perpetual settlement and if therefore we cannot judge distinctly of his intentions yet his act can only be considered as an example it makes not an obligation And as you observe he set no example of rigorous adherence to the line of succession He that overlooked a brother would not wonder that little regard is shown to remote relations As the rules of succession are in a great part purely legal no man can be supposed to bequeath any thing but upon legal terms he can grant no power which the law denies and if he makes no special and definite limitation he confers all the power which the law allows Your ancestor for some reason disinherited his daughters but it no more follows that he intended this act as a rule for posterity than the disinheriting of his brother If therefore you ask by what right your father admits daughters to inheritance ask yourself first by what right you require them to be excluded It appears upon reflection that your father excludes nobody he only admits nearer females to inherit before males more remote and the exclusion is purely consequential These dear Sir are my thoughts immethodical and deliberative but perhaps you may find in them some glimmering of evidence I cannot however but again recommend to you a conference with Lord Hailes whom you know to be both a Lawyer and a Christian Make my compliments to missus Boswell though she does not love me I am Sir Your affectionate servant SAM JOHNSON Feb three seventeen seventy three I had followed his recommendation and consulted Lord Hailes who upon this subject had a firm opinion contrary to mine His Lordship obligingly took the trouble to write me a letter in which he discussed with legal and historical learning the points in which I saw much difficulty maintaining that the succession of heirs general was the succession by the law of Scotland from the throne to the cottage as far as we can learn it by record twelve forty four observing that the estate of our family had not been limited to heirs male and that though an heir male had in one instance been chosen in preference to nearer females that had been an arbitrary act which had seemed to be best in the embarrassed state of affairs at that time and the fact was that upon a fair computation of the value of land and money at the time applied to the estate and the burthens upon it there was nothing given to the heir male but the skeleton of an estate The plea of conscience said his Lordship which you put is a most respectable one especially when conscience and self are on different sides But I think that conscience is not well informed and that self and she ought on this occasion to be of a side This letter which had considerable influence upon my mind I sent to doctor Johnson begging to hear from him again upon this interesting question To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR Having not any acquaintance with the laws or customs of Scotland I endeavoured to consider your question upon general principles and found nothing of much validity that I could oppose to this position He who inherits a fief unlimited by his ancestors inherits the power of limiting it according to his own judgement or opinion If this be true you may join with your father Further consideration produces another conclusion He who receives a fief unlimited by his ancestors gives his heirs some reason to complain if he does not transmit it unlimited to posterity For why should he make the state of others worse than his own without a reason If this be true though neither you nor your father are about to do what is quite right but as your father violates I think the legal succession least he seems to be nearer the right than yourself It cannot but occur that Women have natural and equitable claims as well as men and these claims are not to be capriciously or lightly superseded or infringed When fiefs implied military service it is easily discerned why females could not inherit them but that reason is now at an end As manners make laws manners likewise repeal them These are the general conclusions which I have attained None of them are very favourable to your scheme of entail nor perhaps to any scheme My observation that only he who acquires an estate may bequeath it capriciously twelve forty five if it contains any conviction includes this position likewise that only he who acquires an estate may entail it capriciously But I think it may be safely presumed that he who inherits an estate inherits all the power legally concomitant and that He who gives or leaves unlimited an estate legally limitable must be presumed to give that power of limitation which he omitted to take away and to commit future contingencies to future prudence In these two positions I believe Lord Hailes will advise you to rest every other notion of possession seems to me full of difficulties and embarrassed with scruples If these axioms be allowed you have arrived now at full liberty without the help of particular circumstances which however have in your case great weight You very rightly observe that he who passing by his brother gave the inheritance to his nephew could limit no more than he gave and by Lord Hailes s estimate of fourteen years purchase what he gave was no more than you may easily entail according to your own opinion if that opinion should finally prevail Lord Hailes s suspicion that entails are encroachments on the dominion of Providence may be extended to all hereditary privileges and all permanent institutions I do not see why it may not be extended to any provision for the present hour since all care about futurity proceeds upon a supposition that we know at least in some degree what will be future Of the future we certainly know nothing but we may form conjectures from the past and the power of forming conjectures includes in my opinion the duty of acting in conformity to that probability which we discover Providence gives the power of which reason teaches the use I am dear Sir Your most faithful servant SAM JOHNSON Feb nine seventeen seventy six I hope I shall get some ground now with missus Boswell make my compliments to her and to the little people Don t burn papers they may be safe enough in your own box you will wish to see them hereafter To THE SAME DEAR SIR To the letters which I have written about your great question I have nothing to add If your conscience is satisfied you have now only your prudence to consult I long for a letter that I may know how this troublesome and vexatious question is at last decided twelve forty six I hope that it will at last end well Lord Hailes s letter was very friendly and very seasonable but I think his aversion from entails has something in it like superstition Providence is not counteracted by any means which Providence puts into our power The continuance and propagation of families makes a great part of the Jewish law and is by no means prohibited in the Christian institution though the necessity of it continues no longer Hereditary tenures are established in all civilised countries and are accompanied in most with hereditary authority Sir William Temple considers our constitution as defective that there is not an unalienable estate in land connected with a peerage twelve forty seven and Lord Bacon mentions as a proof that the Turks are Barbarians their want of Stirpes as he calls them or hereditary rank twelve forty eight Do not let your mind when it is freed from the supposed necessity of a rigorous entail be entangled with contrary objections and think all entails unlawful till you have cogent arguments which I believe you will never find I am afraid of scruples twelve forty nine I have now sent all Lord Hailes s papers part I found hidden in a drawer in which I had laid them for security and had forgotten them Part of these are written twice I have returned both the copies Part I had read before Be so kind as to return Lord Hailes my most respectful thanks for his first volume his accuracy strikes me with wonder his narrative is far superiour to that of Henault as I have formerly mentioned I am afraid that the trouble which my irregularity and delay has cost him is greater far greater than any good that I can do him will ever recompense but if I have any more copy I will try to do better Pray let me know if missus Boswell is friends with me and pay my respects to Veronica and Euphemia and Alexander I am Sir Your most humble servant SAM JOHNSON February fifteen seventeen seventy five seventeen seventy six mister BOSWELL TO doctor JOHNSON Edinburgh Feb twenty seventeen seventy six You have illuminated my mind and relieved me from imaginary shackles of conscientious obligation Were it necessary I could immediately join in an entail upon the series of heirs approved by my father but it is better not to act too suddenly doctor JOHNSON TO mister BOSWELL DEAR SIR I am glad that what I could think or say has at all contributed to quiet your thoughts Your resolution not to act till your opinion is confirmed by more deliberation is very just If you have been scrupulous do not now be rash I hope that as you think more and take opportunities of talking with men intelligent in questions of property you will be able to free yourself from every difficulty When I wrote last I sent I think ten packets Did you receive them all You must tell missus Boswell that I suspected her to have written without your knowledge twelve fifty and therefore did not return any answer lest a clandestine correspondence should have been perniciously discovered I will write to her soon I am dear Sir Most affectionately yours SAM JOHNSON Feb twenty four seventeen seventy six Having communicated to Lord Hailes what doctor Johnson wrote concerning the question which perplexed me so much his Lordship wrote to me Your scruples have produced more fruit than I ever expected from them an excellent dissertation on general principles of morals and law I wrote to doctor Johnson on the twentieth of February complaining of melancholy and expressing a strong desire to be with him informing him that the ten packets came all safe that Lord Hailes was much obliged to him and said he had almost wholly removed his scruples against entails To JAMES BOSWELL esquire DEAR SIR I have not had your letter half an hour as you lay so much weight upon my notions I should think it not just to delay my answer I am very sorry that your melancholy should return and should be sorry likewise if it could have no relief but from company My counsel you may have when you are pleased to require it but of my company you cannot in the next month have much for mister Thrale will take me to Italy he says on the first of April Let me warn you very earnestly against scruples I am glad that you are reconciled to your settlement and think it a great honour to have shaken Lord Hailes s opinion of entails Do not however hope wholly to reason away your troubles do not feed them with attention and they will die imperceptibly away Fix your thoughts upon your business fill your intervals with company and sunshine will again break in upon your mind twelve fifty one If you will come to me you must come very quickly and even then I know not but we may scour the country together for I have a mind to see Oxford and Lichfield before I set out on this long journey To this I can only add that I am dear Sir Your most affectionate humble servant SAM JOHNSON March five seventeen seventy six To THE SAME DEAR SIR Very early in April we leave England and in the beginning of the next week I shall leave London for a short time of this I think it necessary to inform you that you may not be disappointed in any of your enterprises I had not fully resolved to go into the country before this day Please to make my compliments to Lord Hailes and mention very particularly to missus Boswell my hope that she is reconciled to Sir Your faithful servant SAM JOHNSON March twelve seventeen seventy six Above thirty years ago the heirs of Lord Chancellor Clarendon presented the University of Oxford with the continuation of his History and such other of his Lordship s manuscripts as had not been published on condition that the profits arising from their publication should be applied to the establishment of a Manege in the University The gift was accepted in full convocation A person being now recommended to doctor Johnson as fit to superintend this proposed riding school he exerted himself with that zeal for which he was remarkable upon every similar occasion twelve fifty two But on enquiry into the matter he found that the scheme was not likely to be soon carried into execution the profits arising from the Clarendon press being from some mismanagement very scanty This having been explained to him by a respectable dignitary of the church who had good means of knowing it he wrote a letter upon the subject which at once exhibits his extraordinary precision and acuteness and his warm attachment to his ALMA MATER To THE REVEREND doctor WETHERELL MASTER OF UNIVERSITY COLLEGE OXFORD DEAR SIR Few things are more unpleasant than the transaction of business with men who are above knowing or caring what they have to do such as the trustees for Lord Cornbury s institution will perhaps appear when you have read doctor s letter The last part of the Doctor s letter is of great importance The complaint twelve fifty three which he makes I have heard long ago and did not know but it was redressed It is unhappy that a practice so erroneous has not yet been altered for altered it must be or our press will be useless with all its privileges The booksellers who like all other men have strong prejudices in their own favour are enough inclined to think the practice of printing and selling books by any but themselves an encroachment on the rights of their fraternity and have need of stronger inducements to circulate academical publications than those of one another for of that mutual company operation by which the general trade is carried on the University can bear no part Of those whom he neither loves nor fears and from whom he expects no reciprocation of good offices why should any man promote the interest but for profit I suppose with all our scholastick ignorance of mankind we are still too knowing to expect that the booksellers will erect themselves into patrons and buy and sell under the influence of a disinterested zeal for the promotion of learning To the booksellers if we look for either honour or profit from our press not only their common profit but something more must be allowed and if books printed at Oxford are expected to be rated at a high price that price must be levied on the publick and paid by the ultimate purchaser not by the intermediate agents What price shall be set upon the book is to the booksellers wholly indifferent provided that they gain a proportionate profit by negociating the sale Why books printed at Oxford should be particularly dear I am however unable to find We pay no rent we inherit many of our instruments and materials lodging and victuals are cheaper than at London and therefore workmanship ought at least not to be dearer Our expences are naturally less than those of booksellers and in most cases communities are content with less profit than individuals It is perhaps not considered through how many hands a book often passes before it comes into those of the reader or what part of the profit each hand must retain as a motive for transmitting it to the next We will call our primary agent in London mister Cadell twelve fifty four who receives our books from us gives them room in his warehouse and issues them on demand by him they are sold to mister Dilly a wholesale bookseller who sends them into the country and the last seller is the country bookseller Here are three profits to be paid between the printer and the reader or in the style of commerce between the manufacturer and the consumer and if any of these profits is too penuriously distributed the process of commerce is interrupted We are now come to the practical question what is to be done You will tell me with reason that I have said nothing till I declare how much according to my opinion of the ultimate price ought to be distributed through the whole succession of sale The deduction I am afraid will appear very great but let it be considered before it is refused We must allow for profit between thirty and thirty five per cent between six and seven shillings in the pound that is for every book which costs the last buyer twenty shillings we must charge mister Cadell with something less than fourteen We must set the copies at fourteen shillings each and superadd what is called the quarterly book or for every hundred books so charged we must deliver an hundred and four The profits will then stand thus mister Cadell who runs no hazard and gives no credit will be paid for warehouse room and attendance by a shilling profit on each book and his chance of the quarterly book mister Dilly who buys the book for fifteen shillings and who will expect the quarterly book if he takes five and twenty will send it to his country customer at sixteen and six by which at the hazard of loss and the certainty of long credit he gains the regular profit of ten per cent which is expected in the wholesale trade The country bookseller buying at sixteen and sixpence and commonly trusting a considerable time gains but three and sixpence and if he trusts a year not much more than two and sixpence otherwise than as he may perhaps take as long credit as he gives With less profit than this and more you see he cannot have the country bookseller cannot live for his receipts are small and his debts sometimes bad Thus dear Sir I have been incited by doctor s letter to give you a detail of the circulation of books which perhaps every man has not had opportunity of knowing and which those who know it do not perhaps always distinctly consider I am c SAM JOHNSON twelve fifty five March twelve seventeen seventy six Having arrived in London late on Friday the fifteenth of March I hastened next morning to wait on doctor Johnson at his house but found he was removed from Johnson s court No seven to Boltcourt No eight twelve fifty six still keeping to his favourite Fleet street My reflection at the time upon this change as marked in my Journal is as follows I felt a foolish regret that he had left a court which bore his name twelve fifty seven but it was not foolish to be affected with some tenderness of regard for a place in which I had seen him a great deal from whence I had often issued a better and a happier man than when I went in and which had often appeared to my imagination while I trod its pavements in the solemn darkness of the night to be sacred to wisdom and piety twelve fifty eight Being informed that he was at mister Thrale s in the Borough I hastened thither and found missus Thrale and him at breakfast I was kindly welcomed In a moment he was in a full glow of conversation and I felt myself elevated as if brought into another state of being missus Thrale and I looked to each other while he talked and our looks expressed our congenial admiration and affection for him I shall ever recollect this scene with great pleasure I exclaimed to her I am now intellectually Hermippus redivivus I am quite restored by him by transfusion of mind twelve fifty nine There are many she replied who admire and respect mister Johnson but you and I love him He seemed very happy in the near prospect of going to Italy with mister and missus Thrale But said he before leaving England I am to take a jaunt to Oxford Birmingham my native city Lichfield and my old friend doctor Taylor s at Ashbourn in Derbyshire I shall go in a few days and you Boswell shall go with me I was ready to accompany him being willing even to leave London to have the pleasure of his conversation I mentioned with much regret the extravagance of the representative of a great family in Scotland by which there was danger of its being ruined and as Johnson respected it for its antiquity he joined with me in thinking it would be happy if this person should die missus Thrale seemed shocked at this as feudal barbarity and said I do not understand this preference of the estate to its owner of the land to the man who walks upon that land JOHNSON Nay Madam it is not a preference of the land to its owner it is the preference of a family to an individual Here is an establishment in a country which is of importance for ages not only to the chief but to his people an establishment which extends upwards and downwards that this should be destroyed by one idle fellow is a sad thing He said Entails twelve sixty are good because it is good to preserve in a country serieses of men to whom the people are accustomed to look up as to their leaders But I am for leaving a quantity of land in commerce to excite industry and keep money in the country for if no land were to be bought in the country there would be no encouragement to acquire wealth because a family could not be founded there or if it were acquired it must be carried away to another country where land may be bought And although the land in every country will remain the same and be as fertile where there is no money as where there is yet all that portion of the happiness of civil life which is produced by money circulating in a country would be lost BOSWELL Then Sir would it be for the advantage of a country that all its lands were sold at once JOHNSON So far Sir as money produces good it would be an advantage for then that country would have as much money circulating in it as it is worth But to be sure this would be counterbalanced by disadvantages attending a total change of proprietors I expressed my opinion that the power of entailing should be limited thus That there should be one third or perhaps one half of the land of a country kept free for commerce that the proportion allowed to be entailed should be parcelled out so that no family could entail above a certain quantity Let a family according to the abilities of its representatives be richer or poorer in different generations or always rich if its representatives be always wise but let its absolute permanency be moderate In this way we should be certain of there being always a number of established roots and as in the course of nature there is in every age an extinction of some families there would be continual openings for men ambitious of perpetuity to plant a stock in the entail ground twelve sixty one JOHNSON Why Sir mankind will be better able to regulate the system of entails when the evil of too much land being locked up by them is felt than we can do at present when it is not felt I mentioned doctor Adam Smith s book on The Wealth of Nations twelve sixty two which was just published and that Sir John Pringle had observed to me that doctor Smith who had never been in trade could not be expected to write well on that subject any more than a lawyer upon physick JOHNSON He is mistaken Sir a man who has never been engaged in trade himself may undoubtedly write well upon trade and there is nothing which requires more to be illustrated by philosophy than trade does As to mere wealth that is to say money it is clear that one nation or one individual cannot increase its store but by making another poorer but trade procures what is more valuable the reciprocation of the peculiar advantages of different countries A merchant seldom thinks but of his own particular trade To write a good book upon it a man must have extensive views It is not necessary to have practised to write well upon a subject I mentioned law as a subject on which no man could write well without practice JOHNSON Why Sir in England where so much money is to be got by the practice of the law most of our writers upon it have been in practice though Blackstone had not been much in practice when he published his Commentaries But upon the Continent the great writers on law have not all been in practice Grotius indeed was but Puffendorf was not Burlamaqui was not When we had talked of the great consequence which a man acquired by being employed in his profession I suggested a doubt of the justice of the general opinion that it is improper in a lawyer to solicit employment for why I urged should it not be equally allowable to solicit that as the means of consequence as it is to solicit votes to be elected a member of Parliament mister Strahan had told me that a countryman of his and mine twelve sixty three who had risen to eminence in the law had when first making his way solicited him to get him employed in city causes JOHNSON Sir it is wrong to stir up law suits but when once it is certain that a law suit is to go on there is nothing wrong in a lawyer s endeavouring that he shall have the benefit rather than another BOSWELL You would not solicit employment Sir if you were a lawyer JOHNSON No Sir but not because I should think it wrong but because I should disdain it This was a good distinction which will be felt by men of just pride He proceeded However I would not have a lawyer to be wanting to himself in using fair means I would have him to inject a little hint now and then to prevent his being overlooked Lord Mountstuart s bill for a Scotch Militia twelve sixty four in supporting which his Lordship had made an able speech in the House of Commons was now a pretty general topick of conversation JOHNSON As Scotland contributes so little land tax twelve sixty five towards the general support of the nation it ought not to have a militia paid out of the general fund unless it should be thought for the general interest that Scotland should be protected from an invasion which no man can think will happen for what enemy would invade Scotland where there is nothing to be got No Sir now that the Scotch have not the pay of English soldiers spent among them as so many troops are sent abroad they are trying to get money another way by having a militia paid If they are afraid and seriously desire to have an armed force to defend them they should pay for it Your scheme is to retain a part of your land tax by making us pay and clothe your militia BOSWELL You should not talk of we and you Sir there is now an Union JOHNSON There must be a distinction of interest while the proportions of land tax are so unequal If Yorkshire should say Instead of paying our land tax we will keep a greater number of militia it would be unreasonable In this argument my friend was certainly in the wrong The land tax is as unequally proportioned between different parts of England as between England and Scotland nay it is considerably unequal in Scotland itself But the land tax is but a small part of the numerous branches of publick revenue all of which Scotland pays precisely as England does A French invasion made in Scotland would soon penetrate into England He thus discoursed upon supposed obligation in settling estates Where a man gets the unlimited property of an estate there is no obligation upon him in justice to leave it to one person rather than to another There is a motive of preference from kindness and this kindness is generally entertained for the nearest relation If I owe a particular man a sum of money I am obliged to let that man have the next money I get and cannot in justice let another have it but if I owe money to no man I may dispose of what I get as I please There is not a debitum justitice to a man s next heir there is only a debitum caritatis It is plain then that I have morally a choice according to my liking If I have a brother in want he has a claim from affection to my assistance but if I have also a brother in want whom I like better he has a preferable claim The right of an heir at law is only this that he is to have the succession to an estate in case no other person is appointed to it by the owner His right is merely preferable to that of the King We got into a boat to cross over to Black friars and as we moved along the Thames I talked to him of a little volume which altogether unknown to him was advertised to be published in a few days under the title of Johnsoniana or Bon Mots of doctor Johnson twelve sixty six JOHNSON Sir it is a mighty impudent thing BOSWELL Pray Sir could you have no redress if you were to prosecute a publisher for bringing out under your name what you never said and ascribing to you dull stupid nonsense or making you swear profanely as many ignorant relaters of your bon mots do twelve sixty seven JOHNSON No Sir there will always be some truth mixed with the falsehood and how can it be ascertained how much is true and how much is false Besides Sir what damages would a jury give me for having been represented as swearing BOSWELL I think Sir you should at least disavow such a publication because the world and posterity might with much plausible foundation say Here is a volume which was publickly advertised and came out in doctor Johnson s own time and by his silence was admitted by him to be genuine JOHNSON I shall give myself no trouble about the matter He was perhaps above suffering from such spurious publications but I could not help thinking that many men would be much injured in their reputation by having absurd and vicious sayings imputed to them and that redress ought in such cases to be given He said The value of every story depends on its being true A story is a picture either of an individual or of human nature in general if it be false it is a picture of nothing For instance suppose a man should tell that Johnson before setting out for Italy as he had to cross the Alps sat down to make himself wings This many people would believe but it would be a picture of nothing twelve sixty eight naming a worthy friend of ours used to think a story a story till I shewed him that truth was essential to it twelve sixty nine I observed that Foote entertained us with stories which were not true but that indeed it was properly not as narratives that Foote s stories pleased us but as collections of ludicrous images JOHNSON Foote is quite impartial for he tells lies of every body The importance of strict and scrupulous veracity cannot be too often inculcated Johnson was known to be so rigidly attentive to it that even in his common conversation the slightest circumstance was mentioned with exact precision twelve seventy The knowledge of his having such a principle and habit made his friends have a perfect reliance on the truth of every thing that he told however it might have been doubted if told by many others As an instance of this I may mention an odd incident which he related as having happened to him one night in Fleet street A gentlewoman said he begged I would give her my arm to assist her in crossing the street which I accordingly did upon which she offered me a shilling supposing me to be the watchman I perceived that she was somewhat in liquor This if told by most people would have been thought an invention when told by Johnson it was believed by his friends as much as if they had seen what passed We landed at the Temple stairs where we parted I found him in the evening in missus Williams s room We talked of religious orders He said It is as unreasonable for a man to go into a Carthusian convent for fear of being immoral as for a man to cut off his hands for fear he should steal There is indeed great resolution in the immediate act of dismembering himself but when that is once done he has no longer any merit for though it is out of his power to steal yet he may all his life be a thief in his heart So when a man has once become a Carthusian he is obliged to continue so whether he chooses it or not Their silence too is absurd We read in the Gospel of the apostles being sent to preach but not to hold their tongues All severity that does not tend to increase good or prevent evil is idle I said to the Lady Abbess twelve seventy one of a convent Madam you are here not for the love of virtue but the fear of vice She said She should remember this as long as she lived I thought it hard to give her this view of her situation when she could not help it and indeed I wondered at the whole of what he now said because both in his Rambler twelve seventy two and Idler twelve seventy three he treats religious austerities with much solemnity of respect twelve seventy four Finding him still persevering in his abstinence from wine I ventured to speak to him of it JOHNSON Sir I have no objection to a man s drinking wine if he can do it in moderation I found myself apt to go to excess in it and therefore after having been for some time without it on account of illness I thought it better not to return to it twelve seventy five Every man is to judge for himself according to the effects which he experiences One of the fathers tells us he found fasting made him so peevish twelve seventy six that he did not practise it Though he often enlarged upon the evil of intoxication twelve seventy seven he was by no means harsh and unforgiving to those who indulged in occasional excess in wine One of his friends twelve seventy eight I well remember came to sup at a tavern with him and some other gentlemen and too plainly discovered that he had drunk too much at dinner When one who loved mischief thinking to produce a severe censure asked Johnson a few days afterwards Well Sir what did your friend say to you as an apology for being in such a situation Johnson answered Sir he said all that a man should say he said he was sorry for it I heard him once give a very judicious practical advice upon this subject A man who has been drinking wine at all freely should never go into a new company With those who have partaken of wine with him he may be pretty well in unison but he will probably be offensive or appear ridiculous to other people He allowed very great influence to education I do not deny Sir but there is some original difference in minds but it is nothing in comparison of what is formed by education We may instance the science of numbers which all minds are equally capable of attaining twelve seventy nine yet we find a prodigious difference in the powers of different men in that respect after they are grown up because their minds have been more or less exercised in it and I think the same cause will explain the difference of excellence in other things gradations admitting always some difference in the first principles twelve eighty This is a difficult subject but it is best to hope that diligence may do a great deal We are sure of what it can do in increasing our mechanical force and dexterity I again visited him on Monday He took occasion to enlarge as he often did upon the wretchedness of a sea life twelve eighty one A ship is worse than a gaol There is in a gaol better air better company better conveniency of every kind and a ship has the additional disadvantage of being in danger When men come to like a sea life they are not fit to live on land twelve eighty two Then said I it would be cruel in a father to breed his son to the sea JOHNSON It would be cruel in a father who thinks as I do Men go to sea before they know the unhappiness of that way of life and when they have come to know it they cannot escape from it because it is then too late to choose another profession as indeed is generally the case with men when they have once engaged in any particular way of life On Tuesday March nineteen which was fixed for our proposed jaunt we met in the morning at the Somerset coffee house in the Strand where we were taken up by the Oxford coach He was accompanied by mister Gwyn twelve eighty three the architect and a gentleman of Merton College whom we did not know had the fourth seat We soon got into conversation for it was very remarkable of Johnson that the presence of a stranger had no restraint upon his talk I observed that Garrick who was about to quit the stage would soon have an easier life JOHNSON I doubt that Sir BOSWELL Why Sir he will be Atlas with the burthen off his back JOHNSON But I know not Sir if he will be so steady without his load However he should never play any more but be entirely the gentleman and not partly the player he should no longer subject himself to be hissed by a mob or to be insolently treated by performers whom he used to rule with a high hand and who would gladly retaliate BOSWELL I think he should play once a year for the benefit of decayed actors as it has been said he means to do JOHNSON Alas Sir he will soon be a decayed actor himself Johnson expressed his disapprobation of ornamental architecture such as magnificent columns supporting a portico or expensive pilasters supporting merely their own capitals because it consumes labour disproportionate to its utility For the same reason he satyrised statuary Painting said he consumes labour not disproportionate to its effect but a fellow will hack half a year at a block of marble to make something in stone that hardly resembles a man The value of statuary is owing to its difficulty You would not value the finest head cut upon a carrot twelve eighty four Here he seemed to me to be strangely deficient in taste for surely statuary is a noble art of imitation and preserves a wonderful expression of the varieties of the human frame and although it must be allowed that the circumstances of difficulty enhance the value of a marble head we should consider that if it requires a long time in the performance it has a proportionate value in durability Gwyn was a fine lively rattling fellow doctor Johnson kept him in subjection but with a kindly authority The spirit of the artist however rose against what he thought a Gothick attack and he made a brisk defence What Sir will you allow no value to beauty in architecture or in statuary Why should we allow it then in writing Why do you take the trouble to give us so many fine allusions and bright images and elegant phrases You might convey all your instruction without these ornaments Johnson smiled with complacency but said Why Sir all these ornaments are useful because they obtain an easier reception for truth but a building is not at all more convenient for being decorated with superfluous carved work Gwyn at last was lucky enough to make one reply to doctor Johnson which he allowed to be excellent Johnson censured him for taking down a church which might have stood many years and building a new one at a different place for no other reason but that there might be a direct road to a new bridge and his expression was You are taking a church out of the way that the people may go in a straight line to the bridge No Sir said Gwyn I am putting the church in the way that the people may not go out of the way JOHNSON with a hearty loud laugh of approbation Speak no more Rest your colloquial fame upon this Upon our arrival at Oxford doctor Johnson and I went directly to University College but were disappointed on finding that one of the fellows his friend mister Scott twelve eighty five who accompanied him from Newcastle to Edinburgh was gone to the country We put up at the Angel inn and passed the evening by ourselves in easy and familiar conversation Talking of constitutional melancholy he observed A man so afflicted Sir must divert distressing thoughts and not combat with them BOSWELL May not he think them down Sir JOHNSON No Sir To attempt to think them down is madness He should have a lamp constantly burning in his bed chamber during the night and if wakefully disturbed take a book and read and compose himself to rest To have the management of the mind is a great art and it may be attained in a considerable degree by experience and habitual exercise BOSWELL Should not he provide amusements for himself Would it not for instance be right for him to take a course of chymistry JOHNSON Let him take a course of chymistry or a course of rope dancing or a course of any thing to which he is inclined at the time Let him contrive to have as many retreats for his mind as he can as many things to which it can fly from itself twelve eighty six Burton s Anatomy of Melancholy twelve eighty seven is a valuable work It is perhaps overloaded with quotation But there is great spirit and great power in what Burton says when he writes from his own mind Next morning we visited doctor Wetherell Master of University College with whom doctor Johnson conferred on the most advantageous mode of disposing of the books printed at the Clarendon press on which subject his letter has been inserted in a former page twelve eighty eight I often had occasion to remark Johnson loved business twelve eighty nine loved to have his wisdom actually operate on real life doctor Wetherell and I talked of him without reserve in his own presence WETHERELL I would have given him a hundred guineas if he would have written a preface to his Political Tracts twelve ninety by way of a Discourse on the British Constitution BOSWELL doctor Johnson though in his writings and upon all occasions a great friend to the constitution both in church and state has never written expressly in support of either There is really a claim upon him for both I am sure he could give a volume of no great bulk upon each which would comprise all the substance and with his spirit would effectually maintain them He should erect a fort on the confines of each I could perceive that he was displeased with this dialogue He burst out Why should I be always writing twelve ninety one I hoped he was conscious that the debt was just and meant to discharge it though he disliked being dunned We then went to Pembroke College and waited on his old friend doctor Adams the master of it whom I found to be a most polite pleasing communicative man Before his advancement to the headship of his college I had intended to go and visit him at Shrewsbury where he was rector of saint Chad s in order to get from him what particulars he could recollect of Johnson s academical life He now obligingly gave me part of that authentick information which with what I afterwards owed to his kindness will be found incorporated in its proper place in this work doctor Adams had distinguished himself by an able answer to David Hume s Essay on Miracles He told me he had once dined in company with Hume in London twelve ninety two that Hume shook hands with him and said You have treated me much better than I deserve and that they exchanged visits I took the liberty to object to treating an infidel writer with smooth civility Where there is a controversy concerning a passage in a classick authour or concerning a question in antiquities or any other subject in which human happiness is not deeply interested a man may treat his antagonist with politeness and even respect But where the controversy is concerning the truth of religion it is of such vast importance to him who maintains it to obtain the victory that the person of an opponent ought not to be spared If a man firmly believes that religion is an invaluable treasure twelve ninety three he will consider a writer who endeavours to deprive mankind of it as a robber he will look upon him as odious though the infidel might think himself in the right A robber who reasons as the gang do in the Beggar s Opera who call themselves practical philosophers twelve ninety four and may have as much sincerity as pernicious speculative philosophers is not the less an object of just indignation An abandoned profligate may think that it is not wrong to debauch my wife but shall I therefore not detest him And if I catch him in making an attempt shall I treat him with politeness No I will kick him down stairs or run him through the body that is if I really love my wife or have a true rational notion of honour An infidel then shall not be treated handsomely by a Christian merely because he endeavours to rob with ingenuity I do declare however that I am exceedingly unwilling to be provoked to anger and could I be persuaded that truth would not suffer from a cool moderation in its defenders I should wish to preserve good humour at least in every controversy nor indeed do I see why a man should lose his temper while he does all he can to refute an opponent I think ridicule may be fairly used against an infidel for instance if he be an ugly fellow and yet absurdly vain of his person twelve ninety five we may contrast his appearance with Cicero s beautiful image of Virtue could she be seen twelve ninety six Johnson coincided with me and said When a man voluntarily engages in an important controversy he is to do all he can to lessen his antagonist because authority from personal respect has much weight with most people and often more than reasoning twelve ninety seven If my antagonist writes bad language though that may not be essential to the question I will attack him for his bad language ADAMS You would not jostle a chimney sweeper JOHNSON Yes Sir if it were necessary to jostle him down doctor Adams told us that in some of the Colleges at Oxford the fellows had excluded the students from social intercourse with them in the common room twelve ninety eight JOHNSON They are in the right Sir there can be no real conversation no fair exertion of mind amongst them if the young men are by for a man who has a character does not choose to stake it in their presence BOSWELL But Sir may there not be very good conversation without a contest for superiority JOHNSON No animated conversation Sir for it cannot be but one or other will come off superiour I do not mean that the victor must have the better of the argument for he may take the weak side but his superiority of parts and knowledge will necessarily appear and he to whom he thus shews himself superiour is lessened in the eyes of the young men twelve ninety nine You know it was said Mallem cum Scaligero errare quam cum Clavio recte sapere thirteen hundred In the same manner take Bentley s and Jason de Nores Comments upon Horace you will admire Bentley more when wrong than Jason when right We walked with doctor Adams into the master s garden and into the common room JOHNSON after a reverie of meditation Ay Here I used to play at draughts with Phil Jones thirteen oh one and Fludyer Jones loved beer and did not get very forward in the church Fludyer turned out a scoundrel thirteen oh two a Whig and said he was ashamed of having been bred at Oxford He had a living at Putney and got under the eye of some retainers to the court at that time and so became a violent Whig but he had been a scoundrel all along to be sure BOSWELL Was he a scoundrel Sir in any other way than that of being a political scoundrel Did he cheat at draughts JOHNSON Sir we never played for money He then carried me to visit doctor Bentham Canon of Christ Church and Divinity Professor with whose learned and lively conversation we were much pleased He gave us an invitation to dinner which doctor Johnson told me was a high honour Sir it is a great thing to dine with the Canons of Christ Church We could not accept his invitation as we were engaged to dine at University College We had an excellent dinner there with the Master and Fellows it being saint Cuthbert s day which is kept by them as a festival as he was a saint of Durham with which this college is much connected thirteen oh three We drank tea with doctor Home thirteen oh four late President of Magdalen College and Bishop of Norwich of whose abilities in different respects the publick has had eminent proofs and the esteem annexed to whose character was increased by knowing him personally He had talked of publishing an edition of Walton s Lives thirteen oh five but had laid aside that design upon doctor Johnson s telling him from mistake that Lord Hailes intended to do it I had wished to negociate between Lord Hailes and him that one or other should perform so good a work JOHNSON In order to do it well it will be necessary to collect all the editions of Walton s Lives By way of adapting the book to the taste of the present age they have in a later edition left out a vision which he relates doctor Donne had thirteen oh six but it should be restored and there should be a critical catalogue given of the works of the different persons whose lives were written by Walton and therefore their works must be carefully read by the editor We then went to Trinity College where he introduced me to mister Thomas Warton with whom we passed a part of the evening We talked of biography JOHNSON It is rarely well executed thirteen oh seven They only who live with a man can write his life with any genuine exactness and discrimination and few people who have lived with a man know what to remark about him The chaplain of a late Bishop thirteen oh eight whom I was to assist in writing some memoirs of his Lordship could tell me scarcely any thing thirteen oh nine I said mister Robert Dodsley s life should be written as he had been so much connected with the wits of his time thirteen ten and by his literary merit had raised himself from the station of a footman mister Warton said he had published a little volume under the title of The Muse in Livery thirteen eleven JOHNSON I doubt whether Dodsley s brother thirteen twelve would thank a man who should write his life yet Dodsley himself was not unwilling that his original low condition should be recollected When Lord Lyttelton s Dialogues of the Dead came out one of which is between Apicius an ancient epicure and Dartineuf a modern epicure Dodsley said to me I knew Dartineuf well for I was once his footman thirteen thirteen Biography led us to speak of doctor John Campbell thirteen fourteen who had written a considerable part of the Biographia Britannica Johnson though he valued him highly was of opinion that there was not so much in his great work A Political Survey of Great Britain as the world had been taught to expect thirteen fifteen and had said to me that he believed Campbell s disappointment on account of the bad success of that work had killed him He this evening observed of it That work was his death mister Warton not adverting to his meaning answered I believe so from the great attention he bestowed on it JOHNSON Nay Sir he died of want of attention if he died at all by that book We talked of a work much in vogue at that time written in a very mellifluous style but which under pretext of another subject contained much artful infidelity thirteen sixteen I said it was not fair to attack us thus unexpectedly he should have warned us of our danger before we entered his garden of flowery eloquence by advertising Spring guns and men traps set here thirteen seventeen The authour had been an Oxonian and was remembered there for having turned Papist I observed that as he had changed several times from the Church of England to the Church of Rome from the Church of Rome to infidelity I did not despair yet of seeing him a methodist preacher JOHNSON laughing It is said that his range has been more extensive and that he has once been Mahometan thirteen eighteen However now that he has published his infidelity he will probably persist in it BOSWELL I am not quite sure of that Sir I mentioned Sir Richard Steele having published his Christian Hero with the avowed purpose of obliging himself to lead a religious life thirteen nineteen yet that his conduct was by no means strictly suitable JOHNSON Steele I believe practised the lighter vices mister Warton being engaged could not sup with us at our inn we had therefore another evening by ourselves I asked Johnson whether a man s thirteen twenty being forward to make himself known to eminent people and seeing as much of life and getting as much information as he could in every way was not yet lessening himself by his forwardness JOHNSON No Sir a man always makes himself greater as he increases his knowledge I censured some ludicrous fantastick dialogues between two coach horses and other such stuff which Baretti had lately published thirteen twenty one He joined with me and said Nothing odd will do long Tristram Shandy did not last thirteen twenty two I expressed a desire to be acquainted with a lady who had been much talked of and universally celebrated for extraordinary address and insinuation thirteen twenty three JOHNSON Never believe extraordinary characters which you hear of people Depend upon it Sir they are exaggerated You do not see one man shoot a great deal higher than another I mentioned mister Burke JOHNSON Yes Burke is an extraordinary man His stream of mind is perpetual thirteen twenty four It is very pleasing to me to record that Johnson s high estimation of the talents of this gentleman was uniform from their early acquaintance Sir Joshua Reynolds informs me that when mister Burke was first elected a member of Parliament and Sir John Hawkins expressed a wonder at his attaining a seat Johnson said Now we who know mister Burke know that he will be one of the first men in this country thirteen twenty five And once when Johnson was ill and unable to exert himself as much as usual without fatigue mister Burke having been mentioned he said That fellow calls forth all my powers Were I to see Burke now it would kill me thirteen twenty six So much was he accustomed to consider conversation as a contest thirteen twenty seven and such was his notion of Burke as an opponent Next morning Thursday March thirty one we set out in a post chaise to pursue our ramble It was a delightful day and we rode through Blenheim park When I looked at the magnificent bridge built by John Duke of Marlborough over a small rivulet and recollected the Epigram made upon it The lofty arch his high ambition shows The stream an emblem of his bounty flows thirteen twenty eight and saw that now by the genius of Brown thirteen twenty nine a magnificent body of water was collected I said They have drowned the Epigram I observed to him while in the midst of the noble scene around us You and I Sir have I think seen together the extremes of what can be seen in Britain the wild rough island of Mull and Blenheim park We dined at an excellent inn at Chapel house where he expatiated on the felicity of England in its taverns and inns and triumphed over the French for not having in any perfection the tavern life There is no private house said he in which people can enjoy themselves so well as at a capital tavern Let there be ever so great plenty of good things ever so much grandeur ever so much elegance ever so much desire that every body should be easy in the nature of things it cannot be there must always be some degree of care and anxiety The master of the house is anxious to entertain his guests the guests are anxious to be agreeable to him and no man but a very impudent dog indeed can as freely command what is in another man s house as if it were his own thirteen thirty Whereas at a tavern there is a general freedom from anxiety You are sure you are welcome and the more noise you make the more trouble you give the more good things you call for the welcomer you are No servants will attend you with the alacrity which waiters do who are incited by the prospect of an immediate reward in proportion as they please No Sir there is nothing which has yet been contrived by man by which so much happiness is produced as by a good tavern or inn thirteen thirty one He then repeated with great emotion Shenstone s lines Whoe er has travell d life s dull round Where er his stages may have been May sigh to think he still has found The warmest welcome at an inn thirteen thirty two My illustrious friend I thought did not sufficiently admire Shenstone thirteen thirty three That ingenious and elegant gentleman s opinion of Johnson appears in one of his letters to mister Graves thirteen thirty four dated Feb nine seventeen sixty I have lately been reading one or two volumes of The Rambler who excepting against some few hardnesses thirteen thirty five in his manner and the want of more examples to enliven is one of the most nervous most perspicuous most concise and most harmonious prose writers I know A learned diction improves by time In the afternoon as we were driven rapidly along in the post chaise he said to me Life has not many things better than this thirteen thirty six We stopped at Stratford upon Avon and drank tea and coffee and it pleased me to be with him upon the classick ground of Shakspeare s native place He spoke slightingly of Dyer s Fleece thirteen thirty seven The subject Sir cannot be made poetical How can a man write poetically of serges and druggets Yet you will hear many people talk to you gravely of that excellent poem The Fleece Having talked of Grainger s Sugar Cane I mentioned to him mister Langton s having told me that this poem when read in manuscript at Sir Joshua Reynolds s had made all the assembled wits burst into a laugh when after much blank verse pomp the poet began a new paragraph thus Now Muse let s sing of rats And what increased the ridicule was that one of the company who slily overlooked the reader perceived that the word had been originally mice and had been altered to rats as more dignified thirteen thirty eight This passage does not appear in the printed work doctor Grainger or some of his friends it should seem having become sensible that introducing even Rats in a grave poem might be liable to banter He however could not bring himself to relinquish the idea for they are thus in a still more ludicrous manner periphrastically exhibited in his poem as it now stands Nor with less waste the whisker d vermin race A countless clan despoil the lowland cane Johnson said that doctor Grainger was an agreeable man a man who would do any good that was in his power His translation of Tibullus he thought was very well done but The Sugar Cane a poem did not please him thirteen thirty nine for he exclaimed What could he make of a sugar cane One might as well write the Parsley bed a Poem or The Cabbage garden a Poem BOSWELL You must then pickle your cabbage with the sal atticum JOHNSON You know there is already The Hop Garden a Poem thirteen forty and I think one could say a great deal about cabbage The poem might begin with the advantages of civilised society over a rude state exemplified by the Scotch who had no cabbages till Oliver Cromwell s soldiers introduced them thirteen forty one and one might thus shew how arts are propagated by conquest as they were by the Roman arms He seemed to be much diverted with the fertility of his own fancy I told him that I heard doctor Percy was writing the history of the wolf in Great Britain JOHNSON The wolf Sir why the wolf Why does he not write of the bear which we had formerly Nay it is said we had the beaver Or why does he not write of the grey rat the Hanover rat as it is called because it is said to have come into this country about the time that the family of Hanover came I should like to see The History of the Grey Rat by Thomas Percy D D Chaplain in Ordinary to His Majesty laughing immoderately BOSWELL I am afraid a court chaplain could not decently write of the grey rat JOHNSON Sir he need not give it the name of the Hanover rat Thus could he indulge a luxuriant sportive imagination when talking of a friend whom he loved and esteemed He mentioned to me the singular history of an ingenious acquaintance He had practised physick in various situations with no great emolument A West India gentleman whom he delighted by his conversation gave him a bond for a handsome annuity during his life on the condition of his accompanying him to the West Indies and living with him there for two years He accordingly embarked with the gentleman but upon the voyage fell in love with a young woman who happened to be one of the passengers and married the wench From the imprudence of his disposition he quarrelled with the gentleman and declared he would have no connection with him So he forfeited the annuity He settled as a physician in one of the Leeward Islands A man was sent out to him merely to compound his medicines This fellow set up as a rival to him in his practice of physick and got so much the better of him in the opinion of the people of the island that he carried away all the business upon which he returned to England and soon after died On Friday March twenty two having set out early from Henley thirteen forty two where we had lain the preceding night we arrived at Birmingham about nine o clock and after breakfast went to call on his old schoolfellow mister Hector thirteen forty three A very stupid maid who opened the door told us that her master was gone out he was gone to the country she could not tell when he would return In short she gave us a miserable reception and Johnson observed She would have behaved no better to people who wanted him in the way of his profession He said to her My name is Johnson tell him I called Will you remember the name She answered with rustick simplicity in the Warwickshire pronunciation I don t understand you Sir Blockhead said he I ll write I never heard the word blockhead applied to a woman before though I do not see why it should not when there is evident occasion for it thirteen forty four He however made another attempt to make her understand him and roared loud in her ear Johnson and then she catched the sound We next called on mister Lloyd one of the people called Quakers He too was not at home but missus Lloyd was and received us courteously and asked us to dinner Johnson said to me After the uncertainty of all human things at Hector s this invitation came very well We walked about the town and he was pleased to see it increasing I talked of legitimation by subsequent marriage which obtained in the Roman law and still obtains in the law of Scotland JOHNSON I think it a bad thing because the chastity of women being of the utmost importance as all property depends upon it they who forfeit it should not have any possibility of being restored to good character nor should the children by an illicit connection attain the full right of lawful children by the posteriour consent of the offending parties His opinion upon this subject deserves consideration Upon his principle there may at times be a hardship and seemingly a strange one upon individuals but the general good of society is better secured And after all it is unreasonable in an individual to repine that he has not the advantage of a state which is made different from his own by the social institution under which he is born A woman does not complain that her brother who is younger than her gets their common father s estate Why then should a natural son complain that a younger brother by the same parents lawfully begotten gets it The operation of law is similar in both cases Besides an illegitimate son who has a younger legitimate brother by the same father and mother has no stronger claim to the father s estate than if that legitimate brother had only the same father from whom alone the estate descends mister Lloyd joined us in the street and in a little while we met Friend Hector as mister Lloyd called him It gave me pleasure to observe the joy which Johnson and he expressed on seeing each other again mister Lloyd and I left them together while he obligingly shewed me some of the manufactures of this very curious assemblage of artificers We all met at dinner at mister Lloyd s where we were entertained with great hospitality mister and missus Lloyd had been married the same year with their Majesties and like them had been blessed with a numerous family of fine children their numbers being exactly the same Johnson said Marriage is the best state for a man in general and every man is a worse man in proportion as he is unfit for the married state I have always loved the simplicity of manners and the spiritual mindedness of the Quakers and talking with mister Lloyd I observed that the essential part of religion was piety a devout intercourse with the Divinity and that many a man was a Quaker without knowing it As doctor Johnson had said to me in the morning while we walked together that he liked individuals among the Quakers but not the sect when we were at mister Lloyd s I kept clear of introducing any questions concerning the peculiarities of their faith But I having asked to look at Baskerville s edition of Barclay s Apology Johnson laid hold of it and the chapter on baptism happening to open Johnson remarked He says there is neither precept nor practice for baptism in the scriptures that is false Here he was the aggressor by no means in a gentle manner and the good Quakers had the advantage of him for he had read negligently and had not observed that Barclay speaks of infant baptism thirteen forty five which they calmly made him perceive mister Lloyd however was in as great a mistake for when insisting that the rite of baptism by water was to cease when the spiritual administration of CHRIST began he maintained that John the Baptist said My baptism shall decrease but his shall increase Whereas the words are He must increase but I must decrease thirteen forty six One of them having objected to the observance of days and months and years Johnson answered The Church does not superstitiously observe days merely as days but as memorials of important facts Christmas might be kept as well upon one day of the year as another but there should be a stated day for commemorating the birth of our Saviour because there is danger that what may be done on any day will be neglected He said to me at another time Sir the holidays observed by our church are of great use in religion There can be no doubt of this in a limited sense I mean if the number of such consecrated portions of time be not too extensive The excellent mister Nelson s thirteen forty seven Festivals and Fasts which has I understand the greatest sale of any book ever printed in England except the Bible is a most valuable help to devotion and in addition to it I would recommend two sermons on the same subject by mister Pott Archdeacon of saint Alban s equally distinguished for piety and elegance I am sorry to have it to say that Scotland is the only Christian country Catholick or Protestant where the great events of our religion are not solemnly commemorated by its ecclesiastical establishment on days set apart for the purpose mister Hector was so good as to accompany me to see the great works of mister Bolton at a place which he has called Soho about two miles from Birmingham which the very ingenious proprietor shewed me himself to the best advantage I wish Johnson had been with us for it was a scene which I should have been glad to contemplate by his light thirteen forty eight The vastness and the contrivance of some of the machinery would have matched his mighty mind I shall never forget mister Bolton s expression to me I sell here Sir what all the world desires to have POWER He had about seven hundred people at work I contemplated him as an iron chieftain and he seemed to be a father to his tribe One of them came to him complaining grievously of his landlord for having distrained his goods Your landlord is in the right Smith said Bolton But I ll tell you what find you a friend who will lay down one half of your rent and I ll lay down the other half and you shall have your goods again From mister Hector I now learnt many particulars of doctor Johnson s early life which with others that he gave me at different times since have contributed to the formation of this work doctor Johnson said to me in the morning You will see Sir at mister Hector s his sister missus Careless thirteen forty nine a clergyman s widow She was the first woman with whom I was in love It dropt out of my head imperceptibly but she and I shall always have a kindness for each other He laughed at the notion that a man never can be really in love but once and considered it as a mere romantick fancy On our return from mister Bolton s mister Hector took me to his house where we found Johnson sitting placidly at tea thirteen fifty with his first love who though now advanced in years was a genteel woman very agreeable and well bred Johnson lamented to mister Hector the state of one of their school fellows mister Charles Congreve a clergyman which he thus described He obtained I believe considerable preferment in Ireland but now lives in London quite as a valetudinarian afraid to go into any house but his own He takes a short airing in his post chaise every day He has an elderly woman whom he calls cousin who lives with him and jogs his elbow when his glass has stood too long empty and encourages him in drinking in which he is very willing to be encouraged not that he gets drunk for he is a very pious man but he is always muddy thirteen fifty one He confesses to one bottle of port every day and he probably drinks more He is quite unsocial his conversation is quite monosyllabical and when at my last visit I asked him what a clock it was that signal of my departure had so pleasing an effect on him that he sprung up to look at his watch like a greyhound bounding at a hare When Johnson took leave of mister Hector he said Don t grow like Congreve nor let me grow like him when you are near me thirteen fifty two When he again talked of missus Careless to night he seemed to have had his affection revived for he said If I had married her it might have been as happy for me thirteen fifty three BOSWELL Pray Sir do you not suppose that there are fifty women in the world with any one of whom a man may be as happy as with any one woman in particular JOHNSON Ay Sir fifty thousand BOSWELL Then Sir you are not of opinion with some who imagine that certain men and certain women are made for each other and that they cannot be happy if they miss their counterparts JOHNSON To be sure not Sir I believe marriages would in general be as happy and often more so if they were all made by the Lord Chancellor upon a due consideration of characters and circumstances without the parties having any choice in the matter I wished to have staid at Birmingham to night to have talked more with mister Hector but my friend was impatient to reach his native city so we drove on that stage in the dark and were long pensive and silent When we came within the focus of the Lichfield lamps Now said he we are getting out of a state of death We put up at the Three Crowns not one of the great inns but a good old fashioned one which was kept by mister Wilkins and was the very next house to that in which Johnson was born and brought up and which was still his own property thirteen fifty four We had a comfortable supper and got into high spirits I felt all my Toryism glow in this old capital of Staffordshire I could have offered incense genio loci and I indulged in libations of that ale which Boniface in The Beaux Stratagem recommends with such an eloquent jollity thirteen fifty five Next morning he introduced me to missus Lucy Porter his step daughter She was now an old maid with much simplicity of manner She had never been in London Her brother a Captain in the navy had left her a fortune of ten thousand pounds about a third of which she had laid out in building a stately house and making a handsome garden in an elevated situation in Lichfield Johnson when here by himself used to live at her house She reverenced him and he had a parental tenderness for her thirteen fifty six We then visited mister Peter Garrick who had that morning received a letter from his brother David announcing our coming to Lichfield He was engaged to dinner but asked us to tea and to sleep at his house Johnson however would not quit his old acquaintance Wilkins of the Three Crowns The family likeness of the Garricks was very striking thirteen fifty seven and Johnson thought that David s vivacity was not so peculiar to himself as was supposed Sir said he I don t know but if Peter had cultivated all the arts of gaiety as much as David has done he might have been as brisk and lively Depend upon it Sir vivacity is much an art and depends greatly on habit I believe there is a good deal of truth in this notwithstanding a ludicrous story told me by a lady abroad of a heavy German baron who had lived much with the young English at Geneva and was ambitious to be as lively as they with which view he with assiduous exertion was jumping over the tables and chairs in his lodgings and when the people of the house ran in and asked with surprize what was the matter he answered Sh apprens t etre fif We dined at our inn and had with us a mister Jackson thirteen fifty eight one of Johnson s schoolfellows whom he treated with much kindness though he seemed to be a low man dull and untaught He had a coarse grey coat black waistcoat greasy leather breeches and a yellow uncurled wig and his countenance had the ruddiness which betokens one who is in no haste to leave his can He drank only ale He had tried to be a cutler at Birmingham but had not succeeded and now he lived poorly at home and had some scheme of dressing leather in a better manner than common to his indistinct account of which doctor Johnson listened with patient attention that he might assist him with his advice Here was an instance of genuine humanity and real kindness in this great man who has been most unjustly represented as altogether harsh and destitute of tenderness A thousand such instances might have been recorded in the course of his long life though that his temper was warm and hasty and his manner often rough cannot be denied I saw here for the first time oat ale and oat cakes not hard as in Scotland but soft like a Yorkshire cake were served at breakfast It was pleasant to me to find that Oats the food of horses thirteen fifty nine were so much used as the food of the people in doctor Johnson s own town He expatiated in praise of Lichfield and its inhabitants who he said were the most sober decent people thirteen sixty in England the genteelest in proportion to their wealth and spoke the purest English thirteen sixty one I doubted as to the last article of this eulogy for they had several provincial sounds as there pronounced like fear instead of like fair once pronounced woonse instead of wunse or wonse Johnson himself never got entirely free of those provincial accents thirteen sixty two Garrick sometimes used to take him off squeezing a lemon into a punch bowl with uncouth gesticulations looking round the company and calling out Who s for poonsh thirteen sixty three Very little business appeared to be going forward in Lichfield I found however two strange manufactures for so inland a place sail cloth and streamers for ships and I observed them making some saddle cloths and dressing sheepskins but upon the whole the busy hand of industry seemed to be quite slackened Surely Sir said I you are an idle set of people Sir said Johnson we are a city of philosophers we work with our heads and make the boobies of Birmingham thirteen sixty four work for us with their hands There was at this time a company of players performing at Lichfield The manager mister Stanton sent his compliments and begged leave to wait on doctor Johnson Johnson received him very courteously and he drank a glass of wine with us He was a plain decent well behaved man and expressed his gratitude to doctor Johnson for having once got him permission from doctor Taylor at Ashbourne to play there upon moderate terms Garrick s name was soon introduced JOHNSON Garrick s conversation is gay and grotesque It is a dish of all sorts but all good things There is no solid meat in it there is a want of sentiment in it Not but that he has sentiment sometimes and sentiment too very powerful and very pleasing but it has not its full proportion in his conversation When we were by ourselves he told me Forty years ago Sir I was in love with an actress here missus Emmet who acted Flora in Hob in the Well thirteen sixty five What merit this lady had as an actress or what was her figure or her manner I have not been informed but if we may believe mister Garrick his old master s taste in theatrical merit was by no means refined thirteen sixty six he was not an elegans formarum spectator thirteen sixty seven Garrick used to tell that Johnson said of an actor who played Sir Harry Wildair thirteen sixty eight at Lichfield There is a courtly vivacity about the fellow when in fact according to Garrick s account he was the most vulgar ruffian that ever went upon boards We had promised mister Stanton to be at his theatre on Monday doctor Johnson jocularly proposed me to write a Prologue for the occasion A Prologue by James Boswell esquire from the Hebrides I was really inclined to take the hint Methought Prologue spoken before doctor Samuel Johnson at Lichfield seventeen seventy six would have sounded as well as Prologue spoken before the Duke of York at Oxford in Charles the Second s time Much might have been said of what Lichfield had done for Shakspeare by producing Johnson and Garrick But I found he was averse to it We went and viewed the museum of mister Richard Green apothecary here who told me he was proud of being a relation of doctor Johnson s It was truely a wonderful collection both of antiquities and natural curiosities and ingenious works of art He had all the articles accurately arranged with their names upon labels printed at his own little press and on the staircase leading to it was a board with the names of contributors marked in gold letters A printed catalogue of the collection was to be had at a bookseller s Johnson expressed his admiration of the activity and diligence and good fortune of mister Green in getting together in his situation so great a variety of things and mister Green told me that Johnson once said to him Sir I should as soon have thought of building a man of war as of collecting such a museum mister Green s obliging alacrity in shewing it was very pleasing His engraved portrait with which he has favoured me has a motto truely characteristical of his disposition Nemo sibi vivat A physician being mentioned who had lost his practice because his whimsically changing his religion had made people distrustful of him I maintained that this was unreasonable as religion is unconnected with medical skill JOHNSON Sir it is not unreasonable for when people see a man absurd in what they understand they may conclude the same of him in what they do not understand If a physician were to take to eating of horse flesh nobody would employ him though one may eat horse flesh and be a very skilful physician If a man were educated in an absurd religion his continuing to profess it would not hurt him though his changing to it would We drank tea and coffee at mister Peter Garrick s where was missus Aston one of the maiden sisters of missus Walmsley wife of Johnson s first friend thirteen sixty nine and sister also of the lady of whom Johnson used to speak with the warmest admiration by the name of Molly Aston thirteen seventy who was afterwards married to Captain Brodie of the navy On Sunday March twenty four we breakfasted with missus Cobb a widow lady who lived in an agreeable sequestered place close by the town called the Friary it having been formerly a religious house She and her niece Miss Adey were great admirers of doctor Johnson and he behaved to them with a kindness and easy pleasantry such as we see between old and intimate acquaintance He accompanied missus Cobb to saint Mary s church and I went to the cathedral where I was very much delighted with the musick finding it to be peculiarly solemn and accordant with the words of the service We dined at mister Peter Garrick s who was in a very lively humour and verified Johnson s saying that if he had cultivated gaiety as much as his brother David he might have equally excelled in it He was to day quite a London narrator telling us a variety of anecdotes with that earnestness and attempt at mimicry which we usually find in the wits of the metropolis doctor Johnson went with me to the cathedral in the afternoon thirteen seventy one It was grand and pleasing to contemplate this illustrious writer now full of fame worshipping in the solemn temple thirteen seventy two of his native city I returned to tea and coffee at mister Peter Garrick s and then found doctor Johnson at the Reverend mister Seward s thirteen seventy three Canon Residentiary who inhabited the Bishop s palace thirteen seventy four in which mister Walmsley lived and which had been the scene of many happy hours in Johnson s early life mister Seward had with ecclesiastical hospitality and politeness asked me in the morning merely as a stranger to dine with him and in the afternoon when I was introduced to him he asked doctor Johnson and me to spend the evening and sup with him He was a genteel well bred dignified clergyman had travelled with Lord Charles Fitzroy uncle of the present Duke of Grafton who died when abroad and he had lived much in the great world He was an ingenious and literary man had published an edition of Beaumont and Fletcher and written verses in Dodsley s collection His lady was the daughter of mister Hunter Johnson s first schoolmaster And now for the first time I had the pleasure of seeing his celebrated daughter Miss Anna Seward to whom I have since been indebted for many civilities as well as some obliging communications concerning Johnson thirteen seventy five mister Seward mentioned to us the observations which he had made upon the strata of earth in volcanos from which it appeared that they were so very different in depth at different periods that no calculation whatever could be made as to the time required for their formation This fully refuted an antimosaical remark introduced into Captain Brydone s entertaining tour I hope heedlessly from a kind of vanity which is too common in those who have not sufficiently studied the most important of all subjects doctor Johnson indeed had said before independent of this observation Shall all the accumulated evidence of the history of the world shall the authority of what is unquestionably the most ancient writing be overturned by an uncertain remark such as this thirteen seventy six On Monday March twenty five we breakfasted at missus Lucy Porter s Johnson had sent an express to doctor Taylor s acquainting him of our being at Lichfield thirteen seventy seven and Taylor had returned an answer that his postchaise should come for us this day While we sat at breakfast doctor Johnson received a letter by the post which seemed to agitate him very much When he had read it he exclaimed One of the most dreadful things that has happened in my time The phrase my time like the word age is usually understood to refer to an event of a publick or general nature I imagined something like an assassination of the King like a gunpowder plot carried into execution or like another fire of London When asked What is it Sir he answered mister Thrale has lost his only son thirteen seventy eight This was no doubt a very great affliction to mister and missus Thrale which their friends would consider accordingly but from the manner in which the intelligence of it was communicated by Johnson it appeared for the moment to be comparatively small I however soon felt a sincere concern and was curious to observe how doctor Johnson would be affected He said This is a total extinction to their family as much as if they were sold into captivity Upon my mentioning that mister Thrale had daughters who might inherit his wealth Daughters said Johnson warmly he ll no more value his daughters than I was going to speak Sir said he don t you know how you yourself think Sir he wishes to propagate his name thirteen seventy nine In short I saw male succession strong in his mind even where there was no name no family of any long standing I said it was lucky he was not present when this misfortune happened JOHNSON It is lucky for me People in distress never think that you feel enough BOSWELL And Sir they will have the hope of seeing you which will be a relief in the mean time and when you get to them the pain will be so far abated that they will be capable of being consoled by you which in the first violence of it I believe would not be the case JOHNSON No Sir violent pain of mind like violent pain of body must be severely felt BOSWELL I own Sir I have not so much feeling for the distress of others as some people have or pretend to have but I know this that I would do all in my power to relieve them JOHNSON Sir it is affectation to pretend to feel the distress of others as much as they do themselves It is equally so as if one should pretend to feel as much pain while a friend s leg is cutting off as he does No Sir you have expressed the rational and just nature of sympathy I would have gone to the extremity of the earth to have preserved this boy thirteen eighty He was soon quite calm The letter was from mister Thrale s clerk and concluded I need not say how much they wish to see you in London He said We shall hasten back from Taylor s missus Lucy Porter and some other ladies of the place talked a great deal of him when he was out of the room not only with veneration but affection It pleased me to find that he was so much beloved in his native city missus Aston whom I had seen the preceding night and her sister missus Gastrel a widow lady had each a house and garden and pleasure ground prettily situated upon Stowhill a gentle eminence adjoining to Lichfield Johnson walked away to dinner there leaving me by myself without any apology I wondered at this want of that facility of manners from which a man has no difficulty in carrying a friend to a house where he is intimate I felt it very unpleasant to be thus left in solitude in a country town where I was an entire stranger and began to think myself unkindly deserted but I was soon relieved and convinced that my friend instead of being deficient in delicacy had conducted the matter with perfect propriety for I received the following note in his handwriting missus Gastrel at the lower house on Stowhill desires mister Boswell s company to dinner at two I accepted of the invitation and had here another proof how amiable his character was in the opinion of those who knew him best I was not informed till afterwards that missus Gastrel s husband was the clergyman who while he lived at Stratford upon Avon where he was proprietor of Shakspeare s garden with Gothick barbarity cut down his mulberry tree thirteen eighty one and as doctor Johnson told me did it to vex his neighbours His lady I have reason to believe on the same authority thirteen eighty two participated in the guilt of what the enthusiasts for our immortal bard deem almost a species of sacrilege After dinner doctor Johnson wrote a letter to missus Thrale on the death of her son thirteen eighty three I said it would be very distressing to Thrale but she would soon forget it as she had so many things to think of JOHNSON No Sir Thrale will forget it first She has many things that she may think of He has many things that he must think of thirteen eighty four This was a very just remark upon the different effect of those light pursuits which occupy a vacant and easy mind and those serious engagements which arrest attention and keep us from brooding over grief He observed of Lord Bute It was said of Augustus that it would have been better for Rome that he had never been born or had never died So it would have been better for this nation if Lord Bute had never been minister or had never resigned In the evening we went to the Town hall which was converted into a temporary theatre and saw Theodosius with The Stratford Jubilee I was happy to see doctor Johnson sitting in a conspicuous part of the pit and receiving affectionate homage from all his acquaintance We were quite gay and merry I afterwards mentioned to him that I condemned myself for being so when poor mister and missus Thrale were in such distress JOHNSON You are wrong Sir twenty years hence mister and missus Thrale will not suffer much pain from the death of their son Now Sir you are to consider that distance of place as well as distance of time operates upon the human feelings I would not have you be gay in the presence of the distressed because it would shock them but you may be gay at a distance Pain for the loss of a friend or of a relation whom we love is occasioned by the want which we feel In time the vacuity is filled with something else or sometimes the vacuity closes up of itself mister Seward and mister Pearson another clergyman here supt with us at our inn and after they left us we sat up late as we used to do in London Here I shall record some fragments of my friend s conversation during this jaunt Marriage Sir is much more necessary to a man than to a woman for he is much less able to supply himself with domestick comforts You will recollect my saying to some ladies the other day that I had often wondered why young women should marry as they have so much more freedom and so much more attention paid to them while unmarried than when married I indeed did not mention the strong reason for their marrying the mechanical reason BOSWELL Why that is a strong one But does not imagination make it much more important than it is in reality Is it not to a certain degree a delusion in us as well as in women JOHNSON Why yes Sir but it is a delusion that is always beginning again BOSWELL I don t know but there is upon the whole more misery than happiness produced by that passion JOHNSON I don t think so Sir Never speak of a man in his own presence It is always indelicate and may be offensive Questioning is not the mode of conversation among gentlemen thirteen eighty five It is assuming a superiority and it is particularly wrong to question a man concerning himself There may be parts of his former life which he may not wish to be made known to other persons or even brought to his own recollection A man should be careful never to tell tales of himself to his own disadvantage People may be amused and laugh at the time but they will be remembered and brought out against him upon some subsequent occasion Much may be done if a man puts his whole mind to a particular object By doing so Norton thirteen eighty six has made himself the great lawyer that he is allowed to be I mentioned an acquaintance of mine thirteen eighty seven a sectary who was a very religious man who not only attended regularly on publick worship with those of his communion but made a particular study of the Scriptures and even wrote a commentary on some parts of them yet was known to be very licentious in indulging himself with women maintaining that men are to be saved by faith alone and that the Christian religion had not prescribed any fixed rule for the intercourse between the sexes JOHNSON Sir there is no trusting to that crazy piety I observed that it was strange how well Scotchmen were known to one another in their own country though born in very distant counties for we do not find that the gentlemen of neighbouring counties in England are mutually known to each other Johnson with his usual acuteness at once saw and explained the reason of this Why Sir you have Edinburgh where the gentlemen from all your counties meet and which is not so large but they are all known There is no such common place of collection in England except London where from its great size and diffusion many of those who reside in contiguous counties of England may long remain unknown to each other On Tuesday March twenty six there came for us an equipage properly suited to a wealthy well beneficed clergyman doctor Taylor s large roomy post chaise drawn by four stout plump horses and driven by two steady jolly postillions which conveyed us to Ashbourne where I found my friend s schoolfellow living upon an establishment perfectly corresponding with his substantial creditable equipage his house garden pleasure grounds table in short every thing good and no scantiness appearing Every man should form such a plan of living as he can execute completely Let him not draw an outline wider than he can fill up I have seen many skeletons of shew and magnificence which excite at once ridicule and pity doctor Taylor had a good estate of his own and good preferment in the church thirteen eighty eight being a prebendary of Westminster and rector of Bosworth He was a diligent justice of the peace and presided over the town of Ashbourne to the inhabitants of which I was told he was very liberal and as a proof of this it was mentioned to me he had the preceding winter distributed two hundred pounds among such of them as stood in need of his assistance He had consequently a considerable political interest in the county of Derby which he employed to support the Devonshire family for though the schoolfellow and friend of Johnson he was a Whig I could not perceive in his character much congeniality of any sort with that of Johnson who however said to me Sir he has a very strong understanding thirteen eighty nine His size and figure and countenance and manner were that of a hearty English Squire with the parson super induced and I took particular notice of his upper servant mister Peters a decent grave man in purple clothes and a large white wig like the butler or major domo of a Bishop doctor Johnson and doctor Taylor met with great cordiality and Johnson soon gave him the same sad account of their school fellow Congreve that he had given to mister Hector thirteen ninety adding a remark of such moment to the rational conduct of a man in the decline of life that it deserves to be imprinted upon every mind There is nothing against which an old man should be so much upon his guard as putting himself to nurse thirteen ninety one Innumerable have been the melancholy instances of men once distinguished for firmness resolution and spirit who in their latter days have been governed like children by interested female artifice doctor Taylor commended a physician who was known to him and doctor Johnson and said I fight many battles for him as many people in the country dislike him JOHNSON But you should consider Sir that by every one of your victories he is a loser for every man of whom you get the better will be very angry and resolve not to employ him whereas if people get the better of you in argument about him they ll think We ll send for doctor thirteen ninety two nevertheless This was an observation deep and sure in human nature Next day we talked of a book thirteen ninety three in which an eminent judge was arraigned before the bar of the publick as having pronounced an unjust decision in a great cause doctor Johnson maintained that this publication would not give any uneasiness to the judge For said he either he acted honestly or he meant to do injustice If he acted honestly his own consciousness will protect him if he meant to do injustice he will be glad to see the man who attacks him so much vexed Next day as doctor Johnson had acquainted doctor Taylor of the reason for his returning speedily to London it was resolved that we should set out after dinner A few of doctor Taylor s neighbours were his guests that day doctor Johnson talked with approbation of one who had attained to the state of the philosophical wise man that is to have no want of any thing Then Sir said I the savage is a wise man Sir said he I do not mean simply being without but not having a want I maintained against this proposition that it was better to have fine clothes for instance than not to feel the want of them JOHNSON No Sir fine clothes are good only as they supply the want of other means of procuring respect Was Charles the Twelfth think you less respected for his coarse blue coat and black stock thirteen ninety four And you find the King of Prussia dresses plain because the dignity of his character is sufficient I here brought myself into a scrape for I heedlessly said Would not you Sir be the better for velvet and embroidery JOHNSON Sir you put an end to all argument when you introduce your opponent himself Have you no better manners There is your want I apologised by saying I had mentioned him as an instance of one who wanted as little as any man in the world and yet perhaps might receive some additional lustre from dress APPENDIX A Page seventeen In the Bodleian is the following autograph record by Johnson of Good Friday March twenty eight Easter Sunday March thirty and May four seventeen sixty six and the copy of the record of Saturday March twenty nine They belong to the series published by the reverend mister Strahan under the title of Prayers and Meditations but they are not included in it Good Friday March twenty eight seventeen sixty six On the night before I used proper Collects and prayed when I arose in the morning I had all the week an awe upon me not thinking on Passion week till I looked in the almanack I have wholly forborne M meat and wines except one glass on Sunday night In the morning I rose and drank very small tea without milk and had nothing more that day This was the day on which Tetty died I did not mingle much men mention of her with the devotions of this day because it is dedicated to more holy subjects I mentioned her at church and prayed once solemnly at home I was twice at church and went through the prayers without perturbation but heard the sermons imperfectly I came in both times at the second lesson not hearing the bell When I came home I read the Psalms for the day and one sermon in Clark Scruples distract me but at church I had hopes to conquer them I bore abstinence this day not well being at night insupportably heavy but as fasting does not produce sleepyness I had perhaps rested ill the night before I prayed in my study for the day and prayed again in my chamber I went to bed very early before eleven After church I selected collects for the Sacraments Finding myself upon recollection very ignorant of religion I formed a purpose of studying it I went down and sat to tea but was too heavy to converse Saturday twenty nine I rose at the time now usual not fully refreshed Went to tea A sudden thought of restraint hindered me I drank but one dish Took a purge for my health Still uneasy Prayed and went to dinner Dined sparingly on fish added in different ink about four Went to Simpson Was driven home by my physick Drank tea and am much refreshed I believe that if I had drank tea again yesterday I had escaped the heaviness of the evening Fasting that produces inability is no duty but I was unwilling to do less than formerly I had lived more abstemiously than is usual the whole week and taken physick twice which together made the fast more uneasy Thus much I have written medically to show that he who can fast long must have lived plentifully Saturday March twenty nine seventeen sixty six I was yesterday very heavy I do not feel myself to day so much impressed with awe of the approaching mystery I had this day a doubt like Baxter of my state and found that my faith though weak was yet faith O God strengthen it Since the last reception of the sacrament I hope I have no otherwise grown worse than as continuance in sin makes the sinner s condition more dangerous Since last New Year s Eve I have risen every morning by eight at least not after nine which is more superiority over my habits than I have ever before been able to obtain Scruples still distress me My resolution with the blessing of God is to contend with them and if I can to conquer them My resolutions are To conquer scruples To read the Bible this year To try to rise more early To study Divinity To live methodically To oppose idleness To frequent Divine worship Almighty and most merciful Father before whom I now appear laden with the sins of another year suffer me yet again to call upon Thee for pardon and peace O God grant me repentance grant me reformation Grant that I may be no longer distracted with doubts and harassed with vain terrors Grant that I may no longer linger in perplexity nor waste in idleness that life which Thou hast given and preserved Grant that I may

my life by Thy holy laws as that when Thou shalt call me hence I may pass by a holy and happy death to a life of everlasting and unchangeable joy for the sake of Jesus Christ our Lord Amen I went to bed at one or later but did not sleep tho I knew not why Easter Day March thirty seventeen sixty six I rose in the morning Prayed Took my prayer book to tea drank tea planned my devotion for the church I think prayed again Went to church was early Went through the prayers with fixed attention Could not hear the sermon After sermon applied myself to devotion Troubled with Baxter s scruple which was quieted as I returned home It occurred to me that the scruple itself was its own confutation I used the prayer against scruples in the foregoing page in the pew and commended so far as it was lawful Tetty dear Tetty in a prayer by herself then my other friends What collects I do not exactly remember I gave a shilling I then went towards the altar that I might hear the service The communicants were more than I ever saw I kept back used again the foregoing prayer again commended Tetty and lifted up my heart for the rest I prayed in the collect for the fourteen S after Trinity for encrease of Faith Hope and Charity and deliverance from scruples this deliverance was the chief subject of my prayers O God hear me I am now to try to conquer them After reception I repeated my petition and again when I came home My dinner made me a little peevish not much After dinner I retired and read in an hour and a half the seven first chapters of saint Matthew in Greek Glory be to God God grant me to proceed and improve for Jesus Christ s sake Amen I went to Evening Prayers and was undisturbed At church in the morning it occurred to me to consider about example of good any of my friends had set me This is proper in order to the thanks returned for their good examples My attainment of rising gives me comfort and hope O God for Jesus Christ s sake bless me Amen After church before and after dinner I read Rotheram on Faith After evening prayer I retired and wrote this account I then repeated the prayer of the day with collects and my prayer for night and went down to supper at near ten May four sixty six I have read since the noon of Easter day the Gospels of saint Matthew and saint Mark in Greek I have read Xenophon s Cyropaidia BODLEIAN LIBRARY SELECT AUTOGRAPHS MONTAGU APPENDIX B Page three hundred twelve Johnson s sentiments towards his fellow subjects in America have never so far as I know been rightly stated It was not because they fought for liberty that he had come to dislike them A man who bursting forth with a generous indignation had said The Irish are in a most unnatural state for we see there the minority prevailing over the majority ante ii two hundred fifty five was not likely to wish that our plantations should be tyrannically governed The man who in company with some very grave men at Oxford gave as his toast Here s to the next insurrection of the negroes in the West Indies post iii two hundred was not likely to condemn insurrections in general The key to his feelings is found in his indignant cry How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of negroes Ib He hated slavery as perhaps no man of his time hated it While the Quakers who were almost the pioneers in the Anti slavery cause were still slave holders and slave dealers he lifted up his voice against it So early as seventeen forty when Washington was but a child of eight he had maintained the natural right of the negroes to liberty and independence Works vi three hundred thirteen In seventeen fifty six he described Jamaica as a place of great wealth and dreadful wickedness a den of tyrants and a dungeon of slaves Ib vi one hundred thirty In seventeen fifty nine he wrote Of black men the numbers are too great who are now repining under English cruelty Ib iv four hundred seven In the same year in describing the cruelty of the Portuguese discoverers he said We are openly told that they had the less scruple concerning their treatment of the savage people because they scarcely considered them as distinct from beasts and indeed the practice of all the European nations and among others of the English barbarians that cultivate the southern islands of America proves that this opinion however absurd and foolish however wicked and injurious still continues to prevail Interest and pride harden the heart and it is in vain to dispute against avarice and power Ib v two hundred eighteen No miserable sophistry could convince him with his clear mind and his ardour for liberty that slavery can be right An individual he wrote post iii two hundred two may indeed forfeit his liberty by a crime but he cannot by that crime forfeit the liberty of his children How deeply he felt for the wrongs done to helpless races is shown in his dread of discoverers No man had a more eager curiosity or more longed that the bounds of knowledge should be enlarged Yet he wrote I do not much wish well to discoveries for I am always afraid they will end in conquest and robbery Croker s Boswell p two hundred forty eight In his Life of Savage written in seventeen forty four he said Works viii one hundred fifty six Savage has not forgotten to censure those crimes which have been generally committed by the discoverers of new regions and to expose the enormous wickedness of making war upon barbarous nations because they cannot resist and of invading countries because they are fruitful He has asserted the natural equality of mankind and endeavoured to suppress that pride which inclines men to imagine that right is the consequence of power He loved the University of Salamanca because it gave it as its opinion that the conquest of America by the Spaniards was not lawful ante i four hundred fifty five When in seventeen fifty six the English and French were at war in America he said that such was the contest that no honest man could heartily wish success to either party It was only the quarrel of two robbers for the spoils of a passenger ante i three hundred eight note two When from political considerations opposition was raised in seventeen sixty six to the scheme of translating the Bible into Erse he wrote To omit for a year or for a day the most efficacious method of advancing Christianity in compliance with any purposes that terminate on this side of the grave is a crime of which I know not that the world has yet had an example except in the practice of the planters of America a race of mortals whom I suppose no other man wishes to resemble ante ii twenty seven Englishmen as a nation had no right to reproach their fellow subjects in America with being drivers of negroes for England shared in the guilt and the gain of that infamous traffic Nay even as the Virginian delegates to Congress in seventeen seventy four complained Our repeated attempts to exclude all further importations of slaves from Africa by prohibition and by imposing duties which might amount to prohibition have hitherto been defeated by his Majesty s negative thus preferring the immediate advantages of a few British corsairs to the lasting interests of the American States and to the rights of human nature deeply wounded by this infamous practice Bright s Speeches ed eighteen sixty nine i one hundred seventy one Franklin Memoirs ed eighteen eighteen iii seventeen writing from London in seventeen seventy two speaks of the hypocrisy of this country which encourages such a detestable commerce by laws for promoting the Guinea trade while it piqued itself on its virtue love of liberty and the equity of its courts in setting free a single negro From the slightest stain of this hypocrisy Johnson was free He at all events had a right to protest against the yelps of those who while they solemnly asserted that among the unalienable rights of all men are liberty and the pursuit of happiness yet themselves were drivers of negroes FOOTNOTES one Had he been busily employed he would no doubt have finished the edition in a few months He himself had recorded at Easter seventeen sixty five My time

Calamities of Authors i sixty four says Fuller s Church History is disgraced by twelve particular dedications It was an expedient to procure dedication fees for publishing books by subscription was an art not yet discovered The price of the dedication of a play was he adds in the time of George I twenty guineas So much then at least Johnson lost by not dedicating Irene However when he addressed the Plan of his Dictionary to Lord Chesterfield ante i one hundred eighty three he certainly came very near a dedication Boswell in the Hypochondriack writes For my own part I own I am proud enough But I do not relish the stateliness of not dedicating at all I prefer pleasure to pride and it appears to me that there is much pleasure in honestly expressing one s admiration esteem or affection in a public manner and in thus contributing to the happiness of another by making him better pleased with himself London Mag for seventeen eighty two p four hundred fifty four His dedications were dedications of friendship not of flattery or servility He dedicated his Tour to Corsica to Paoli his Tour to the Hebrides to Malone and his Life of Johnson to Sir Joshua Reynolds Goldsmith in like manner distrest though he so often was dedicated his Traveller to his brother the Deserted Village to Sir Joshua and She Stoops to Conquer to Johnson three A passage in Boswell s letter to Malone of Jan twenty nine seventeen ninety one Croker s Boswell p eight hundred twenty nine shows that it is Reynolds of whom he is writing I am he writes to cancel a leaf of the first volume having found that though Sir Joshua certainly assured me he had no objection to my mentioning that Johnson wrote a dedication for him he now thinks otherwise In that leaf occurs the mention of Johnson having written to doctor Leland thanking the University of Dublin for their diploma In the first edition this mention of the letter is followed by the passage above about dedications It was no doubt Reynolds s Dedication of his Discourses to the King in the year seventeen seventy eight that Johnson wrote The first sentence is in a high degree Johnsonian The regular progress of cultivated life is from necessaries to accommodations from accommodations to ornaments four That is to say he added to the last generation of the Royal Family See post April fifteen seventeen seventy three We may hope that

advantages of a good light and free air he fitted up for a study A silver standish and some useful plate which he had been prevailed on to accept as pledges of kindness from some who most esteemed him

Blair about the men of letters at Paris It would give you and Robertson great satisfaction to find that there is not a single deist among them J H Burton s Hume ii one hundred eighty one There was no deist I suppose because they were all atheists Romilly Life i one hundred seventy nine records the following anecdote which he had from Diderot in seventeen eighty one Hume dina avec une grande

malheureux repondit l autre vous voici a table avec dix sept pour la premiere fois It was on the same day that Diderot related this that he said to Romilly Il faut sabrer la theologie twenty two The inference upon the whole is that it is not from the value or worth of the object which any person pursues that we can determine his enjoyment but merely from the passion with which he pursues it and the success which he meets with in his pursuit Objects have absolutely no worth or value in themselves They derive their worth merely from the passion If that be strong and steady and successful the person is happy It cannot reasonably be doubted but a little miss dressed in a new gown for a dancing school ball receives as complete enjoyment as the greatest orator who triumphs in the splendour of

Peregrine Langton BOSWELL fifty seven mister Langton did not disregard this counsel but wrote the following account which he has been pleased to communicate to me The circumstances of mister Peregrine Langton were these He had an annuity for life of two hundred pounds per annum He resided in a village in Lincolnshire the rent of his house with two or three small fields was twenty eight pounds the county he lived in was not more than moderately cheap his family consisted of a sister who paid him eighteen pounds annually for her board and a niece The servants were two maids and two men in livery His common way of living at his table was three or four dishes the appurtenances to his table were neat and handsome he frequently entertained company at dinner and then his table was well served with as many dishes as were usual at the tables of the other gentlemen in the neighbourhood His own appearance as to clothes was genteelly neat and plain He had always a post chaise and kept three horses Such with the resources I have mentioned was his way of living which he did not suffer to employ his whole income for he had always a sum of money lying by him for any extraordinary expences that might arise Some money he put into the stocks at his death the sum he had there amounted to one hundred and fifty pounds He purchased out of his income his household furniture and linen of which latter he had a very ample store and as I am assured by those that had very good means of knowing not less than the tenth part of his income was set apart for charity at the time of his death the sum of twenty five pounds was found with a direction to be employed in such uses He had laid down a plan of living proportioned to his income and did not practise any extraordinary degree of parsimony but endeavoured that in his family there should be plenty without waste as an instance that this was his endeavour it may be worth while to mention a method he took in regulating a proper allowance of malt liquor to be drunk in his family that there might not be a deficiency or any intemperate profusion On a complaint made that his allowance of a hogshead in a month was not enough for his own family he ordered the quantity of a hogshead to be put into bottles had it locked up from the servants and distributed out every day eight quarts which is the quantity each day at one hogshead in a month and told his servants that if that did not suffice he would allow them more but by this method it appeared at once that the allowance was much more than sufficient for his small family and this proved a clear conviction that could not be answered and saved all future dispute He was in general very diligently and punctually attended and obeyed by his servants he was very considerate as to the injunctions he gave and explained them distinctly and at their first coming to his service steadily exacted a close compliance with them without any remission and the servants finding this to be the case soon grew habitually accustomed to the practice of their business and then very little further attention was necessary On extraordinary instances of good behaviour or diligent service he was not wanting in particular encouragements and presents above their wages it is remarkable that he would permit their relations to visit them and stay at his house two or three days at a time fifty eight Of

poem it is stated that Miss Williams when before her blindness she was assisting mister Grey in his experiments was the first that observed the emission of the electrical spark from a human body The best lines are the following Now hoary Sage purse thy happy flight With swifter motion haste to purer light Where Bacon waits with Newton and with Boyle To hail thy genius and applaud thy toil Where

Johnson seems to be describing himself He certainly was in his early life a man of great literary curiosity and when he wrote his Essay on Criticism had for his age a very wide acquaintance with books When he entered into the living world it seems to have happened to him as to many others that he was less attentive to dead masters he studied in the academy of Paracelsus and made the universe his favourite volume His frequent references to history his allusions to various kinds of knowledge and his images selected from art and nature with his observations on the operations of the mind and the modes of life show an intelligence perpetually on the wing excursive vigorous and diligent eager to pursue knowledge and attentive to retain it See ante i fifty seven one hundred two Johnson thus describes Warburton Works viii two hundred eighty eight About this time seventeen thirty two Warburton began to make his appearance in the first ranks of learning He was a man of vigorous faculties a mind fervid and vehement supplied by incessant and unlimited enquiry with wonderful extent and variety of knowledge Cradock Memoirs i one hundred eighty eight says that Bishop Kurd always wondered where it was possible for Warburton to meet with certain anecdotes with which not only his conversation but likewise his writings abounded I could have readily informed him said missus Warburton for when we passed our winters in London he would often after his long and severe studies send out for a whole basketful of books from the circulating libraries and at times I have gone into his study and found him laughing though alone Lord Macaulay was in this respect the Warburton of our age one hundred three The reverend mister Strahan clearly recollects having been told by Johnson that the King observed that Pope made Warburton a Bishop True Sir said Johnson but Warburton did more for Pope he made him a Christian alluding no doubt to his ingenious Comments on the Essay on Man BOSWELL The statements both of the King and Johnson are supported by two passages in Johnson s Life of Pope Works viii two hundred eighty nine two hundred ninety He says of Warburton s Comments Pope who probably began to doubt the tendency of his own work was glad that the positions of which he perceived himself not to know the full meaning could by any mode of interpretation be made to mean well From this time Pope lived in the closest intimacy with his commentator and amply rewarded his kindness and his zeal for he introduced him to mister Murray by whose interest he became preacher at Lincoln s Inn and to mister Allen who gave him his niece and his estate and by consequence a bishoprick See also the account given by Johnson in Boswell s Hebrides Aug twenty one seventeen seventy three Bishop Law in his Revised Preface to Archbishop King s Origin of Evil seventeen eighty one p xvii writes I had now the satisfaction of seeing that those very principles which had been maintained by Archbishop King were adopted by mister Pope in his Essay on Man this I used to recollect and sometimes relate with pleasure conceiving that such an account did no less honour to the poet than to our philosopher but was soon made to understand that anything of that kind was taken highly amiss by one Warburton who had once held the doctrine of that same Essay to be rank atheism but afterwards turned a warm advocate for it and thought proper to deny the account above mentioned with heavy menaces against those who presumed to insinuate that Pope borrowed anything from any man whatsoever See post Oct ten

Joseph is made to hug his brother in his arms when he sees him descend safely from the balloon in which he had composed his Ode Thomas Warton is described in the same piece p one hundred sixteen as a

more afraid of this interview than doctor Johnson was and went to it as a schoolboy to his task But he did not want to have the trial repeated every day nor was it necessary The very jealousy of his self love marked his respect and if he thought the less of doctor Johnson he would have been more willing to risk the encounter Hazlitt s Conversations of Northcote p forty five It should seem that Johnson had a second interview with the King thirteen years later In seventeen eighty Hannah More records Memoirs i one hundred seventy four Johnson told me he had been with the King that morning who enjoined him to add Spenser to his Lives of the Poets It is strange that so far as I know this interview is not mentioned by any one else It is perhaps alluded to post Dec seventeen eighty four when mister Nichols told Johnson that he wished he would gratify his sovereign by a Life of Spenser one hundred eighteen It is proper here to mention that when I speak of his correspondence I consider it

when he first went the Northern Circuit about seventeen seventy six seventeen eighty he asked Jack Lee post March twenty seventeen seventy eight who was not scrupulous in his advocacy whether his method could be justified Oh yes he said undoubtedly doctor Johnson had said that counsel were at liberty to state as the parties themselves would state what it was most for their interest to state After some interval and when he had had his evening bowl of milk punch and two or three pipes of tobacco he suddenly said Come Master Scott let us go to bed I have been thinking upon the questions that you asked me and I am not quite so sure that the conduct you represented will bring a man peace at the last Lord Eldon after stating pretty nearly what Johnson had said continues But it may be

then with a letter I have been told how favourably your Lordship has spoken of me To correspond with a Paoli and with a Chatham is enough to keep a young man ever ardent in the pursuit of virtuous fame Chatham Corres iii two hundred forty six On the same day on which he wrote to Johnson he said in a letter to Temple Old General Oglethorpe who has come to see me and is with me often just on

simply strong facts but strong facts well arranged His lordship however knows too well the value of written documents to insist on setting his recollection against my notes taken at the time He does

upon this occasion was James Boswell esquire in the dress of an armed Corsican chief He entered the amphitheatre about twelve o clock On the front of his cap was embroidered in gold letters Viva La Liberta and on one side of it was a handsome blue feather and cockade so that it had an elegant as well as a warlike appearance He wore no mask saying that it was not proper for a gallant Corsican So soon as he came into the room he drew universal attention Cradock Memoirs i two hundred seventeen gives a melancholy account of the festival The preparations were all behind hand and the weather was stormy There was a masquerade in the evening and all zealous friends endeavoured to keep up the spirit of it as long as they could till they were at last informed that the Avon was rising so very fast that no delay could be admitted The ladies of our party were conveyed by planks from the building to the coach and found that the wheels had been two feet deep in water Garrick in seventeen seventy

Taxation no Tyranny under the noble title of Resistance no Rebellion Ib ii sixty eight two hundred seven See ante i one hundred eighty one two hundred eight In the Preface to my Account of Corsica published in seventeen sixty eight I thus express myself He who publishes a book affecting not to be an authour and professing an indifference for literary fame may possibly impose upon many people such an idea of his consequence as he wishes may be received For my part I should be proud to be known as an authour and I have an ardent ambition for literary fame for of all possessions I should imagine literary fame to be the most valuable A man who has been able to furnish a book which has been approved by the world has established himself as a respectable character in distant society without any danger of having that character lessened by the observation of his weaknesses To preserve an uniform dignity among those who see us every day is hardly possible and to aim at it must put us under the fetters of perpetual restraint The authour of an approved book may allow his natural disposition an easy play and yet indulge the pride of superior genius when he considers that by those who know him only as an authour he never ceases to be respected Such an authour when in his hours of gloom and discontent may have the consolation to think that his writings are at that very time giving pleasure to numbers and such an authour may cherish the hope of being remembered after death which has been a great object to the noblest minds in all ages BOSWELL His preface to the third edition thus ends When I first ventured to send this book into the world I fairly owned an ardent desire for literary fame I have obtained my desire and whatever clouds may overcast my days I can now walk here among the rocks and woods of my ancestors with an agreeable consciousness that I have done something worthy The dedication of the first edition and the preface of the third are both dated Oct twenty nine one seventeen sixty seven and the other seventeen sixty eight Oct twenty nine was his birthday two hundred nine Paoli s father had been one of the leaders of the Corsicans in their revolt against Genoa in seventeen thirty four Paoli himself was chosen by them as their General in chief in seventeen fifty five In seventeen sixty nine the island was conquered by the French He escaped in an English ship and settled in England Here he stayed till seventeen eighty nine when Mirabeau moved in the National Assembly the recall of all the Corsican patriots Paoli was thereupon appointed by Louis XVI Lieutenant general and military commandant in Corsica He resisted the violence of the Convention and was in consequence summoned before it Refusing to obey an expedition was sent to arrest him Napoleon Buonaparte fought in the French army but Paoli s party proved the stronger The islanders sought the aid of Great Britain and offered the crown of Corsica to George III The offer was accepted but by an act of incredible folly not Paoli but Sir Gilbert Eliot was made Viceroy Paoli returned to England where he died in eighteen oh seven at the age of eighty two In seventeen ninety six Corsica was abandoned by the English By the Revolution it ceased to be a conquered province having been formally declared an integral part of France At the present day the Corsicans are proud of being citizens of that great country no less proud however are they of Pascal Paoli and of the gallant struggle for independence of their forefathers two hundred ten According to the Ann Reg xii one hundred thirty two Paoli arrived in London on Sept twenty one He certainly was in London on Oct ten for on that day he was presented by Boswell to Johnson Yet Wesley records in his Journal iii

been with him from his youth up hath not sent him into England for nothing In the Public Advertiser for Oct four there is the following entry inserted no doubt by Boswell On Sunday last General Paoli accompanied by James Boswell esquire took an airing in Hyde Park in his coach Priors Goldsmith i four hundred fifty Horace Walpole writes Paoli s character had been so advantageously exaggerated by mister Boswell s enthusiastic and entertaining account of him that the Opposition were ready to incorporate him in the list of popular tribunes The Court artfully intercepted the project and deeming patriots of all nations equally corruptible bestowed a pension of Lone thousand a year on the unheroic fugitive Memoirs of the Reign of George III iii three hundred eighty seven two hundred eleven Johnson writes missus Piozzi Anec p two hundred twenty eight ridiculed a friend who looking out on Streatham Common from our windows lamented the enormous wickedness of the times because some bird catchers were busy there one fine Sunday morning While half the Christian world is permitted said Johnson to dance and sing and celebrate Sunday as a day of festivity how comes your puritanical spirit so offended with frivolous and empty deviations from exactness Whoever loads life with unnecessary scruples Sir continued he provokes the attention of others on his conduct and incurs the censure of singularity without reaping the reward of superior virtue See Boswell s Hebrides Aug twenty seventeen seventy three two hundred twelve The first edition of Hume s History of England was full of Scotticisms many of which he corrected in subsequent editions MALONE According to mister J H Burton Life of Hume ii seventy nine He appears to have earnestly solicited the aid of Lyttelton Mallet and others whose experience of English composition might enable them to detect Scotticisms mister Burton gives instances of alterations made in the second edition He says also that in none of his historical or philosophical writings does any expression used by him unless in those cases where a Scotticism has escaped his vigilance betray either the district or the county of his origin Ib i nine Hume was shown in manuscript Reid s Inquiry into the Human Mind Though it was an attack on his own philosophy yet in reading it he kept he says a watchful eye all along over the style so that he might

Imlac are less unhappy than we but they are not happy Human life is everywhere a state in which much is to be endured and little to be enjoyed Writing to missus Thrale from Skye Johnson said The traveller wanders through a naked desert gratified sometimes but rarely with the sight of cows and now and then finds a heap of loose stones and turf in a cavity between rocks where a being born with all those powers which education expands and all those sensations which culture refines is condemned to shelter itself from the wind and rain Philosophers there are who try to make themselves believe

voluntarily consign themselves to singularity affect to cross the roads of life because they know that they shall not be jostled and indulge a boundless gratification of will because they perceive that they shall be quietly obeyed Singularity is I think in its own nature universally and invariably displeasing Writing of Swift he says Works viii two hundred twenty three Whatever he did he seemed willing to do in a manner peculiar to himself without sufficiently considering that singularity as it implies a contempt of the general practice is a kind of defiance which justly provokes the

fencing match The alterations were received with general approbation beyond my most warm expectations Garrick Corres ii one hundred twenty six See ante ii seventy eight note four two hundred fifty nine This comparison between Shakespeare and Congreve is mentioned perhaps oftener than any passage in Boswell Almost as often as it is mentioned it may be seen that Johnson s real opinion is misrepresented or misunderstood A few passages from his writings will shew how he regarded the two men In the Life of Congreve Works viii thirty one he repeats what he says here If I were required to select from the whole mass of English poetry the most poetical paragraph I know not what I could prefer to an exclamation in The Mourning Bride Yet in writing of the same play he says In this play there is more bustle than sentiment the plot is busy and intricate and the events take hold on the attention but except a very few passages we are rather amused with noise and perplexed with stratagem than entertained with any true delineation of natural characters Ib p twenty six In the preface to his Shakespeare published four years before this conversation he almost answered Garrick by anticipation It was said of Euripides that every verse was a precept and it may be said of Shakespeare that from his works may be collected a system of civil and economical prudence Yet his real power is not shown in the splendour of particular passages but by the progress of his fable and the tenour of his dialogue and he that tries to recommend him by select quotations will succeed like the pedant in Hierocles who when he offered his house to sale carried a brick in his pocket as a specimen Ib v one hundred six Ignorant indeed is he who thinks that Johnson was insensible to Shakespeare s transcendent and unbounded genius to use the words that he himself applied to him The Rambler No one hundred fifty six It may be doubtful he writes whether from all his successors more maxims of theoretical knowledge or more rules of practical prudence can be collected than he alone has given to his country Works v one hundred thirty one He that has read Shakespeare with attention will

can give read every play from the first scene to the last with utter negligence of all his commentators When his fancy is once on the wing let it not stoop at correction or explanation Ib p one

poets had the largest and most comprehensive soul Ib p one hundred fifty three missus Piozzi records Anec p fifty eight that she forced Johnson one day in a similar humour to that in which he had

In spite of the gross nonsense that Voltaire has written about Shakespeare yet it was with justice that in a letter to Horace Walpole dated July fifteen seventeen sixty eight he said Je suis le

sixty six Of whom I acknowledge myself to be one considering it as a piece of the secondary or comparative species of criticism and not of that profound species which alone doctor Johnson would allow to be real criticism It is besides clearly and elegantly expressed and has done effectually what it professed to do namely vindicated Shakespeare from the misrepresentations of Voltaire and considering how many young people were misled by his witty though false observations missus Montagu s Essay was of service to Shakspeare with a certain class of readers and is therefore entitled to praise Johnson I am assured allowed the merit which I have stated saying with reference to Voltaire it is conclusive ad hominem BOSWELL That this dull essay which would not do credit to a clever school girl of seventeen should have had a fame of which the echoes have not yet quite died out can only be fully explained by missus Montagu s great wealth and position in society Contemptible as was her essay yet a saying of hers about Voltaire was clever He sent to the Academy an invective against Shakespeare that bears all the marks of passionate dotage missus Montagu happened to be present

friendship and continues Now of whom shall I proceed to speak Of whom but missus Montagu Having mentioned Shakespeare and Nature does not the name of Montagu force itself upon me Such were the

progress of a petition is well known An ejected placeman goes down to his county or his borough tells his friends of his inability to serve them and his constituents of the corruption of the Government His friends readily understand that he who can get nothing will have nothing to give They agree to proclaim a meeting meat and drink are plentifully provided a crowd is easily brought

must confess that I myself am never absent from a public execution When I first attended them I was shocked to the greatest degree I was in a manner convulsed with pity and terror and for several days but especially nights after I was in a very dismal situation Still however I persisted in attending them and by degrees my sensibility abated so that I can now see one with great composure I can account for this curiosity in a philosophical manner when I consider that death is the most awful object before every man whoever directs his thoughts seriously towards futurity Therefore it is that I feel an irresistible impulse to be present at every execution as I there behold the various effects of the near approach of death He maintains that the curiosity which impels people to be present at such affecting scenes is certainly a proof of sensibility not of callousness For it is observed that the greatest proportion of the spectators is composed of women See post June twenty three seventeen

the misrepresentation is not imputable to you Not having the book at hand I cannot specify the page but I suppose you will easily find it doctor Johnson says speaking of missus Thrale s family doctor Beattie sunk upon us that he was married or words to that purpose I am not sure that I understand sunk upon us which is a very uncommon phrase but it seems to me to imply and others I find have understood it in the same sense studiously concealed from us his being married Now Sir this was by no means the case I could have no motive to conceal a circumstance of which I never was nor can be ashamed and of which doctor Johnson seemed to think when he afterwards became acquainted with missus Beattie that I had as was true reason to be proud So far was I from concealing her that my wife had at that time almost as numerous an acquaintance in London as I had myself and was not very long after kindly invited and elegantly entertained at Streatham by mister and missus Thrale My request therefore is that you would rectify this matter in your new edition You are at liberty to make what use you please of this letter My best wishes ever attend you and your family Believe me to be with the utmost regard and esteem dear Sir Your obliged and affectionate humble servant J BEATTIE I have from my respect for my friend doctor Beattie and regard to his extreme sensibility inserted the foregoing letter though I cannot but wonder at his considering as any imputation a phrase commonly used among the best friends BOSWELL mister Croker says there was a cause for the extreme sensibility doctor Beattie was conscious that there was something that might give a colour to such an imputation It became known shortly after the date of this letter that the mind of missus Beattie had become

Character of John Lord Somers Baron of Evesham doctor Johnson here speaks only to the internal evidence I take leave to differ from him having a very high estimation of the powers of doctor Swift His Sentiments of a Church of England man his Sermon on the Trinity and other serious pieces prove his learning as well as his acuteness in logick and metaphysicks and his various compositions of a different cast exhibit not only wit humour and ridicule but a knowledge of nature and art and life a combination therefore of those powers when as the Apology says the authour was young his invention at the heighth and his reading fresh in his head might surely produce The Tale of a Tub BOSWELL nine hundred thirty five His Tale of a Tub has little resemblance to his other pieces It exhibits a vehemence and rapidity of mind a copiousness of images and vivacity of diction such as he afterwards never possessed or never exerted It is of a mode so distinct and peculiar that it must be considered by itself what is true of that is not true of anything else which he has written Johnson s Works viii two hundred twenty At the conclusion of the Life of Swift ib two hundred twenty eight Johnson allows him one great merit It was said in a preface to one of the Irish editions that Swift had never been known to take a single thought from any writer ancient or modern This is not literally true but perhaps no writer can easily be found that has borrowed so little or that in all his excellencies and all his defects has so well maintained his claim to be considered as original

degree This conduct Johnson calls perverseness of integrity Johnson s Works viii fifty four The question concerning the morality of taking oaths of whatever kind imposed by the prevailing power at the time rather than to be excluded from all consequence or even any considerable usefulness in society has been agitated with all the acuteness of casuistry It is related that he who devised the oath of abjuration profligately boasted that he had framed a test which should damn one half of the nation and starve the other Upon minds not exalted to inflexible rectitude or minds in which zeal for a party is predominant to excess taking that oath against conviction may have been palliated under the plea of necessity or ventured upon in heat as upon the whole producing more good than evil At a county election in Scotland many years ago when there was a warm contest between the friends of the Hanoverian succession and those against it the oath of abjuration having been demanded the

Johnson s sayings would not appear so extraordinary were it not for his bow wow way The sayings themselves are generally of sterling merit but doubtless his manner was an addition to their effect and

designation I once observed on his table a letter directed to him with the addition of Esquire and objected to it as being a designation inferiour to that of Doctor but he checked me and seemed

the highway immediately after being present at the representation of The Beggar s Opera I have been told of an ingenious observation by mister Gibbon that The Beggar s Opera may perhaps have sometimes increased the number of highwaymen but that it has had a beneficial effect in refining that class of men making them less ferocious more polite in short more like gentlemen Upon this mister Courtenay

required some philosophy to bear the change from England to Scotland The unpleasing tone the rude familiarity the barren conversation of those whom I found here in comparison with what I had left really hurt my feelings The General Assembly is sitting and I practise at its Bar There is de facto something low and coarse in such employment though on paper it is a Court of Supreme Judicature but

upon him and he is an independent man and all he has is his own and he is not used to such things Ib p two hundred twenty six An eye witness told mister Croker that Coulson was going out on a country living and talking of it with the same pomp as to Lord Stowell He had expressed to him his doubts whether after living so long in the great world he might not grow weary of the comparative retirement

Johnson concluded the debate by exclaiming emphatically Sir having meant you no offence I will make you no apology Ib p four hundred fifty eight The quarrel was made up for the next day he wrote Coulson and I are pretty well again Piozzi Letters i two hundred twenty nine eleven thirty six Boswell wrote to Temple on Sept two It is hardly credible how difficult it is for a man of my sensibility to support existence in the family where I now am My father whom I really both respect and affectionate if that is a word for it is a different feeling from that which is expressed by love which I can say of you from my soul is so different from me We divaricate so much as doctor Johnson said that I am often hurt when I dare say he means no harm and he has a method of treating me which makes me feel myself like a timid boy which to Boswell comprehending all that my character does in my own imagination and in that of a wonderful number of mankind is intolerable His wife too whom in my conscience I cannot condemn for any capital bad quality is so narrow minded and I don t know how so set upon keeping him under her own management and so suspicious and so sourishly tempered that it requires the utmost exertion of practical philosophy to keep myself quiet I however have done so all this week to admiration nay I have appeared good humoured but it has cost me drinking a

formidable list is given of the authors Greek and Latin that were read in Aldersgate street by youth between ten and fifteen or sixteen years of age Those who tell or receive these stories should consider that nobody can be taught faster than he can learn The speed of the horseman must be limited by the power of the horse He advised Boswell not to refine in the education of his children You must do as other people do Post iii one hundred sixty nine Yet in his Life of Barretier Works vi three hundred eighty he says The first languages which he learnt were the French German and Latin which he was taught not in the common way by a multitude of definitions rules and exceptions which fatigue the attention and burden the memory without any use proportionate to the time which they require and the disgust which they create The method by which he was instructed was easy and expeditious and therefore pleasing He learnt them all in the same manner and almost at the same time by conversing

Arblay he said Sir I shall be very glad to have a new sense put into me He had been wont to speak slightingly of music and musicians The first symptom that he showed of a tendency to conversion was upon hearing the following read aloud from the preface to doctor Burney s History of Music while it was yet in manuscript The love of lengthened tones and modulated sounds seems a passion implanted in human nature throughout the globe as we hear of no people however wild and savage in other particulars who have not music of some kind or other with which they seem greatly delighted Sir cried doctor Johnson after a little pause this assertion I believe may be right And then see sawing a minute or two on his chair he forcibly added All animated nature loves music except myself Dr Burney s Memoirs

positive pain to him Upon his hearing a celebrated performer go through a hard composition and hearing it remarked that it was very difficult he said I would it had been impossible Yet he had once

thus describes a journey by night in the Highlands Works ix lfifty five The wind was loud the rain was heavy and the whistling of the blast the fall of the shower the rush of the cataracts and the

acre in the kingdom might be bound up throughout all ages in favour of any heirs or any conditions that the caprice of each unfettered owner might be pleased to proscribe twelve forty As first the opinion of some distinguished naturalists that our species is transmitted through males only the female being all along no more than a nidus or nurse as Mother Earth is to plants of every sort which notion seems to be confirmed by that text of scripture He was yet in the loins of his FATHER when Melchisedeck met him Heb vii ten and consequently that a man s grandson by a daughter instead of being his surest descendant as is vulgarly said has in reality no connection whatever with his blood And secondly independent of this theory which if true should completely exclude heirs general that if the preference of a male to a female without regard to primogeniture as a son though much younger nay even a grandson by a son to a daughter be once admitted as it universally is it must be equally reasonable and proper in the most remote degree of descent from an original proprietor of an estate as in the nearest because however distant from the representative at the time that remote heir male upon the failure of those nearer to the original proprietor than he is becomes in fact the nearest male to him and is therefore preferable as his representative to a female descendant A little extension of mind will enable us easily to perceive that a son s son in continuation to whatever length of time is preferable to a son s daughter in the succession to an ancient inheritance in which regard should be had to the representation of the original proprietor and not to that of one of his descendants I am aware of Blackstone s admirable demonstration of the reasonableness of the legal succession upon the principle of there being the greatest probability that the nearest heir of the person who last dies proprietor of an estate is of the blood of the first purchaser But supposing a pedigree to be carefully authenticated through all its branches instead of mere probability there will be a certainty that the nearest heir male at whatever period has the same right of blood with the first heir male namely the original purchaser s eldest son Boswell twelve forty one Boswell wrote to Temple on Sept two seventeen seventy five What a discouraging reflection is it that my father has in his possession a renunciation of my birthright which I madly granted to him and which he has not the generosity to restore now that I am doing beyond his utmost hopes and that he may incommode and

gentleman commoner he writes I was admitted to the society of the fellows and fondly expected that some questions of literature would be the amusing and instructive topics of their discourse Their conversation stagnated in a round of college business Tory politics personal anecdotes and private scandal their dull and deep potations excused the brisk intemperance of youth and their constitutional toasts were not expressive of the most lively loyalty for the house of Hanover Gibbon s Misc Works i fifty three In Jesse s edition of White s Selborne p ii it is stated that White as long as his health allowed him always attended the annual election of Fellows at Oriel College where the gentlemen commoners were allowed the use of the common room after dinner This liberty they seldom availed themselves of except on the occasion of mister White s visits for such was his happy manner of telling a story that the room was always filled when he was there He died in seventeen ninety three twelve ninety nine So different are the colours of life as we look forward to the future or backward to the past and so different the opinions and sentiments which this contrariety of appearance naturally produces that the conversation of the old and young ends generally with contempt or pity on either side One generation is always the scorn and wonder of the other and the notions of the old and young are like liquors of different gravity and texture which never can unite The Rambler No sixty nine thirteen hundred It was said of a dispute between two mathematicians malim cum Scaligero errare quam cum Clavio recte sapere that it was more eligible to go wrong with one than right with the other A tendency of the same kind every mind must feel at the perusal of Dryden s

narrative begun with his pedigree and ended with his funeral The Rambler No sixty See post iii seventy one thirteen oh eight See post iii one hundred twelve thirteen oh nine It has been mentioned to me by an accurate English friend that doctor Johnson could never have used the phrase almost nothing as not being English and therefore I have put another in its place At the same time I am not quite convinced it is not good English For the best writers use the phrase Little or nothing i e almost so little as to be nothing BOSWELL Boswell might have left almost nothing in his text Johnson used it in his writings certainly twice It will add almost nothing to the expense Works v three hundred seven I have read little almost nothing Pr and Med p one hundred seventy six Moreover in a letter to missus Aston written on Nov five seventeen seventy nine Croker s Boswell p six hundred forty he says Nothing almost is purchased In King Lear act ii sc two we have Nothing almost sees miracles But

Dodsley is how little apt to forget or disguise his having been a footman Johnson seems to refer to Dodsley in the following passage written in seventeen fifty six Works v three hundred fifty eight The last century imagined that a man composing in his chariot was a new object of curiosity but how much would the wonder have been increased by a footman studying behind it thirteen fourteen See ante

seventy three thirteen sixteen Two days earlier Hume congratulated Gibbon on the first volume of his Decline and Fall I own that if I had not previously had the happiness of your personal acquaintance such a performance from an Englishman in our age would have given me some surprise You may smile at this sentiment but as it seems to me that your countrymen for almost a whole generation have given themselves up to barbarous and absurd faction and have totally neglected all polite letters I no longer expected any valuable production ever to come from them J H Burton s Hume ii four hundred eighty four thirteen seventeen Five weeks later Boswell used a different metaphor I think it is right that as fast as infidel wasps or venomous insects whether creeping or flying are hatched they should be crushed Letters of Boswell p two hundred thirty two If the infidels were wasps to the orthodox the orthodox were hornets to the infidels Gibbon wrote Misc Works i two hundred seventy three The freedom of my writings has indeed provoked an implacable tribe but as I was safe from the stings I was soon accustomed to the buzzing of the hornets thirteen eighteen Macaulay thus examines this report Essays i three hundred sixty To what then it has been asked could Johnson allude Possibly to some anecdote or some conversation of which all trace is lost One conjecture may be offered though with diffidence Gibbon tells us in his memoirs Misc Works i fifty six that at Oxford he took a fancy for studying Arabic and was prevented from doing so by the remonstrances of his tutor Soon after this the young man fell in with Bossuet s controversial writings and was speedily converted by them to the Roman Catholic faith The apostasy of a gentleman commoner would of course be for a time the chief subject of conversation in the common room of Magdalene His whim about Arabic learning would naturally be mentioned and would give occasion to some jokes about the probability of his turning Mussulman If such jokes were made Johnson who frequently visited Oxford was very likely to hear of them Though Gibbon s Autobiography ends with the year seventeen eighty eight yet he wrote portions of it I believe after the publication of the Life of Johnson See ante ii eight note one I have little doubt that in the following lines he refers to the attack thus made on him by Boswell and Johnson Many years afterwards when the name of Gibbon was become as notorious as that of Middleton it was industriously whispered at Oxford that the historian had formerly turned Papist my character stood exposed to the reproach of inconstancy Gibbon s Misc Works i sixty five thirteen nineteen Steele in his Apology for Himself and his Writings ed seventeen fourteen p eighty says of himself He first became an author when an ensign of the Guards a way of life exposed to much irregularity and being thoroughly convinced of many things of which he often repented and which he more often repeated he writ for his own private use a little book called the Christian Hero with a design principally to fix upon his own mind a strong impression of virtue and religion in opposition to a stronger propensity towards unwarrantable pleasures This secret admonition was too weak he therefore printed the book with his name in hopes that a standing testimony against himself and the eyes of the world that is to say of his acquaintance upon him in a new light might curb his desires and make him ashamed of understanding and seeming to feel what was virtuous and living so quite contrary a life thirteen twenty A man no doubt is Boswell himself thirteen twenty one I was sure when I read it that the preface to Baretti s Dialogues was doctor Johnson s and that I made him confess Baretti s Dialogues What are they about A thimble and a spoon and a knife and a fork They are the most absurd and yet the most laughable things you ever saw They were written for Miss Thrale and all the dialogues are between her and him except now and then a shovel and a poker or a goose and a chair happen to step in Mme D Arblay s Diary ii two hundred sixty three thirteen twenty two April four seventeen sixty At present nothing is talked of nothing admired but what I cannot help calling a very insipid and tedious performance it is a kind of novel called The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy the great humour of which consists in the whole narration always going backwards Walpole s Letters iii two hundred ninety eight March seven seventeen sixty one The second and third volumes of Tristram Shandy the dregs of nonsense have universally met the contempt they deserve Ib three hundred eighty two My good friend said doctor Farmer ante i three hundred sixty eight one day in the parlour at Emanuel College you young men seem very fond of this Tristram Shandy but mark my words however much it may be talked about at present yet depend upon it in the course of twenty years should any one wish to refer to it he will be

the Perreaus and the popular fancy had taken the part of the woman as against the men They were convicted and hanged protesting their innocence Letters of Boswell pp two hundred twenty three two

publick house called for what I wanted with the tone which one uses in calling to the waiters at a tavern I did so at Pino asking for a variety of things at once when Signora Tomasi perceiving my mistake looked in my face and smiled saying with much calmness and good nature una cosa dopo un altra Signore One thing after another Sir Boswell s Corsica ed eighteen seventy nine p one hundred fifty

There is however to be found in his bulky tome p eighty seven a very excellent one upon this subject In contradiction to those who having a wife and children prefer domestick enjoyments to those which a tavern affords I have heard him assert that a tavern chair was the throne of human felicity As soon said he as I enter the door of a tavern I experience an oblivion of care and a freedom from solicitude when I am seated I find the master courteous and the servants obsequious to my call anxious to know and ready to supply my wants wine there exhilarates my spirits and prompts me to free conversation and an interchange of discourse with those whom I most love I dogmatise and am contradicted and in this conflict of opinions and sentiments I find delight BOSWELL thirteen thirty two We happened to lie this night at the inn at Henley where Shenstone wrote these lines BOSWELL I give them as they are found in the corrected edition of his Works published after his death In Dodsley s

viii four hundred six tells the following ludicrous story of The Fleece Dodsley the bookseller was one day mentioning it to a critical visitor with more expectation of success than the other could easily admit In the conversation the author s age was asked and being represented as advanced in life He will said the critic be buried in woollen To encourage the trade in wool an Act was passed requiring the dead to be buried in woollen Burke refers to this when he says of Lord Chatham who was swathed in flannel owing to the gout Like a true obeyer of the laws he will be buried in woollen Burke s Corres ii two hundred one Hawkins Life p two hundred thirty one says A portrait of Samuel Dyer see post seventeen eighty in mister Langton s Collection was painted by Sir Joshua and from it a mezzotinto was scraped the print whereof as he was little known sold only to his friends A singular use was made of it Bell the publisher of The English Poets caused an engraving to be made from it and prefixed it to the poems of mister John Dyer thirteen thirty eight Such is this little laughable incident which has been often related doctor Percy the Bishop of Dromore who was an intimate friend of doctor Grainger and has a particular regard for his memory has communicated to me the following explanation The passage in question was originally not liable to such a perversion for the authour having occasion in that part of his work to mention the havock made by rats and mice had introduced the subject in a kind of mock heroick and a parody of Homer s battle of the frogs and mice invoking the Muse of the old Grecian bard in an elegant and well turned manner In that state I had seen it but afterwards unknown to me and other friends he had been persuaded contrary to his own better judgement to alter it so as to produce the unlucky effect above mentioned The above was written by the Bishop when he had not the Poem itself to recur to and though the account given was true of it at one period yet as doctor Grainger afterwards altered the passage in question the remarks in the text do not now apply to the printed poem The Bishop gives this character of doctor Grainger He was not only a man of genius and learning but had many excellent virtues being one of the most generous friendly and benevolent men I ever knew BOSWELL thirteen thirty nine doctor Johnson said to me Percy Sir was angry with me for laughing at The Sugar cane for he had a mind to make a great thing of Grainger s rats BOSWELL Johnson helped Percy in writing a review of this poem in seventeen sixty four ante i

at the suggestion of the late mister George Dawson marking the spot where Edmund Hector was the host Samuel Johnson the guest This tablet together with the wainscoting the door and the mantelpiece of one of the rooms was set up in Aston Hall at the Johnson Centenary in a room that is to be known as doctor Johnson s Room thirteen forty four My worthy friend mister Langton to whom I am under innumerable obligations in the course of my Johnsonian History has furnished me with a droll illustration about this question An honest carpenter after giving some anecdote in his presence of the ill treatment which he had received from a clergyman s wife who was a noted termagant and whom he accused of unjust dealing in some transaction with him added I took care to let her know what I thought of her And being asked What did you say answered I told her she was a scoundrel BOSWELL thirteen forty five As to the baptism of infants it is a mere human tradition for which neither precept nor

am afraid to forget the world and content to be forgotten by it to repose in that sullen sensuality into which men naturally sink who think disease a justification of indulgence and converse only with those who hope to prosper by indulging them Infirmity will come but let us not invite it indulgence will allure us but let us turn resolutely away Time cannot always be defeated but let us not yield
