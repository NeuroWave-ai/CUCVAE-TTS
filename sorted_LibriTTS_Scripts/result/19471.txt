922_132299_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Then he shrugged 
922_132300_000043_000000	train-clean-360	he shrugged 
none	none	and threaded his way through the narrow aisles toward the attendant Better get a doctor he said bitterly when the young punk looked up at him You ve got a man dying of space stomach on two hundred fourteen The sneer on the kid s face deepened Yeah We don t pay for doctors every time some wino wants to throw up Forget it and get back where you belong bo You ll have a corpse on your hands in an hour Feldman insisted I know space stomach damn it The kid turned back to his lottery sheet Go treat yourself if you wanta play doctor Go on scram before I toss you out in the snow One of Feldman s white knuckled hands reached for the attendant 
922_132299_000045_000003	train-clean-360	Then he caught himself 
none	none	He started to turn back hesitated and finally faced the kid again I m not fooling And I was a doctor he stated My name is Daniel Feldman The attendant nodded absently until the words finally penetrated He looked up studied Feldman with surprised curiosity and growing contempt and reached for the phone Gimme Medical Directory he muttered Feldman felt the kid s eyes on his back as he stumbled through the aisles to his cot again He slumped down rolling another cigarette in hands that shook The sick man was approaching delirium now and the moans were mixed with weak whining sounds of fear Other men had wakened and were watching but nobody made a move to help The retching and writhing of the sick man had begun to weaken but it was still not too late to save him Hot water and skillful massage could interrupt the paroxysms In fifteen minutes Feldman could have stopped the attack completely He found his feet on the floor and his hands already reaching out Savagely he pulled himself back Sure he could save the man and wind up in the gas chamber There d be no mercy for his second offense against 
922_132291_000004_000000	train-clean-360	Lobby
none	none	 laws If the spaceman lived Feldman might get off with a flogging that was standard punishment for a pariah who stepped out of line But with his luck there would be a heart arrest and another juicy story for the papers 
922_132291_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Idealism 
none	none	The Medical Lobby made a lot out of the word But it wasn t for him A pariah had no business thinking of others As Feldman sat there staring the spaceman grew quieter Sometimes even at this stage massage could help It was harder without liberal supplies of hot water but the massage was the really important treatment It was the trembling of Feldman s hands that stopped him He no longer had the strength or the certainty to make the massage effective He was glaring at his hands in self disgust when the legal doctor arrived The man was old and tired Probably he had been another idealist who had wound up defeated content to leave things up to the established procedures of the Medical Lobby He looked it as he bent over the dying man The doctor turned back at last to the attendant Too late The best I can do is ease his pain The call should have been made half an hour earlier He had obviously never handled space stomach before He administered a hypo that probably held narconal Feldman watched his guts tightening sympathetically for the shock that would be to the sick man But at least it would shorten his sufferings The final seizure lasted only a minute or so Hopeless the doctor said His eyes were clouded for a moment and then he shrugged Well I ll make out a death certificate Anyone here know his name His eyes swung about the cots until they came to rest on Feldman He frowned and a twisted smile curved his lips Feldman isn t it You still look something like your pictures Do you know the deceased 
922_132299_000021_000000	train-clean-360	Feldman shook his head 
none	none	bitterly No
922_132300_000043_000001	train-clean-360	 I don t know 
none	none	his name I don t even know why he wasn t cyanotic at the end if it was space stomach Do you doctor The old man threw a startled glance at the corpse Then he shrugged and nodded to the attendant Well go through his things If he still has a space ticket I can get his name from that The kid began pawing through the bag that had fallen from the cot He dragged out a pair of shoes half a bottle of cheap rum a wallet and a bronze space ticket He wasn t quick enough with the wallet and the doctor took it from him Medical Lobby authorization If he has any money it covers my fee and the rest goes to his own Lobby There were several bills all of large denominations He turned the ticket over and began filling in the death certificate Arthur Billings Space Lobby Crewman Cause of death idiopathic gastroenteritis and delirium tremens There had been no evidence of delirium tremens but apparently the doctor felt he had scored a point He tossed the space ticket toward the shoes closed his bag and prepared to leave Hey doc The attendant s voice was indignant Hey what about my reporting fee The doctor stopped He glanced at the kid then toward Feldman his face a mixture of speculation and dislike He took a dollar bill from the wallet That s right he admitted The fee for reporting a solvent case Medical Lobby rules apply even to a man who breaks them The kid s hand was out but the doctor dropped the dollar onto Feldman s cot There s your fee pariah He left forcing the protesting attendant to precede him Feldman reached for the bill It was blood money for letting a man die but it meant cigarettes and food or shelter for another night if he could get a mission meal He no longer could afford pride Grimly he pocketed the bill staring at the face of the dead man It looked back sightlessly now showing a faint speckling of tiny dots They caught Feldman s eyes and he bent closer There should be no black dots on the skin of a man who died of space stomach And there should have been cyanosis He swore and bent down to find the wrecks of his shoes He couldn t worry about anything now but getting away from here before the attendant made trouble His eyes rested on the shoes of the dead man sturdy boots that would last for another year They could do the corpse no good someone else would steal them if he didn t But he hesitated cursing himself The right boot fitted better than he could have expected but something got in the way as he tried to put the left one on His fingers found the bronze ticket He turned it over considering it He wasn t ready to fraud his identity for what he d heard of life on the spaceships yet But he shoved it into his pocket and finished lacing the boots Outside the snow was still falling but it had turned to slush and the sidewalk was soggy underfoot There was going to be no work shoveling snow he realized This would melt before the day was over Feldman hunched the suitcoat up shivering as the cold bit into him The boots felt good though if he d had socks they would have been completely comfortable He passed a cheap restaurant and the smell of the synthetics set his stomach churning It had been two days since his last real meal and the dollar burned in his pocket But he had to wait There was a fair chance this early that he could scavenge something edible He shuffled on After a while the cold bothered him less and he passed through the hunger spell He rolled another smoke and sucked at it hardly thinking It was better that way It was much later when the big caduceus set into the sidewalk snapped him back to awareness of where he d traveled His undirected feet had led him much too far uptown following old habits This was the Medical Lobby building where he d spent more than enough time including three weeks in custody before they stripped him of all rank and status His eyes wandered to the ornate entrance where he d first emerged as a pariah He d meant to walk down those steps as if he were still a man But each step had drained his resolution until he d finally covered his face and slunk off knowing himself for what the world had branded him He stood there now staring at the smug young medical politicians and the tired old general practitioners filing in and out One of the latter halted fumbled in his pocket and drew out a quarter Merry Christmas he said dully Feldman fingered the coin Then he saw a gray Medical policeman watching him and he knew it was time to move on Sooner or later someone would recognize him here He clutched the quarter and turned to look for a coffee shop that sold the synthetics to which his metabolism had been switched No shop would serve him here but he could buy coffee and a piece of cake to take out A flurry of motion registered from the corner of his eye and he glanced back Taxi Taxi The girl rushing down the steps had a clear soprano voice cultured and commanding The gray Medical uniform seemed molded to her shapely figure and her red hair glistened in the lights of the street Her snub nose and determined mouth weren t the current fashion but nobody stopped to think of fashions when they saw her She didn t have to be the daughter of the president of Medical Lobby to rule It was Chris Chris Feldman once and now Chris Ryan again Feldman swung toward a cab For a moment his attitude was automatic and assured and the cab stopped before the driver noticed his clothes He picked up the bag Chris dropped and swung it onto the front seat She was fumbling in her change purse as he turned back to shut the door Thank you my good man she said She could be gracious even to a pariah when his homage suited her She dropped two quarters into his hand raising her eyes Recognition flowed into them followed by icy shock She yanked the cab door shut and shouted something to the driver The cab took off with a rush that left Feldman in a backwash of slush and mud He glanced down at the coins in his hand It was his lucky day he thought bitterly He moved across the street and away not bothering about the squeal of brakes and the honking horns He looked back only once toward the glowing sign that topped the building Your health is our business Then the great symbol of the health business faded behind him and he stumbled on sucking incessantly at the cigarettes he rolled One hand clutched the bronze badge belonging to the dead man and his stolen boots drove onward through the melting snow It was Christmas in the year twenty one hundred on the protectorate of Earth II Lobby 
922_132291_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Feldman had set his legs the problem of heading for the great spaceport and escape from Earth and he let them take him without further guidance 
922_132291_000005_000001	train-clean-360	His mind was wrapped up in a whirl of the past his past and that of the whole planet 
none	none	Both pasts had in common the growth and sudden ruin of idealism Idealism 
922_132291_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Throughout history some men had sought the ideal and most had called it freedom 
922_132291_000006_000002	train-clean-360	Only fools expected absolute freedom but wise men dreamed up many systems of relative freedom including democracy They had tried that in America as the last fling of the dream 
922_132291_000006_000003	train-clean-360	It had been a good attempt too 
922_132291_000007_000000	train-clean-360	The men who drew the Constitution had been pretty practical dreamers They came to their task after a bitter war and a worse period of wild chaos and they had learned where idealism stopped and idiocy began They set up a republic with all the elements of democracy that they considered safe 
none	none	It had worked well enough to make America the number one power of the world 
922_132291_000007_000002	train-clean-360	But the men who followed the framers of the new plan were a different sort without the knowledge of practical limits 
922_132291_000008_000000	train-clean-360	The privileges their ancestors had earned in blood and care became automatic rights 
922_132291_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Practical men tried to explain that there were no such rights that each generation had to pay for its rights with responsibility 
922_132291_000008_000002	train-clean-360	That kind of talk didn t get far 
922_132291_000008_000003	train-clean-360	People wanted to hear about rights not about duties 
none	none	They took the phrase that all men were created equal and left out the implied kicker that equality was in the sight of God and before the law They wanted an equality with the greatest men without giving up their drive toward mediocrity and they meant to have it 
922_132291_000009_000001	train-clean-360	In a way they got it 
922_132291_000010_000000	train-clean-360	They got the vote extended to everyone 
922_132291_000010_000001	train-clean-360	The man on subsidy or public dole could vote to demand more 
922_132291_000010_000002	train-clean-360	The man who read of nothing beyond sex crimes could vote on the great political issues of the world 
922_132291_000010_000003	train-clean-360	No ability was needed for his vote 
922_132291_000010_000004	train-clean-360	In fact he was assured that voting alone was enough to make him a fine and noble citizen 
none	none	He loved that if he bothered to vote at all that year 
922_132291_000010_000006	train-clean-360	He became a great man by listing his unthought hungry desire for someone to take care of him without responsibility 
922_132291_000010_000007	train-clean-360	So he went out and voted for the man who promised him most or who looked most like what his limited dreams felt to be a father image or son image or hero image 
922_132291_000010_000008	train-clean-360	He never bothered later to see how the men he d elected had handled the jobs he had given them 
922_132291_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Someone had to look of course and someone did 
922_132291_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Organized special interests stepped in where the mob had failed 
922_132291_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Lobbies grew up 
922_132291_000011_000003	train-clean-360	There had always been pressure groups but now they developed into a third arm of the government 
922_132291_000012_000000	train-clean-360	The old Farm Lobby was unbeatable 
922_132291_000012_000001	train-clean-360	The big farmers shaped the laws they wanted 
922_132291_000012_000002	train-clean-360	They convinced the little farmers it was for the good of all and they made the story stick well enough to swing the farm vote 
922_132291_000012_000003	train-clean-360	They made the laws when it came to food and crops 
922_132291_000013_000000	train-clean-360	The last of the great lobbies was Space probably 
922_132291_000013_000001	train-clean-360	It was an accident that grew up so fast it never even knew it wasn t a real part of the government 
922_132291_000013_000002	train-clean-360	It developed during a period of chaos when another country called Russia got the first hunk of metal above the atmosphere and when the representatives who had been picked for everything but their grasp of science and government went into panic over a myth of national prestige 
922_132291_000014_000000	train-clean-360	The space effort was turned over to the aircraft industry which had never been able to manage itself successfully except under the stimulus of war or a threat of war 
922_132291_000014_000001	train-clean-360	The failing airplane industry became the space combine overnight and nobody kept track of how big it was except a few sharp operators 
922_132291_000015_000000	train-clean-360	They worked out a system of subcontracts that spread the profits so wide that hardly a company of any size in the country wasn t getting a share Thus a lot of patriotic noble voters got their pay from companies in the lobby block and could be panicked by the lobby at the first mention of recession 
922_132291_000016_000000	train-clean-360	So Space Lobby took over completely in its own field 
922_132291_000016_000001	train-clean-360	It developed enough pressure to get whatever appropriations it wanted even over Presidential veto 
922_132291_000016_000002	train-clean-360	It created the only space experts which meant that the men placed in government agencies to regulate it came from its own ranks 
922_132291_000017_000000	train-clean-360	The other lobbies learned a lot from Space 
922_132291_000018_000000	train-clean-360	There had been a medical lobby long before but it had been a conservative group mostly concerned with protecting medical autonomy and ethics 
922_132291_000018_000001	train-clean-360	It also tried to prevent government control of treatment and payment feeling that it couldn t trust the people to know where to stop 
922_132291_000018_000002	train-clean-360	But its history was a long series of retreats 
922_132291_000019_000000	train-clean-360	It fought what it called socialized medicine 
922_132291_000019_000001	train-clean-360	But the people wanted their troubles handled free which meant by government spending since that could be added to the national debt and thus didn t seem to cost anything 
none	none	It lost and eventually the government paid most medical costs with doctors working on a fixed fee 
922_132291_000019_000003	train-clean-360	Then quantity of treatment paid rather than quality 
922_132291_000019_000004	train-clean-360	Competence no longer mattered so much 
922_132291_000019_000005	train-clean-360	The Lobby lost but didn t know it because the lowered standards of competence in the profession lowered the caliber of men running the political aspects of that profession as exemplified by the Lobby 
922_132291_000020_000000	train-clean-360	It took a world wide plague to turn the tide 
922_132291_000020_000001	train-clean-360	The plague began in old China anything could start there with more than a billion people huddled in one area and a few madmen planning to conquer the world 
none	none	It might have been a laboratory mutation but nobody could ever prove it 
922_132291_000021_000000	train-clean-360	It wiped out two billion people depopulated Africa and most of Asia and wrecked Europe leaving only America comparatively safe to take over 
922_132291_000021_000001	train-clean-360	An obscure scientist in one of the laboratories run by the Medical Lobby found a cure before the first waves of the epidemic hit America Rutherford Ryan then head of the Lobby made sure that Medical Lobby got all the credit 
922_132291_000022_000000	train-clean-360	By the time the world recovered America ran it and the Medical Lobby was untouchable 
922_132291_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Ryan made a deal with Space Lobby and the two effectively ran the world 
922_132291_000022_000002	train-clean-360	None of the smaller lobbies could buck them and neither could the government 
922_132291_000023_000000	train-clean-360	There was still a president and a congress as there had been a Senate under the Roman Caesars 
none	none	But the two Lobbies ran themselves as they chose 
922_132291_000023_000002	train-clean-360	The real government had become a kind of oligarchy as it always did after too much false democracy ruined the ideals of real and practical self rule 
922_132291_000023_000003	train-clean-360	A man belonged to his Lobby just as a serf had belonged to his feudal landlord 
922_132291_000024_000000	train-clean-360	It was a safe world now 
922_132291_000024_000001	train-clean-360	Maybe progress had been halted at about the level of nineteen eighty but so long as the citizens didn t break the rules of their lobbies they had very little to worry about 
922_132291_000024_000002	train-clean-360	For that for security and the right not to think most people were willing to leave well enough alone 
922_132291_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Some rules seemed harsh of course such as the law that all operations had to be performed in Lobby hospitals 
922_132291_000025_000001	train-clean-360	But that could be justified it was the only safe kind of surgery and the only way to make sure there was no unsupervised experimentation such as that which supposedly caused the plague 
922_132291_000025_000002	train-clean-360	The rule was now an absolute ethic of medicine 
922_132291_000025_000003	train-clean-360	It also made for better fees 
922_132291_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Feldman s father had stuck by the rule but had questioned it 
922_132291_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Feldman learned not to question in medical school 
922_132291_000026_000002	train-clean-360	He scored second in Medical Ethics only to Christina Ryan 
922_132291_000027_000000	train-clean-360	He had never figured why she singled him out for her attentions but he gloried in both those attentions and the results 
922_132291_000027_000001	train-clean-360	He became automatically a rising young man the favorite of the daughter of the Lobby president 
922_132291_000027_000002	train-clean-360	He went through internship without a sign of trouble Chris humored him in his desire to spend three years of practice in a poor section loaded with disease and her father approved such selfless dedication was the perfect image projection for a future son in law 
922_132291_000027_000003	train-clean-360	In return he agreed to follow that period by becoming an administrator 
922_132291_000027_000004	train-clean-360	A doctor s doctor as they put it 
922_132291_000028_000000	train-clean-360	They were married in April and his office was ready in May complete with a staff of eighty 
922_132291_000028_000001	train-clean-360	The publicity releases had gone out and the Public Relations Lobby that handled news and education was paid to begin the greatest build up any young genius ever had 
922_132291_000029_000000	train-clean-360	They celebrated that with a little party of some four hundred people and reporters at Ryan s lodge in Canada 
922_132291_000029_000001	train-clean-360	It was to be a gala weekend 
922_132291_000030_000000	train-clean-360	It was then that Baxter shot himself 
922_132291_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Baxter had been Feldman s closest friend in the Lobby 
922_132291_000031_000001	train-clean-360	He d come along to handle press relations and had gotten romantic about the countryside never having been out of a city before 
922_132291_000031_000002	train-clean-360	He hired a guide and went hunting eighty miles beyond the last outpost of civilization 
922_132291_000031_000003	train-clean-360	Somehow he got his hand on a gun though only guides were supposed to touch them managed to overcome its safety devices and then pulled the trigger with the gun pointed the wrong way 
922_132291_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Chris Feldman and Harnett from Public Relations had accompanied him on the trip 
922_132291_000032_000001	train-clean-360	They were sitting in a nearby car while Feldman enjoyed the scenery Chris made further plans and Harnett gathered material 
922_132291_000032_000002	train-clean-360	There was also a photographer and writer but they hadn t been introduced by name 
922_132291_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Feldman reached Baxter first 
922_132291_000033_000001	train-clean-360	The man was moaning and scared and he was bleeding profusely 
922_132291_000033_000002	train-clean-360	Only a miracle had saved him from instant death 
922_132291_000033_000003	train-clean-360	The bullet had struck a rib been deflected and robbed of some of its energy and had barely reached the heart 
922_132291_000033_000004	train-clean-360	But it had pierced the pericardium as best Feldman could guess and it could be fatal at any moment 
922_132291_000034_000000	train-clean-360	He d reached for a probe without thinking 
922_132291_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Chris knocked his hand aside 
922_132291_000035_000000	train-clean-360	She was right of course 
922_132291_000035_000001	train-clean-360	He couldn t operate outside a hospital 
922_132291_000035_000002	train-clean-360	But they had no phone in the lodge where the guide lived and no way to summon an ambulance 
922_132291_000035_000003	train-clean-360	They d have to drive Baxter back in the car which would almost certainly result in his death 
922_132291_000036_000000	train-clean-360	When Feldman seemed uncertain Harnett had given his warning in a low but vehement voice 
922_132291_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 You touch him Dan and I ll spread it in every one of our media 
922_132291_000036_000002	train-clean-360	I ll have to 
none	none	It s the only way to retain public confidence 
922_132291_000036_000004	train-clean-360	There d be a leak with all the guides and others here and we can t afford that 
922_132291_000036_000005	train-clean-360	I like you you have color 
922_132291_000036_000006	train-clean-360	But touch that wound and I ll crucify you 
922_132291_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Chris added her own threats 
922_132291_000037_000001	train-clean-360	She d spent years making him the outlet for all her ambitions denied because women were still only second rate members of Medical Lobby 
922_132291_000037_000002	train-clean-360	She couldn t let it go now 
922_132291_000037_000003	train-clean-360	And she was probably genuinely shocked 
922_132291_000038_000000	train-clean-360	Baxter groaned again and started to bleed more profusely 
922_132291_000039_000000	train-clean-360	There wasn t much equipment 
922_132291_000039_000001	train-clean-360	Feldman operated with a pocketknife sterilized in a bottle of expensive Scotch and only anodyne tablets in place of anesthesia 
922_132291_000039_000002	train-clean-360	He got the bullet out and sewed up the wound with a bit of surgical thread he d been using to tie up a torn good luck emblem 
none	none	The photographer and writer recorded the whole thing 
922_132291_000039_000004	train-clean-360	Chris swore harshly and beat her fists against the bole of a tree 
922_132291_000039_000005	train-clean-360	But Baxter lived 
none	none	He recovered completely and was shocked at the heinous thing that had been done to him They crucified Feldman III Spaceman Most crewmen lived rough ugly lives and usually short ones Passengers and officers on the big tubs were given the equivalent of gravity in spinning compartments but the crews rode free The lucky crewmen lived through their accidents got space stomach now and then and recovered Nobody cared about the others Feldman s ticket was work stamped for the Navaho and nobody questioned his identity He suffered through the agony of acceleration on the shuttle up to the orbital station then was sick as acceleration stopped But he was able to control himself enough to follow other crewmen down a hall of the station toward the Navaho The big ships never touched a planet always docking at the stations A checker met the crew and reached for their badges He barely glanced at them punched a mark for each on his checkoff sheet and handed them back Deckmen forward tubemen to the rear he ordered Navaho blasts in fifteen minutes Hey you You re tubes Feldman grunted He should have expected it Tubemen had the lowest lot of all the crew Between the killing work the heat of the tubes and occasional doses of radiation their lives weren t worth the metal value of their tickets He began pulling himself clumsily along a shaft dodging freight the loaders were tossing from hand to hand A bag hit his head drawing blood and another caught him in the groin Watch it bo a loader yelled at him You dent that bag and they ll brig you Cantcha see it s got a special courtesy stripe It had a brilliant green stripe he saw It also had a name printed in block letters that shouted their identity before he could read the words Dr Christina Ryan Southport Mars And he d had to choose this time to leave Earth Suddenly he was glad he was assigned to the tubes It was the one place on the ship where he d be least likely to run into her As a doctor and a courtesy passenger she d have complete run of the ship but she d hardly bother with the dangerous and unpleasant tube section He dragged his way back beginning to sweat with the effort The Navaho was an old ship A lot of the handholds were missing and he had to throw himself along by erratic leaps He was gaining proficiency but not enough to handle himself if the ship blasted off Time was growing short when he reached the aft bunkroom where the other tubemen were waiting Ben one husky introduced himself Tube chief Know how to work this Feldman could see that they were assembling a small still He d heard of the phenomenal quantities of beer spacemen drank and now he realized what really happened to it Hard liquor was supposed to be forbidden but they made their own I can work it he decided I m uh Dan Okay Dan Ben glanced at the clock Hit the sacks boys By the time Feldman could settle into the sacklike hammock the Navaho began to shake faintly and weight piled up It was mild compared to that on the shuttle since the big ships couldn t take high acceleration Space had been conquered for more than a century but the ships were still flimsy tubs that took months to reach Mars using immense amounts of fuel Only the valuable plant hormones from Mars made commerce possible at the ridiculously high freight rate Three hours later he began to find out why spacemen didn t seem to fear dying or turning pariah The tube quarters had grown insufferably hot during the long blast but the main tube room was blistering as Ben led the men into it The chief handed out spacesuits and motioned for Dan Greenhorn aincha Okay I ll take you with me We go out in the tubes and pull the lining I pry up the stuff you carry it back here and stack it They sealed off the tube room pumped out the air and went into the steaming mildly radioactive tubes just big enough for a man on hands and knees Beyond the tube mouth was empty space waiting for the man who slipped Ben began ripping out the eroded blocks with a special tool Feldman carried them back and stacked them along with others A plasma furnace melted them down into new blocks The work grew progressively worse as the distance to the tube room increased The tube mouth yawned closer and closer There were no handholds there only the friction of a man s body in the tube Life settled into a dull routine of labor sleep and the brief relief of the crude white mule from the still They were six weeks out and almost finished with the tube cleaning when Number Two tube blew Bits of the remaining radioactive fuel must have collected slowly until they reached blow point Feldman in Number One would have gone sailing out into space but Ben reacted at once As the ship leaped slightly Feldman brought up sharply against the chief s braced body For a second their fate hung in the balance Then it was over and Ben shoved him back grinning faintly He jerked his thumb and touched helmets briefly There they go Dan The two men who had been working in Number Two were charred lumps drifting out into space No further comment was made on it except that they d have to work harder from now on since they were shorthanded That rest period Feldman came down with a mild attack of space stomach which meant no more drinking for him and was off work for a day Then the pace picked up The tubes were cleared and they began laying the new lining for the landing blasts There was no time for thought after that Mars orbital station lay close when the work was finished Ben slapped Feldman on the back Ya ain t bad for a greenie Dan We all get six day passes on Mars Hit the sack now so you won t waste time sleeping then We ll hear it when the ship berths Feldman didn t hear it but the others did He felt Ben shaking his shoulder trying to drag him out of the sack Grab your junk Dan Ben picked up Feldman s nearly empty bag and tossed it toward him before his eyes were fully open He grabbed for it and missed He grabbed again with Ben s laughter in his ears The bag hit the wall and fell open spilling its contents Feldman began gathering it up but the chief was no longer laughing A big hand grabbed up the space ticket suddenly and there was no friendliness now on Ben s face Art Billing s card Ben told the other tubemen Five trips I made with Art He was saving his money going to buy a farm on Mars Five trips and one more to go before he had enough Now you show up with his ticket The tubemen moved forward toward Feldman There was no indecision To them apparently trial had been held and sentence passed Wait a minute Feldman began Billings died of A fist snaked past his raised hand and connected with his jaw He bounced off a wall A wrench sailed toward him glanced off his arm and ripped at his muscles Another heavy fist struck Abruptly Ben s voice cut through their yells Hold it He shoved through the group tossing men backwards Stow it We can take care of him later Right now this is captain s business You fools want to lose your leave He indicated two of the others You two bring him along and keep him quiet The two grabbed Feldman s arms and dragged him along as the chief began pulling his way forward through the tubes up towards the control section of the ship Feldman took a quick glance at their faces and made no effort to resist they obviously would have enjoyed any chance to subdue him They were stopped twice by minor officers then sent on They finally found the captain near the exit lock apparently assisting the passengers to leave Most of them went on into the shuttle but Chris Ryan remained behind as the captain listened to Ben s report and inspected the false ticket Finally the captain turned to Feldman You What s your name Chris eyes were squarely on Feldman cold and furious He was Doctor Daniel Feldman Captain Marker she stated Feldman stood paralyzed He d been unwilling to face Chris He wanted to avoid all the past But the idea that she would denounce him had never entered his head There was no Medical rule involved She knew that as a pariah he was forbidden to board a passenger ship of course But she d been his wife once Marker bowed slightly to her Thank you doctor Ryan I should take this criminal back to Earth in chains I suppose But he s hardly worth the freightage You men Want to take him down to Mars and ground him there Ben grinned and touched his forelock Thank you sir We d enjoy that Good His pay reverts to the ship s fund That s all men Feldman started to protest but a fist lashed savagely against his mouth He made no other protests as they dragged him into the crew shuttle that took off for Southport He avoided their eyes and sat hunched over It was Ben who finally broke the silence What happened to Art s money He had a pile on him Go to hell Give I said Ben twisted his arm back toward his shoulder applying increasing pressure A doctor took it for his fee when Billings died of space stomach Damn you I couldn t help him Ben looked at the others Med Lobby fee eh All the market will take Umm It could be maybe He shrugged Okay reasonable doubt We won t kill you bo Not quite we won t The shuttle landed and Ben handed out the little helmets and aspirators that made life possible in Mars thin air Outside the tubemen took turns holding Feldman and beating him while the passengers disembarked from their shuttle As he slumped into unconsciousness he had a picture of Chris Ryan s frozen face as she moved steadily toward the port station IV Martian It was night when Feldman came to and the temperature was dropping rapidly He struggled to sit up through a fog of pain Somewhere in his bag he should have an anodyne tablet that would kill any ache He finally found the pill and swallowed it fumbling with the aspirator lip opening The aspirator meant life to him now he suddenly realized He twisted to stare at the tiny charge indicator for the battery It showed half charge Then he saw that someone had attached another battery beside it He puzzled briefly over it but his immediate concern was for shelter Apparently he was still where he had been knocked out There was a light coming from the little station and he headed toward that fumbling for the few quarters that represented his entire fortune Maybe it would have been better if the tubemen had killed him Batteries were an absolute necessity here food and shelter would be expensive and he had no skills to earn his way At most he had only a day or so left But meantime he had to find warmth before the cold killed him The tiny restaurant in the station was still open and the air was warm inside He pulled off the aspirator shutting off the battery The counterman didn t even glance up as he entered Feldman gazed at the printed menu and flinched Soup he ordered It was the cheapest item he could find The counterman stared at him obviously spotting his Earth origin You adjusted to synthetics Feldman nodded Earth operated on a mixed diet with synthetics for all who couldn t afford the natural foods there But Mars was all synthetic Many of the chemicals in food could exist in either of two forms or isomers they were chemically alike but differently crystallized Sometimes either form was digestible but frequently the body could use only the isomer to which it was adjusted Martian plants produced different isomers from those on Earth Since the synthetic foods turned out to be Mars normal that was probably the more natural form Research designed to let the early colonists live off native food here had turned up an enzyme that enabled the body to handle either isomer In a few weeks of eating Martian or synthetic food the body adapted without more enzyme it lost its power to handle Earth normal food The cheapness of synthetics and the discovery that many diseases common to Earth would not attack Mars normal bodies led to the wide use of synthetics on Earth No pariah could have been expected to afford Earth normal Feldman finished the soup and found a cigarette that was smokable Any objections if I sit in the waiting room He d expected a rejection but the counterman only shrugged The waiting room was almost dark and the air was chilly but there was normal pressure He found a bench and slumped onto it lighting his cigarette He d miss the smokes but probably not for long He finished the cigarette reluctantly and sat huddled on the bench waiting for morning The airlock opened later and feet sounded on the boards of the waiting room floor but he didn t look up until a thin beam of light hit him Then he sighed and nodded The shoes made of some odd fiber didn t look like those of a cop but this was Mars He could see only a hulking shadow behind the light You the man who was a medical doctor The voice was dry and old Yeah Feldman answered Once Good Thought that space crewman was just lying drunk at first Come along Doc Why It didn t matter but if they wanted him to move on they d have to push a little harder The light swung up to show the other He was the shade of old leather with a bleached patch of sandy hair and the deepest gray eyes Feldman had ever seen It was a face that could have belonged to a country storekeeper in New England with the same hint of dry humor The man was dressed in padded levis and a leather jacket of unguessable age His aspirator seemed worn and patched and one big hand fumbled with it Because we re friends Doc the voice drawled at him Because you might as well come with us as sit here Maybe we have a job for you Feldman shrugged and stood up If the man was a Lobby policeman he was different from the usual kind Nothing could be worse than the present prospects They went out through the doors of the waiting room toward a rattletrap vehicle It looked something like a cross between a schoolboy s jalopy and a scaled down army tank of former times The treads were caterpillar style and the stubby body was completely enclosed A tiny airlock stuck out from the rear Two men were inside both bearded The old man grinned at them Mark Lou meet Doc Feldman Sit Doc I m Jake Mullens and you might say we were farmers The motor started with a wheeze The tractor swung about and began heading away from Southport toward the desert dunes It shook and rattled but it seemed to make good time I don t know anything about farming Feldman protested Jake shrugged No of course not Couple of our friends heard about you where a spaceman was getting drunk and tipped us off We know who you are Here try a bracky Feldman took what seemed to be a cigarette and studied it doubtfully It was coarse and fibrous inside with a thin hard shell that seemed to be a natural growth as if it had been chopped from some vine He lighted it not knowing what to expect Then he coughed as the bitter rancid smoke burned at his throat He started to throw it down and hesitated Jake was smoking one and it had killed the craving for tobacco almost instantly Some like em most don t Jake said They won t hurt you Look see that Old Martian ruins Built by some race a million years ago Only half a dozen on Mars It was only a clump of weathered stone buildings in the light from the tractor and Feldman had seen better in the stereo shots It was interesting only because it connected with the legendary Martian race like the canals that showed from space but could not be seen on the surface of the planet Feldman waited for the other to go on but Jake was silent Finally he ground out the butt of the weed Okay Jake What do you want with me Consultation maybe Ever hear of herb doctors I m one of them Feldman knew that the Lobby permitted some leniency here due to the scarcity of real medical help There was only one decent hospital at Northport on the opposite side of the planet Jake sighed and reached for another bracky weed Yeah I m pretty good with herbs But I got a sick village on my hands and I can t handle it We can t all mortgage our work to pay for a trip to Northport Southport s all messed up while the new she doctor gets her metabolism changed Maybe the old guy there would have helped but he died a couple months ago So it looks like you re our only hope Then you have no hope Feldman told him sickly I m a pariah Jake I can t do a thing for you We heard about your argument with the Lobby News reaches Mars But these are mighty sick people Doc Feldman shook his head Better take me back I m not allowed to practice medicine The charge would be first degree murder if anything happened Lou leaned forward Shall I talk to him Jake The old man grimaced Time enough Let him see what we got first Sand howled against the windshield and the tractor bumped and surged along Feldman took another of the weeds and tried to estimate their course But he had no idea where they were when the tractor finally stopped There was a village of small huts that seemed to be merely entrances to living quarters dug under the surface They led him into one and through a tunnel into a large room filled with simple cots and the unhappy sounds of sick people Two women were disconsolately trying to attend to the half dozen sick four children and two adults Their faces brightened as they saw Jake then fell Eb and Tilda died they reported Feldman looked at the two figures under the sheets and whistled The same black specks he had seen on the face of Billings covered the skins of the two old people who had died Funny Jake said slowly They didn t quite act like the others and they sure died mighty fast Darn it I had it figured for that stuff in the book Infantile paralysis How about it Doc Sort of like a cold stiff sore neck It was clearly polio one of the diseases that could attack Mars normal flesh Feldman nodded at the symptoms staring at the sick kids He shrugged finally There s a cure for it but I don t have the serum Neither do you or you wouldn t have brought me here I couldn t help if I wanted to That old book didn t list a cure Jake told him But it said the kids didn t have to be crippled There was something about a Kenny treatment Doc does the stuff really cripple for life Feldman saw one of the boys flinch He dropped his eyes remembering the Lobby s efficient spy service on Earth and wondering what it was like here But he knew the outcome Damn you Jake Jake chuckled Thought you would We sure appreciate it Just tell us what to do Doc Feldman began writing down his requirements trying to remember the details of the treatment Exercise hot compresses massage It was coming back to him He d have to do it himself of course to get the feel of it He couldn t explain it well enough But he couldn t turn his back on the kids either Maybe I can help he said doubtfully as he moved toward a cot No Doc Jake s voice wasn t amused any longer and he held the younger man back You re doing us a favor and I ll be darned if I ll let you stick your neck out too far You can t treat em yourself Mars is tougher than Earth You should live under Space Lobby and Medical Lobby here a while Oh maybe they don t mind a few fools like me being herb doctors but they d sure hate to have a man who can do real medicine outside their hands You let me do it or get in the tractor and I ll have Lou drive you back Once you start in here there ll be no stopping Believe me Feldman looked at him seeing the colonials around him for the first time as people It had been a long time since he d been treated as a fellow human by anyone Jake was right he knew Once he put his hand to the bandage eventually there d be no turning back from the scalpel These people needed medical help too desperately Eventually the news would spread and the Lobby police would come for him Chris couldn t afford to shield him In fact he was sure now that she d hunt him night and day Don t be a fool Jake he ordered brusquely He handed his list to one of the women You ll have to learn to do what I do he told the people there You ll have to work like fools for weeks But there won t be many crippled children I can promise that much He blinked sharply at the sudden hope in their eyes But his mind went on wondering how long it would be before the inevitable would catch up with him With luck maybe a few months But he hadn t been blessed with any superabundance of luck It would probably be less time than he thought V Surgery Doc Feldman s luck was better than he had expected For an Earth year he was a doctor again moving about from village to village as he was needed and doing what he could The village had been isolated during the early colonization when Mars made a feeble attempt to break free of Space Lobby Their supplies had been cut off and they had been forced to do for themselves Now they were largely self sufficient They grew native plants and extracted hormones in crude little chemical plants The hormones were traded to the big chemical plants for a pittance to buy what had to come from Earth Other jury rigged affairs synthesized much of their food But mostly they learned to get along on what Mars provided Doc Feldman learned from them Money was no longer part of his life He ate with whatever family needed him and slipped into the life around him He was learning Martian medicine and finding that his Earth courses were mostly useless No wonder the villagers distrusted Lobby doctors Doc had his own little laboratory where he had managed to start making Mars normal penicillin a primitive antibiotic but better than nothing Jake had come to remind him that it was his first anniversary and now they were smoking bracky together Sheer luck Jake Doc repeated You Martians are tough But some day someone is going to die under my care with the little equipment I have Then Jake nodded slowly Maybe Doc And maybe some day Mars will break free of the Lobbies You d better pray for that I ve been Doc stopped realizing what he d started to say The old man chuckled You ve been talking rebellion for months Doc I hear rumors Whenever you get mad you want us to secede But you don t really mean it yet You can t picture any government but the one you re used to Doc grinned Jake had a point but it was not as strong as it would have been a few months before The towns under the Lobby were cheap imitations of Earth but here divorced to a large extent from the lobbies the villages were making Mars their own Their ways might be strange but they worked Jake shifted his body in the weak sunlight Newton village forgot to report a death on time I hear Ryan is sweating them out trying to prove it was your fault There was no evidence against him yet Doc was sure But Chris was out to prove something and to get a reputation as a top flight administrator It must have hurt when they shipped her here as head of the lesser hemisphere of Mars She d expected to use Feldman as a front while she became the actual ruler of the whole Lobby Now she wanted to strike back She s using blackmail he said and some of his old bitterness was in his voice Anyone taking treatment from an herb doctor in this section is cut off from Medical Lobby service Damn it Jake that could mean letting people die Yeah Jake sighed softly It could mean letting people begin to think about getting rid of the Lobby too Well I gotta help harvest the bracky Take it easy on operating for a while will you Doc All right Jake But stop keeping the serious cases a secret Two men died last month because you wouldn t call me for surgery I ve broken all my oaths already It doesn t matter anymore It matters boy We ve been lucky but some day one case will go to the hospital and they ll find your former work Then they ll really be after you The less you do the better Doc watched Jake slump off then turned down into the little root cellar and back toward the room concealed behind it where his crude laboratory lay For the moment he was free to work on the mystery of the black spots He kept running into them always on the body of someone who died of something that seemed like a normal disease Without a microscope he was almost helpless but he had taken specimens and tried to culture them Some of his cultures had grown though they might be nothing but unknown Martian fungi or bacteria Mars was dry and almost devoid of air but plants and a few smaller insects had survived and adapted It wasn t by any means lifeless Without a microscope he could do little but depend on his files of cases But today there was new evidence A villager had filched an Earth Medical Journal from the tractor driven by Chris Ryan and forwarded it to him He found the black specks mentioned in a single paragraph under skin diseases Investigation of the diet was being made since all cases were among people eating synthetics There was another article on aberrant cases a few strange little misbehaviors in classical syndromes He studied that wondering It had to be the same thing Diet didn t account for the fact that the specks appeared only when the patient was near death Nor did it account for the hard lump at the base of the neck which he found in every case he could check That might be coincidence but he doubted it Whatever it was it aggravated any other disease the patient had and made seemingly simple diseases turn out to be completely and rapidly fatal Once syphilis had been called The Great Imitator This gave promise of being worse He shook his head cursing his lack of equipment Each month more people were dying with these specks and he was helpless The concealed door broke open suddenly and a boy thrust his head in Doc there s a man here from Einstein Says his wife s dying The man was already coming into the room She s powerful sick Doc Had a bellyache fever began throwing up Pains under her belly like she s had before But this time it s awful Doc shot a few questions at him frowning at what he heard Then he began packing the few things that might help There should be no appendicitis on Mars The bugs responsible for that shouldn t have adapted to Mars normal But more and more infections found ways to cross the border Gangrene had been able to get by without change it seemed So far none of the contagious infections except polio and the common cold had made the jump This sounded like an advanced case perhaps already involving peritonitis So far he d been lucky with penicillin but each time he used it with grave doubts of its action on the Mars adapted patients If the appendix had burst however it was the only possible treatment He riffled through his stores There was ether enough fortunately The villagers had made that for him out of Martian plants using their complicated fermentation processes He yelled for Jake and the boy brought the old man back a moment later Jake I ll need more of that narcotic stuff I don t want the woman writhing and tearing her stitches after the ether wears off Can t get it Doc Jake s eyes seemed to cloud as he said it Distilling plant broke down Doc I don t like this case That woman s been to the hospital three times I hear she just got out recently This might be a plant or they figure they can t help her They re afraid to try anything on Mars normal flesh They can t be proved wrong if they do nothing Doc finished packing his bag and got ready to go out Jake either I m a doctor or I m not I can t worry when a woman may be dying For a second Jake s expression was stubborn Then the little crow s feet around his eyes deepened and the dry chuckle was back in his voice Right doctor Feldman He flipped up his thumb and went off at a shuffling run toward the tractor Lou and the man from Einstein followed Doc into the machine It was a silent ride except for Doc s questions about the sick woman Her husband George Lynn was evasive and probably ignorant He admitted that Harriet had been to the dispensary and small infirmary that Southport called a hospital It was the only place in the entire Southern hemisphere where an operation could be performed legally Most cases had to go to Northport but Chris had been trying to expand Apparently she was determined to make Southport into another major center before she was called back to Earth Doc wondered why the villagers went there They had no medical insurance with the Lobby they couldn t afford it Most villagers didn t have the cash either They were forced to mortgage their future work and that of their families to the drug plants that were run by the Lobby And they just turned your wife away Doc asked He couldn t quite believe that of Chris Well I dunno She wouldn t talk much Twice she went and they gave her something Cost every cent I could borrow Then this last time they kept her a couple days before they let me come and get her But now she s a lot worse Jake spun about suddenly tense How d you pay them last time George Why they didn t ask I told her she could put up six months from me and the kids but nobody said nothing about it Just gave her back to me He frowned slowly his dull voice uncertain They told me they d done all they could not to bring her back That s why she was so strong on getting Doc I don t like it Jake said flatly It stinks They always charge George did they suggest she get in touch with Doc here Maybe they did maybe not Harriet did all the talking with them I just do what she tells me and she said to get Doc Jake swore It smells like a trap Are you sure she s sick George I felt her head and she sure had a fever George Lynn was torn between his loyalties You know me Doc You fixed me up that time I had the red pip I wouldn t pull nothing on you Doc had a feeling that Jake was probably right but he vetoed the suggestion that they stop to look for spies He had no time for that If the woman was really sick he had to get to her at once and even that might be too late He remembered the woman sickly from other treatment He d been forced to remove her inflamed tonsils a few months before She d whined and complained because he couldn t spend all his time attending her She was a nag a shrew and a totally selfish woman But that was her husband s worry not his He dashed into the little house when they reached Einstein and his first glance confirmed what George Lynn had said The woman was sick all right She was running a high fever Much too high She began whining and protesting at his having taken so long but the pain soon forced her to stop There may still be a chance Doc told her husband brusquely He threw the cleanest sheet onto a table and shoved it under the single light Keep out of the way in the other room if you can all pile in there This isn t exactly aseptic anyhow You can boil a lot of water if you want to help It would give them something to do and he could use the water to clean up There was no time to wait for it however He had to sterilize with alcohol and carbolic acid and hope He bent over the woman ripping her thin gown across to make room for the operation Then he swore Across her abdomen was the unhealed wound of a previous operation They d worked on her at Southport They must have removed the appendix and then been shocked by the signs of infection They weren t supposed to release a sick patient but there was an easy out for them they could remove her from the danger of spreading an unknown infection Some doctors must have doped her up on sedatives and painkillers and sent her home knowing that she would call him For that matter they might have noticed her unrecorded tonsillectomy and considered her fair bait He grabbed the ether and slapped a cone over her nose She tried to protest she never cooperated in anything But the fumes of the ether he dipped onto the packing of the cone soon overcame that It was peritonitis of course The only thing to do was to go in and scrape and clean as best he could It was a rotten job to have to do and he should have had help But he gritted his teeth and began He couldn t trust anyone else to hold the instruments even He cleaned the infection as best he could knowing there was almost no chance He used all the penicillin he dared Then he began sewing up the incision It was all he could do except for dressing the wound with a sterile bandage He reached for one and stopped While he d been working the woman had died far more quietly than she had ever lived It was probably the only gracious act of her life But it was damning to Doc They couldn t hide her death and any investigation would show that someone had worked on her To the Lobby he would be the one who had murdered her Jake was waiting in the tractor He took one look at Doc s face and made no inquiries They were more than a mile away when Jake pointed back Small in the distance but distinct against the sands a gray Medical Corps tractor was coming Either they d had a spy in the village or they d guessed the rate of her infection very closely They must have hoped to catch Doc in the act and they d barely missed It wouldn t matter Their pictures and what testimony they could force from the village should be enough to hang Doc VI Research There had been a council the night following the death of Harriet Lynn Somehow the word had spread through the villages and the chiefs had assembled in Jake s village But they had brought no solution and in the long run had been forced to accept Doc s decision I m not going to retire and hide he d told them surprised at his own decision but grimly determined You need me and I need you I ll move every day in hopes the Lobby police won t find me but I won t quit Now he was packing the things he most needed and getting ready to move The small bottles in which he was trying to grow his cultures would need warmth He shoved them into an inner pocket and began surveying what must be left He was heading for his tractor when another battered machine drove up It had a girl of about fourteen with tears streaming down her face She held out a pleading hand and her voice was scared It s it s mama Where Leibnitz Leibnitz was near enough Doc started his tractor motioning for the girl to lead the way The little dwelling she led him to was at the edge of the village looking more poverty stricken than most Chris Ryan and three of the Medical Lobby police were inside waiting The girl s mother was tied to the bed with a collection of medical instruments laid out but apparently the threat had been enough No actual injury had been inflicted Probably none had been intended seriously I knew you d answer that kind of call Chris said coldly He grinned sickly They d wasted no time I hear it s more than you ll do Chris Congratulations My patient died You re lucky She was certainly dead when my men took her picture The print shows the death grimace clearly Pretty Frame it and keep it to comfort you when you feel lonely he snapped She struck him across the mouth with the handle of her gun Then she twisted out through the door quickly heading for the tractor that had been camouflaged to look like those used by the villagers The three police led him behind her A shout went up and people began to rush onto the village street But they were too late By the time they reached Southport Doc could see a trail of battered tractors behind but there was nothing more the people could do Chris had her evidence and her prisoner Judge Ben Wilson might have been Jake s brother He was older and grayer but the same expression lay on his face He must have been the family black sheep since his father had been president of Space Lobby Instead of inheriting the position Wilson had remained on Mars safely out of the family s way He dropped the paper he was reading to frown at Chris This the fellow She began formal charges but he cut them off Your lawyer already had all that drawn up I ve been expecting you Doctor Doctor Hnnf You d do a lot better home somewhere raising a flock of babies Well young fellow so you re Feldman Okay your trial comes up day after tomorrow Be a shame to lock you in Southport jail a man of your importance We ll just keep you here in the pending trial room It s a lot more comfortable Chris had been boiling slowly and now she seemed to blow her safety valve Judge Wilson your methods are your own business in local affairs But this involves Earth Medical Lobby I demand Tch tch The judge stared at her reprovingly Young woman you don t demand anything This is Mars If Space Lobby can stand me I guess our friends over at Medical will have to Or should I hold trial right now and find Feldman innocent for lack of evidence You wouldn t Chris cried Then her face sobered suddenly I apologize Medical is pleased to leave things in your hands of course Wilson smiled Court s closed for today Doc I ll show you your cell It s right next to my study so I m heading there anyhow He began shucking his robe while Chris went out with the police her voice sharp and continual The cell was both reasonably escape proof and comfortable Doc saw and he tried to thank the judge But the old man waved it aside Forget it I just like to see that little termagant taken down But don t count on my being soft My methods may be a bit unusual I always did like the courtroom scenes in the old books by that fellow Smith but Space Lobby never had any reason to reverse my decisions Anything you need Sure Doc told him grinning in spite of his bitterness A good biology lab and an electron microscope Umm How about a good optical mike and some stains Just got them in on the last shipment Figure they were meant for you anyhow since Jake Mullens asked me to order them He went out and came back with the box almost at once He snorted at Doc s incredulous thanks and moved off his bedroom slippers slapping against the hard floor Doc stared after him If he were a friend of Jake willing to invent some excuse to get a microscope here but it didn t matter Friend or foe his death sentence would be equally fatal And there were other things to be thought of now The little microscope was an excellent one though only a monocular Doc s hands trembled as he drew his cultures out and began making up a slide The sun offered the best source of light near the window and he adjusted the instrument Something began to come into view but too faintly to be really visible He remembered the stains trying to recall his biology courses More by luck than skill his fourth try gave him results Under two thousand powers he could just see details There were dozens of cells in his impure culture but only one seemed unfamiliar It was a long worm like thing sharpened at both ends with the three separate nuclei that were typical of Martian life forms Nearby were a host of little rodlike squiggles just too small to see clearly Martian life No Martian bug had ever proved harmful to men Yet this was no mutated cell or virus from Earth it was a new disease completely different from all others It was one where all Earth s centuries of experience with bacteria would be valueless the first Martian disease Unless this was simply some accidental contamination of his culture not common to the other samples He worked on until the light was too faint before putting the microscope aside By the time the trial commenced however he was sure of the cause of the disease It was Martian Crude as his cultures were they had proved that The little courtroom was filled mostly from the villages Lou was there along with others he had come to know Then the sight of Jake caught Doc s eyes The darned fool had no business there he could get too closely mixed into the whole mess Court s in session Wilson announced Doc you represented by counsel Jake s voice answered Your Honor I represent the defendant I think you ll find my credentials in order Chris started to protest but Wilson grinned Never lost your standing in spite of that little fracas thirty years ago so far as I know But the police thought you were a witness when you came walking in Figured you were giving up I never said so Jake answered Chris was squirming angrily but the florid man acting as counsel for Medical Lobby shook his head bending over to whisper in her ear He straightened No objection to counsel for the defense We recognize his credentials You re a fool Matthews the judge told him Jake was smarter than half the rest of Legal Lobby before he went native Still can tie your tail to a can Okay let s start things I m too old to dawdle Doc lost track of most of what happened This was totally unlike anything on Earth though it might have been in keeping with the general casualness of the villages Maybe the ritualistic routine of the Lobbies was driving those who could resist to the opposite extreme Chris was the final witness Matthews drew comment of Feldman s former crime from her and Jake made no protest though Wilson seemed to expect one Then she began sewing his shroud There wasn t a fact that managed to emerge without slanting though technically correct Jake sat quietly smiling faintly and making no protests He got up lazily to cross examine Chris doctor Ryan when Daniel Feldman was examined by the Captain of the Navaho after arriving at Mars station did you identify him then as having been doctor Daniel Feldman She glanced at Matthews who seemed puzzled but unconcerned That s correct she admitted But And you later saw him delivered to the surface of Mars Is that also correct When she assented Jake hesitated Then he frowned What did you do then Did you report him or send anyone to look after him or anything like that Certainly not she answered He was no You did absolutely nothing about him after you identified him and saw him delivered here You re quite sure of that I did nothing Jake stood quietly for a moment then shrugged No more questions Matthews finished things in a plea for the salvation of all humanity from the danger of such men as Daniel Feldman He was looking smug as was Chris Wilson turned to Jake Has the defense anything to say A few things Your Honor Jake stood up suddenly looking certain and pleased We are happy to admit everything factual the Lobby had testified Daniel Feldman performed a surgical operation on Harriet Lynn in the village of Einstein But when has it been illegal for a member of the Medical profession to perform an operation even with small chance of success within an accepted area for such operation There has been no evidence adduced that any crime or act of even unethical conduct was committed That brought Chris and Matthews to their feet Wilson was relaxed again looking as if he d swallowed a whole cage of canaries He banged his gavel down Jake picked up two ragged and dog eared volumes from his table Case of Harding vs Southport twenty forty three establishes that a Lobby is responsible for any member on Mars It is also responsible for informing the authorities of any criminal conduct on the part of its members or any former member known to it Failure to report shall be considered an admission that the Lobby recognizes the member as one in good standing and accepts responsibility for that member s conduct At the time Daniel Feldman arrived doctor Christina Ryan was the highest appointed representative of Medical Lobby in Southport with full authority She identified Feldman as having been a doctor without stipulating any change in status She made no further report to any authority concerning Daniel Feldman s presence here It seems obvious that Medical Lobby at Southport thereby accepted Daniel Feldman as a doctor in good standing for whose conduct the Lobby accepted full responsibility Wilson studied the book Jake held out and nodded Seems pretty clear cut to me he agreed passing the book on to Matthews There s still the charge that doctor Feldman operated outside a hospital No reason he shouldn t Jake said He handed over the other volume This is the charter for Medical Lobby on Mars Medical Lobby agrees to perform all necessary surgical and medical services for the planet though at the signing of this charter there was no hospital on Mars Necessarily Medical Lobby agreed to perform surgery outside of any hospital then But to make it plainer there s a later paragraph page one hundred eighty one that defines each hospital zone as extending not less than three nor more than one hundred miles Einstein is about one hundred and ten miles from the nearest hospital at Southport so Einstein comes under the original charter provisions doctor Feldman was forced by charter provisions to protect the good name of his Lobby by undertaking any necessary surgery in Einstein He waited until Matthews had scanned that book then took it back and began packing a big bag Doc saw that his possessions and the microscope were already in the bag The old man paid no attention to the arguments of Matthews before the bench Abruptly Wilson pounded his gavel This court finds that doctor Daniel Feldman is qualified to practice all the arts and skills of the medical profession on Mars and that he acted ethically in the performance of his duties in the case of the deceased Harriet Lynn he ruled The costs of the case shall be billed to Medical Lobby of Southport He took off his robe and moved rapidly toward his private quarters Court was closed Doc got up shakily not daring to believe fully what he had heard He started toward Jake trying to avoid bumping into Chris But she would not be avoided She stood in front of him screaming accusations and threats that reminded him of the only fight they d ever had during their brief marriage When she ran down he finally met her eyes You re a helluva doctor he told her harshly You spend all your time fighting me when there s a plague out there that may be worse than any disease we ve ever known Take a look at what lies under the black specks on your corpses You ll find the first Martian disease And maybe if you begin working on that now you can learn to be a real doctor in time to do something about it But I doubt it She fell back from him then Research You ve been doing unauthorized research Prove it he suggested But you d be a lot smarter to try some yourself and to hell with your precious rules He followed Jake out to the tractor Surprisingly the old man was sweating now He shook his head at Doc s look and his grin was uncertain Matthews is an incompetent he said They could have had you Doc That charter is so sloppy a man can prove anything by it and building a hospital here did bring in Earth rules Wilson went out on a limb in letting you go But I guess we got away with it Let s get out of here Doc climbed into the tractor more soberly They had escaped this time But there would be another time and he was pretty sure that would be Chris round He had no intention of giving up his research VII Plague doctor Feldman leaned back from his microscope and lighted another bracky weed He glanced about the room and sighed wearily Maybe he d been better off when he had no friends and couldn t risk the safety of others in an effort to do research that was the highest crime on two worlds The evidence of his work was hidden thirty feet beyond his former laboratory in Jake s village with a tunnel that led from another root cellar The theory was the old one that the best place to avoid discovery was where you had already been discovered If their spies had identified his former hangout they d never expect to have him set up research nearby It was a nice theory but he wasn t sure of it Jake looked up from a cot where he d been watching the improvised culture incubator Stop tearing yourself to bits Doc We know the danger and we re still darned glad to have you here working on this I m trying to put myself together into a whole man Doc told him But I seem to come out wholly a fool Yeah sure Sometimes it takes a fool to get things done wise men wait too long for the right time How s the bug hunt Doc grunted in disgust and swung back to the microscope Then he gave up as his tired eyes refused to focus Why don t you people revolt They tried it twice But they were just a bunch of pariahs shipped here to live in peonage They couldn t do much The first time Earth cut off shipments and starved them Next time the villages had the answer to that but the cities had to fight for Earth or starve so they whipped us And there s always the threat that Earth could send over unmanned war rockets loaded with fissionables So it s hopeless So nothing The Lobbies are poisoning themselves like cutting off Medical service until they cut themselves out of a job It s just a matter of time Go back to the bugs Doc Doc sighed and reached for his notes I wish I knew more Martian history I ve been wondering whether this bug may not have been what killed off the old Martians Something had to do it the way they disappeared I wish I knew enough to make an investigation of those ruins out there Durwood Jake had propped himself on an elbow staring at Doc in surprise Doc scowled Clive Durwood you mean The archeologist who dug up what little we know about the ruins Yeah before he went back to Earth and started living off his lectures He came here again three years ago and dropped dead in Edison on the way to some other ruins Heart failure they called it though it was more like the two old farmers who ran themselves to death last month I saw him when they buried him His face looked funny and I think he had those little specks though I may remember wrong He grimaced Mars is tough Doc it has to be Some of the plant seeds Durwood found in the ruins grew Maybe your bugs waited a million years till we came along What about the farmers Did they meet Durwood Jake nodded Must have He lived in their village most of the time Doc went through his notes He d asked for reports on all deaths and he finally found the account The two old men had been nervous and fidgety for weeks They were twins living by themselves and nobody paid much attention Then one morning both were seen running wildly in circles The village managed to tie them up but they died of exhaustion shortly after It wasn t a pretty picture The disease might have an incubation period of nearly fifteen years judging by the length of time it had taken to hit Durwood It must spread from person to person during an early contagious stage leaving widening circles behind Durwood and those first infected When matured any other sickness would set it off with few symptoms of its own But without help it still killed its victims apparently driving them madly toward frenzied physical effort He studied the culture on a slide again He d tried Koch s method to get a pure strain splattering the bugs onto a native starchy root and plucking off individual colonies About twenty specimens had been treated with every chemical he could find So far he d found a few things that seemed to stop their growth but nothing that killed them except stuff far too harsh to use in living tissue He had nearly forty cases of deaths that showed symptoms now and he went back over them looking for anything in common that went back ten to twenty years before death There were no rashes nor blisters A few had had apparent colds but such were too common to mean anything Only one thing appeared about fourteen years before their deaths The people interviewed about the victims might be vague about most things but they remembered the time when Jim had the jumping headache Jake Doc called what s jumping headache Most people seem to have it some time or other but I haven t run across a case of it Sure you have Doc Mamie Brander s little girl a few weeks ago Feels like your pulse is going to rip your skull off right here Can t eat because chewing drives you crazy Back of your head neck and shoulders swell up for about a week Then it goes away Then it goes away for fourteen years until it comes back to kill Doc stared at his charts in sudden horror It was a new disease thought to be some virus but not considered dangerous Selznik s migraine according to medical usage you treated it with hot pads and anodyne and it went away easily enough He d seen hundreds of such cases on Earth There must be millions who had been hit by it The patent medicine branch of the Lobby had even brought out something called Nograine to use for self treatment Something important Jake wanted to know Feldman nodded How much weight do you swing in other villages Jake People sort of do me favors when I ask Jake admitted Like swiping those medical journals from Northport for you or like Molly Badger getting that job as maid to spy on Chris Ryan Name it and I ll do my best Doc had a vague idea of village politics but he had more important things to think of Most of his foul mood had disappeared with the clue he d stumbled on and his chief worry now was to clinch the facts Feldman considered the problem I want a report on every case of jumping headache in every village who had it when and how old they were This place first but every village you can reach And I ll want someone to take a letter to Chris Ryan Jake frowned at that but went out to issue instructions Doc sat down at a battered old typewriter Writing Chris might do no good but some warning had to be gotten through to Earth where the vast resources of Medical Lobby could be thrown into the task of finding the cause and cure of the disease The connection with Selznik s migraine had to be reported If something could blast the Lobby into action it wouldn t matter quite so much what they did to him He wasn t foolish enough to expect gratitude from them but he was getting used to the idea that his days were numbered The plague was more important than what happened to him The letter had been dispatched by the time Jake returned Here s the dope for this village Everybody accounted for except you Never had it Jake Feldman went down the list Most of it fourteen years ago That fits About the only exceptions are the kids who seem to get it between the ages of two and three Eighty seven out of ninety one He stared at the figures sickly Most of the village not only had the plague but must be near the end of the incubation period It looked as if most of the village would be dead before another year passed Bad Jake asked The first symptom of Martian fever The old man whistled the lines around his eyes tightening Must be me he decided I m the guy who must have brought it here then I used to spend a lot of time with Durwood at his diggings There was a constant commotion all that day and the next as runners went out to the villages and came back with reports The variation from village to village was only slight Most of Mars seemed to have advanced cases of Martian fever Without animals for investigation and study real research was difficult Doc also needed an electron microscope He was reasonably sure that the disease must travel through the nerves but he had found no proof beyond the hard lump at the base of the neck There it was a fair sized organism Elsewhere he could find nothing until the black specks developed His eyes ached from trying to see more than was visible in the microscope The tantalizing suggestions of filaments around the nuclei might be the form of plague that was contagious They might even be the true form of the bug with the bigger cell only a transition stage There were a number of diseases that involved complicated changes in the organisms that caused them But he couldn t be sure He finally buried his head in his hands trying to do by pure thought what he couldn t do in any other way And even there he lacked training He was a doctor not a xenobiologist Research training had been taboo in school except for a favored few The reports continued to come in confirming the danger They seemed to have the worst plague on their hands in all human history and nobody who could do anything about it even knew of it Molly reports that your letter got some results Jake reported Chris Ryan brought home one of the electron microscopes and a bunch of equipment from the hospital pathology room Think she ll get anywhere Doc doubted it Damn it he hadn t meant for her to try it though she might have authority for routine experiments But it was like her to refuse to pass on the word without trying to prove her own suspicion of him first He tried to comfort himself with the fact that some men were immune or seemed so about three out of a hundred showed no signs If that immunity was hereditary it might save the race If not Jake came in at twilight with a grim face More news from Molly The Lobby is starting out to comb every village with a fault finder starting here And this hole will show up like a sore thumb Better start packing We gotta be out of here in less than an hour VIII Fool Three days later Doc saw his first runner The tractor was churning through the sand just before sundown heading toward another one night stand at a new village Lou was driving while Doc and Jake brooded silently in the back paying no attention to the colors that were blazoned over the dunes The cat and mouse game was getting to Doc There was no real assurance that the village they were approaching might not be the target the Lobby had chosen for the next investigation Lou braked the tractor to a sudden halt and pointed A figure was running frantically over one of the low dunes with the little red sun behind him He seemed headed toward them but as he drew nearer they could see that he had no definite direction He simply ran pumping his legs frantically as if all the devils of hell were after him His body swayed from side to side in exhaustion but his arms and legs pumped on Stop him Jake ordered and Lou swung the tractor It halted squarely in the runner s path and the figure struck against it and toppled The legs went on pumping digging into the dirt and gravel but the man was too far gone to rise Jake and Lou shoved him through the doors into the tractor and Doc yanked off his aspirator The man was giving vent to a kind of ululating cry weakened now almost to a whine that rose and fell with the motion of his legs Sweat had once streaked his haggard face but it was dry and blanched to a pasty gray Doc injected enough narcotic to quiet a maddened bull It had no effect except to upset the rhythm of the arms and legs It took five more minutes for the man to die The specks were larger this time the size of periods in twelve point type The lump at the base of the skull was as big as a small hen s egg From Edison like the others so far Jack Kooley Jake answered Doc s question Durwood spent a lot of time here on his first expedition so it s getting the worst of it Doc pulled the aspirator mask back over the man s face and they carried him out and laid him on a low dune They couldn t risk returning the corpse to its people This was only the primary circle of infection direct from Durwood The second circle could be ten times as large as the infection spread from one to a few to many So far it was localized But it wouldn t stay that way Doc climbed slowly out of the tractor lugging his small supplies of equipment while Jake made arrangements for them to spend the night in a deserted house But the figure of the runner and his own failures to find more about the disease kept haunting Doc He began setting up his equipment grimly Better get some sleep Jake suggested You re a mite more tired than you think Anyhow I thought you told me you couldn t do any more with what you ve got Feldman looked at the supplies he had spread out and shook his head wearily He d been over every chemical and combination a dozen times without results that showed in the limited magnification of the optical mike He snapped the case shut and hit the rude table with the heel of his hand There are other supplies Jake do you have any signal to get in touch with Molly at the Ryan house Three raps on the rear left window I ll get Lou No Doc came to his feet reaching for his jacket They re looking for three men now It s safer if I go alone and I m the only one who knows what supplies are needed With luck I may even get the electron mike Got a gun I can borrow Jake found one somewhere an old revolver with a few loads He began protesting but Doc overruled him sharply Three men could no more fight off the police than one if they were spotted He swung toward the tractor You d better start spreading the word on everything we know If people realize they re already safe or doomed it ll be better than having them going crazy to avoid contagion Most of the villages know already Jake told him And damn it get back here Doc If you can t make it turn tail quick and we ll think of something else Southport seemed normal enough as Doc drove through its streets The stereo house was open and the little shops were brightly lighted He stopped once to pull a copy of Southport s little newspaper from a dispenser All was quiet on its front page too As usual though the facts were buried inside The editorial was pouring too much oil on the waters in its lauding of the role of Medical Lobby on Mars for no apparent reason The death notices no longer listed the cause of death Medical knew something was up at least and was worried He parked the tractor behind Chris house and slipped to the proper window Everything was seemingly quiet there At his knock the shade was drawn back and he caught a brief glimpse of Molly looking out A moment later she opened the rear lock to let him into the kitchen Shh She s still up I think What can I do Doc He tried to smile at her Hide me until it s safe to get into her laboratory I ve got to The inner kitchen was kicked open and Chris stood beyond it holding a cocked gun in her hand It took longer than I expected Dan she said quietly But after your letter I knew you d swallow the bait You bloody fool Did you really believe I d start doing research here just because of your imaginings He slumped slowly back against the sink So this is a fool s errand then There never was any equipment here The equipment s here in my office I guessed your spies would report it so it had to be here But it won t help you now pariah Feldman He came from his braced position against the sink like a spring uncoiling He expected her to shoot but hoped the surprise would ruin her aim Then it was too late and his boot hit the gun savagely knocking it from her hand Life in the villages had hardened him surprisingly She was comparatively helpless in his hands A few minutes later he had her bound securely with surgical tape Molly brought him She raged furiously in the chair where he d dumped her then gave up They ll get you Daniel Feldman Surprisingly there was no rage in her voice now You won t get away from us The planet isn t big enough I got away from your trial he reminded her And I got away and lived when you left me without a chance on the ground of the spaceport She laughed harshly You got away then You fool who do you think gave you the extra battery so you could live long enough to be helped at the spaceport Who hired a fool like Matthews so you wouldn t get the death sentence you deserved Who let you get away as an herb doctor for months before you set yourself up as God and a traitor to mankind again It shook him as it was probably intended to do How had she known about the extra battery He d always assumed that Ben had returned to give it to him But in that case Chris couldn t know of it Then he hardened himself again In the old days she d always had one trump card he couldn t beat and hadn t expected But too much was involved for games now Any police around Molly he asked Molly came back a minute later to report that everything looked clear and to show him where the equipment had been set up in Chris office It was all there including the electron mike a beautiful little portable model There was even a small incubator with its own heat source into which he immediately transferred the little bottles he d been keeping warm against his skin Most of the equipment had never been unpacked which made loading it onto his tractor ridiculously easy Better come with me now Molly he suggested at last Then he turned to Chris who was watching him with almost no expression You can wriggle your chair to the phone in half an hour I guess Knock the phone off and yell for help It s better than you deserve unless you really did leave me that battery You won t get away with it she told him again calmly this time No he admitted Probably not But maybe the human race will if I have time to find an answer to the plague you won t see under your nose But you won t get away with it either In the long run your kind never do Molly was sniffling as they drove away It had probably been the best life she d known Doc supposed Chris could be kind to menials But now Molly s work was done and she d have to disappear into the villages He let her off at the first village and drove on alone He was itching to get to the microscope now hardly able to wait through the long journey back to Jake His impatience grew with each mile Finally he gave up He swung the tractor into a small gulley between sand dunes left the motor idling and pulled down the shades the villagers used for blackout traveling There was power enough for the mike here and the cab was big enough for what he had to do He mounted the mike on the tractor seat and began laying out the collection of smears and cultures he had brought It had been years since he d made a film for the electron mike but he found it all came back to him as he worked His hands were sweating with tension as he inserted the first film into the chamber He had the magnetic lenses set for twenty thousand power but a quick glance showed it was too weak He raised the power to fifty thousand The filaments were there clear and distinct He turned on the little tape recorder that had been part of Chris equipment and set the microphone where he could dictate into it without stopping to make clumsy notes He readjusted the focus carefully carrying on a running commentary Then he gasped Each of the little filaments carried three tiny darker sections each was a cell complete in itself with the typical Martian triple nucleus He put a film with a tiny section of the nerve tissue from a corpse into the chamber next and again a quick glance at the screen was enough The filaments were there thickly crowded among nerve cells They did travel along the nerves to reach the base of the brain before the larger lump could form A specimen from one of the black specks was even more interesting The filaments were there but some were changed or changing into tiny round cells also with the triple dark spots of nuclei Those must be the final form that was released to infect others Probably at first these multiplied directly in epithelial tissue so that there was a rapid contagion of infection Eventually they must form the filaments that invaded the nerves and caused the brief bodily reaction that was Selznik s migraine Then the body adapted to them and they began to incubate slowly developing into the large cells he had first seen When ripe the big cells broke apart into millions of the tiny round ones that went back to the nerve endings causing the black spots and killing the host He knew his enemy now at least He reached for the controls increasing the magnification He would lose resolution but he might find something more at the extreme limits of the mike Something wet and cold gushed into his face He jerked back trying to wipe it off but it was already evaporating and there was a thick acrid odor in the cab He grabbed for his aspirator then tried to reach the airlock But paralysis was already spreading through him and he toppled to the floor before he could escape When he came to it was morning outside and Chris was waiting inside the cab with two big Lobby policemen A hypo in her hand must have been what revived him She touched the electron microscope with something like affection The Lobby technicians did a good job on this don t you think Dan I warned you but you wouldn t listen And now we ve even got your own taped words to prove you were doing forbidden research Fool She shook her head pityingly as the tractor began moving with two others toward Southport You and your phony diseases A little skin disorder Selznik s migraine and a few cases of psychosis to make a new disease Do you think Medical Lobby can t check on such simple things Or didn t you expect us to hear of your open talk of revolt and realize you were planning to create some new germ to wipe out the Earth forces Maybe those runners of yours were real mass murderer She drew out another hypo and shoved the needle into his arm Necrosynth enough to keep him unconscious for twenty four hours He started to curse her but the drug acted before he could complete the thought IX Judgment Doc woke to see sunlight shining through a heavily barred window that must be in the official Southport jail He waited a few minutes for his head to clear and then sat up necrosynth left no hangover at least The sound of steps outside was followed by the squeak of a key in the lock Fifteen minutes Judge Wilson a voice said Thank you officer Wilson came into the cell carrying a tray of breakfast and a copy of the Northport Gazette He began unloading bracky weeds from his pocket while Doc attacked the breakfast They tossed the book at you Doc he said You haven t got a chance and there s nothing the villages can do Trial s set for tomorrow at Northport and it s in closed session We can t get you off this time Doc nodded Thanks for coming even if there s nothing you can do I ve been living on borrowed time for a year anyhow so I have no right to kick But who s we The villages I ve been part of their organization for years The old man sighed heavily You might say a revolution has been going on since I can remember though most villagers don t know it We ve just been waiting our time Now we ve stopped waiting and the rifles will be coming out rifles made in village shops The villages are going to rebel even if we re all dead of plague in a month Doc Feldman nodded and reached for the bracky He knew that this was their way of trying to make him feel his work hadn t been for nothing and he was grateful for Wilson s visit It was a good year for me Damned good But time s running short I d better brief you on the latest on the plague Wilson began making notes until Doc was finished Finally he got up as steps sounded from the hall Anything else Just a guess A lot of Earth germs can t live in Mars normal flesh maybe this can t live in Earth normal Tell them so long for me So long Doc He shook hands briefly and was waiting at the door when the guard opened it An hour later the Lobby police took Feldman to the Northport shuttle rocket They had some trouble on the way a runner cut down the street with the crowds frantically rushing out of his way Terror was reaching the cities already Doc flashed a look at Chris Mob hysteria Like flying saucers and wriggly tops I suppose he asked before the guard could stop him They locked his legs but left his hands free in the rocket He unfolded the paper Wilson had brought and buried his face in it Then he swore They were explaining the runners as a case of mob hysteria Northport was calmer Apparently they had yet to have first hand experience with the plague But now nothing seemed quite real to Doc even when they locked him into the big Northport jail The whole ritual of the Lobbies seemed like a fantasy after the villages It snapped back into focus however when they led him into the trial room of the Medical Lobby building It was a smaller version of his trial on Earth Fear washed in by association The complete lack of humanity in the procedure was something from a half remembered and horrible past The presiding officer asked the routine question Is the prisoner represented by counsel Blane the dapper little prosecutor arose quickly The prisoner is a pariah Sir Magistrate Very well The court will accept the protective function for the prisoner You may proceed I ll be judge I ll be jury And prosecution and defense It made for a lot less trouble Of course if Space Lobby had asserted interest it would have gone to a supposedly neutral court But as usual Space was happy to leave it in the hands of Medical The tape was played as evidence Doc frowned The words were his but there had been a lot of editing that subtly changed the import of his notes I protest he challenged It s not an accurate version The Lobby magistrate turned a wooden face to him Does the prisoner have a different version to introduce No but The evidence is accepted One of the prisoner s six protests will be charged against him Blane smiled smoothly and held up a small package We wish to introduce this drug as evidence that the prisoner is a confirmed addict morally irresponsible under addiction This is a package of so called bracky weed a vile and noxious substance found in his possession It has alkaloids no more harmful than nicotine Feldman stated sharply Do you contend that you find the taste pleasing Blane asked It s bitter but I ve gotten used to it I ve tasted it the magistrate said Evidence accepted Two deductions one for irregularity of presentation Doc shrugged and sat back He d tested his rights and found what he expected It was hard to see now how he had ever accepted such procedure Jake must be right they d been in power too long and were making the mistake of taking the velvet glove off the iron fist and flailing about for the sheer pleasure of power It dragged on while he became a greater and greater monster on the record But finally it was over and the magistrate turned to Feldman You may present your defense I ask complete freedom of expression Doc said formally The magistrate nodded This is a closed court Permission granted The recording will be scrambled The last bit ruined most of the purpose Doc had in mind But it was too late to change He could only hope that some one of the Medical men present would remember something of what he said I have nothing to say for myself he began It would be useless But I had to do what I did There s a plague outside I ve studied that plague and I have knowledge which must be used against it He sat down in three minutes It had been useless Blane arose with a smile still plastered on his face We of course recognize the existence of a new contagion but I believe we have established that this is one disseminated by the prisoner himself and probably not directly contagious There have been many cases of fanatics ready to destroy humanity to eliminate those they hate Now surely the prisoner has himself left no question of his attitude He asserts he has knowledge and skill greater than the entire Medical Research staff He has attempted to intimidate us by threats He is clearly psychopathic and dangerously so The prosecution rests The guards took Doc into the anteroom where he was supposed to hear nothing that went on But their curiosity was stronger than their discretion and the door remained a trifle ajar The magistrate began the discussion The case seems firm enough It s fortunate doctor Ryan acted so quickly with some of the people getting nervous Perhaps it might be wise to publicize our verdict My thought exactly Blane agreed If we show Feldman is responsible and that Medical is eliminating the source of the infection it may have a stabilizing effect Let s hope so The sentence will have to be death of course We can t let such a rebellious psychopath live But this needs something more it seems You ve prepared a recommendation I suppose There was the case of Albrecht Delier Blane suggested Something like that should have good publicity impact It struck Doc that they sounded as if they believed themselves as the witch burners had believed in witches He was sweating when the guards led him before the bench The magistrate rolled a pen slowly across his fingers as his eyes raked Feldman Pariah Daniel Feldman you have been found guilty on all counts Furthermore your guilt must be shared by that entire section of Mars known as the villages Therefore the entire section shall be banned and forbidden any and all services of the Medical Lobby for a period of one year Sir Magistrate One of the members of Southport Hospital staff was on his feet Sir Magistrate we can t cut them off completely We must doctor Harkness I appreciate the fine humanitarian tradition of our Lobby which lies behind your protest but at such a time as this the good of the body politic requires drastic measures Why not see me after court and we can discuss it then He turned back to Feldman and his face was severe The same education which has produced such fine young men as doctor Harkness was wasted on you and perverted to endanger the whole race No punishment can equal your crimes but there is one previously invoked for a particularly horrible case and it seems fitting that you should be the fourth so sentenced Daniel Feldman you are sentenced to be taken in to space beyond planetary limits together with all material used by you in the furtherance of your criminal acts There you shall be placed into a spacesuit containing sufficient oxygen for one hour of life and no more You and your contaminated possessions shall then be released into space to drift there through all eternity as a warning to other men This sentence shall be executed at the earliest possible moment and doctor Christina Ryan is hereby commissioned to observe such 
922_132299_000002_000000	train-clean-360	execution
none	none	 And may God have mercy on your soul X Execution The hours of waiting were blurred for Doc 
922_132299_000003_000001	train-clean-360	There were periods when fear clogged his throat and left him gasping with the need to scream and beat his cell walls 
922_132299_000003_000002	train-clean-360	There were also times when it didn t seem to matter and when his only thoughts were for the villages and the plague 
922_132299_000004_000000	train-clean-360	They brought him the papers where he was painted as a monster beside whom Jack the Ripper and Albrecht Delier were gentle amateurs 
922_132299_000004_000001	train-clean-360	They were trying to focus all fear and resentment on him 
922_132299_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Maybe it was working There were screaming crowds outside the jail and the noise of their hatred was strong enough to carry through even the atmosphere of Mars But there were also signs that the Lobby was worried as if afraid that some attempt might still be made to rescue him 
922_132299_000005_000000	train-clean-360	He d looked forward to the trip to the airport as a way of judging public reaction 
922_132299_000005_000001	train-clean-360	But apparently the Lobby had no desire to test that The guards led him up to the roof of the jail where a rocket was waiting 
922_132299_000005_000002	train-clean-360	The landing space was too small for one of the station shuttles but a little Northport Southport shuttle was parked there after what must have been a difficult set down 
922_132299_000005_000003	train-clean-360	The guards tested Doc s manacles and forced him into the shuttle 
922_132299_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Inside Chris was waiting carrying an official automatic 
922_132299_000006_000001	train-clean-360	There was also a young pilot looking nervous and unhappy 
922_132299_000006_000002	train-clean-360	He was muttering under his breath as the guards locked Doc s legs to a seat and left 
922_132299_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 All right Chris ordered 
922_132299_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 Up ship 
922_132299_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 I tell you we re overweight with you 
922_132299_000008_000001	train-clean-360	I wasn t counting on three for the trip the pilot protested 
922_132299_000008_000002	train-clean-360	 The only thing that will get this into orbit with the station is faith 
922_132299_000008_000003	train-clean-360	I m loaded with every drop of fuel she ll hold and it still isn t enough 
922_132299_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 That s your problem Chris told him firmly 
922_132299_000009_000001	train-clean-360	 You ve got your orders and so have I Up ship 
none	none	If she had her own worries about the shuttle she didn t show it 
922_132299_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Chris had never been afraid to do what she felt she should 
922_132299_000010_000002	train-clean-360	The pilot stared at her doubtfully and finally turned back to his controls still muttering 
922_132299_000011_000000	train-clean-360	The shuttle lifted sluggishly but there was no great difficulty 
922_132299_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Doc could see that there was even some fuel remaining when they slipped into the tube at the orbital station 
922_132299_000011_000002	train-clean-360	Chris went out and other guards came in to free him 
922_132299_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 So long doctor Feldman the pilot called softly as they led him out Then the guards shoved him through the airlock into the station 
none	none	Fifteen minutes later he was locked into one of the cabins of the Iroquois with all his possessions stacked beside him 
922_132299_000013_000000	train-clean-360	He grinned wryly 
none	none	As an honest worker on the Navaho he d been treated like an animal Now as a human fiend he was installed in a luxury cabin of the finest ship of the fleet with constant spin to give a feeling of weight and more room than the entire tube crew had known 
922_132299_000014_000000	train-clean-360	He roamed the cabin until he found a little collapsible table 
922_132299_000014_000001	train-clean-360	He set the electron microscope up on that and plugged it in 
922_132299_000014_000002	train-clean-360	It seemed a shame that good equipment should be wasted along with his life 
922_132299_000014_000003	train-clean-360	He wondered if they would really throw it out into space with him 
922_132299_000014_000004	train-clean-360	Probably they would 
922_132299_000015_000000	train-clean-360	He pushed a button on the call board over the table and asked for the steward 
922_132299_000015_000001	train-clean-360	There was a long wait as if the procedure were being checked with some authority but finally he received a surly acknowledgement Steward 
none	none	Whatcha want
922_132299_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 How s the chance of getting some food 
922_132299_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 You re on first class 
922_132299_000018_000000	train-clean-360	They could afford it Doc decided 
922_132299_000018_000001	train-clean-360	He wouldn t cost them much considering the distance he was going 
922_132299_000018_000002	train-clean-360	 Bring me two complete dinners one Earth normal and one Mars normal 
922_132299_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Okay Feldman 
none	none	But if you think you can suicide that way you re wrong You may be sick but you ll be alive when they dump you 
922_132299_000020_000000	train-clean-360	A sharp click interrupted him 
922_132299_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 That s enough Steward 
922_132299_000020_000002	train-clean-360	Captain Everts speaking 
922_132299_000020_000003	train-clean-360	doctor Feldman you have my apologies 
922_132299_000020_000004	train-clean-360	Until you reach your destination you are my passenger and entitled to every consideration of any other passenger except freedom of movement through the ship 
922_132299_000020_000005	train-clean-360	I am always available for legitimate complaints 
none	none	Feldman shook his head 
922_132299_000021_000001	train-clean-360	He d heard of such men 
922_132299_000021_000002	train-clean-360	But he d thought the species extinct 
922_132299_000022_000000	train-clean-360	The steward brought his food in a thoroughly chastened manner 
922_132299_000022_000001	train-clean-360	He managed to find space for it and came to attention 
none	none	Is that all sir 
922_132299_000023_000000	train-clean-360	For a moment as the smell of real steak reached him Doc regretted the fact that his metabolism had been switched 
none	none	Then he shrugged 
922_132299_000023_000002	train-clean-360	A little wouldn t hurt him though there was no proper nourishment in it 
922_132299_000023_000003	train-clean-360	He squeezed some of the gravy and bits of meat into one of his bottles sticking to his purpose then he fell to on the rest 
922_132299_000023_000004	train-clean-360	But after a few bites it was queerly unsatisfactory 
922_132299_000023_000005	train-clean-360	The seemingly unappealing Mars normal ragout suited his current tastes better after all 
922_132299_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Once the steward had cleared away the dishes Doc went to work 
922_132299_000024_000001	train-clean-360	It was better than wasting his time in dread 
922_132299_000024_000002	train-clean-360	He might even be able to leave some notes behind 
922_132299_000025_000000	train-clean-360	A gong sounded and a red light warned him that acceleration was due 
922_132299_000025_000001	train-clean-360	He finished with his bottles put them into the incubator and piled into his bunk swallowing one of the tablets of morphetal the ship furnished 
922_132299_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Acceleration had ended and a simple breakfast was waiting when he awoke 
none	none	There was also a red flashing light over the call board 
922_132299_000026_000002	train-clean-360	He flipped the switch while reaching for the coffee 
922_132299_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Captain Everts the speaker said 
none	none	May I join you in your cabin
922_132299_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Come ahead Feldman invited 
922_132299_000028_000001	train-clean-360	He cut off the switch and glanced at the clock on the wall 
922_132299_000028_000002	train-clean-360	There were less than eleven hours left to him 
none	none	Everts was a trim man of forty erect but not rigid 
922_132299_000029_000001	train-clean-360	There was neither friendliness nor hostility in his glance 
922_132299_000029_000002	train-clean-360	His words were courteous as Doc motioned toward the tray of breakfast 
922_132299_000029_000003	train-clean-360	 I ve already eaten thank you 
922_132299_000030_000000	train-clean-360	He accepted a chair 
922_132299_000030_000001	train-clean-360	His voice was apologetic when he began 
922_132299_000030_000002	train-clean-360	 This is a personal matter which I perhaps have no right to bring up 
922_132299_000030_000003	train-clean-360	But my wife is greatly worried about this plague 
none	none	I violate no confidence in telling you there is considerable unease even on Earth according to messages I have received 
922_132299_000030_000005	train-clean-360	The ship physician believes missus Everts may have the plague but isn t sure of the symptoms 
none	none	I understand you are quite expert 
922_132299_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Doc wondered about the physician 
922_132299_000031_000001	train-clean-360	Apparently there was another man who placed his patients above anything else though he was probably meticulous about obeying all actual rules 
922_132299_000031_000002	train-clean-360	There was no law against listening to a pariah at least 
922_132299_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 When did she have Selznik s migraine he asked 
none	none	About thirteen years ago 
922_132299_000033_000001	train-clean-360	We went through it together shortly after having our metabolism switched during the food shortage of eighty eight 
922_132299_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Doc felt carefully at the base of the Captain s skull the swelling was there 
922_132299_000034_000001	train-clean-360	He asked a few questions but there could be no doubt 
922_132299_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Both of you must have it Captain though it won t mature for another year 
922_132299_000035_000001	train-clean-360	I m sorry 
none	none	There s no hope then 
922_132299_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Doc studied the man 
922_132299_000037_000001	train-clean-360	But Everts wasn t the sort to dicker even for his life 
922_132299_000037_000002	train-clean-360	 Nothing that I ve found Captain 
922_132299_000037_000003	train-clean-360	I have a clue but I m still working on it 
922_132299_000037_000004	train-clean-360	Perhaps if I could leave a few notes for your physician 
922_132299_000038_000000	train-clean-360	It was Everts turn to shake his head 
922_132299_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 I m sorry doctor Feldman 
922_132299_000038_000002	train-clean-360	I have orders to burn out your cabin when you leave 
922_132299_000038_000003	train-clean-360	But thank you He got to his feet and left as quietly and erectly as he had entered 
922_132299_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Doc tore up his notes bitterly 
922_132299_000039_000001	train-clean-360	He paced his cabin slowly reading out the hours while his eyes lingered on the little bottle of cultures 
none	none	At times the fear grew in him but he mastered it 
922_132299_000039_000003	train-clean-360	There was half an hour left when he began opening the little bottles and making his films 
922_132299_000040_000000	train-clean-360	He was still not finished when steps echoed down the hall but he was reasonably sure of his results 
922_132299_000040_000001	train-clean-360	The bug could not grow in Earth normal tissue 
922_132299_000041_000000	train-clean-360	Three men entered the room 
922_132299_000041_000001	train-clean-360	One of them dressed in a spacesuit held out another suit to him 
none	none	The other two began gathering up everything in the cabin and stowing it neatly into a sack designed to protect freight for a limited time in a vacuum 
922_132299_000042_000000	train-clean-360	Doc forced his hands to steadiness with foolish pride and began climbing into the suit 
922_132299_000042_000001	train-clean-360	He reached for the helmet but the man shook his head pointing to the oxygen gauge 
922_132299_000042_000002	train-clean-360	There would be exactly one hour s supply of oxygen when he was thrown out and it still lacked five minutes of the deadline 
none	none	They marched him down the hallway to meet Everts coming toward them There were still three minutes left when they reached the airlock with its inner door already open 
922_132299_000043_000001	train-clean-360	The spacesuited man climbed into it and began strapping down so that the rush of air would not sweep him outward when the other seal was released 
922_132299_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Doc had saved one bracky weed 
922_132299_000044_000001	train-clean-360	Now he raised it to his lips fumbling for a light 
922_132299_000045_000000	train-clean-360	Everts stepped forward and flipped a lighter 
922_132299_000045_000001	train-clean-360	Doc inhaled deeply 
none	none	Fear was thick in every muscle and he needed the smoke desperately Then he caught himself
922_132299_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Better change your metabolism back to Earth normal Captain Everts he said and his voice was so normal that he hardly recognized it 
922_132299_000047_000000	train-clean-360	Everts eyes widened briefly 
922_132299_000047_000001	train-clean-360	The man bowed faintly 
922_132299_000047_000002	train-clean-360	 Thank you doctor Feldman 
922_132299_000048_000000	train-clean-360	It was ridiculous impossible and yet there was a curious relief at the formality of it 
922_132299_000048_000001	train-clean-360	It was like something from a play too unreal to affect his life 
922_132299_000049_000000	train-clean-360	Everts nodded to the man holding the helmet 
922_132299_000049_000001	train-clean-360	Doc dropped his bracky weed and felt the helmet snap down 
922_132299_000049_000002	train-clean-360	A hiss of oxygen reached him and the suit ballooned out 
922_132299_000049_000003	train-clean-360	There was no gravity the two men handed him up easily to the one in the airlock while the inner seal began to close 
922_132299_000050_000000	train-clean-360	There was still ten seconds to go according to the big chronometer that had been installed in the lock 
922_132299_000050_000001	train-clean-360	The spaceman used it in tying the sack of possessions firmly to Doc s suit 
922_132299_000051_000000	train-clean-360	A red light went on 
922_132299_000051_000001	train-clean-360	The man caught Doc and held him against the outer seal 
922_132299_000051_000002	train-clean-360	The red light blinked 
922_132299_000051_000003	train-clean-360	Four seconds three two 
none	none	There was a sudden heavy thudding sound and the Iroquois seemed to jerk sideways slightly 
922_132299_000052_000001	train-clean-360	The spaceman s face swung around in surprise 
922_132299_000053_000000	train-clean-360	The red light blinked and stayed on 
none	none	Zero 
922_132299_000054_000000	train-clean-360	The outer seal snapped open and the spaceman heaved 
922_132299_000054_000001	train-clean-360	Air exploded outwards and Doc went with it 
922_132299_000054_000002	train-clean-360	He was alone in space gliding away from the ship with oxygen hissing softly through the valve and ticking away his life 
none	none	XI Convert Feldman fought for control of himself forced himself to think to hold onto his sanity 
922_132300_000004_000001	train-clean-360	It was sheer stupidity since nothing could have been more merciful than to lose this reality 
922_132300_000004_000002	train-clean-360	But the will to be himself was stronger than logic 
922_132300_000004_000003	train-clean-360	And bit by bit he forced the fear and horror away from him until he could examine his situation 
922_132300_000005_000000	train-clean-360	He was spinning slowly so that stars ahead of him seemed to crawl across his view 
922_132300_000005_000001	train-clean-360	The ship was retreating from him already hundreds of yards away 
922_132300_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Mars was a shrunken pill far away 
922_132300_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Then something blinked to one side 
922_132300_000006_000001	train-clean-360	He turned his head to stare 
922_132300_000007_000000	train-clean-360	A little ship was less than three hundred yards away 
922_132300_000007_000001	train-clean-360	He recognized it as a life raft 
922_132300_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Now his spin brought him around to face it and he saw it was parallelling his course 
none	none	The ejection of the life raft must have caused the thump he d heard before he was cast adrift 
922_132300_000008_000000	train-clean-360	It meant someone was trying to save him 
none	none	It meant life 
922_132300_000009_000000	train-clean-360	He flailed his arms and beat his legs together senselessly trying to force himself closer while trying to guess who could have taken the chance 
none	none	No one he could think of could have booked passage on the Iroquois 
922_132300_000009_000002	train-clean-360	There wasn t that much free money in the villages 
922_132300_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Something flashed a hot blue and the little ship leaped forward Whoever was handling it knew nothing about piloting 
922_132300_000010_000001	train-clean-360	It picked up too much speed at too great an angle 
922_132300_000011_000000	train-clean-360	Again blue spurts came but this time matters were even worse 
922_132300_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Then there was a long wait before a third try was made 
922_132300_000011_000002	train-clean-360	He estimated the course 
922_132300_000011_000003	train-clean-360	It would miss him by a good hundred feet but it was probably the best the amateur pilot could do 
922_132300_000011_000004	train-clean-360	The ship drifted closer but to one side 
922_132300_000011_000005	train-clean-360	It would soon pass him completely 
922_132300_000012_000000	train-clean-360	A spacesuited figure suddenly appeared in the tiny airlock holding a coil of rope 
922_132300_000012_000001	train-clean-360	The rope shot out well thrown 
922_132300_000012_000002	train-clean-360	But it was too short 
922_132300_000012_000003	train-clean-360	It would pass within ten feet and might as well have been ten miles for all the good it would do him 
922_132300_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Every film he had seen on space seemed to form a mad jumble in his mind but he seized on the first idea he could remember 
922_132300_000013_000001	train-clean-360	He inhaled deeply and yanked the oxygen tank free 
922_132300_000013_000002	train-clean-360	An automatic seal on the suit cut off the connection 
922_132300_000013_000003	train-clean-360	He aimed the hissing bottle fumbling for the manual valve 
922_132300_000014_000000	train-clean-360	It almost worked 
922_132300_000014_000001	train-clean-360	It kicked him toward the rope slightly but most of the energy was wasted in setting him into a wilder spin 
922_132300_000014_000002	train-clean-360	He blinked trying to spot the rope 
922_132300_000014_000003	train-clean-360	It was within five feet now 
none	none	Again he waited until he seemed to be in position 
922_132300_000015_000001	train-clean-360	This time he threw the bottle away from it 
922_132300_000015_000002	train-clean-360	It added spin to his vertical axis but the rope came into view within arm s reach 
922_132300_000016_000000	train-clean-360	He grasped it just as his lungs seemed about to burst 
922_132300_000016_000001	train-clean-360	He couldn t hold on long enough to tie the rope 
922_132300_000017_000000	train-clean-360	His lungs gave up suddenly collapsing and then sucking in greedily Clean air rushed in letting his head clear 
922_132300_000017_000001	train-clean-360	He d forgotten that the inflated suit held enough oxygen for several minutes 
922_132300_000018_000000	train-clean-360	His body struck the edge of the airlock and a hand jerked him inside The outer seal was slammed shut and locked and there was a hiss of air entering 
922_132300_000019_000000	train-clean-360	He threw back his helmet just as Chris Ryan jerked hers off 
922_132300_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Her voice shook almost hysterically 
922_132300_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 Thank God 
922_132300_000020_000002	train-clean-360	Dan I almost gave up 
922_132300_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 I liked the air out there better he told her bitterly 
922_132300_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 If you ll open the lock again I ll leave 
none	none	Or am I supposed to believe this is rescue and that you came along just to save me
922_132300_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 I came along to see you killed as you know very well 
922_132300_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Saving you wasn t in my orders 
922_132300_000023_000000	train-clean-360	He grunted and reached for the handle that would release the outer lock Better get back inside if you don t want to blow out with me 
922_132300_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 It s up to you Dan she told him and there was all the sincerity in the world in her blue eyes 
922_132300_000024_000001	train-clean-360	 I m on your side now 
922_132300_000025_000000	train-clean-360	He began counting on his fingers 
922_132300_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 Let s see 
none	none	The spare battery the delay in arresting me the choice of Matthews
922_132300_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 It was all true Anger began to grow in her eyes 
none	none	Dan Feldman you get inside this raft 
922_132300_000026_000002	train-clean-360	If you don t care about me you might consider the people dying of the plague who need you 
922_132300_000027_000000	train-clean-360	She d played her trump and it took the round 
922_132300_000027_000001	train-clean-360	He followed her 
922_132300_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 All right he said grudgingly 
922_132300_000028_000001	train-clean-360	 Spill your story 
922_132300_000029_000000	train-clean-360	She held out a copy of a space radiogram addressed to missus D E Everts and signed by one of the best doctors on the Lobby Board of Directors 
922_132300_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Regret confirm diagnosis 
922_132300_000030_000001	train-clean-360	Topsecret 
922_132300_000030_000002	train-clean-360	Repeat topsecret Martian fever incubates fourteen years believed highly fatal 
922_132300_000030_000003	train-clean-360	No cure research beginning immediately 
922_132300_000030_000004	train-clean-360	Penalty violation topsecret death all concerned 
922_132300_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 missus Everts rates a topsecret break Doc commented dryly 
922_132300_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 Come off it Chris 
922_132300_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 She s the daughter of Elmers of Space Lobby Chris answered 
922_132300_000032_000001	train-clean-360	She pointed to the message underlining words with her finger 
none	none	Fourteen years You couldn t have caused it Highly fatal And people are being told it s only a skin disease Research beginning But you ve already done most of the research 
922_132300_000032_000005	train-clean-360	I can see that now 
922_132300_000032_000006	train-clean-360	I can see a lot of things 
922_132300_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 You ve got me beat then he said 
922_132300_000033_000001	train-clean-360	 I can t see how such a reformed young noblewoman calmly walked over and stole a life raft 
922_132300_000033_000002	train-clean-360	I can t see how your brilliant mind concocted this whole scheme in almost no time And to be honest I can t even see why Medical Lobby decided to save me at the last minute and sent you to do the job 
922_132300_000033_000003	train-clean-360	You didn t have to spy out knowledge from me 
922_132300_000033_000004	train-clean-360	I ve been trying all along to get it to your Research division 
922_132300_000034_000000	train-clean-360	She sighed and dropped onto a little seat 
922_132300_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 I can t prove my motives 
922_132300_000035_000001	train-clean-360	You ll just have to believe me 
922_132300_000035_000002	train-clean-360	But it wasn t hard to do what I ve done 
922_132300_000035_000003	train-clean-360	That shuttle pilot was found in a routine check stowed away on the life raft 
922_132300_000035_000004	train-clean-360	I was with Captain Everts when he was found so I discovered how to get into the raft 
922_132300_000035_000005	train-clean-360	And I heard his whole confession 
922_132300_000035_000006	train-clean-360	He wasn t the real pilot 
922_132300_000035_000007	train-clean-360	He d come from the villages to save you 
922_132300_000035_000008	train-clean-360	The whole scheme was his 
922_132300_000035_000009	train-clean-360	I just used it hoping I could reach you 
922_132300_000036_000000	train-clean-360	As always her story had a convincing element she shouldn t have known The pilot s farewell addressing him as doctor Feldman had been too low for her to hear but it was something that fitted her story 
922_132300_000036_000001	train-clean-360	It was probably a deliberate clue to give him hope to assure him the villages were still trying 
922_132300_000036_000002	train-clean-360	It shook his confidence 
922_132300_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 And your motive your real motive he insisted 
922_132300_000038_000000	train-clean-360	She swore at him then began ripping off the spacesuit 
922_132300_000038_000001	train-clean-360	She turned her back pulling a thin blouse down from her neck 
922_132300_000038_000002	train-clean-360	He stared then reached out to touch the lump there 
none	none	So you ve had Selznik s migraine and know you re carrying plague 
922_132300_000039_000001	train-clean-360	And you ve decided your precious Lobby won t save you 
922_132300_000040_000000	train-clean-360	She dropped her eyes then raised them to meet his defiantly 
922_132300_000040_000001	train-clean-360	 I m not just scared and selfish 
922_132300_000040_000002	train-clean-360	Dad caught it too and it must be close to the time for him 
922_132300_000040_000003	train-clean-360	He switched to Mars normal when he was a liaison agent and never changed back 
922_132300_000040_000004	train-clean-360	Dan are we all going to have to die 
922_132300_000040_000005	train-clean-360	Can t you save him 
922_132300_000041_000000	train-clean-360	Feldman was out of his suit and at the control panel 
922_132300_000041_000001	train-clean-360	There was a manual lever which Chris must have used before 
922_132300_000041_000002	train-clean-360	It might work out here where there was room to maneuver and nothing to hit 
922_132300_000041_000003	train-clean-360	But trying to make a landing was going to be different 
922_132300_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Dan she repeated 
none	none	He shrugged I don t know 
922_132300_000043_000002	train-clean-360	They ve started research too late and they ll be under so much pressure that the real brains won t have a chance 
922_132300_000043_000003	train-clean-360	The topsecret stuff looks bad for research 
922_132300_000043_000004	train-clean-360	Maybe there s a cure 
922_132300_000043_000005	train-clean-360	It works in culture bottles but it may fail in person 
922_132300_000043_000006	train-clean-360	When I m convinced I m safe with you I may tell you about it 
922_132300_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh Her voice was low 
922_132300_000044_000001	train-clean-360	Then she sighed 
922_132300_000044_000002	train-clean-360	 I suppose I can understand why you hate me Dan 
922_132300_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t hate you 
922_132300_000045_000001	train-clean-360	I m too mixed up 
922_132300_000045_000002	train-clean-360	Tomorrow maybe but not now 
922_132300_000045_000003	train-clean-360	Shut up and let me see if I can figure out how to land this thing 
922_132300_000046_000000	train-clean-360	He found that the fuel tanks were nearly full but that still didn t leave much margin 
none	none	Mars must have been notified by Everts and be ready to pick the raft up 
922_132300_000046_000002	train-clean-360	He had to reach the wastelands away from any of the shuttle ports 
922_132300_000046_000003	train-clean-360	They had no aspirators however and they couldn t cover much territory in the spacesuits they would have to use 
none	none	It meant he d have to land close to a village where he was known 
922_132300_000047_000000	train-clean-360	He jockeyed the ship around by trial and error studying the manual that was lying prominently on the control panel 
922_132300_000047_000001	train-clean-360	According to the booklet the ship was simple to operate 
922_132300_000047_000002	train-clean-360	It was self leveling in an atmosphere and automatic flare computers were supposed to make it possible for an amateur to judge the rate of descent near the surface 
922_132300_000047_000003	train-clean-360	It looked reassuring and was probably written with that in mind 
922_132300_000048_000000	train-clean-360	Finally he reached for the control hoping he d figured his landing orbit reasonably well by simple logic 
922_132300_000048_000001	train-clean-360	He smoothed it out in the following hours as he watched the markings on Mars 
922_132300_000048_000002	train-clean-360	When they were near turnover point he began cranking the little gyroscope to swing the ship 
922_132300_000048_000003	train-clean-360	It saved fuel to turn without power and he wasn t sure he could have turned accurately by blasting 
922_132300_000049_000000	train-clean-360	He was gaining some proficiency however he felt 
922_132300_000049_000001	train-clean-360	But now he had to waste fuel and ruin his orbit again 
922_132300_000049_000002	train-clean-360	There was no way to practice maneuvering without actually doing so 
922_132300_000050_000000	train-clean-360	In the end he compromised leaving a small margin for a bad landing that would require a second attempt but with less practice than he wanted 
922_132300_000051_000000	train-clean-360	He had located Jake s village through the little telescope when he finally reached for the main blast control 
922_132300_000051_000001	train-clean-360	The thin haze of Mars atmosphere came rushing up while the blast lashed out 
none	none	Then they were in the outer fringes of the sky and the blast was beginning to show a corona that ruined visibility 
922_132300_000052_000000	train-clean-360	He turned to the flare computer and back to what he could see through the quartz viewport 
none	none	He was going to land about half a mile from the village as nearly as he could judge The computer seemed to work as it should The speed was within acceptable limits He gave up trying to see the ground and was forced to trust the machinery designed for amateur pilots The flare bloomed and he yanked down on the little lever It could have been worse They hit the ground bounced twice and turned over The ship was a mess when Feldman freed himself from the elastic straps of the seat Chris had shrieked as they hit but she was unbuckling herself now He threw her her spacesuit and one of the emergency bottles of oxygen from the rack Hurry up with that We ve sprung a leak and the pressure s dropping 
922_132300_000056_000000	train-clean-360	They were halfway to the village when a dozen tractors came racing up and Jake piled out of the lead one to drag the two in with him 
922_132300_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Heard about it from the broadcasts and figured you might land around here 
none	none	Good to see you Doc He started the tractor off at full speed back to the wastelands while Doc stared at the armed men who were riding the tractors 
922_132300_000058_000000	train-clean-360	Jake caught his look and nodded 
none	none	You re in enemy territory Doc There s a war going on XII War Sometimes it seemed to Doc that war was nothing but an endurance race to see how many times they could run before they were bombed He was just beginning to drop off to sleep after a long trip for the sixth consecutive day when the little alarm shrilled He sighed and shook Chris awake Again she protested But she got up and began helping him pack Jake came in his eyes weary pulling on the old jacket with the big star on its sleeve Doc hadn t been too surprised to learn that Jake was the actual leader of the rebels Shuttles spotted taking off this way And I still can t find where the leak is They haven t missed our location once this week Here give me that He took the electron mike that had been among Doc s possessions but Chris recaptured it I can manage she told him and headed out for the tractor where Lou was waiting Doc scowled after her He and Jake had been watching her She was too useful to Doc s research to be turned away but they didn t trust her yet So far however they had found nothing wrong with her conduct Still He swung suddenly into Jake s tractor Just remembered something How d they find me that time I stopped in the tractor to use the mike I was pretty well hidden and no tracks last in the sand long enough for them to have followed But they were there when I came to Somehow they must have put a radio tracer on me Jake waited while they lighted up his eyes suddenly bright You mean something you got from her house was bugged It figures And I ve still got all the stuff Now they find wherever we set up headquarters though they ve always managed to miss my laboratory even when they ve hit the troops around us Jake I think it s the microscope Doc managed to push enough junk off one of the seats to make a cramped bed and stretched out Sure we figured they sent her because they want to keep tabs on what I discover They ve finally gotten scared of the plague and she s the perfect Judas goat But they have to have some way to get in touch with her I ll bet there s a tracer in the mike and a switch so she can modulate it or key it to send out Morse Yeah Jake nodded Well she does her own dirty work I might get to like her if she was on our side Okay Doc If they ve put things into the mike I ve got a boy who ll find and fix it so she won t guess it s been touched Doc relaxed For the moment there would be no power in the instrument nor any excuse for her to use it But she must have handled some secret arrangement during the work periods She used the mike more than he did The switch could be camouflaged easily enough If anyone detected the signal they d probably only think it was some leak in the electrical circuit Far away the shuttle rockets had appeared as tiny dots in the sky They were standing on their tails a second later just off the ground letting the full force of their blasts bake the area where headquarters had been Jake watched grimly driving by something close to instinct Then he looked back Know anything about a doctor Harkness Not much except that he protested sealing off the villages Why He and five other doctors were picked up trying to get through to us Claimed they wanted to give us medical help We can use them God knows I guess I ll have to chance it They stopped at a halfway village and hid the tractors before looking for a place to rest Doc found Chris curled up asleep against the microscope He had a hard time getting her to leave it in the tractor but she was too genuinely tired to put up any real argument Jake reported in the morning before they set out again You were right Doc It was a nice job of work Must have taken the best guys in Southport to hide the circuit so well But it s safe now It just makes a kind of meaningless static nobody can trace Maybe we can get you a permanent lab now Doc debated again having Chris left behind and decided against it The Lobby was determined to let him find a cure for them if he could That meant Chris would work herself to exhaustion trying to help Let her think she was doing it for the Lobby It was time she was on the receiving end of a double cross It s a stinking way to run a war he decided Jake chuckled without much humor It s the war you wanted remember They forced our hand but it had to come sometime Right now the Lobby s fighting to get their hands on your work before we can use it they re just using holding tactics which helps our side And we re hoping you get the cure so we can win With that maybe we ll whip them It was a crazy war with each side killing more of its own men than of the enemy The runners were increasing and Jake s army was learning to shoot the poor devils mercifully and go on They knew at least that there was no current danger of infection In the Lobby towns more were dying of panic in their efforts to escape the runners Desert towns had joined the villages reluctantly but inevitably to give the rebels nearly three quarters of the total population But the Lobby forces and the few cities held most of the real fighting equipment and they were ready to wait until Earth could send out unmanned rockets loaded with atomics which could cut through space at ten times normal speed There were vague lines of battle but time was the vital factor The Lobbies waited to steal a cure for the plague and the villages waited until they could announce it and demand surrender as its price It looked as if both sides were doomed to disappointment however He and Chris had put in every spare minute between moving and the minimum of sleep in searching for something that would check the disease It couldn t grow in an Earth normal body but it didn t die either And there wasn t enough normal food available to permit the switch over for more than a handful of people Even Earth was out of luck since eighty percent of her population ate synthetics There were ways to synthesize Earth normal food but they were still hopelessly inefficient Jake had ordered one of the villages to rebuild their plant for such a purpose while another was producing the enzyme that would permit switching But it looked hopeless for more than a few of the most valuable men No progress Jake asked for the hundredth time Doc grinned wryly A lot but no help We ve found a fine accelerator for the bug We can speed up its incubation or even make someone already infected catch it all over again But we can t slow it down or stop it The new laboratory was still being fitted when they arrived It had been dug into one of the few real cliffs in this section of Mars The power plant had been installed complete with a steam plant that would operate off sunlight in the daytime through a series of heat valves that took in a lot of warm air and produced smaller amounts hot enough to boil water I ll see you whenever I can Jake said But mostly you re going to be somewhat isolated so they won t trace you Let them think they goofed with the shuttles and hit you and Chris Anything you need Guinea pigs Doc told him sarcastically It was meant as a joke though a highly bitter one Jake nodded and left them Doc opened the cots as Chris came in not bothering to unpack the equipment Hit the sack Chris he told her She looked at him doubtfully You almost said that the way you d address a human being Dan You re slipping One of these days you ll like me again Maybe He was too tired to argue I doubt it though Forget it and get some sleep She watched him silently until he got up to turn out the light Then she sighed heavily Dan Yeah I never got a divorce The publicity would have been bad But anyway we re still married That s nice He swung to face her briefly And they found the radio in the microscope Better get to sleep Chris Oh It was a quiet exclamation barely audible There was a sound that might have been a sniffle if it had come from anyone else Then she rolled over All right Dan I still want to help you He cursed himself for a stupid fool for telling her Fatigue was ruining what judgment he had From now on he d have to watch her every minute Or had she really seen the value of the research by now She wasn t a fool It should have registered on even her stubborn mind But he was too sleepy to think about it She had breakfast ready in the morning She made no comment on what had been said during the night Instead she began discussing a way to keep one of the organic antibiotics from splitting into simpler compounds when they tried to switch it over to Mars normal They were both hopelessly bad chemists and biologists but there was no one else to do the work Chris worked harder than ever during the day Just after sundown Jake came in with a heavy box He dropped it onto the floor Mice Doc ripped off the cover exposing fine screening There were at least six dozen mice inside Harkness found them Jake explained A hormone extraction plant used them for testing some of the products Had them sent by regular shipments from Earth Getting them cost a couple of men but Harkness claims it s worth it He s a good man on a raid Here He d gone to the doorway again and came back with another box this one crammed with bottles and boxes They had quite a laboratory and Harkness picked out whatever he thought you could use Chris and Doc were going through it The labels were engineering ones but the chemical formulae were identification enough There were dozens of chemicals they hadn t hoped to get Anything else Doc finally asked as they began arranging the supplies More runners A lot more We re still holding things down but it s reaching a limit Panic will start in the camps if this keeps on But that s my worry You stick to yours Several of the new chemicals showed promise in the tubes But two of them proved fatal to the mice and the others were completely innocuous in the little animal s bodies both to mouse and to germ The plague was much hardier in contact with living cells than in the artificial environment of the culture jars They lost seven mice in two days but that seemed unimportant the females were already living up to their reputations nearly all pregnant Doc didn t know the gestation period but he remembered that it was short Funny they all started at the same time he commented Must have been shipped out separately or else been kept apart while they were switched over to Mars normal Something interrupted their habits anyhow A few nights later they learned what it was There was a horrible squealing that woke him out of the depths of his sleep Chris was already at the light switch As light came on they turned to the mouse box All the animals were charging about in their limited space their little legs driving madly and their mouths open What they lacked in size they made up in numbers and the din was terrific But it didn t last One by one the mice began dropping to the floor of the cage In fifteen minutes they were all dead It was obviously the plague contracted after having their metabolism switched Women were sterile for some time after Selznik s migraine struck and the same must have been true of the mice They must have contracted the plague at about the same time and reached fertility together Somehow the plague incubation period had been shortened to fit their life span the disease was nothing if not adaptive Chris prepared a slide in dull silence The familiar cell was there when Doc looked through the microscope He picked up one of the little creatures and cut it open removing one of the foetuses Make a film of that he suggested She worked rapidly scraping out the almost microscopic brain dissolving out the fatty substance and transferring the result to a film This time even at full magnification there was no sign of the filaments that were always present in diseased flesh The results were the same for the other samples they made Something about the very young animal or a secretion from the mother s organs keeps the bug from working Doc reached for a bracky weed and accepted a light from Chris without thinking of it Every kid I ve heard about contracted the plague between the second and third year None are born with it none get it earlier I ve suspected this but now here s confirmation Chris began preparing specimens while Doc got busy with tubes of the culture They d have to test various fluids from the tiny bodies but there were enough cultures prepared Then if the substance only inhibited growth there would be a long slow test if it killed the bugs they might know more quickly Jake came in before the final tests but waited on them Doc was studying a film in the microscope He suddenly motioned excitedly for Chris See the filaments They re completely disintegrated And there s one of the big cells broken open We ve got it It s in the blood of the foetus And it must be in the blood of newborn children too Jake looked at the slide but his face was doubtful Maybe you ve got something Doc I hope so And I hope you can use it He shook his head wearily We need good news right now A couple of big rockets just reached the station and they ve been sending shuttles back and forth a mile a minute Nobody can figure how they got here so fast or what they re for But it doesn t look good for us XIII Susceptibility Doc could feel the tension in the village where GHQ was temporarily located long before they were close enough for details to register The people were gathered in clusters staring at the sky where the station must be A few were pacing up and down gesticulating with tight sweeps of their arms One woman suddenly went into even more violent action She leaped into the air and then took off at a rapid trot then a run Her hands were tearing at her clothes and her mouth seemed to be working violently She was halfway to the top of the nearest dune before a rifle cracked She dropped to twitch once and lie still Almost with her death another figure leaped from one of the houses his face bare of the necessary aspirator He took off at a violent run but he was falling from lack of air before the bullet ended his struggles The people suddenly began to move apart as if trying to get away from each other For weeks they had faced the horror with courage now it was finally too much for them Tension mounted as no news came from the cities Doc noticed that it seemed to aggravate or speed up the disease He saw three men shot in the next half hour He was trying to calm them with word of a possible cure for the plague but their reactions were as curiously dull as those of Jake had been As he spoke they faced him with set expressions At his mention of the need for the blood of young children they turned from him sullenly silent Jake came over nodding unhappily It s what I was afraid might happen Doc George Lynn Tell Doc what s wrong Lynn was reluctant but he finally stumbled out his explanation It ain t like you Doc Comes from that Lobby woman you got It s her dirty idea We ve seen the Lobby doctors cutting open our kids poisoning their blood and bleeding them dry That ain t gonna happen again Doc You tell her it ain t Doc swore as he realized their ignorance An unexplained vaccination looked like poisoning of the blood But he couldn t understand the bleeding part until Jake filled him in Northport infant s wing Each department has its own blood bank and donation is compulsory Southport started it a couple months ago too The long arm of the Lobby had reached out again Now if he ever got them to try the treatment it would be only after long sessions of preparing them with the facts and there was hardly enough time for the crucial work By afternoon Judge Ben Wilson reached them His voice shook with fatigue as he climbed up to address the crowd through a power megaphone Southport s going crazy He had to pause for breath between each sentence Earth s pulling back all the important people They re packing them into the ships They re leaving only colonials with no Earth rights Those ships left when they decided the plague was coming from here They won t let anybody back until the plague is licked There won t be an Earth technician on Mars tomorrow No bombs someone called No bombs The ships must have started before you rebelled maybe meant honestly to save their own kind But now it s a military action and don t think it won t mean trouble The poor devils in the city bet on the wrong horse Now they can t run their food factories or anything else for long Not without technicians They ve got to whip you now Up to this time they ve been fighting for the Lobbies Now they ll fight you for their own bellies to get your supplies And they ve still got shuttle rockets and fuel for them Now beat it I gotta confer with Jake Doc started after the judge but doctor Harkness caught his arm and drew him aside Chris followed I ve found another epidemic Harkness told them Over at Marconi It s kept me on the run all night and now half the village is down with it Starts like a common cold runs a fair fever and the skin breaks out all over with bright red dots He went on describing it Chris began asking him about what medical supplies he had brought with him pilfered from Northport hospital She seemed to know what it was but refused to say until she saw the cases Doc also preferred to wait Sometimes things weren t as bad as they seemed though usually they were worse Marconi was dead to all outward appearances with nobody on the streets It had been a village of great hopes a week before since this was where they had decided to experiment with switching the people back to Earth normal They d had the best chance of survival of anyone on Mars until this came up Three people lay on the beds in the first house Harkness led them to The room was darkened and a man was stumbling around trying to tend the others though the little spots showed on his skin He grinned weakly Hi Doc I guess we re making a lot of trouble ain t we Chris gave Doc no chance to answer Just as I thought Measles Plain old fashioned measles Figured so the sick man said Like my brother back on Earth The others looked doubtful but Doc reassured them Chris should know she d worked in a swanky hospital where the patients were mostly Earth normal Measles was one of the diseases which was foiled by the metabolism switch Well at least they wouldn t have to be quarantined here Chris finished treating the family with impersonal efficiency discussing the symptoms loudly with Harkness It s a good thing it isn t serious No Harkness answered bitterly Not serious It s only killed five children and three adults so far It would here Doc agreed unhappily He led Chris out of the room on the pretext of washing his hands It s serious enough to force us to abandon the whole idea of going back to Earth normal Measles today smallpox tuberculosis scarlet fever and everything else tomorrow These people have lived Mars normal so long their natural immunity has been destroyed On Earth where the disease was everywhere kids used to pick up some immunity with constant exposure even without what might be called a case of the disease Here the blood has no reason to build antibodies They can be killed by things people used to laugh at How the disease got here I don t know But it s here So we ll have to give up the idea of switching back to Earth normal He gathered up one of the kits and started toward the other houses And Lord knows how long it will take to get the blood for the other treatment even if it works They worked as a team for a while with Harkness frowning as he watched Chris Finally the young doctor stopped Chris outside the fifth house These are my patients doctor Ryan I left the Lobby because I didn t believe colonials were mere livestock I still feel the same I appreciate your help in diagnosis and methods of treatment But I can t let you handle my patients this way Dan She swung around with eyes glazing Dan are you going to stand for that I think you d better wait in the tractor Chris He was lucky enough to catch the kit she threw at him before its precious contents spilled But it wasn t luck that guided his hand to the back of her skirt hard enough to leave it stinging Her face froze and she stormed out A moment later they heard the tractor start off But Doc had no time to think of her He and Harkness split up and began covering the streets house by house while he passed on the word to abandon the metabolism switch and go back to Mars normal Jake sent two other doctors to relieve them late in the evening Things were somewhat quieter at GHQ as Doc reported the events at Marconi Where s doctor Ryan Jake asked at last Doc exchanged glances with Harkness She isn t in the lab Wasn t there an hour ago Doc cursed himself for letting her go With the knowledge that the radio in the mike was disabled she d obviously grabbed the first chance to report back And with her had gone news of the only cure they had found Jake took it as philosophically as he could though it was a heavy blow to his hopes They spent half the night looking for her tractor on the chance that she might have gotten lost or broken down but there was no sign of it She was waiting in the laboratory when he returned at dawn Her face was dirty and her uniform was a mess But she was smiling She got up to greet him holding out two large bottles Infant plasma straight from Southport And if you think I had it easy lying my way in and out of the hospital you re a fool Dan Feldman If the man who took my place there hadn t been a native idiot I never would have gotten away with it The things he had suspected could still be right he realized She could have reported everything to the Lobby It was a better explanation than her vague account of bullying her way in and out But she d had a rough drive and he wanted the plasma Curiously he was glad to have her back with him He reached out a hand for the bottles She put the bottle on the table and grabbed up a short bladed knife Not so fast she cried Her eyes were blazing now Dan Feldman if you touch those bottles until you ve crawled across the floor on your face and apologized for the way you treated me the last few days I ll cut your damned heart out He shook his head chuckling at the picture she made There were times when he could almost see why he d married her All right Chris he gave in I ll be darned if I ll crawl but you ve earned an apology Okay She sighed uncertainly Then she nodded and began changing for work XIV Immunity They worked through the day in what seemed to be armed truce There was no coffee waiting for him when he awoke next as he d come to expect but he didn t comment He went to where she was already working checking on the results of the plasma on the cultures The response had been slower than with the mouse blood but now the bugs seemed to be dead The filaments were destroyed and there were no signs of the big cells It seemed to be a cure at least in the culture bottles We ll need volunteers he decided There should be animals but we don t have any At least this stuff isn t toxic We need a natural immune and someone infected Two of each so one can be treated and the other used for a control Makes four Not enough to be sure but it will have to do Two Chris corrected You re not infected I am Two others he agreed I ll get them from Jake Most of GHQ was out on the street but Doc found Jake inside the big schoolroom where he enjoyed his early morning bracky and coffee The chief listened and agreed at once turning to the others in the room Who s had the jumping headache Okay Swanee Who never had it He blinked in surprise as three men nodded out of the eight present I guess you go Tom The two men stood up tamping out their weeds and went out with Doc Chris had everything set up They matched coins to decide who would be treated Doc noticed that Chris would get no plasma while he was scheduled for everything He watched her prepare the culture and add the accelerator that would speed development and make certain he and Tom were infected then let her inject it That was all except for the waiting To keep conditions more closely alike they were to stay there until the tests were finished not even eating for fear of upsetting the conditions Swanee dug out a pack of worn cards and began to deal while Doc dug out some large pills to use as chips It was an hour later when the pain began Doc had just won the pot of fifty pills and opened his mouth for the expected gloating He yelled as an explosion seemed to go off inside his head Even closing his mouth was agony A moment later Tom began to sweat It got worse spreading to the whole area of the back of the head and neck Doc lay on the cot envying Chris and Swanee who had already been infected naturally He longed desperately for bracky and had to keep reminding himself that no drugs must upset the tests It was the longest day he had ever spent and he began to doubt that he could get through it He watched the little clock move from one minute to nine over to half a minute and hung breathless until it hit the nine There was no question about whether the infection had taken Now they could dull the agony Chris had the anodyne tablets already dissolved in water and Swanee was passing out three lighted bracky weeds It took a few minutes for the relief of the anodyne and even that couldn t kill all the pain But it didn t matter by comparison He sucked the weed mashed it out and began dealing the cards again They had a plentiful supply of the anodyne and used it liberally during the night The test was a speeded up simulation of the natural course of the disease where painkiller would take time to get for most people here but would then be used generously Precisely at nine in the morning Chris began to inject Swanee and Doc with plasma Now there was no thought of cards They waited trying to talk but with most of their attention on the clock Doc had estimated that an hour should be enough to show results but it was hard to remember that an hour was the guess as to the minimum time He winced as Chris took a tiny bit of flesh from his neck She went to the other men and then submitted to his work on herself Then she began preparing the slides Feldman she read the name of the slide as she inserted it into the microscope Then her breath caught sharply Only dead cells It was the same for Swanee and Tom Each had to look at his own slide and have it explained before the results could be believed But at last Chris bent over her own slide A minute later she glanced up nodding What it should be It checks Tom whooped and went out the door to notify Jake There was only plasma for some two hundred injections but that should yield sufficient proof Once salvation was offered there should be no trouble convincing the people that blood donations from their children were worthwhile Later when the last of the plasma had been used they could finally relax Chris slipped off her smock and dropped onto the cot A tired smile came onto her lips You re forgiven Dan she said A moment later she was obviously asleep Doc meant to join her but it was too much effort He leaned his head forward onto his arms vaguely wondering why she was calling off the feud It was night outside when he awoke and he was lying on the cot though he still felt cramped and strained He stirred groaning and finally realized that a hand was on his shoulder shaking him He looked up to see Jake above him Chris was busy with the coffee maker Jake slumped onto the cot beside Doc We took Southport he announced That knocked the sleep out of Doc s system You what We took it lock stock and barrel I figured the news of your cure would put guts into the men and it did But we d probably have taken it anyhow There wasn t anything to fight for there after Earth pulled out and the plague really hit Wilson mistook last minute panic for fighting spirit The poor devils didn t have anything to fight about once the Lobby stopped goading them Doc tried to assimilate the news But once the surprise was gone he found it meant very little Maybe his revolutionary zeal had cooled once the Lobby men had pulled out We ll need a lot more plasma than there is in Southport he said Not so much maybe Jake denied Doc three of the men you injected were shot down as runners Your plasma s no good It takes time to work Jake I told you there might be a case or two that would be too close to the edge Three is more than I expected but it s not impossible There was plenty of time They blew after we got back from Southport Jack dropped his hand on Doc s shoulder and his face softened Harkness tested every man you injected He finished half an hour ago Five showed dead bugs The rest of them weren t helped at all Doc fumbled for a weed trying to think But his thoughts refused to focus Five Five out of two hundred That s about average And what about Tom He was jumping around after the test last night telling how you d cured him how he d seen the dead bugs but he never had the jumping headache and you never gave him the plasma He s got dead bugs though Harkness tested him Doc let his realization of his own idiocy sink in until he could believe it Jake was right Tom had never been treated yet Chris had reported dead bugs They d all been so ready to believe in miracles that no one had been able to think straight after the long wait There was a bump on his neck a small one he said slowly Jake he must have caught it even if he seemed immune If he was taking anodyne anyway for something or unconscious He was up in Northport six years ago for a kidney operation Jake admitted doubtfully We had to chip in to pay for it But you still didn t treat him and he s cured Face it Doc that plasma is no good inside the body His hand tightened on Doc s shoulder again We re not blaming you We don t judge a man here except by what he is Maybe the stuff helps a little We ll go on using it when we get it tell everybody you were a mite optimistic so they ll figure it s a gamble but have a little hope left And you keep trying Something cured it in Tom Now you find out what Doc watched him go out numbly and turned to Chris It can t be right she said shakily You and Swanee were cured Maybe it was the accelerator It had to be something You didn t have the accelerator he accused No and I ve still got live bugs I was never supposed to be cured so I expected to see just what I saw How I missed the fact that Tom should have been like me I don t know Damn it oh damn it He s never seen her cry before except in fury But she mastered it almost at once shaking tears out of her eyes All right Plasma works in a bottle but not in an adult body Maybe something works in the body but not in a bottle Maybe And maybe some people are just naturally immune after it reaches a certain stage Maybe we ran into coincidence But he didn t believe that any more than she did The answer had to be in the room He d taken a massive dose of the disease and been cured in a few hours Outside the room the war went on drawing toward a close The supposed partial cure was good propaganda if nothing else and Jake was widening his territory steadily There was only token resistance against him He had the Southport shuttles now to cover huge areas in a hurry But inside the room the battle was less successful It wasn t the accelerator It wasn t the tablets of anodyne They even tried sweeping the floor and using the dust without results Then another test in the room made with four volunteers Jake selected yielded complete cures after injections with plain salt water in place of plasma The plague speeded up again About four people out of a hundred now seemed to have caught the disease and cured themselves They accounted for what faith was left in Doc s plasma and gave some unfounded hope to the others Northport fell a week later putting the whole planet in rebel hands Jake returned wearier than ever He d proved to be one of the natural immunes but the weight of the campaign that could only end in a defeat by the plague left him no room to rejoice in his personal fortune This time he looked completely defeated And a moment later Doc saw why as Jake flipped a flimsy sheet onto the table It bore the seals of Space and Medical Lobbies Jake pointed upwards The war rockets are there all right We knew they d come Now all they want for calling them off is our surrender and your cure If they don t get both they ll blow the planet to bits We have two days The rockets could be seen clearly with binoculars There were more than enough to destroy all life on the planet Maybe they d be used eventually anyhow since the Lobbies wanted no more rebellion But with a cure for the plague he might have bought them off Chris stood beside him looking as if it were a bitter pill for her too She d risked herself in the hands of the enemy had cooperated with him in everything she d been taught to oppose and had worked like a dog Now the Lobbies seemed to forget her as a useless tool They were falling back on a raw power play and forgetting any earlier schemes Maybe they d hold off for a while if I agreed to go to them and share all my ideas specimens and notes he said at last Do you think your Lobby would settle for that Chris I don t know Dan I ve stopped thinking their way She seemed almost apologetic for the admission He dropped an arm over her shoulder and turned with her back to the laboratory Okay then we ve got to find a miracle We ve got two days ahead of us At least we can try But he knew he was lying to himself There wasn t anything he could think of to try XV Decision Two days was never enough time for a miracle Doc decided as he packed his notes into a small bag and put it beside his bundle of personal belongings He glanced around the room for the last time and managed a grin at Jake s gloomy expression Maybe I can bluff them or maybe they ll string along for a while he said Anyhow now that they ve agreed to take me and my notes in place of the cure we re fresh out of I ve got to be on that shuttle when it goes back to their men at orbital station Jake nodded I don t like selling friends down the river Doc But it wouldn t do you any more good to blow up with the planet I reckon They won t call off the war rockets when they do get you of course But maybe they won t use them except as a threat to put the Lobbies back in stronger than ever He stuck out one of his awkwardly shaped hands clapped the aspirator over his face and hurried out Doc picked up his bags and went toward the little tractor where Lou was waiting to drive him and Chris back toward Southport and the shuttle rocket that would be landing for them They hadn t mentioned Chris in their demands but her father must expect her to return After they had him he d be on his own His best course was probably to insist on talking only to Ryan at Medical Lobby and then being completely honest The room here would be kept sealed in case the Lobby wanted to investigate where he had failed And his notes were honest which was something that could usually be determined Chris could testify to that anyhow since she d kept a lot of them for him At best there would be a chance for some compromise and perhaps some clue for them that might eventually end the plague They had enough men to work on it and billions in equipment At worst he should gain a little time Cheer up Chris he told her as he climbed through the little airlock Maybe Harkness will turn up the cure before our negotiations break down He has the whole of Northport Hospital to play with They haven t tried to chase him out of there yet After all we almost found something with no equipment except wild imaginations She shook her head as the tractor began moving Shut up I ve got enough trouble without your coming down with logorrhea Don t be a fool Why change now he asked her Everything I ve done has been because I am a fool I guess my luck lasted longer than I could expect And I m still fool enough to think that the solution has to turn up eventually We know it has to be in that room Damn it we must know it if we could only think straight now She reached over and touched his hand but made no comment They had been over that statement of desperation too many times already But it kept nagging at him something in the room something in the room Something so common that nobody noticed it They passed a crowd chasing down a runner Something in that room could have saved the unlucky man It could have saved Mars perhaps He growled for the hundredth time cursing his fatigue numbed mind Too little sleep too much coffee and bracky He reached for the package of weed realizing that he would miss it on Earth if he ever got there Like everything here on the planet he d begun by detesting it and wound up finding it the thing he wanted to keep forever He lighted the bracky and sat smoking watching Lou drive When the first was finished he lighted another from the butt She put out a hand and took it away Please Dan I can stand the stuff but I ll never like it and the tractor s stuffy enough already I ve taken enough of it And it keeps reminding me of our test the three of you stinking up the place puffing and blowing that out while I couldn t even get a breath of air She was getting logorrhea herself now and The answer finally hit him He jerked around making a grab for Lou s shoulder motioning for the man to head back Bracky it has to be Chris that s it Jake picked out the second group of men from his friends and they are all cronies because they hang around so much in their so called smoking room The first time it killed the bugs for all of us who smoked and it didn t work for you because you never learned the habit Lou had the tractor turned and the rheostat all the way to the floor She was sitting up now but she wasn t fully satisfied The percentage of immunes seems about right But why do some of the smokers get the disease while some don t Why not It depends on whether they pick up the habit before or after the disease gets started Tom must have got his while he was in Northport They wouldn t let him smoke there if he had the habit before for that matter She found no fault with that He twisted it back and forth in his mind trying to find a fault There seemed to be none The only trouble was that they couldn t send a message that bracky was the cure and hope that Earth would prove it true No polite note of apology would do after that They had to be sure Too many other ideas had proved wrong already Jake saw them coming and came running toward the laboratory but Lou stopped the tractor before it reached the building and let the older man in Get me a dozen men who have the plague I want the worst cases you have and ones that Harkness tested himself Doc ordered And then start praying that the cure we ve got works fast Chris was at the electron mike at once but one of her hands reached out for the weed She began puffing valiantly making sick faces Now other men began coming in their faces struggling to find hope but not daring to believe yet Jake followed them We ll test at ten minute intervals That will be about two hours for the last from the group Doc decided One of the doctors Harkness had brought to the villages was busy cutting tiny sections from the lumps on the men s necks while Chris ran them through the microscope to make sure the bugs were still alive The regular optical mike was strong enough for that Doc handed each man a bracky weed with instructions to keep smoking no matter how sick it made him There were no results at the end of ten minutes when the first test was made The second at the end of twenty minutes was still infected with live bugs At the half hour Chris frowned I can t be sure take a look Dan He bent over moving the slide to examine another spot I think so The next one should tell There was no doubt about the fourth test The bugs were dead without a single exception that they could find One by one the men were tested and went storming out shouting the news For a minute the gathering crowd was skeptical remembering the other failures Then abruptly men were screaming crying and fighting for the precious bracky like the legions of the damned grabbing for lottery tickets when the prize was a passport to paradise Jake swore as he moved toward the door We re low on bracky here Have to get a supply from Edison I guess and cart it to the shuttle Enough for a sample and to make them want more It ll be tough but we ll get it there in time by the time the shuttle should be picking you up Doc you ve won our war From now on if Earth wants to keep her population up we ll be a free planet Chris turned slowly from the microscope holding a slide in her hands My bugs she said unbelievingly Dan they re dead Jake patted her shoulder That makes it perfect girl Now come on We ve got to start celebrating a victory It was the general feeling of most of the heads of the villages when they met the next day in Southport using the courtroom that had been presided over so long by Judge Ben Wilson It was victory and to the victor belonged the spoils The bracky had gone out to Earth on a converted war rocket that could make the trip in less than two weeks and one packet had been specially labeled for Captain Everts But Earth had already confirmed the cure The small amounts of the herb found in the botanical collections had been enough to satisfy all doubts Harkness Chris and Doc had been fighting against the desire to rob Earth blind that filled most of the men here for hours now Now they had the backing of Jake and Ben Wilson And now finally they leaned back sensing that the argument had been won Bargaining was all right in its place but it had no place in affairs of life and death such as this They had to see that Earth received all the bracky she needed It was only right to charge a fair price for it but they couldn t restrict it by withholding or overcharging And they could still gain their ends without blackmail Martian alkaloids were tricky things and bracky smoke contained a number of them It would take Earth at least ten years to discover and synthesize the right one and it would still probably cost more than it would to import the weed from Mars As long as the source of that weed was here and in the hands of the colonials there would be no danger of Earth s bombing the planet Harkness got up to underscore a point Wilson had made The plague lived a million years and it won t disappear now The jumping headache or Selznick s migraine is unpleasant enough to make us reasonably sure that there will be a steady consumption of the weed Our problem will be to keep the children from using too much of it probably He pulled a weed out and lighted it puckering his face as the smoke bit his tongue I m told that this gets to be an enjoyable habit If I can believe that surely you can believe me when I say we don t have to bargain with lives The village men were human and most of them could remember the strain they had been under when they expected those they loved to die at any hour It had made them crave vengeance but now as they had a chance to reexamine it they began to find it harder to impose the horror of any such threat on others The final vote was almost unanimous Doc listened as they wrangled over the wording of the message to Earth feeling disconnected from it He passed Chris a bracky and lighted it for her She took it automatically smiling as the smoke hit her lungs It was one thing they had in common now at least Ben Wilson finally read the message To the people of Earth greetings On behalf of the free people of Mars I have the honor to announce that this planet hereby declares itself a sovereign and independent world We shall continue to regard Earth as our mother and to consider the health and welfare of her people in no way second to our own in matters which affect both planets We trust that Earth will share this feeling of mutual friendship We trust that all strains of hostility will be ended The advantages to each from peaceful commerce make any course other than the most cordial of relations unthinkable We shall consider proof of such friendship an order by Earth to all rockets circling this planet that they shall deliver themselves safely into our hands in order that we may begin converting them to peaceful purposes for the trade that is to come In turn we pledge that all efforts will be made to ensure a prompt delivery of those products most in demand including the curative bracky plant He turned to Doc then You want to sign it doctor Feldman Make it as acting president or something until we can get around to voting you into permanent office You and Jake fight over the job Doc told him No Ben I mean it He got up and moved out into the outer room where he could avoid the stares of amazement that were turned to him He d never asked for the honor and he didn t want it Chris came with him Her face was shocked and something was slowly draining out of it as he looked at her Forget it Chris he said You re going back to Earth There is nothing for you here She hadn t quite given up There could be Dan You know that No No Chris I don t think there ever can be You can t find a man strong enough to rule who ll be weak enough to let you rule in his place It didn t work on Earth and it won t work here Forget the dreams you had of what could be done with a new planet Those are the dreams that made a mess of the old one I ll be back she told him Some day I ll be back He shook his head again No You wouldn t like what you find here Freedom is heady stuff but you have to have a taste for it You can t acquire a fondness for it secondhand And for a while there s going to be freedom here Besides once you get back to Earth you ll forget what happened here She sighed at last For the first time since he had known her she seemed to give in completely And for that brief moment he loved what she could have been but never would be All right Dan she said quietly I can t fight you I never could I see now I ll take the rocket back What are you going to do He hadn t bothered to think but he knew the answer Research What else There would be a lot of research done here It had been suppressed too long and had piled up a back pressure that would have to be relieved And from that research he suspected would come the end of the stable oligarchy of Earth It could never stand against the changes that would be pouring out of Mars She put her hands on his shoulders and moved forward to kiss him He bent down to meet her and found her eyes were wet Maybe his were too Then she broke free You re a fool Dan Feldman she whispered and began moving down the hallway and out of the council hall of Mars Doc Feldman nodded slowly as he let her go He was a fool He had always been a fool and always would be And that was why he could never take over leadership here Fools and idealists should never govern a world It took practical men such as Jake to do that But the practical men needed the foolish idealists too And maybe for a time here on Mars their kind of men and his kind of fools could make one more stab at the ancient puzzle of freedom Outside the war rockets of Earth began landing quietly on the free soil of Mars Transcriber s Note The following errors in the
