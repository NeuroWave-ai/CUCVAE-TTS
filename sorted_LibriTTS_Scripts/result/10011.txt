electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone For thirty years he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support Project Gutenberg tm eBooks are often created from several printed editions all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U S unless a copyright notice is included Thus we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility http www gutenberg net This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg tm including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation how to help produce our new eBooks and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks EBooks posted prior to November two thousand three with eBook numbers BELOW ten thousand are filed in directories based on their release date If you want to download any of these eBooks directly rather than using the regular search system you may utilize the following addresses and just download by the etext year http www ibiblio org gutenberg etextsix Or etext five four three two one zero ninety nine ninety eight ninety seven ninety six ninety five ninety four ninety three ninety two ninety two ninety one or ninety EBooks posted since November two thousand three with etext numbers OVER ten thousand are filed in a different way The year of a release date is no longer part of the directory path The path is based on the etext number which is identical to the filename The
