1513_140221_000008_000006	train-clean-360	The solution given by Socrates is as follows 
none	none	The rhapsode is not guided by rules of art but is an inspired person who derives a mysterious power from the poet and the poet in like manner is inspired by the God The poets and their interpreters may be compared to a chain of magnetic rings suspended from one another and from a magnet The magnet is the Muse and the ring which immediately follows is the poet himself from him are suspended other poets there is also a chain of rhapsodes and actors who also hang from the Muses but are let down at the side and the last ring of all is the spectator The poet is the inspired interpreter of the God and this is the reason why some poets like Homer are restricted to a single theme or like Tynnichus are famous for a single poem and the rhapsode is the inspired interpreter of the poet and for a similar reason some rhapsodes like Ion are the interpreters of single poets Ion is delighted at the notion of being inspired and acknowledges that he is beside himself when he is performing his eyes rain tears and his hair stands on end Socrates is of opinion that a man must be mad who behaves in this way at a festival when he is surrounded by his friends and there is nothing to trouble him 
1513_140221_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Ion is confident that Socrates would never think him mad if he could only hear his embellishments of Homer 
none	none	Socrates asks whether he can speak well about everything in Homer Yes indeed he can What about things of which he has no knowledge Ion answers that he can interpret anything in Homer But rejoins Socrates when Homer speaks of the arts as for example of chariot driving or of medicine or of prophecy or of navigation will he or will the charioteer or physician or prophet or pilot be the better judge 
1513_140221_000010_000006	train-clean-360	Ion is compelled to admit that every man will judge of his own particular art better than the rhapsode 
none	none	He still maintains however that he understands the art of the general as well as any one Then why in this city of Athens in which men of merit are always being sought after is he not at once appointed a general Ion replies that he is a foreigner and the Athenians and Spartans will not appoint a foreigner to be their general No that is not the real reason there are many examples to the contrary But Ion has long been playing tricks with the argument like Proteus he transforms himself into a variety of shapes and is at last about to run away in the disguise of a general Would he rather be regarded as inspired or dishonest Ion who has no suspicion of the irony of Socrates eagerly embraces the alternative of inspiration The Ion like the other earlier Platonic Dialogues is a mixture of jest and earnest in which no definite result is obtained but some Socratic or Platonic truths are allowed dimly to appear The elements of a true theory of poetry are contained in the notion that the poet is inspired Genius is often said to be unconscious or spontaneous or a gift of nature that genius is akin to madness is a popular aphorism of modern times The greatest strength is observed to have an element of limitation Sense or passion are too much for the dry light of intelligence which mingles with them and becomes discoloured by them Imagination is often at war with reason and fact The concentration of the mind on a single object or on a single aspect of human nature overpowers the orderly perception of the whole Yet the feelings too bring truths home to the minds of many who in the way of reason would be incapable of understanding them Reflections of this kind may have been passing before Plato s mind when he describes the poet as inspired or when as in the Apology he speaks of poets as the worst critics of their own writings anybody taken at random from the crowd is a better interpreter of them than they are of themselves They are sacred persons winged and holy things who have a touch of madness in their composition Phaedr and should be treated with every sort of respect Republic but not allowed to live in a well ordered state Like the Statesmen in the Meno they have a divine instinct but they are narrow and confused they do not attain to the clearness of ideas or to the knowledge of poetry or of any other art as a whole In the Protagoras the ancient poets are recognized by Protagoras himself as the original sophists and this family resemblance may be traced in the Ion The rhapsode belongs to the realm of imitation and of opinion he professes to have all knowledge which is derived by him from Homer just as the sophist professes to have all wisdom which is contained in his art of rhetoric Even more than the sophist he is incapable of appreciating the commonest logical distinctions he cannot explain the nature of his own art his great memory contrasts with his inability to follow the steps of the argument And in his highest moments of inspiration he has an eye to his own gains The old quarrel between philosophy and poetry which in the Republic leads to their final separation is already working in the mind of Plato and is embodied by him in the contrast between Socrates and Ion Yet here as in the Republic Socrates shows a sympathy with the poetic nature Also the manner in which Ion is affected by his own recitations affords a lively illustration of the power which in the Republic Socrates attributes to dramatic performances over the mind of the performer His allusion to his embellishments of Homer in which he declares himself to have surpassed Metrodorus of Lampsacus and Stesimbrotus of Thasos seems to show that like them he belonged to the allegorical school of interpreters The circumstance that nothing more is known of him may be adduced in confirmation of the argument that this truly Platonic little work is not a forgery of later times ION 
1513_140222_000001_000000	train-clean-360	PERSONS OF THE DIALOGUE Socrates Ion 
none	none	SOCRATES Welcome Ion Are you from your native city of Ephesus 
1513_140222_000151_000000	train-clean-360	ION No 
1513_140222_000003_000000	train-clean-360	ION No Socrates but from Epidaurus where I attended the festival of Asclepius 
none	none	SOCRATES And do the Epidaurians have contests of rhapsodes at the festival ION O yes and of all sorts of musical performers SOCRATES And were you one of the competitors and did you succeed ION I obtained the first prize of all Socrates 
1513_140222_000008_000000	train-clean-360	SOCRATES Well done and I hope that you will do the same for us at the Panathenaea 
none	none	ION And I will please heaven SOCRATES I often envy the profession of a rhapsode Ion for you have always to wear fine clothes and to look as beautiful as you can is a part of your art Then again you are obliged to be continually in the company of many good poets and especially of Homer who is the best and most divine of them and to understand him and not merely learn his words by rote is a thing greatly to be envied And no man can be a rhapsode who does not understand the meaning of the poet For the rhapsode ought to interpret the mind of the poet to his hearers but how can he interpret him well unless he knows what he means All this is greatly to be envied 
1513_140222_000021_000000	train-clean-360	ION Very true 
1513_140222_000107_000000	train-clean-360	ION Very true 
none	none	Socrates interpretation has certainly been the most laborious part of my art and I believe myself able to speak about Homer better than any man and that neither Metrodorus of Lampsacus nor Stesimbrotus of Thasos nor Glaucon nor any one else who ever was had as good ideas about Homer as I have or as many SOCRATES I am glad to hear you say so Ion I see that you will not refuse to acquaint me with them ION Certainly Socrates and you really ought to hear how exquisitely I render Homer I think that the Homeridae should give me a golden crown SOCRATES I shall take an opportunity of hearing your embellishments of him at some other time But just now I should like to ask you a question Does your art extend to Hesiod and Archilochus or to Homer only ION To Homer only he is in himself quite enough SOCRATES Are there any things about which Homer and Hesiod agree 
1513_140222_000035_000000	train-clean-360	ION Yes 
1513_140222_000047_000000	train-clean-360	ION Yes 
1513_140222_000055_000000	train-clean-360	ION Yes 
1513_140222_000059_000000	train-clean-360	ION Yes 
1513_140222_000061_000000	train-clean-360	ION Yes 
1513_140222_000099_000000	train-clean-360	ION Yes 
1513_140222_000101_000000	train-clean-360	ION Yes 
1513_140222_000111_000000	train-clean-360	ION Yes 
1513_140222_000113_000000	train-clean-360	ION Yes 
1513_140222_000137_000000	train-clean-360	ION Yes 
1513_140222_000147_000000	train-clean-360	ION Yes 
1513_140222_000159_000000	train-clean-360	ION Yes 
none	none	in my opinion there are a good many SOCRATES And can you interpret better what Homer says or what Hesiod says about these matters in which they agree ION I can interpret them equally well Socrates where they agree SOCRATES But what about matters in which they do not agree for example about divination of which both Homer and Hesiod have something to say ION Very true SOCRATES Would you or a good prophet be a better interpreter of what these two poets say about divination not only when they agree but when they disagree 
1513_140222_000023_000000	train-clean-360	ION A prophet 
none	none	SOCRATES And if you were a prophet would you not be able to interpret them when they disagree as well as when they agree 
1513_140222_000025_000000	train-clean-360	ION Clearly 
none	none	SOCRATES But how did you come to have this skill about Homer only and not about Hesiod or the other poets Does not Homer speak of the same themes which all other poets handle Is not war his great argument and does he not speak of human society and of intercourse of men good and bad skilled and unskilled and of the gods conversing with one another and with mankind and about what happens in heaven and in the world below and the generations of gods and heroes Are not these the themes of which Homer sings ION Very true Socrates SOCRATES And do not the other poets sing of the same 
1513_140222_000029_000000	train-clean-360	ION Yes Socrates but not in the same way as Homer 
1513_140222_000030_000000	train-clean-360	SOCRATES What in a worse way 
1513_140222_000031_000000	train-clean-360	ION Yes in a far worse 
none	none	SOCRATES And Homer in a better way ION He is incomparably better SOCRATES And yet surely my dear friend Ion in a discussion about arithmetic where many people are speaking and one speaks better than the rest there is somebody who can judge which of them is the good speaker ION Yes SOCRATES And he who judges of the good will be the same as he who judges of the bad speakers ION The same SOCRATES And he will be the arithmetician ION Yes SOCRATES Well and in discussions about the wholesomeness of food when many persons are speaking and one speaks better than the rest will he who recognizes the better speaker be a different person from him who recognizes the worse or the same 
1513_140222_000041_000000	train-clean-360	ION Clearly the same 
none	none	SOCRATES And who is he and what is his name ION The physician SOCRATES And speaking generally in all discussions in which the subject is the same and many men are speaking will not he who knows the good know the bad speaker also For if he does not know the bad neither will he know the good when the same topic is being discussed 
1513_140222_000115_000000	train-clean-360	ION True 
none	none	SOCRATES Is not the same person skilful in both ION Yes SOCRATES And you say that Homer and the other poets such as Hesiod and Archilochus speak of the same things although not in the same way but the one speaks well and the other not so well 
1513_140222_000049_000000	train-clean-360	ION Yes and I am right in saying so 
none	none	SOCRATES And if you knew the good speaker you would also know the inferior speakers to be inferior 
1513_140222_000051_000000	train-clean-360	ION That is true 
none	none	SOCRATES Then my dear friend can I be mistaken in saying that Ion is equally skilled in Homer and in other poets since he himself acknowledges that the same person will be a good judge of all those who speak of the same things and that almost all poets do speak of the same things ION Why then Socrates do I lose attention and go to sleep and have absolutely no ideas of the least value when any one speaks of any other poet but when Homer is mentioned I wake up at once and am all attention and have plenty to say SOCRATES The reason my friend is obvious No one can fail to see that you speak of Homer without any art or knowledge If you were able to speak of him by rules of art you would have been able to speak of all other poets for poetry is a whole ION Yes SOCRATES And when any one acquires any other art as a whole the same may be said of them 
1513_140222_000056_000001	train-clean-360	Would you like me to explain my meaning Ion 
none	none	ION Yes indeed Socrates I very much wish that you would for I love to hear you wise men talk SOCRATES O that we were wise Ion and that you could truly call us so but you rhapsodes and actors and the poets whose verses you sing are wise whereas I am a common man who only speak the truth For consider what a very commonplace and trivial thing is this which I have said a thing which any man might say that when a man has acquired a knowledge of a whole art the enquiry into good and bad is one and the same 
1513_140222_000058_000002	train-clean-360	Let us consider this matter is not the art of painting a whole 
none	none	ION Yes 
1513_140222_000060_000000	train-clean-360	SOCRATES And there are and have been many painters good and bad 
none	none	ION Yes SOCRATES And did you ever know any one who was skilful in pointing out the excellences and defects of Polygnotus the son of Aglaophon but incapable of criticizing other painters and when the work of any other painter was produced went to sleep and was at a loss and had no ideas but when he had to give his opinion about Polygnotus or whoever the painter might be and about him only woke up and was attentive and had plenty to say 
1513_140222_000063_000000	train-clean-360	ION No indeed I have never known such a person 
none	none	SOCRATES Or did you ever know of any one in sculpture who was skilful in expounding the merits of Daedalus the son of Metion or of Epeius the son of Panopeus or of Theodorus the Samian or of any individual sculptor but when the works of sculptors in general were produced was at a loss and went to sleep and had nothing to say 
1513_140222_000065_000000	train-clean-360	ION No indeed no more than the other 
none	none	SOCRATES And if I am not mistaken you never met with any one among flute players or harp players or singers to the harp or rhapsodes who was able to discourse of Olympus or Thamyras or Orpheus or Phemius the rhapsode of Ithaca but was at a loss when he came to speak of Ion of Ephesus and had no notion of his merits or defects 
1513_140222_000067_000000	train-clean-360	ION I cannot deny what you say Socrates 
1513_140222_000067_000001	train-clean-360	Nevertheless I am conscious in my own self and the world agrees with me in thinking that I do speak better and have more to say about Homer than any other man 
none	none	But I do not speak equally well about others tell me the reason of this SOCRATES I perceive Ion and I will proceed to explain to you what I imagine to be the reason of this 
1513_140222_000068_000001	train-clean-360	The gift which you possess of speaking excellently about Homer is not an art but as I was just saying an inspiration there is a divinity moving you like that contained in the stone which Euripides calls a magnet but which is commonly known as the stone of Heraclea 
none	none	This stone not only attracts iron rings but also imparts to them a similar power of attracting other rings and sometimes you may see a number of pieces of iron and rings suspended from one another so as to form quite a long chain and all of them derive their power of suspension from the original stone 
1513_140222_000068_000003	train-clean-360	In like manner the Muse first of all inspires men herself and from these inspired persons a chain of other persons is suspended who take the inspiration 
1513_140222_000068_000004	train-clean-360	For all good poets epic as well as lyric compose their beautiful poems not by art but because they are inspired and possessed 
none	none	And as the Corybantian revellers when they dance are not in their right mind so the lyric poets are not in their right mind when they are composing their beautiful strains but when falling under the power of music and metre they are inspired and possessed like Bacchic maidens who draw milk and honey from the rivers when they are under the influence of Dionysus but not when they are in their right mind And the soul of the lyric poet does the same as they themselves say for they tell us that they bring songs from honeyed fountains culling them out of the gardens and dells of the Muses they like the bees winging their way from flower to flower 
1513_140222_000068_000007	train-clean-360	And this is true 
none	none	For the poet is a light and winged and holy thing and there is no invention in him until he has been inspired and is out of his senses and the mind is no longer in him when he has not attained to this state he is powerless and is unable to utter his oracles Many are the noble words in which poets speak concerning the actions of men but like yourself when speaking about Homer they do not speak of them by any rules of art they are simply inspired to utter that to which the Muse impels them and that only and when inspired one of them will make dithyrambs another hymns of praise another choral strains another epic or iambic verses and he who is good at one is not good at any other kind of verse for not by art does the poet sing but by power divine Had he learned by rules of art he would have known how to speak not of one theme only but of all and therefore God takes away the minds of poets and uses them as his ministers as he also uses diviners and holy prophets in order that we who hear them may know them to be speaking not of themselves who utter these priceless words in a state of unconsciousness but that God himself is the speaker and that through them he is conversing with us 
1513_140222_000068_000011	train-clean-360	And Tynnichus the Chalcidian affords a striking instance of what I am saying he wrote nothing that any one would care to remember but the famous paean which is in every one s mouth one of the finest poems ever written simply an invention of the Muses as he himself says 
1513_140222_000068_000012	train-clean-360	For in this way the God would seem to indicate to us and not allow us to doubt that these beautiful poems are not human or the work of man but divine and the work of God and that the poets are only the interpreters of the Gods by whom they are severally possessed 
none	none	Was not this the lesson which the God intended to teach when by the mouth of the worst of poets he sang the best of songs Am I not right Ion 
1513_140222_000069_000000	train-clean-360	ION Yes indeed Socrates I feel that you are for your words touch my soul and I am persuaded that good poets by a divine inspiration interpret the things of the Gods to us 
1513_140222_000070_000000	train-clean-360	SOCRATES And you rhapsodists are the interpreters of the poets 
none	none	ION There again you are right SOCRATES Then you are the interpreters of interpreters 
1513_140222_000073_000000	train-clean-360	ION Precisely 
none	none	SOCRATES I wish you would frankly tell me Ion what I am going to ask of you When you produce the greatest effect upon the audience in the recitation of some striking passage such as the apparition of Odysseus leaping forth on the floor recognized by the suitors and casting his arrows at his feet or the description of Achilles rushing at Hector or the sorrows of Andromache Hecuba or Priam are you in your right mind 
1513_140222_000074_000001	train-clean-360	Are you not carried out of yourself and does not your soul in an ecstasy seem to be among the persons or places of which you are speaking whether they are in Ithaca or in Troy or whatever may be the scene of the poem 
1513_140222_000075_000000	train-clean-360	ION That proof strikes home to me Socrates 
1513_140222_000075_000001	train-clean-360	For I must frankly confess that at the tale of pity my eyes are filled with tears and when I speak of horrors my hair stands on end and my heart throbs 
none	none	SOCRATES Well Ion and what are we to say of a man who at a sacrifice or festival when he is dressed in holiday attire and has golden crowns upon his head of which nobody has robbed him appears weeping or panic stricken in the presence of more than twenty thousand friendly faces when there is no one despoiling or wronging him is he in his right mind or is he not ION No indeed Socrates I must say that strictly speaking he is not in his right mind SOCRATES And are you aware that you produce similar effects on most of the spectators ION Only too well for I look down upon them from the stage and behold the various emotions of pity wonder sternness stamped upon their countenances when I am speaking and I am obliged to give my very best attention to them for if I make them cry I myself shall laugh and if I make them laugh I myself shall cry when the time of payment arrives SOCRATES Do you know that the spectator is the last of the rings which as I am saying receive the power of the original magnet from one another The rhapsode like yourself and the actor are intermediate links and the poet himself is the first of them Through all these the God sways the souls of men in any direction which he pleases and makes one man hang down from another Thus there is a vast chain of dancers and masters and under masters of choruses who are suspended as if from the stone at the side of the rings which hang down from the Muse And every poet has some Muse from whom he is suspended and by whom he is said to be possessed which is nearly the same thing for he is taken hold of And from these first rings which are the poets depend others some deriving their inspiration from Orpheus others from Musaeus but the greater number are possessed and held by Homer Of whom Ion you are one and are possessed by Homer and when any one repeats the words of another poet you go to sleep and know not what to say but when any one recites a strain of Homer you wake up in a moment and your soul leaps within you and you have plenty to say for not by art or knowledge about Homer do you say what you say but by divine inspiration and by possession just as the Corybantian revellers too have a quick perception of that strain only which is appropriated to the God by whom they are possessed and have plenty of dances and words for that but take no heed of any other And you Ion when the name of Homer is mentioned have plenty to say and have nothing to say of others You ask Why is this The answer is that you praise Homer not by art but by divine inspiration ION That is good Socrates and yet I doubt whether you will ever have eloquence enough to persuade me that I praise Homer only when I am mad and possessed and if you could hear me speak of him I am sure you would never think this to be the case SOCRATES I should like very much to hear you but not until you have answered a question which I have to ask On what part of Homer do you speak well not surely about every part ION There is no part Socrates about which I do not speak well of that I can assure you SOCRATES Surely not about things in Homer of which you have no knowledge ION And what is there in Homer of which I have no knowledge SOCRATES Why does not Homer speak in many passages about arts For example about driving if I can only remember the lines I will repeat them ION I remember and will repeat them SOCRATES Tell me then what Nestor says to Antilochus his son where he bids him be careful of the turn at the horserace in honour of Patroclus 
1513_140222_000089_000000	train-clean-360	ION Bend gently he says in the polished chariot to the left of them and urge the horse on the right hand with whip and voice and slacken the rein 
none	none	And when you are at the goal let the left horse draw near yet so that the nave of the well wrought wheel may not even seem to touch the extremity and avoid catching the stone Il 
1513_140222_000090_000000	train-clean-360	SOCRATES Enough 
none	none	Now Ion will the charioteer or the physician be the better judge of the propriety of these lines 
1513_140222_000109_000000	train-clean-360	ION The charioteer 
none	none	clearly 
1513_140222_000092_000000	train-clean-360	SOCRATES And will the reason be that this is his art or will there be any other reason 
none	none	ION No that will be the reason 
1513_140222_000094_000000	train-clean-360	SOCRATES And every art is appointed by God to have knowledge of a certain work for that which we know by the art of the pilot we do not know by the art of medicine 
1513_140222_000095_000000	train-clean-360	ION Certainly not 
1513_140222_000097_000000	train-clean-360	ION Certainly not 
1513_140222_000096_000000	train-clean-360	SOCRATES Nor do we know by the art of the carpenter that which we know by the art of medicine 
none	none	ION Certainly not 
1513_140222_000098_000000	train-clean-360	SOCRATES And this is true of all the arts that which we know with one art we do not know with the other 
1513_140222_000098_000001	train-clean-360	But let me ask a prior question You admit that there are differences of arts 
none	none	ION Yes SOCRATES You would argue as I should that when one art is of one kind of knowledge and another of another they are different ION Yes 
1513_140222_000102_000000	train-clean-360	SOCRATES Yes surely for if the subject of knowledge were the same there would be no meaning in saying that the arts were different if they both gave the same knowledge 
1513_140222_000102_000001	train-clean-360	For example I know that here are five fingers and you know the same 
1513_140222_000102_000002	train-clean-360	And if I were to ask whether I and you became acquainted with this fact by the help of the same art of arithmetic you would acknowledge that we did 
none	none	ION Yes SOCRATES Tell me then what I was intending to ask you whether this holds universally Must the same art have the same subject of knowledge and different arts other subjects of knowledge 
1513_140222_000105_000000	train-clean-360	ION That is my opinion Socrates 
none	none	SOCRATES Then he who has no knowledge of a particular art will have no right judgment of the sayings and doings of that art ION Very true 
1513_140222_000108_000000	train-clean-360	SOCRATES Then which will be a better judge of the lines which you were reciting from Homer you or the charioteer 
none	none	ION The charioteer SOCRATES Why yes because you are a rhapsode and not a charioteer ION Yes SOCRATES And the art of the rhapsode is different from that of the charioteer ION Yes 
1513_140222_000114_000000	train-clean-360	SOCRATES And if a different knowledge then a knowledge of different matters 
none	none	ION True 
1513_140222_000116_000000	train-clean-360	SOCRATES You know the passage in which Hecamede the concubine of Nestor is described as giving to the wounded Machaon a posset as he says 
none	none	Made with Pramnian wine and she grated cheese of goat s milk with a grater of bronze and at his side placed an onion which gives a relish to drink Il Now would you say that the art of the rhapsode or the art of medicine was better able to judge of the propriety of these lines 
1513_140222_000119_000000	train-clean-360	ION The art of medicine 
1513_140222_000120_000000	train-clean-360	SOCRATES And when Homer says 
none	none	And she descended into the deep like a leaden plummet which set in the horn of ox that ranges in the fields rushes along carrying death among the ravenous fishes Il 
1513_140222_000122_000000	train-clean-360	will the art of the fisherman or of the rhapsode be better able to judge whether these lines are rightly expressed or not 
1513_140222_000123_000000	train-clean-360	ION Clearly Socrates the art of the fisherman 
none	none	SOCRATES Come now suppose that you were to say to me Since you Socrates are able to assign different passages in Homer to their corresponding arts I wish that you would tell me what are the passages of which the excellence ought to be judged by the prophet and prophetic art and you will see how readily and truly I shall answer you 
1513_140222_000124_000001	train-clean-360	For there are many such passages particularly in the Odyssee as for example the passage in which Theoclymenus the prophet of the house of Melampus says to the suitors 
1513_140222_000125_000000	train-clean-360	 Wretched men what is happening to you 
none	none	Your heads and your faces and your limbs underneath are shrouded in night and the voice of lamentation bursts forth and your cheeks are wet with tears And the vestibule is full and the court is full of ghosts descending into the darkness of Erebus and the sun has perished out of heaven and an evil mist is spread abroad Od And there are many such passages in the Iliad also as for example in the description of the battle near the rampart where he says As they were eager to pass the ditch there came to them an omen a soaring eagle holding back the people on the left bore a huge bloody dragon in his talons still living and panting nor had he yet resigned the strife for he bent back and smote the bird which carried him on the breast by the neck and he in pain let him fall from him to the ground into the midst of the multitude And the eagle with a cry was borne afar on the wings of the wind Il 
1513_140222_000128_000000	train-clean-360	These are the sort of things which I should say that the prophet ought to consider and determine 
1513_140222_000129_000000	train-clean-360	ION And you are quite right Socrates in saying so 
none	none	SOCRATES Yes Ion and you are right also And as I have selected from the Iliad and Odyssee for you passages which describe the office of the prophet and the physician and the fisherman do you who know Homer so much better than I do Ion select for me passages which relate to the rhapsode and the rhapsode s art and which the rhapsode ought to examine and judge of better than other men ION All passages I should say Socrates 
1513_140222_000132_000000	train-clean-360	SOCRATES Not all Ion surely 
none	none	Have you already forgotten what you were saying A rhapsode ought to have a better memory 
1513_140222_000133_000000	train-clean-360	ION Why what am I forgetting 
none	none	SOCRATES Do you not remember that you declared the art of the rhapsode to be different from the art of the charioteer 
1513_140222_000135_000000	train-clean-360	ION Yes I remember 
1513_140222_000136_000000	train-clean-360	SOCRATES And you admitted that being different they would have different subjects of knowledge 
none	none	ION Yes SOCRATES Then upon your own showing the rhapsode and the art of the rhapsode will not know everything 
1513_140222_000139_000000	train-clean-360	ION I should exclude certain things Socrates 
none	none	SOCRATES You mean to say that you would exclude pretty much the subjects of the other arts As he does not know all of them which of them will he know ION He will know what a man and what a woman ought to say and what a freeman and what a slave ought to say and what a ruler and what a subject SOCRATES Do you mean that a rhapsode will know better than the pilot what the ruler of a sea tossed vessel ought to say ION No the pilot will know best SOCRATES Or will the rhapsode know better than the physician what the ruler of a sick man ought to say ION He will not SOCRATES But he will know what a slave ought to say ION Yes 
1513_140222_000148_000000	train-clean-360	SOCRATES Suppose the slave to be a cowherd the rhapsode will know better than the cowherd what he ought to say in order to soothe the infuriated cows 
1513_140222_000149_000000	train-clean-360	ION No he will not 
none	none	SOCRATES But he will know what a spinning woman ought to say about the working of wool ION No SOCRATES At any rate he will know what a general ought to say when exhorting his soldiers ION Yes that is the sort of thing which the rhapsode will be sure to know 
1513_140222_000154_000000	train-clean-360	SOCRATES Well but is the art of the rhapsode the art of the general 
1513_140222_000155_000000	train-clean-360	ION I am sure that I should know what a general ought to say 
none	none	SOCRATES Why yes Ion because you may possibly have a knowledge of the art of the general as well as of the rhapsode and you may also have a knowledge of horsemanship as well as of the lyre and then you would know when horses were well or ill managed 
1513_140222_000156_000001	train-clean-360	But suppose I were to ask you By the help of which art Ion do you know whether horses are well managed by your skill as a horseman or as a performer on the lyre what would you answer 
none	none	ION I should reply by my skill as a horseman SOCRATES And if you judged of performers on the lyre you would admit that you judged of them as a performer on the lyre and not as a horseman ION Yes SOCRATES And in judging of the general s art do you judge of it as a general or a rhapsode 
1513_140222_000161_000000	train-clean-360	ION To me there appears to be no difference between them 
1513_140222_000162_000000	train-clean-360	SOCRATES What do you mean 
1513_140222_000162_000001	train-clean-360	Do you mean to say that the art of the rhapsode and of the general is the same 
none	none	ION Yes one and the same 
1513_140222_000164_000000	train-clean-360	SOCRATES Then he who is a good rhapsode is also a good general 
none	none	ION Certainly Socrates SOCRATES And he who is a good general is also a good rhapsode 
1513_140222_000167_000000	train-clean-360	ION No I do not say that 
1513_140222_000168_000000	train-clean-360	SOCRATES But you do say that he who is a good rhapsode is also a good general 
none	none	ION Certainly SOCRATES And you are the best of Hellenic rhapsodes 
1513_140222_000171_000000	train-clean-360	ION Far the best Socrates 
none	none	SOCRATES And are you the best general Ion 
1513_140222_000173_000000	train-clean-360	ION To be sure Socrates and Homer was my master 
none	none	SOCRATES But then Ion what in the name of goodness can be the reason why you who are the best of generals as well as the best of rhapsodes in all Hellas go about as a rhapsode when you might be a general Do you think that the Hellenes want a rhapsode with his golden crown and do not want a general ION Why Socrates the reason is that my countrymen the Ephesians are the servants and soldiers of Athens and do not need a general and you and Sparta are not likely to have me for you think that you have enough generals of your own 
1513_140222_000176_000000	train-clean-360	SOCRATES My good Ion did you never hear of Apollodorus of Cyzicus 
none	none	ION Who may he be SOCRATES One who though a foreigner has often been chosen their general by the Athenians and there is Phanosthenes of Andros and Heraclides of Clazomenae whom they have also appointed to the command of their armies and to other offices although aliens after they had shown their merit 
1513_140222_000178_000001	train-clean-360	And will they not choose Ion the Ephesian to be their general and honour him if he prove himself worthy 
1513_140222_000178_000002	train-clean-360	Were not the Ephesians originally Athenians and Ephesus is no mean city 
none	none	But indeed Ion if you are correct in saying that by art and knowledge you are able to praise Homer you do not deal fairly with me and after all your professions of knowing many glorious things about Homer and promises that you would exhibit them you are only a deceiver and so far from exhibiting the art of which you are a master will not even after my repeated entreaties explain to me the nature of it 
1513_140222_000178_000004	train-clean-360	You have literally as many forms as Proteus and now you go all manner of ways twisting and turning and like Proteus become all manner of people at once and at last slip away from me in the disguise of a general in order that you may escape exhibiting your Homeric lore 
1513_140222_000178_000005	train-clean-360	And if you have art then as I was saying in falsifying your promise that you would exhibit Homer you are not dealing fairly with me 
1513_140222_000178_000006	train-clean-360	But if as I believe you have no art but speak all these beautiful words about Homer unconsciously under his inspiring influence then I acquit you of dishonesty and shall only say that you are inspired 
1513_140222_000178_000007	train-clean-360	Which do you prefer to be thought dishonest or inspired 
1513_140222_000179_000000	train-clean-360	ION There is a great difference Socrates between the two alternatives and inspiration is by far the nobler 
1513_140222_000180_000000	train-clean-360	SOCRATES Then Ion I shall assume the nobler alternative and attribute to you in your praises of Homer inspiration and not art
