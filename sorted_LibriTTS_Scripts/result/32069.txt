AUTHOR OF NELLY S SILVER MINE WITH SEVENTEEN ILLUSTRATIONS BY ADDIE LEDYARD BOSTON ROBERTS BROTHERS eighteen seventy nine Copyright eighteen seventy nine By Roberts Brothers Illustration Helen INTRODUCTION Dear Children I do not feel wholly sure that my Pussy wrote these letters herself They always came inside the letters written to me by my mamma or other friends and I never caught Pussy writing at any time when I was at home but the printing was pretty bad and they were signed by Pussy s name and my mamma always looked very mysterious when I asked about them as if there were some very great secret about it all so that until I grew to be a big girl I never doubted but that Pussy printed them all alone by herself after dark They were written when I was a very little girl and was away from home with my father on a journey We made this journey in our own carriage and it was one of the pleasantest things that ever happened to me My clothes and my father s were packed in a little leather valise which was hung by straps underneath the carriage and went swinging swinging back and forth as the wheels went round My father and I used to walk up all the steep hills because old Charley our horse was not very strong and I kept my eyes on that valise all the while I was walking behind the carriage it seemed to me the most unsafe way to carry a valise and I wished very much that my best dress had been put in a bundle that I could carry in my lap This was the only drawback on the pleasure of my journey my fear that the valise would fall off when we did not know it and be left in the road and then I should not have anything nice to wear when I reached my aunt s house But the valise went through all safe and I had the satisfaction of wearing my best dress every afternoon while I stayed and I was foolish enough to think a great deal of this On the fourth day after our arrival came a letter from my mamma giving me a great many directions how to behave and enclosing this first letter from Pussy I carried both letters in my apron pocket all the time They were the first letters I ever had received and I was very proud of them I showed them to everybody and everybody laughed hard at Pussy s and asked me if I believed that Pussy printed it herself I thought perhaps my mamma held her paw with the pen in it as she had sometimes held my hand for me and guided my pen to write a few words I asked papa to please to ask mamma in his letter if that were the way Pussy did it but when his next letter from mamma came he read me this sentence out of it Tell Helen I did not hold Pussy s paw to write that letter So then I felt sure Pussy did it herself and as I told you I had grown up to be quite a big girl before I began to doubt it You see I thought my Pussy such a wonderful Pussy that nothing was too remarkable for her to do I knew very well that cats generally did not know how to read or write but I thought there had never been such a cat in the world as this Pussy of mine It is a great many years since she died but I can see her before me to day as plainly as if it were only yesterday that I had really seen her alive She was a little kitten when I first had her but she grew fast and was very soon bigger than I wanted her to be I wanted her to stay little Her fur was a beautiful dark gray color and there were black stripes on her sides like the stripes on a tiger Her eyes were very big and her ears unusually long and pointed This made her look like a fox and she was so bright and mischievous that some people thought she must be part fox She used to do one thing that I never heard of any other cat s doing she used to play hide and seek Did you ever hear of a cat s playing hide and seek And the most wonderful part of it was that she took it up of her own accord As soon as she heard me shut the gate in the yard at noon when school was done she would run up the stairs as hard as she could go and take her place at the top where she could just peep through the banisters When I opened the door she would give a funny little mew something like the mew cats make when they call their kittens Then as soon as I stepped on the first stair to come up to her she would race away at the top of her speed and hide under a bed and when I reached the room there would be no Pussy to be seen If I called her she would come out from under the bed but if I left the room and went down stairs without speaking in less than a minute she would fly back to her post at the head of the stairs and call again with the peculiar mew As soon as I appeared off she would run and hide under the bed as before Sometimes she would do this three or four times and it was a favorite amusement of my mother s to exhibit this trick of hers to strangers It was odd though she never would do it twice when she observed that other people were watching When I called her and she came out from under the bed if there were strangers looking on she would walk straight to me in the demurest manner as if it were a pure accident that she happened to be under that bed and no matter what I did or said her frolic was over for that day She used to follow me just like a little dog wherever I went She followed me to school every day and we had great difficulty on Sundays to keep her from following us to church Once she followed me when it made a good many people laugh in spite of themselves on an occasion when it was very improper for them to laugh and they were all feeling very sad It was at the funeral of one of the professors in the college The professors families all sat together and when the time came for them to walk out of the house and get into the carriages to go to the graveyard they were called one after the other by name When it came to our turn my father and mother went first arm in arm then my sister and I and then who should rise very gravely but my Pussy who had slipped into the room after me and had not been noticed in the crowd With a slow and deliberate gait she walked along directly behind my sister and me as if she were the remaining member of the family as indeed she was People began to smile and as we passed through the front door and went down the steps some of the men and boys standing there laughed out I do not wonder for it must have been a very comical sight In a second more somebody sprang forward and snatched Pussy up Such a scream as she gave and scratched his face with her claws so that he was glad to put her down As soon as I heard her voice I turned round and called her in a low tone She ran quickly to me and I picked her up and carried her in my arms the rest of the way But I saw even my own papa and mamma laughing a little for just a minute That was the only funeral Pussy ever attended Pussy lived several years after the events which are related in these letters It was a long time before her fur grew out again after that terrible fall into the soft soap barrel However it did grow out at last and looked as well as ever Nobody would have known that any thing had been the matter with her except that her eyes were always weak The edges of them never got quite well and poor Pussy used to sit and wash them by the hour sometimes mewing and looking up in my face with each stroke of her paw on her eyes as much as to say Don t you see how sore my eyes are Why don t you do something for me She was never good for any thing as a mouser after that accident nor for very much to play with I recollect hearing my mother say one day to somebody Pussy was spoiled by her experience in the cradle She would like to be rocked the rest of her days I do believe and it is too funny to see her turn up her nose at tough beef It was a pity she ever got a taste of tenderloin At last what with good feeding and very little exercise she grew so fat that she was clumsy and so lazy that she did not want to do any thing but lie curled up on a soft cushion She had outgrown my little chair which had a green moreen cushion in it on which she had slept for many a year and of which I myself had very little use she was in it so much of the time But now that this was too tight for her she took possession of the most comfortable places she could find all over the house Now it was a sofa now it was an arm chair now it was the foot of somebody s bed But wherever it happened to be it was sure to be the precise place where she was in the way and the poor thing was tipped headlong out of chairs shoved hastily off sofas and driven off beds so continually that at last she came to understand that when she saw any person approaching the chair sofa or bed on which she happened to be lying the part of wisdom for her was to move away And it was very droll to see the injured and reproachful expression with which she would slowly get up stretch all her legs and walk away looking for her next sleeping place Everybody in the house except me hated the sight of her and I had many a pitched battle with the servants in her behalf Even my mother who was the kindest human being I ever knew got out of patience at last and said to me one day Helen your Pussy has grown so old and so fat she is no comfort to herself and a great torment to everybody else I think it would be a mercy to kill her Kill my Pussy I exclaimed and burst out crying so loud and so hard that I think my mother was frightened for she said quickly Never mind dear it shall not be done unless it is necessary You would not want Pussy to live if she were very uncomfortable all the time She isn t uncomfortable I cried she is only sleepy If people would let her alone she would sleep all day It would be awful to kill her You might as well kill me After that I kept a very close eye on Pussy and I carried her up to bed with me every night for a long time But Pussy s days were numbered One morning before I was up my mamma came into my room and sat down on the edge of my bed Helen she said I have something to tell you which will make you feel very badly but I hope you will be a good little girl and not make mamma unhappy about it You know your papa and mamma always do what they think is the very best thing What is it mamma I asked feeling very much frightened but never thinking of Pussy You will never see your Pussy any more she replied She is dead Oh where is she I cried What killed her Won t she come to life again No said my mother she is drowned Then I knew what had happened Who did it was all I said Cousin Josiah she replied and he took great care that Pussy did not suffer at all She sank to the bottom instantly Where did he drown her I asked Down by the mill in Mill Valley where the water is very deep answered my mother we told him to take her there At these words I cried bitterly That s the very place I used to go with her to play I exclaimed I ll never go near that bridge as long as I live and I ll never speak a word to Cousin Josiah either never My mother tried to comfort me but it was of no use my heart was nearly broken When I went to breakfast there sat my cousin Josiah looking as unconcerned as possible reading a newspaper He was a student in the college and boarded at our house At the sight of him all my indignation and grief broke forth afresh I began to cry again and running up to him I doubled up my fist and shook it in his face I said I d never speak to you as long as I lived I cried but I will You re just a murderer a real murderer that s what you are and when you go to be a missionary I hope the cannibals ll eat you I hope they ll eat you alive raw you mean old murderer Helen Maria said my father s voice behind me sternly Helen Maria leave the room this moment I went away sullenly muttering I don t care he is a murderer and I hope he ll be drowned if he isn t eaten The Bible says the same measure ye mete shall be meted to you again He ought to be drowned For this sullen muttering I had to go without my breakfast and after breakfast was over I was made to beg Cousin Josiah s pardon but I did not beg it in my heart not a bit only with my lips just repeating the words I was told to say and from that time I never spoke one word to him nor looked at him if I could help it My kind mother offered to get another kitten for me but I did not want one After a while my sister Ann had a present of a pretty little gray kitten but I never played with it nor took any notice of it at all I was as true to my Pussy as she was to me and from that day to this I have never had another Pussy I

none	none	That is what your mother calls you I know for I jumped up on writing table just now and looked while she was out of the room and I am sure I have as much right to call you so as she has for if you were my own little kitty and looked just like me I could not love you any more than I do How many good naps I have had in your lap and how many nice bits of meat you have saved for me out of your own dinner Oh I ll never let a rat or a mouse touch any thing of yours so long as I live I felt very unhappy after you drove off yesterday and did not know what to do with myself I went into the barn and thought I would take a nap on the hay for I do think going to sleep is one of the very best things for people who are unhappy but it seemed so lonely without old Charlie stamping in his stall that I could not bear it so I went into the garden and lay down under the damask rose bush and caught flies There is a kind of fly round that bush which I like better than any other I ever ate You ought to see that there is a very great difference between my catching flies and your doing it I have noticed that you never eat them and I have wondered that when you were always so kind to me you could be so cruel as to kill poor flies for nothing I have often wished that I could speak to you about it now that your dear mother has taught me to print I shall be able to say a great many things to you which I have often been unhappy about because I could not make you understand I am entirely discouraged about learning to speak the English language and I do not think anybody takes much trouble to learn ours so we cats are confined entirely to the society of each other which prevents our knowing so much as we might and it is very lonely too in a place where there are so few cats kept as in Amherst If it were not for missus Hitchcock s cat and Judge Dickinson s I should really forget how to use my tongue When you are at home I do not mind it for although I cannot talk to you I understand every word that you say to me and we have such good plays together with the red ball That is put away now in the bottom drawer of the little workstand in the sitting room When your mother put it in she turned round to me and said Poor pussy no more good plays for you till Helen comes home and I thought I should certainly cry But I think it is very foolish to cry over what cannot be helped so I pretended to have got something into my left eye and rubbed it with my paw It is very seldom that I cry over any thing unless it is spilt milk I must confess I have often cried when that has happened and it always is happening to cats milk They put it into old broken things that tip over at the least knock and then they set them just where they are sure to be most in the way Many s the time Josiah has knocked over that blue saucer of mine in the shed and when you have thought that I had had a nice breakfast of milk I had nothing in the world but flies which are not good for much more than just a little sort of relish I am so glad of a chance to tell you about this because I know when you come home you will get a better dish for me I hope you found the horse chestnuts which I put in the bottom of the carriage for you I could not think of any thing else to put in which would remind you of me but I am afraid you will never think that it was I who put them there and it will be too bad if you don t for I had a dreadful time climbing up over the dasher with them and both my jaws are quite lame from stretching them so to carry the biggest ones I could find There are three beautiful dandelions out on the terrace but I don t suppose they will keep till you come home A man has been doing something to your garden but though I watched him very closely all the time I could not make out what he was about I am afraid it is something you will not like but if I find out more about it I will tell you in my next letter Good by

none	none	Illustration I felt very unhappy after you drove off yesterday Page twenty eight Illustration I hope you found the horse chestnuts which I put in the carriage for you I had a dreadful time climbing up over the dasher with them Page thirty three II My Dear Helen I do wish that you and your father would turn around directly wherever you are when you get this letter and come home as fast as you can If you do not come soon there will be no home left for you to come into I am so frightened and excited that my paws tremble and I have upset the ink twice and spilled so much that there is only a little left in the bottom of the cup and it is as thick as hasty pudding so you must excuse the looks of this letter and I will tell you as quickly as I can about the dreadful state of things here Not more than an hour after I finished my letter to you yesterday I heard a great noise in the parlor and ran in to see what was the matter There was Mary with her worst blue handkerchief tied over her head her washing day gown on and a big hammer in her hand As soon as she saw me she said There s that cat Always in my way and threw a cricket at me and then shut the parlor door with a great slam So I ran out and listened under the front windows for I felt sure she was in some bad business she did not want to have known Such a noise I never heard all the things were being moved and in a few minutes what do you think out came the whole carpet right on my head I was nearly stifled with dust and felt as if every bone in my body must be broken but I managed to creep out from under it and heard Mary say If there isn t that torment of a cat again I wish to goodness Helen had taken her along Then I felt surer than ever that some mischief was on foot and ran out into the garden and climbed up the old apple tree at the foot of the steps and crawled out on a branch from which I could look directly into the parlor windows Oh my dear Helen you can fancy how I felt to see all the chairs and tables and bookshelves in a pile in the middle of the floor the books all packed in big baskets and Mary taking out window after window as fast as she could I forgot to tell you that your mother went away last night I think she has gone to Hadley to make a visit and it looks to me very much as if Mary meant to run away with every thing which could be moved before she comes back After awhile that ugly Irishwoman who lives in mister Slater s house came into the back gate you know the one I mean the one that threw cold water on me last spring When I saw her coming I felt sure that she and Mary meant to kill me while you were all away so I jumped down out of the tree and split my best claw in my hurry and ran off into Baker s Grove and stayed there all the rest of the day in dreadful misery from cold and hunger There was some snow in the hollows and I wet my feet which always makes me feel wretchedly and I could not find any thing to eat except a thin dried up old mole They are never good in the spring Really nobody does know what hard lives we cats lead even the luckiest of us After dark I went home but Mary had fastened up every door even the little one into the back shed So I had to jump into the cellar window which is a thing I never like to do since I got that bad sprain in my shoulder from coming down on the edge of a milk pan I crept up to the head of the kitchen stairs as still as a mouse if I m any judge and listened there for a long time to try and make out from Mary s talk with the Irishwoman what they were planning to do But I never could understand Irish and although I listened till I had cramps in all my legs from being so long in one position I was no wiser Even the things Mary said I could not understand and I usually understand her very easily I passed a very uncomfortable night in the carrot bin As soon as I heard Mary coming down the cellar stairs this morning I hid in the arch and while she was skimming the milk I slipped upstairs and ran into the sitting room Every thing there is in the same confusion the carpet is gone and the windows too and I think some of the chairs have been carried away All the china is in great baskets on the pantry floor and your father and mother s clothes are all taken out of the nursery closet and laid on chairs It is very dreadful to have to stand and see all this and not be able to do any thing I don t think I ever fully realized before the disadvantage of being only a cat I have just been across the street and talked it all over with the Judge s cat but she is very old and stupid and so taken up with her six kittens who are the ugliest I ever saw that she does not take the least interest in her neighbors affairs missus Hitchcock walked by the house this morning and I ran out to her and took her dress in my teeth and pulled it and did all I could to make her come in but she said No no pussy I m not coming in to day your mistress is not at home I declare I could have cried I sat down in the middle of the path and never stirred for half an hour I heard your friend Hannah Dorrance say yesterday that she was going to write to you to day so I shall run up the hill now and carry my letter to her I think she will be astonished when she sees me for I am very sure that no other cat in town knows how to write Do come home as soon as possible Your affectionate Pussy P S Two men have just driven up to the front gate in a great cart and they are putting all the carpets into it Oh dear oh dear if I only knew what to do And I just heard Mary say to them Be as quick as you can for I want to get through with this business before the folks come back Illustration I climbed up the old apple tree and crawled out on a branch from which I could look directly into the parlor windows Page thirty eight Illustration I crept up to the head of the kitchen stairs as still as a mouse if I m any judge and listened Page forty III My Dear Helen I am too stiff and sore from a terrible fall I have had to write more than one line but I must let you know that my fright was very silly and I am very much mortified about it The house and the things are all safe your mother has come home and I will write and tell you all just as soon as I can use my pen without great pain Some new people have come to live in the Nelson house very nice people I think for they keep their milk in yellow crockery pans They have brought with them a splendid black cat whose name is Caesar and everybody is talking about him He has the handsomest whiskers I ever saw I do hope I shall be well enough to see him before long but I wouldn t have him see me now for any thing Your affectionate Pussy Illustration They have brought with them a splendid black cat whose name is Caesar and everybody is talking about him He has the handsomest whiskers I ever saw Page forty six IV My Dear Helen There is one thing that cats don t like any better than men and women do and that is to make fools of themselves But a precious fool I made of myself when I wrote you that long letter about Mary s moving out all the furniture and taking the house down It is very mortifying to have to tell you how it all turned out but I know you love me enough to be sorry that I should have had such a terrible fright for nothing It went on from bad to worse for three more days after I wrote you Your mother did not come home and the awful Irishwoman was here all the time I did not dare to go near the house and I do assure you I nearly starved I used to lie under the rose bushes and watch as well as I could what was going on now and then I caught a rat in the barn but that sort of hearty food never has agreed with me since I came to live with you and became accustomed to a lighter diet By the third day I felt too weak and sick to stir so I lay still all day on the straw in Charlie s stall and I really thought between the hunger and the anxiety that I should die About noon I heard Mary say in the shed I do believe that everlasting cat has taken herself off it s a good riddance anyhow but I should like to know what has become of the plaguy thing I trembled all over for if she had come into the barn I know one kick from her heavy foot would have killed me and I was quite too weak to run away Towards night I heard your dear mother s voice calling Poor pussy why poor pussy where are you I assure you my dear Helen people are very much mistaken who say as I have often overheard them that cats have no feeling If they could only know how I felt at that moment they would change their minds I was almost too glad to make a sound It seemed to me that my feet were fastened to the floor and that I never could get to her She took me up in her arms and carried me through the kitchen into the sitting room Mary was frying cakes in the kitchen and as your mother passed by the stove she said in her sweet voice You see I ve found poor pussy Mary Humph said Mary I never thought but that she d be found fast enough when she wanted to be I knew that this was a lie because I had heard what she said in the shed I do wish I knew what makes her hate me so I only wish she knew how I hate her I really think I shall gnaw her stockings and shoes some night It would not be any more than fair and she would never suspect me there are so many mice in her room for I never touch one that I think belongs in her closet The sitting room was all in most beautiful order a smooth white something like the side of a basket over the whole floor a beautiful paper curtain pink and white over the fire place and white muslin curtains at the windows I stood perfectly still in the middle of the room for some time I was too surprised to stir Oh how I wished that I could speak and tell your dear mother all that had happened and how the room had looked three days before Presently she said Poor pussy I know you are almost starved aren t you and I said Yes as plainly as I could mew it Then she brought me a big soup plate full of thick cream and some of the most delicious cold hash I ever tasted and after I had eaten it all she took me in her lap and said Poor pussy we miss little Helen don t we and she held me in her lap till bed time Then she let me sleep on the foot of her bed it was one of the happiest nights of my life In the middle of the night I was up for a while and caught the smallest mouse I ever saw out of the nest Such little ones are very tender In the morning I had my breakfast with her in the dining room which looks just as nice as the sitting room After breakfast missus Hitchcock came in and your mother said Only think how fortunate I am Mary did all the house cleaning while I was away Every room is in perfect order all the woollen clothes are put away for the summer Poor pussy here was frightened out of the house and I suppose we should all have been if we had been at home Can you imagine how ashamed I felt I ran under the table and did not come out again until after missus Hitchcock had gone But now comes the saddest part of my story Soon after this as I was looking out of the window I saw the fattest most tempting robin on the ground under the cherry tree the windows did not look as if they had any glass in them and I took it for granted that it had all been taken out and put away upstairs with the andirons and the carpets for next winter I knew that there was no time to be lost if I meant to catch that robin so I ran with all my might and tried to jump through Oh my dear Helen I do not believe you ever had such a bump I fell back nearly into the middle of the room and it seemed to me that I turned completely over at least six times The blood streamed out of my nose and I cut my right ear very badly against one of the castors of the table I could not see nor hear any thing for some minutes When I came to myself I found your dear mother holding me and wiping my face with her own nice handkerchief wet in cold water My right fore paw was badly bruised and that troubles me very much about washing my face and about writing But the worst of all is the condition of my nose Everybody laughs who sees me and I do not blame them it is twice as large as it used to be and I begin to be seriously afraid it will never return to its old shape This will be a dreadful affliction for who does not know that the nose is the chief beauty of a cat s face I have got very tired of hearing the story of my fall told to all the people who come in They laugh as if they would kill themselves at it especially when I do not manage to get under the table before they look to see how my nose is Except for this I should have written to you before and would write more now but my paw aches badly and one of my eyes is nearly closed from the swelling of my nose so I must say good by Your affectionate Pussy P S I told you about Caesar did I not in my last letter Of course I do not venture out of the house in my present plight so I have not seen him except from the window Illustration Can you imagine how ashamed I felt I ran under the table and did not come out again until after missus Hitchcock had gone Page fifty four Illustration I knew that there was no time to be lost if I meant to catch that robin so I ran with all my might and tried to jump through Page fifty five V My Dear Helen I am sure you must have wondered why I have not written to you for the last two weeks but when you hear what I have been through you will only wonder that I am alive to write to you at all I was very glad to hear your mother say yesterday that she had not written to you about what had happened to me because it would make you so unhappy But now that it is all over and I am in a fair way to be soon as well as ever I think you will like to hear the whole story In my last letter I told you about the new black cat Caesar who had come to live in the Nelson house and how anxious I was to know him As soon as my nose was fit to be seen Judge Dickinson s cat who is a good hospitable old soul in spite of her stupidity invited me to tea and asked him too All the other cats were asked to come later in the evening and we had a grand frolic hunting rats in the Judge s great barn Caesar is certainly the handsomest and most gentlemanly cat I ever saw He paid me great attention in fact so much that one of those miserable half starved cats from Mill Valley grew so jealous that she flew at me and bit my ear till it bled which broke up the party But Caesar went home with me so I did not care then we sat and talked a long time under the nursery window I was so much occupied in what he was saying that I did not hear Mary open the window overhead and was therefore terribly frightened when there suddenly came down on us a whole pailful of water I was so startled that I lost all presence of mind and without bidding him good night I jumped directly into the cellar window by which we were sitting Oh my dear Helen I can never give you any idea of what followed Instead of coming down as I expected to on the cabbages which were just under that window the last time I was in the cellar I found myself sinking sinking into some horrible soft slimy sticky substance which in an instant more would have closed over my head and suffocated me but fortunately as I sank I felt something hard at one side and making a great effort I caught on it with my claws It proved to be the side of a barrel and I succeeded in getting one paw over the edge of it There I hung growing weaker and weaker every minute with this frightful stuff running into my eyes and ears and choking me with its bad smell I mewed as loud as I could which was not very loud for whenever I opened my mouth the stuff trickled into it off my whiskers but I called to Caesar who stood in great distress at the window and explained to him as well as I could what had happened to me and begged him to call as loudly as possible for if somebody did not come very soon and take me out I should certainly die He insisted at first on jumping down to help me himself but I told him that would be the most foolish thing he could do if he did we should certainly both be drowned So he began to mew at the top of his voice and between his mewing and mine there was noise enough for a few minutes then windows began to open and I heard your grandfather swearing and throwing out a stick of wood at Caesar fortunately he was so near the house that it did not hit him At last your grandfather came downstairs and opened the back door and Caesar was so frightened that he ran away for which I have never thought so well of him since though we are still very good friends When I heard him running off and calling back to me from a distance that he was so sorry he could not help me my courage began to fail and in a moment more I should have let go of the edge of the barrel and sunk to the bottom but luckily your grandfather noticed that there was something very strange about my mewing and opened the door at the head of the cellar stairs saying I do believe the cat is in some trouble down here Then I made a great effort and mewed still more piteously How I wished I could call out and say Yes indeed I am drowning to death in I m sure I don t know what but something a great deal worse than water However he understood me as it was and came down with a lamp As soon as he saw me he set the lamp down on the cellar bottom and laughed so that he could hardly move I thought this was the most cruel thing I ever heard of If I had not been as it were at death s door I should have laughed at him too for even with my eyes full of that dreadful stuff I could see that he looked very funny in his red night cap and without his teeth He called out to Mary and your mother who stood at the head of the stairs Come down come down here s the cat in the soft soap barrel and then he laughed again and they both came down the stairs laughing even your dear kind mother who I never could have believed would laugh at any one in such trouble They did not seem to know what to do at first nobody wanted to touch me and I began to be afraid I should drown while they stood looking at me for I knew much better than they could how weak I was from holding on to the edge of the barrel so long At last your grandfather swore that oath of his you know the one I mean the one he always swears when he is very sorry for anybody and lifted me out by the nape of my neck holding me as far off from him as he could for the soft soap ran off my legs and tail in streams He carried me up into the kitchen and put me down in the middle of the floor and then they all stood round me and laughed again so loud that they waked up the cook who came running out of her bedroom with her tin candlestick and a chair in her hand thinking that robbers were breaking in At last your dear mother said Poor pussy it is too bad to laugh at you when you are in such pain I had been thinking so for some time Mary bring the small washtub The only thing we can do is to wash her When I heard this I almost wished they had left me to drown in the soft soap for if there is any thing of which I have a mortal dread it is water However I was too weak to resist and they plunged me in all over into the tub full of ice cold water and Mary began to rub me with her great rough hands which I assure you are very different from yours and your mother s Then they all laughed again to see the white lather it made in two minutes the whole tub was as white as the water under the mill wheel that you and I have so often been together to see You can imagine how my eyes smarted I burnt my paws once in getting a piece of beefsteak out of the coals where it had fallen off the gridiron but the pain of that was nothing to this You will hardly believe me when I tell you that they had to empty the tub and fill it again ten times before the soap was all washed out of my fur By that time I was so cold and exhausted that I could not move and they began to think I should die But your mother rolled me up in one of your old flannel petticoats and made a nice bed for me behind the stove By this time even Mary began to seem sorry for me though she was very cross at first and hurt me much more than she need to in washing me now she said You re nothing but a poor beast of a cat to be sure but it s mesilf that would be sorry to have the little mistress come back and find ye kilt So you see your love for me did me service even when you were so far away I doubt very much whether they would have ever taken the trouble to nurse me through this sickness except for your sake But I must leave the rest for my next letter I am not strong enough yet to write more than two hours at a time Your affectionate Pussy Illustration Judge Dickinson s cat who is a good hospitable old soul in spite of her stupidity invited me to tea and asked Caesar too Page sixty Illustration When there suddenly came down on us a whole pailful of water Page sixty one Illustration He lifted me out by the nape of my neck holding me as far off from him as he could Page sixty eight VI My Dear Helen 
6965_291718_000006_000000	train-clean-360	I will begin where I left off in my last letter 
6965_291718_000007_000000	train-clean-360	As you may imagine I did not get any sleep that night not even so much as a cat s nap as people say though how cat s naps differ from men s and women s naps I don t know 
6965_291718_000007_000001	train-clean-360	I shivered all night and it hurt me terribly whenever I moved 
none	none	Early in the morning your grandfather came downstairs and when he saw how I looked he swore again that same oath we all know very well what it means when he swears in that way it means that he is going to do all he can for you and is so sorry that he is afraid of seeming too sorry 
6965_291718_000007_000003	train-clean-360	Don t you remember when you had that big double tooth pulled out and he gave you five dollars how he swore then 
6965_291718_000007_000004	train-clean-360	Well he took me up in his arms and carried me into the dining room it was quite cool there was a nice wood fire on the hearth and Mary was setting the table for breakfast 
6965_291718_000007_000005	train-clean-360	He said to her in a very gruff voice Here you Mary you go up into the garret and bring down the cradle 
6965_291718_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Sick as I was I could not help laughing at the sight of her face 
6965_291718_000008_000001	train-clean-360	It was enough to make any cat laugh 
none	none	You don t ever mean to say sir as you re going to put that cat into the cradle
6965_291718_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 You do as I tell you said he in that most awful tone of his which always makes you so afraid 
6965_291718_000010_000001	train-clean-360	I felt afraid myself though all the time he was stroking my head and saying Poor pussy there poor pussy lie still In a few minutes Mary came down with the cradle and set it down by the fire with such a bang that I wondered it did not break 
6965_291718_000010_000002	train-clean-360	You know she always bangs things when she is cross but I never could see what good it does 
6965_291718_000010_000003	train-clean-360	Then your grandfather made up a nice bed in the cradle out of Charlie s winter blanket and an old pillow and laid me down in it all rolled up as I was in your petticoat 
6965_291718_000010_000004	train-clean-360	When your mother came into the room she laughed almost as hard as she did when she saw me in the soft soap barrel and said Why father you are rather old to play cat s cradle 
6965_291718_000010_000005	train-clean-360	The old gentleman laughed at this till the tears ran down his red cheeks 
none	none	Well he said I tell you one thing the game will last me till that poor cat gets well again Then he went upstairs and brought down a bottle of something very soft and slippery like lard and put it on my eyes and it made them feel much better After that he gave me some milk into which he had put some of his very best brandy that was pretty hard to get down but I understood enough of what they had said to be sure that if I did not take something of the kind I should never get well 
6965_291718_000010_000007	train-clean-360	After breakfast I tried to walk but my right paw was entirely useless 
6965_291718_000010_000008	train-clean-360	At first they thought it was broken but finally decided that it was only sprained and must be bandaged 
6965_291718_000010_000009	train-clean-360	The bandages were wet with something which smelled so badly it made me feel very sick for the first day or two 
none	none	Cats noses are much more sensitive to smells than people s are but I grew used to it and it did my poor lame paw so much good that I would have borne it if it had smelled twice as badly 
6965_291718_000010_000011	train-clean-360	For three days I had to lie all the time in the cradle if your grandfather caught me out of it he would swear at me and put me back again 
6965_291718_000010_000012	train-clean-360	Every morning he put the soft white stuff on my eyes and changed the bandages on my leg 
6965_291718_000010_000013	train-clean-360	And oh my dear Helen such good things as I had to eat 
6965_291718_000010_000014	train-clean-360	I had almost the same things for my dinner that the rest of them did it must be a splendid thing to be a man or a woman 
6965_291718_000010_000015	train-clean-360	I do not think I shall ever again be contented to eat in the shed and have only the old pieces which nobody wants 
none	none	Two things troubled me very much while I was confined to the cradle one was that everybody who came in to see your mother laughed as if they never could stop at the first sight of me and the other was that I heard poor Caesar mewing all around the house and calling me with all his might and I knew he thought I was dead I tried hard to make your kind mother notice his crying for I knew she would be willing to let him come in and see me but I could not make her understand 
6965_291718_000011_000002	train-clean-360	I suppose she thought it was only some common strolling cat who was hungry 
6965_291718_000011_000003	train-clean-360	I have always noticed that people do not observe any difference between one cat s voice and another s now they really are just as different as human voices 
6965_291718_000011_000004	train-clean-360	Caesar has one of the finest deepest toned voices I ever heard 
6965_291718_000011_000005	train-clean-360	One day after I got well enough to be in the kitchen he slipped in between the legs of the butcher s boy who was bringing in some meat but before I had time to say one word to him Mary flew at him with the broom and drove him out 
6965_291718_000011_000006	train-clean-360	However he saw that I was alive and that was something 
6965_291718_000011_000007	train-clean-360	I am afraid it will be some days yet before I can see him again for they do not let me go out at all and the bandages are not taken off my leg 
6965_291718_000011_000008	train-clean-360	The cradle is carried upstairs and I sleep on Charlie s blanket behind the stove 
6965_291718_000011_000009	train-clean-360	I heard your mother say to day that she really believed the cat had the rheumatism 
6965_291718_000011_000010	train-clean-360	I do not know what that is but I think I have got it it hurts me all over when I walk and I feel as if I looked like Bill Jacobs s old cat who they say is older than the oldest man in town but of course that must be a slander 
6965_291718_000012_000000	train-clean-360	The thing I am most concerned about is my fur it is coming off in spots there is a bare spot on the back of my neck on the place by which they lifted me up out of the soap barrel half as large as your hand and whenever I wash myself I get my mouth full of hairs which is very disagreeable 
none	none	I heard your grandfather say to day that he believed he would try missus Somebody s Hair Restorer on the cat at which everybody laughed so that ran out of the room as fast as I could go and then they laughed still harder I will write you again in a day or two and tell you how I am getting on 
6965_291718_000012_000003	train-clean-360	I hope you will come home soon 
none	none	Your affectionate Pussy Illustration Then your grandfather made up a nice bed in the cradle and laid me down in it Page seventy six Illustration One day he slipped in between the legs of the butcher boy but before I had time to say a word to him Mary flew at him with the broom Page eighty one 
6965_291718_000016_000000	train-clean-360	VII 
none	none	My Dear Helen 
6965_291718_000018_000000	train-clean-360	I am so glad to know that you are coming home next week that I cannot think of any thing else 
6965_291718_000018_000001	train-clean-360	There is only one drawback to my pleasure and that is I am so ashamed to have you see me in such a plight 
6965_291718_000018_000002	train-clean-360	I told you in my last letter that my fur was beginning to come off 
6965_291718_000018_000003	train-clean-360	Your grandfather has tried several things of his which are said to be good for hair but they have not had the least effect 
none	none	For my part I don t see why they should fur and hair are two very different things and I thought at the outset there was no use in putting on my skin what was intended for the skin of human heads and even on them don t seem to work any great wonders if I can judge from your grandfather s head which you know is as bald and pink and shiny as a baby s 
6965_291718_000018_000005	train-clean-360	However he has been so good to me that I let him do any thing he likes and every day he rubs in some new kind of stuff which smells a little worse than the last one 
none	none	It is utterly impossible for me to get within half a mile of a rat or a mouse 
6965_291718_000018_000007	train-clean-360	I might as well fire off a gun to let them know I am coming as to go about scented up so that they can smell me a great deal farther off than they can see me 
6965_291718_000018_000008	train-clean-360	If it were not for this dreadful state of my fur I should be perfectly happy for I feel much better than I ever did before in my whole life and am twice as fat as when you went away 
6965_291718_000018_000009	train-clean-360	I try to be resigned to whatever may be in store for me but it is very hard to look forward to being a fright all the rest of one s days 
6965_291718_000018_000010	train-clean-360	I don t suppose such a thing was ever seen in the world as a cat without any fur 
6965_291718_000018_000011	train-clean-360	This morning your grandfather sat looking at me for a long time and stroking his chin at last he said Do you suppose it would do any good to shave the cat all over At this I could not resist the impulse to scream and your mother said I do believe the creature knows whenever we speak about her Of course I do 
6965_291718_000018_000012	train-clean-360	Why in the world shouldn t I People never seem to observe that cats have ears 
6965_291718_000018_000013	train-clean-360	I often think how much more careful they would be if they did 
none	none	I have many a time to see them send children out of the room and leave me behind when I knew perfectly well that the children would neither notice nor understand half so much as I would 
6965_291718_000018_000015	train-clean-360	There are some houses in which I lived before I came to live with you about which I could tell strange stories if I chose 
none	none	Caesar pretends that he likes the looks of little spots of pink skin here and there in fur but I know he only does it to save my feelings for it isn t in human nature I mean in cat s nature that any one should 
6965_291718_000019_000001	train-clean-360	You see I spend so much more time in the society of men and women than of cats that I find myself constantly using expressions which sound queerly in a cat s mouth 
6965_291718_000019_000002	train-clean-360	But you know me well enough to be sure that every thing I say is perfectly natural 
6965_291718_000019_000003	train-clean-360	And now my dear Helen I hope I have prepared you to see me looking perfectly hideous 
6965_291718_000019_000004	train-clean-360	I only trust that your love for me will not be entirely killed by my unfortunate appearance 
none	none	If you do seem to love me less I shall be wretched but I shall still be always Your affectionate Pussy End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Letters from a Cat by Helen Jackson END OF THIS
