LOWER TEN WHEN A MAN MARRIES WHERE THERE S A WILL et cetera Illustrated by M LEONE BRACKER nineteen thirteen CHAPTER I We have just had another flood bad enough but only a foot or two of water on the first floor Yesterday we got the mud shoveled out of the cellar and found Peter the spaniel that mister Ladley left when he went away The flood and the fact that it was mister Ladley s dog whose body was found half buried in the basement fruit closet brought back to me the strange events of the other flood five years ago when the water reached more than half way to the second story and brought with it to some mystery and sudden death and to me the worst case of shingles I have ever seen My name is Pitman in this narrative It is not really Pitman but that does well enough I belong to an old Pittsburgh family I was born on Penn Avenue when that was the best part of town and I lived until I was fifteen very close to what is now the Pittsburgh Club It was a dwelling then I have forgotten who lived there I was a girl in seventy seven during the railroad riots and I recall our driving in the family carriage over to one of the Allegheny hills and seeing the yards burning and a great noise of shooting from across the river It was the next year that I ran away from school to marry mister Pitman and I have not known my family since We were never reconciled although I came back to Pittsburgh after twenty years of wandering mister Pitman was dead the old city called me and I came I had a hundred dollars or so and I took a house in lower Allegheny where because they are partly inundated every spring rents are cheap and I kept boarders My house was always orderly and clean and although the neighborhood had a bad name a good many theatrical people stopped with me Five minutes across the bridge and they were in the theater district Allegheny at that time I believe was still an independent city But since then it has allied itself with Pittsburgh it is now the North Side I was glad to get back I worked hard but I made my rent and my living and a little over Now and then on summer evenings I went to one of the parks and sitting on a bench watched the children playing around and looked at my sister s house closed for the summer It is a very large house her butler once had his wife boarding with me a nice little woman It is curious to recall that at that time five years ago I had never seen my niece Lida Harvey and then to think that only the day before yesterday she came in her automobile as far as she dared and then sat there waving to me while the police patrol brought across in a skiff a basket of provisions she had sent me I wonder what she would have thought had she known that the elderly woman in a calico wrapper with an old overcoat over it and a pair of rubber boots was her full aunt The flood and the sight of Lida both brought back the case of Jennie Brice For even then Lida and mister Howell were interested in each other This is April The flood of nineteen oh seven was earlier in March It had been a long hard winter with ice gorges in all the upper valley Then in early March there came a thaw The gorges broke up and began to come down filling the rivers with crushing grinding ice There are three rivers at Pittsburgh the Allegheny and the Monongahela uniting there at the Point to form the Ohio And all three were covered with broken ice logs and all sorts of debris from the upper valleys A warning was sent out from the weather bureau and I got my carpets ready to lift that morning That was on the fourth of March a Sunday mister Ladley and his wife Jennie Brice had the parlor bedroom and the room behind it missus Ladley or Miss Brice as she preferred to be known had a small part at a local theater that kept a permanent company Her husband was in that business too but he had nothing to do It was the wife who paid the bills and a lot of quarreling they did about it I knocked at the door at ten o clock and mister Ladley opened it He was a short man rather stout and getting bald and he always had a cigarette Even yet the parlor carpet smells of them What do you want he asked sharply holding the door open about an inch The water s coming up very fast mister Ladley I said It s up to the swinging shelf in the cellar now I d like to take up the carpet and move the piano Come back in an hour or so he snapped and tried to close the door But I had got my toe in the crack I ll have to have the piano moved mister Ladley I said You d better put off what you are doing I thought he was probably writing He spent most of the day writing using the wash stand as a desk and it kept me busy with oxalic acid taking ink spots out of the splasher and the towels He was writing a play and talked a lot about the Shuberts having promised to star him in it when it was finished Hell he said and turning spoke to somebody in the room We can go into the back room I heard him say and he closed the door When he opened it again the room was empty I called in Terry the Irishman who does odd jobs for me now and then and we both got to work at the tacks in the carpet Terry working by the window and I by the door into the back parlor which the Ladleys used as a bedroom That was how I happened to hear what I afterward told the police Some one a man but not mister Ladley was talking missus Ladley broke in I won t do it she said flatly Why should I help him He doesn t help me He loafs here all day smoking and sleeping and sits up all night drinking and keeping me awake The voice went on again as if in reply to this and I heard a rattle of glasses as if they were pouring drinks They always had whisky even when they were behind with their board That s all very well missus Ladley said I could always hear her she having a theatrical sort of voice one that carries But what about the prying she devil that runs the house Hush for God s sake broke in mister Ladley and after that they spoke in whispers Even with my ear against the panel I could not catch a word The men came just then to move the piano and by the time we had taken it and the furniture up stairs the water was over the kitchen floor and creeping forward into the hall I had never seen the river come up so fast By noon the yard was full of floating ice and at three that afternoon the police skiff was on the front street and I was wading around in rubber boots taking the pictures off the walls I was too busy to see who the Ladleys visitor was and he had gone when I remembered him again The Ladleys took the second story front which was empty and mister Reynolds who was in the silk department in a store across the river had the room just behind I put up a coal stove in a back room next the bathroom and managed to cook the dinner there I was washing up the dishes when mister Reynolds came in As it was Sunday he was in his slippers and had the colored supplement of a morning paper in his hand What s the matter with the Ladleys he asked I can t read for their quarreling Booze probably I said When you ve lived in the flood district as long as I have mister Reynolds you ll know that the rising of the river is a signal for every man in the vicinity to stop work and get full The fuller the river the fuller the male population Then this flood will likely make em drink themselves to death he said It s a lulu It s the neighborhood s annual debauch The women are busy keeping the babies from getting drowned in the cellars or they d get full too I hope since it s come this far it will come farther so the landlord will have to paper the parlor That was at three o clock At four mister Ladley went down the stairs and I heard him getting into a skiff in the lower hall There were boats going back and forth all the time carrying crowds of curious people and taking the flood sufferers to the corner grocery where they were lowering groceries in a basket on a rope from an upper window I had been making tea when I heard mister Ladley go out I fixed a tray with a cup of it and some crackers and took it to their door I had never liked missus Ladley but it was chilly in the house with the gas shut off and the lower floor full of ice water And it is hard enough to keep boarders in the flood district She did not answer to my knock so I opened the door and went in She was at the window looking after him and the brown valise that figured in the case later was opened on the floor Over the foot of the bed was the black and white dress with the red collar When I spoke to her she turned around quickly She was a tall woman about twenty eight with very white teeth and yellow hair which she parted a little to one side and drew down over her ears She had a sullen face and large well shaped hands with her nails long and very pointed The she devil has brought you some tea I said Where shall she put it She devil she repeated raising her eyebrows It s a very thoughtful she devil Who called you that But with the sight of the valise and the fear that they might be leaving I thought it best not to quarrel She had left the window and going to her dressing table had picked up her nail file Never mind I said I hope you are not going away These floods don t last and they re a benefit Plenty of the people around here rely on em every year to wash out their cellars No I m not going away she replied lazily I m taking that dress to Miss Hope at the theater She is going to wear it in Charlie s Aunt next week She hasn t half enough of a wardrobe to play leads in stock Look at this thumb nail broken to the quick If I had only looked to see which thumb it was But I was putting the tea tray on the wash stand and moving mister Ladley s papers to find room for it Peter the spaniel begged for a lump of sugar and I gave it to him Where is mister Ladley I asked Gone out to see the river I hope he ll be careful There s a drowning or two every year in these floods Then I hope he won t she said calmly Do you know what I was doing when you came in I was looking after his boat and hoping it had a hole in it You won t feel that way to morrow missus Ladley I protested shocked You re just nervous and put out Most men have their ugly times Many a time I wished mister Pitman was gone until he went Then I d have given a good bit to have him back again She was standing in front of the dresser fixing her hair over her ears She turned and looked at me over her shoulder Probably mister Pitman was a man she said My husband is a fiend a devil Well a good many women have said that to me at different times But just let me say such a thing to them or repeat their own words to them the next day and they would fly at me in a fury So I said nothing and put the cream into her tea I never saw her again CHAPTER II There is not much sleeping done in the flood district during a spring flood The gas was shut off and I gave mister Reynolds and the Ladleys each a lamp I sat in the back room that I had made into a temporary kitchen with a candle and with a bedquilt around my shoulders The water rose fast in the lower hall but by midnight at the seventh step it stopped rising and stood still I always have a skiff during the flood season and as the water rose I tied it to one spindle of the staircase after another I made myself a cup of tea and at one o clock I stretched out on a sofa for a few hours sleep I think I had been sleeping only an hour or so when some one touched me on the shoulder and I started up It was mister Reynolds partly dressed Some one has been in the house missus Pitman he said They went away just now in the boat Perhaps it was Peter I suggested That dog is always wandering around at night Not unless Peter can row a boat said mister Reynolds dryly I got up being already fully dressed and taking the candle we went to the staircase I noticed that it was a minute or so after two o clock as we left the room The boat was gone not untied but cut loose The end of the rope was still fastened to the stair rail I sat down on the stairs and looked at mister Reynolds It s gone I said If the house catches fire we ll have to drown It s rather curious when you consider it We both spoke softly not to disturb the Ladleys I ve been awake and I heard no boat come in And yet if no one came in a boat and came from the street they would have had to swim in I felt queer and creepy The street door was open of course and the lights going beyond It gave me a strange feeling to sit there in the darkness on the stairs with the arch of the front door like the entrance to a cavern and see now and then a chunk of ice slide into view turn around in the eddy and pass on It was bitter cold too and the wind was rising I ll go through the house said mister Reynolds There s likely nothing worse the matter than some drunken mill hand on a vacation while the mills are under water But I d better look He left me and I sat there alone in the darkness I had a presentiment of something wrong but I tried to think it was only discomfort and the cold The water driven in by the wind swirled at my feet And something dark floated in and lodged on the step below I reached down and touched it It was a dead kitten I had never known a dead cat to bring me anything but bad luck and here was one washed in at my very feet mister Reynolds came back soon and reported the house quiet and in order But I found Peter shut up in one of the third floor rooms he said Did you put him there I had not and said so but as the dog went everywhere and the door might have blown shut we did not attach much importance to that at the time Well the skiff was gone and there was no use worrying about it until morning I went back to the sofa to keep warm but I left my candle lighted and my door open I did not sleep the dead cat was on my mind and as if it were not bad enough to have it washed in at my feet about four in the morning Peter prowling uneasily discovered it and brought it in and put it on my couch wet and stiff poor little thing I looked at the clock It was a quarter after four and except for the occasional crunch of one ice cake hitting another in the yard everything was quiet And then I heard the stealthy sound of oars in the lower hall I am not a brave woman I lay there hoping mister Reynolds would hear and open his door But he was sleeping soundly Peter snarled and ran out into the hall and the next moment I heard mister Ladley speaking Down Peter he said Down Go and lie down I took my candle and went out into the hall mister Ladley was stooping over the boat trying to tie it to the staircase The rope was short having been cut and he was having trouble Perhaps it was the candle light but he looked ghost white and haggard I borrowed your boat missus Pitman he said civilly enough missus Ladley was not well and I I went to the drug store You ve been more than two hours going to the drug store I said He muttered something about not finding any open at first and went into his room He closed and locked the door behind him and although Peter whined and scratched he did not let him in He looked so agitated that I thought I had been harsh and that perhaps she was really ill I knocked at the door and asked if I could do anything But he only called No curtly through the door and asked me to take that infernal dog away I went back to bed and tried to sleep for the water had dropped an inch or so on the stairs and I knew the danger was over Peter came shivering at dawn and got on to the sofa with me I put an end of the quilt over him and he stopped shivering after a time and went to sleep The dog was company I lay there wide awake thinking about mister Pitman s death and how I had come by degrees to be keeping a cheap boarding house in the flood district and to having to take impudence from everybody who chose to rent a room from me and to being called a she devil From that I got to thinking again about the Ladleys and how she had said he was a fiend and to doubting about his having gone out for medicine for her I dozed off again at daylight and being worn out I slept heavily At seven o clock mister Reynolds came to the door dressed for the store He was a tall man of about fifty neat and orderly in his habits and he always remembered that I had seen better days and treated me as a lady Never mind about breakfast for me this morning missus Pitman he said I ll get a cup of coffee at the other end of the bridge I ll take the boat and send it back with Terry He turned and went along the hall and down to the boat I heard him push off from the stairs with an oar and row out into the street Peter followed him to the stairs At a quarter after seven mister Ladley came out and called to me Just bring in a cup of coffee and some toast he said Enough for one He went back and slammed his door and I made his coffee I steeped a cup of tea for missus Ladley at the same time He opened the door just wide enough for the tray and took it without so much as a thank you He had a cigarette in his mouth as usual and I could see a fire in the grate and smell something like scorching cloth I hope missus Ladley is better I said getting my foot in the crack of the door so he could not quite close it It smelled to me as if he had accidentally set fire to something with his cigarette and I tried to see into the room What about missus Ladley he snapped You said she was ill last night Oh yes Well she wasn t very sick She s better Shall I bring her some tea Take your foot away he ordered No She doesn t want tea She s not here Not here Good heavens he snarled Is her going away anything to make such a fuss about The Lord knows I d be glad to get out of this infernal pig wallow myself If you mean my house I began But he had pulled himself together and was more polite when he answered I mean the neighborhood Your house is all that could be desired for the money If we do not have linen sheets and double cream we are paying muslin and milk prices Either my nose was growing accustomed to the odor or it was dying away I took my foot away from the door When did missus Ladley leave I asked This morning very early I rowed her to Federal Street You couldn t have had much sleep I said dryly For he looked horrible There were lines around his eyes which were red and his lips looked dry and cracked She s not in the piece this week at the theater he said licking his lips and looking past me not at me She ll be back by Saturday I did not believe him I do not think he imagined that I did He shut the door in my face and it caught poor Peter by the nose The dog ran off howling but although mister Ladley had been as fond of the animal as it was in his nature to be fond of anything he paid no attention As I started down the hall after him I saw what Peter had been carrying a slipper of missus Ladley s It was soaked with water evidently Peter had found it floating at the foot of the stairs Although the idea of murder had not entered my head at that time the slipper gave me a turn I picked it up and looked at it a black one with a beaded toe short in the vamp and high heeled the sort most actresses wear Then I went back and knocked at the door of the front room again What the devil do you want now he called from beyond the door Here s a slipper of missus Ladley s I said Peter found it floating in the lower hall He opened the door wide and let me in The room was in tolerable order much better than when missus Ladley was about He looked at the slipper but he did not touch it I don t think that is hers he said I ve seen her wear it a hundred times Well she ll never wear it again And then seeing me stare he added It s ruined with the water Throw it out And by the way I m sorry but I set fire to one of the pillow slips dropped asleep and my cigarette did the rest Just put it on the bill He pointed to the bed One of the pillows had no slip and the ticking cover had a scorch or two on it I went over and looked at it The pillow will have to be paid for too mister Ladley I said And there s a sign nailed on the door that forbids smoking in bed If you are going to set fire to things I shall have to charge extra Really he jeered looking at me with his cold fishy eyes Is there any sign on the door saying that boarders are charged extra for seven feet of filthy river in the bedrooms I was never a match for him and I make it a principle never to bandy words with my boarders I took the pillow and the slipper and went out The telephone was ringing on the stair landing It was the theater asking for Miss Brice She has gone away I said What do you mean Moved away Gone for a few days vacation I replied She isn t playing this week is she Wait a moment said the voice There was a hum of conversation from the other end and then another man came to the telephone Can you find out where Miss Brice has gone I ll see I went to Ladley s door and knocked mister Ladley answered from just beyond The theater is asking where missus Ladley is Tell them I don t know he snarled and shut the door I took his message to the telephone Whoever it was swore and hung up the receiver All the morning I was uneasy I hardly knew why Peter felt it as I did There was no sound from the Ladleys room and the house was quiet except for the lapping water on the stairs and the police patrol going back and forth At eleven o clock a boy in the neighborhood paddling on a raft fell into the water and was drowned I watched the police boat go past carrying his little cold body and after that I was good for nothing I went and sat with Peter on the stairs The dog s conduct had been strange all morning He had sat just above the water looking at it and whimpering Perhaps he was expecting another kitten or It is hard to say how ideas first enter one s mind But the notion that mister Ladley had killed his wife and thrown her body into the water came to me as I sat there All at once I seemed to see it all the quarreling the day before the night trip in the boat the water soaked slipper his haggard face that morning even the way the spaniel sat and stared at the flood Terry brought the boat back at half past eleven towing it behind another Well I said from the stairs I hope you ve had a pleasant morning What doing he asked not looking at me Rowing about the streets You ve had that boat for hours He tied it up without a word to me but he spoke to the dog Good morning Peter he said It s nice weather for fishes ain t it He picked out a bit of floating wood from the water and showing it to the dog flung it into the parlor Peter went after it with a splash He was pretty fat and when he came back I heard him wheezing But what he brought back was not the stick of wood It was the knife I use for cutting bread It had been on a shelf in the room where I had slept the night before and now Peter brought it out of the flood where its wooden handle had kept it afloat The blade was broken off short It is not unusual to find one s household goods floating around during flood time More than once I ve lost a chair or two and seen it after the water had gone down new scrubbed and painted in Molly Maguire s kitchen next door And perhaps now and then a bit of luck would come to me a dog kennel or a chicken house or a kitchen table or even as happened once a month old baby in a wooden cradle that lodged against my back fence and had come forty miles as it turned out with no worse mishap than a cold in its head But the knife was different I had put it on the mantel over the stove I was using up stairs the night before and hadn t touched it since As I sat staring at it Terry took it from Peter and handed it to me Better give me a penny missus Pitman he said in his impudent Irish way I hate to give you a knife It may cut our friendship I reached over to hit him a clout on the head but I did not The sunlight was coming in through the window at the top of the stairs and shining on the rope that was tied to the banister The end of the rope was covered with stains brown with a glint of red in them I got up shivering You can get the meat at the butcher s Terry I said and come back for me in a half hour Then I turned and went up stairs weak in the knees to put on my hat and coat I had made up my mind that there had been murder done CHAPTER III I looked at my clock as I went down stairs It was just twelve thirty I thought of telephoning for mister Reynolds to meet me but it was his lunch hour and besides I was afraid to telephone from the house while mister Ladley was in it Peter had been whining again When I came down the stairs he had stopped whimpering and was wagging his tail A strange boat had put into the hallway and was coming back Now old boy somebody was saying from the boat Steady old chap I ve got something for you A little man elderly and alert was standing up in the boat poling it along with an oar Peter gave vent to joyful yelps The elderly gentleman brought his boat to a stop at the foot of the stairs and reaching down into a tub at his feet held up a large piece of raw liver Peter almost went crazy and I remembered suddenly that I had forgotten to feed the poor beast for more than a day Would you like it asked the gentleman Peter sat up as he had been taught to do and barked The gentleman reached down again got a wooden platter from a stack of them at his feet and placing the liver on it put it on the step The whole thing was so neat and businesslike that I could only gaze That s a well trained dog madam said the elderly gentleman beaming at Peter over his glasses You should not have neglected him The flood put him out of my mind I explained humbly enough for I was ashamed Exactly Do you know how many starving dogs and cats I have found this morning He took a note book out of his pocket and glanced at it Forty eight Forty eight madam And ninety three cats I have found them marooned in trees clinging to fences floating on barrels and I have found them in comfortable houses where there was no excuse for their neglect Well I must be moving on I have the report of a cat with a new litter in the loft of a stable near here He wiped his hands carefully on a fresh paper napkin of which also a heap rested on one of the seats of the boat and picked up an oar smiling benevolently at Peter Then suddenly he bent over and looked at the stained rope end tied to the stair rail What s that he said That s what I m going to find out I replied I glanced up at the Ladleys door but it was closed The little man dropped his oar and fumbling in his pockets pulled out a small magnifying glass He bent over holding to the rail and inspected the stains with the glass I had taken a fancy to him at once and in spite of my excitement I had to smile a little Humph he said and looked up at me That s blood Why did you cut the boat loose I didn t I said If that is blood I want to know how it got there That was a new rope last night I glanced at the Ladleys door again and he followed my eyes I wonder he said raising his voice a little if I come into your kitchen if you will allow me to fry a little of that liver There s a wretched Maltese in a tree at the corner of Fourth Street that won t touch it raw I saw that he wanted to talk to me so I turned around and led the way to the temporary kitchen I had made Now he said briskly when he had closed the door there s something wrong here Perhaps if you tell me I can help If I can t it will do you good to talk about it My name s Holcombe retired merchant Apply to First National Bank for references I m not sure there is anything wrong I began I guess I m only nervous and thinking little things are big ones There s nothing to tell Nonsense I come down the street in my boat A white faced gentleman with a cigarette looks out from a window when I stop at the door and ducks back when I glance up I come in and find a pet dog obviously overfed at ordinary times whining with hunger on the stairs As I prepare to feed him a pale woman comes down trying to put a right hand glove on her left hand and with her jacket wrong side out What am I to think I started and looked at my coat He was right And when as I tried to take it off he helped me and even patted me on the shoulder what with his kindness and the long morning alone worrying and the sleepless night I began to cry He had a clean handkerchief in my hand before I had time to think of one That s it he said It will do you good only don t make a noise about it If it s a husband on the annual flood spree don t worry madam They always come around in time to whitewash the cellars It isn t a husband I sniffled Tell me about it he said There was something so kindly in his face and it was so long since I had had a bit of human sympathy that I almost broke down again I sat there with a crowd of children paddling on a raft outside the window and Molly Maguire next door hauling the morning s milk up in a pail fastened to a rope her doorway being too narrow to admit the milkman s boat and I told him the whole story Humph he exclaimed when I had finished It s curious but you can t prove a murder unless you can produce a body When the river goes down we ll find the body I said shivering It s in the parlor Then why doesn t he try to get away He is ready to go now He only went back when your boat came in mister Holcombe ran to the door and flinging it open peered into the lower hall He was too late His boat was gone tub of liver pile of wooden platters and all We hurried to the room the Ladleys had occupied It was empty From the window as we looked out we could see the boat almost a square away It had stopped where the street being higher a door step rose above the flood On the step was sitting a forlorn yellow puppy As we stared mister Ladley stopped the boat looked back at us bent over placed a piece of liver on a platter and reached it over to the dog Then rising in the boat he bowed with his hat over his heart in our direction sat down calmly and rowed around the corner out of sight mister Holcombe was in a frenzy of rage He jumped up and down shaking his fist out the window after the retreating boat He ran down the staircase only to come back and look out the window again The police boat was not in sight but the Maguire children had worked their raft around to the street and were under the window He leaned out and called to them A quarter each boys he said if you ll take me on that raft to the nearest pavement Money first said the oldest boy holding his cap But mister Holcombe did not wait He swung out over the window sill holding by his hands and lit fairly in the center of the raft Don t touch anything in that room until I come back he called to me and jerking the pole from one of the boys propelled the raft with amazing speed down the street The liver on the stove was burning There was a smell of scorching through the rooms and a sort of bluish haze of smoke I hurried back and took it off By the time I had cleaned the pan mister Holcombe was back again in his own boat He had found it at the end of the next street where the flood ceased but no sign of Ladley anywhere He had not seen the police boat Perhaps that is just as well he said philosophically We can t go to the police with a wet slipper and a blood stained rope and accuse a man of murder We have to have a body He killed her I said obstinately She told me yesterday he was a fiend He killed her and threw the body in the water Very likely But he didn t throw it here But in spite of that he went over all the lower hall with his boat feeling every foot of the floor with an oar and finally at the back end he looked up at me as I stood on the stairs There s something here he said I went cold all over and had to clutch the railing But when Terry had come and the two of them brought the thing to the surface it was only the dining room rug which I had rolled up and forgotten to carry up stairs At half past one mister Holcombe wrote a note and sent it off with Terry and borrowing my boots which had been mister Pitman s investigated the dining room and kitchen from a floating plank the doors were too narrow to admit the boat But he found nothing more important than a rolling pin He was not at all depressed by his failure He came back drenched to the skin about three and asked permission to search the Ladleys bedroom I have a friend coming pretty soon missus Pitman he said a young newspaper man named Howell He s a nice boy and if there is anything to this I d like him to have it for his paper He and I have been having some arguments about circumstantial evidence too and I know he d like to work on this I gave him a pair of mister Pitman s socks for his own were saturated and while he was changing them the telephone rang It was the theater again asking for Jennie Brice You are certain she is out of the city some one asked the same voice as in the morning Her husband says so Ask him to come to the phone He is not here When do you expect him back I m not sure he is coming back Look here said the voice angrily can t you give me any satisfaction Or don t you care to I ve told you all I know You don t know where she is No sir She didn t say she was coming back to rehearse for next week s piece Her husband said she went away for a few days rest He went away about noon and hasn t come back That s all I know except that they owe me three weeks rent that I d like to get hold of The owner of the voice hung up the receiver with a snap and left me pondering It seemed to me that mister Ladley had been very reckless Did he expect any one to believe that Jennie Brice had gone for a vacation without notifying the theater Especially when she was to rehearse that week I thought it curious to say the least I went back and told mister Holcombe who put it down in his note book and together we went to the Ladleys room The room was in better order than usual as I have said The bed was made which was out of the ordinary for Jennie Brice never made a bed but made the way a man makes one with the blankets wrinkled and crooked beneath and the white counterpane pulled smoothly over the top showing every lump beneath I showed mister Holcombe the splasher dotted with ink as usual I ll take it off and soak it in milk I said It s his fountain pen when the ink doesn t run he shakes it and Where s the clock said mister Holcombe stopping in front of the mantel with his note book in his hand The clock I turned and looked My onyx clock was gone from the mantel shelf Perhaps it seems strange but from the moment I missed that clock my rage at mister Ladley increased to a fury It was all I had had left of my former gentility When times were hard and I got behind with the rent as happened now and then more than once I d been tempted to sell the clock or to pawn it But I had never done it Its ticking had kept me company on many a lonely night and its elegance had helped me to keep my pride and to retain the respect of my neighbors For in the flood district onyx clocks are not plentiful missus Bryan the saloon keeper s wife had one and I had another That is I had had I stood staring at the mark in the dust of the mantel shelf which mister Holcombe was measuring with a pocket tape measure You are sure you didn t take it away yourself missus Pitman he asked Sure Why I could hardly lift it I said He was looking carefully at the oblong of dust where the clock had stood The key is gone too he said busily making entries in his note book What was the maker s name Why I don t think I ever noticed He turned to me angrily Why didn t you notice he snapped Good God woman do you only use your eyes to cry with How can you wind a clock time after time and not know the maker s name It proves my contention the average witness is totally unreliable Not at all I snapped I am ordinarily both accurate and observing Indeed he said putting his hands behind him Then perhaps you can tell me the color of the pencil I have been writing with Certainly Red Most pencils are red and I thought this was safe But he held his right hand out with a flourish I ve been writing with a fountain pen he said in deep disgust and turned his back on me But the next moment he had run to the wash stand and pulled it out from the wall Behind it where it had fallen lay a towel covered with stains as if some one had wiped bloody hands on it He held it up his face working with excitement I could only cover my eyes This looks better he said and began making a quick search of the room running from one piece of furniture to another pulling out bureau drawers drawing the bed out from the wall and crawling along the base board with a lighted match in his hand He gave a shout of triumph finally and reappeared from behind the bed with the broken end of my knife in his hand Very clumsy he said Very clumsy Peter the dog could have done better I had been examining the wall paper about the wash stand Among the ink spots were one or two reddish ones that made me shiver And seeing a scrap of note paper stuck between the base board and the wall I dug it out with a hairpin and threw it into the grate to be burned later It was by the merest chance there was no fire there The next moment mister Holcombe was on his knees by the fireplace reaching for the scrap Never do that under such circumstances he snapped fishing among the ashes You might throw away valuable Hello Howell I turned and saw a young man in the doorway smiling his hat in his hand Even at that first glance I liked mister Howell and later when every one was against him and many curious things were developing I stood by him through everything and even helped him to the thing he wanted more than anything else in the world But that of course was later What s the trouble Holcombe he asked Hitting the trail again A very curious thing that I just happened on said mister Holcombe missus Pitman this is mister Howell of whom I spoke Sit down Howell and let me read you something With the crumpled paper still unopened in his hand mister Holcombe took his note book and read aloud what he had written I have it before me now Dog meat two dollars boat hire that s not it Here Yesterday Sunday March the fourth missus Pitman landlady at forty two Union Street heard two of her boarders quarreling a man and his wife Man s name Philip Ladley Wife s name Jennie Ladley known as Jennie Brice at the Liberty Stock Company where she has been playing small parts mister Howell nodded I ve heard of her he said Not much of an actress I believe The husband was also an actor out of work and employing his leisure time in writing a play Everybody s doing it said mister Howell idly The Shuberts were to star him in this I put in He said that the climax at the end of the second act mister Holcombe shut his note book with a snap After we have finished gossiping he said I ll go on Employing his leisure time in writing a play quoted mister Howell Exactly The husband and wife were not on good terms They quarreled frequently On Sunday they fought all day and missus Ladley told missus Pitman she was married to a fiend At four o clock Sunday afternoon Philip Ladley went out returning about five missus Pitman carried their supper to them at six and both ate heartily She did not see missus Ladley at the time but heard her in the next room They were apparently reconciled missus Pitman reports mister Ladley in high good humor If the quarrel recommenced during the night the other boarder named Reynolds in the next room heard nothing missus Pitman was up and down until one o clock when she dozed off She heard no unusual sound At approximately two o clock in the morning however this Reynolds came to the room and said he had heard some one in a boat in the lower hall He and missus Pitman investigated The boat which missus Pitman uses during a flood and which she had tied to the stair rail was gone having been cut loose not untied Everything else was quiet except that missus Ladley s dog had been shut in a third story room At a quarter after four that morning missus Pitman thoroughly awake heard the boat returning and going to the stairs met Ladley coming in He muttered something about having gone for medicine for his wife and went to his room shutting the dog out This is worth attention for the dog ordinarily slept in their room What sort of a dog asked mister Howell He had been listening attentively A water spaniel The rest of the night or early morning was quiet At a quarter after seven Ladley asked for coffee and toast for one and on missus Pitman remarking this said that his wife was not playing this week and had gone for a few days vacation having left early in the morning Remember during the night he had been out for medicine for her Now she was able to travel and in fact had started mister Howell was frowning at the floor If he was doing anything wrong he was doing it very badly he said This is where I entered the case said mister Holcombe I rowed into the lower hall this morning to feed the dog Peter who was whining on the staircase missus Pitman was coming down pale and agitated over the fact that the dog shortly before had found floating in the parlor down stairs a slipper belonging to missus Ladley and later a knife with a broken blade She maintains that she had the knife last night up stairs that it was not broken and that it was taken from a shelf in her room while she dozed The question is then Why was the knife taken Who took it And why Has this man made away with his wife or has he not mister Howell looked at me and smiled mister Holcombe and I are old enemies he said mister Holcombe believes that circumstantial evidence may probably hang a man I do not And to mister Holcombe So having found a wet slipper and a broken knife you are prepared for murder and sudden death I have more evidence mister Holcombe said eagerly and proceeded to tell what we had found in the room mister Howell listened smiling to himself but at the mention of the onyx clock he got up and went to the mantel By Jove he said and stood looking at the mark in the dust Are you sure the clock was here yesterday I wound it night before last and put the key underneath Yesterday before they moved up I wound it again The key is gone also Well what of it Holcombe Did he brain her with the clock Or choke her with the key mister Holcombe was looking at his note book To summarize he said we have here as clues indicating a crime the rope the broken knife the slipper the towel and the clock Besides this scrap of paper may contain some information He opened it and sat gazing at it in his palm Then Is this Ladley s writing he asked me in a curious voice Yes I glanced at the slip mister Holcombe had just read from his note book Rope knife slipper towel clock The slip I had found behind the wash stand said Rope knife shoe towel Horn The rest of the last word was torn off mister Howell was staring at the mantel Clock he repeated CHAPTER IV It was after four when mister Holcombe had finished going over the room I offered to make both the gentlemen some tea for mister Pitman had been an Englishman and I had got into the habit of having a cup in the afternoon with a cracker or a bit of bread But they refused mister Howell said he had promised to meet a lady and to bring her through the flooded district in a boat He shook hands with me and smiled at mister Holcombe You will have to restrain his enthusiasm missus Pitman he said He is a bloodhound on the scent If his baying gets on your nerves just send for me He went down the stairs and stepped into the boat Remember Holcombe he called every well constituted murder has two things a motive and a corpse You haven t either only a mass of piffling details If everybody waited until he saw flames instead of relying on the testimony of the smoke mister Holcombe snapped what would the fire loss be mister Howell poled his boat to the front door and sitting down prepared to row out You are warned missus Pitman he called to me If he doesn t find a body to fit the clues he s quite capable of making one to fill the demand Horn said mister Holcombe looking at the slip again The tail of the n is torn off evidently only part of a word Hornet Horning Horner missus Pitman will you go with me to the police station I was more than anxious to go In fact I could not bear the idea of staying alone in the house with heaven only knows what concealed in the depths of that muddy flood I got on my wraps again and mister Holcombe rowed me out Peter plunged into the water to follow and had to be sent back He sat on the lower step and whined mister Holcombe threw him another piece of liver but he did not touch it We rowed to the corner of Robinson Street and Federal it was before Federal Street was raised above the flood level and left the boat in charge of a boy there And we walked to the police station On the way mister Holcombe questioned me closely about the events of the morning and I recalled the incident of the burned pillow slip He made a note of it at once and grew very thoughtful He left me however at the police station I d rather not appear in this missus Pitman he said apologetically and I think better along my own lines Not that I have anything against the police they ve done some splendid work But this case takes imagination and the police department deals with facts We have no facts yet What we need of course is to have the man detained until we are sure of our case He lifted his hat and turned away and I went slowly up the steps to the police station Living as I had in a neighborhood where the police like the poor are always with us and where the visits of the patrol wagon are one of those familiar sights that no amount of repetition enabled any of us to treat with contempt I was uncomfortable until I remembered that my grandfather had been one of the first mayors of the city and that if the patrol had been at my house more than once the entire neighborhood would testify that my boarders were usually orderly At the door some one touched me on the arm It was mister Holcombe again I have been thinking it over he said and I believe you d better not mention the piece of paper that you found behind the wash stand They might say the whole thing is a hoax Very well I agreed and went in The police sergeant in charge knew me at once having stopped at my house more than once in flood time for a cup of hot coffee Sit down missus Pitman he said I suppose you are still making the best coffee and doughnuts in the city of Allegheny Well what s the trouble in your district Want an injunction against the river for trespass The river has brought me a good bit of trouble I said I m I m worried mister Sergeant I think a woman from my house has been murdered but I don t know Murdered he said and drew up his chair Tell me about it I told him everything while he sat back with his eyes half closed and his fingers beating a tattoo on the arm of his chair When I finished he got up and went into an inner room He came back in a moment I want you to come in and tell that to the chief he said and led the way All told I repeated my story three times that afternoon to the sergeant to the chief of police and the third time to both the others and two detectives The second time the chief made notes of what I said Know this man Ladley he asked the others None of them did but they all knew of Jennie Brice and some of them had seen her in the theater Get the theater Tom the chief said to one of the detectives Luckily what he learned over the telephone from the theater corroborated my story Jennie Brice was not in the cast that week but should have reported that morning Monday to rehearse the next week s piece No message had been received from her and a substitute had been put in her place The chief hung up the receiver and turned to me You are sure about the clock missus Pitman he asked It was there when they moved up stairs to the room Yes sir You are certain you will not find it on the parlor mantel when the water goes down The mantels are uncovered now It is not there You think Ladley has gone for good Yes sir He d be a fool to try to run away unless Graves you d better get hold of the fellow and keep him until either the woman is found or a body The river is falling In a couple of days we will know if she is around the premises anywhere Before I left I described Jennie Brice for them carefully Asked what she probably wore if she had gone away as her husband said I had no idea she had a lot of clothes and dressed a good bit But I recalled that I had seen lying on the bed the black and white dress with the red collar and they took that down as well as the brown valise The chief rose and opened the door for me himself If she actually left town at the time you mention he said she ought not to be hard to find There are not many trains before seven in the morning and most of them are locals And and if she did not if he do you think she is in the house or or the cellar Not unless Ladley is more of a fool than I think he is he said smiling Personally I believe she has gone away as he says she did But if she hasn t He probably took the body with him when he said he was getting medicine and dropped it in the current somewhere But we must go slow with all this There s no use shouting wolf yet But the towel He may have cut himself shaving It has been done And the knife He shrugged his shoulders good naturedly I ve seen a perfectly good knife spoiled opening a bottle of pickles But the slippers And the clock My good woman enough shoes and slippers are forgotten in the bottoms of cupboards year after year in flood time and are found floating around the streets to make all the old clothesmen in town happy I have seen almost everything floating about during one of these annual floods I dare say you never saw an onyx clock floating around I replied a little sharply I had no sense of humor that day He stopped smiling at once and stood tugging at his mustache No he admitted An onyx clock sinks that s true That s a very nice little point that onyx clock He may be trying to sell it or perhaps He did not finish I went back immediately only stopping at the market to get meat for mister Reynolds supper It was after half past five and dusk was coming on I got a boat and was rowed directly home Peter was not at the foot of the steps I paid the boatman and let him go and turned to go up the stairs Some one was speaking in the hall above I have read somewhere that no two voices are exactly alike just as no two violins ever produce precisely the same sound I think it is what they call the timbre that is different I have for instance never heard a voice like mister Pitman s although mister Harry Lauder s in a phonograph resembles it And voices have always done for me what odors do for some people revived forgotten scenes and old memories But the memory that the voice at the head of the stairs brought back was not very old although I had forgotten it I seemed to hear again all at once the lapping of the water Sunday morning as it began to come in over the door sill the sound of Terry ripping up the parlor carpet and missus Ladley calling me a she devil in the next room in reply to this very voice But when I got to the top of the stairs it was only mister Howell who had brought his visitor to the flood district and on getting her splashed with the muddy water had taken her to my house for a towel and a cake of soap I lighted the lamp in the hall and mister Howell introduced the girl She was a pretty girl slim and young and she had taken her wetting good naturedly I know we are intruders missus Pitman she said holding out her hand Especially now when you are in trouble I have told Miss Harvey a little mister Howell said and I promised to show her Peter but he is not here I think I had known it was my sister s child from the moment I lighted the lamp There was something of Alma in her not Alma s hardness or haughtiness but Alma s dark blue eyes with black lashes and Alma s nose Alma was always the beauty of the family What with the day s excitement and seeing Alma s child like this in my house I felt things going round and clutched at the stair rail mister Howell caught me Why missus Pitman he said What s the matter I got myself in hand in a moment and smiled at the girl Nothing at all I said Indigestion most likely Too much tea the last day or two and not enough solid food I ve been too anxious to eat Lida for she was that to me at once although I had never seen her before Lida was all sympathy and sweetness She actually asked me to go with her to a restaurant and have a real dinner I could imagine Alma had she known But I excused myself I have to cook something for mister Reynolds I said and I m better now anyhow thank you mister Howell may I speak to you for a moment He followed me along the back hall which was dusk I have remembered something that I had forgotten mister Howell I said On Sunday morning the Ladleys had a visitor Yes They had very few visitors I see I did not see him but I heard his voice mister Howell did not move but I fancied he drew his breath in quickly It sounded it was not by any chance you I A newspaper man who goes to bed at three A M on Sunday morning up and about at ten I didn t say what time it was I said sharply But at that moment Lida called from the front hall I think I hear Peter she said He is shut in somewhere whining We went forward at once She was right Peter was scratching at the door of mister Ladley s room although I had left the door closed and Peter in the hall I let him out and he crawled to me on three legs whimpering mister Howell bent over him and felt the fourth Poor little beast he said His leg is broken He made a splint for the dog and with Lida helping they put him to bed in a clothes basket in my up stairs kitchen It was easy to see how things lay with mister Howell He was all eyes for her he made excuses to touch her hand or her arm little caressing touches that made her color heighten And with it all there was a sort of hopelessness in his manner as if he knew how far the girl was out of his reach Knowing Alma and her pride I knew better than they how hopeless it was I was not so sure about Lida I wondered if she was in love with the boy or only in love with love She was very young as I had been God help her if like me she sacrificed everything to discover too late that she was only in love with love CHAPTER V mister Reynolds did not come home to dinner after all The water had got into the basement at the store he telephoned one of the flood gates in a sewer having leaked and they were moving some of the departments to an upper floor I had expected to have him in the house that evening and now I was left alone again But as it happened I was not alone mister Graves one of the city detectives came at half past six and went carefully over the Ladleys room I showed him the towel and the slipper and the broken knife and where we had found the knife blade He was very non committal and left in a half hour taking the articles with him in a newspaper At seven the door bell rang I went down as far as I could on the staircase and I saw a boat outside the door with the boatman and a woman in it I called to them to bring the boat back along the hall and I had a queer feeling that it might be missus Ladley and that I d been making a fool of myself all day for nothing But it was not missus Ladley Is this number forty two asked the woman as the boat came back Yes Does mister Ladley live here Yes But he is not here now Are you missus Pittock Pitman yes The boat bumped against the stairs and the woman got out She was as tall as missus Ladley and when I saw her in the light from the upper hall I knew her instantly It was Temple Hope the leading woman from the Liberty Theater I would like to talk to you missus Pitman she said Where can we go I led the way back to my room and when she had followed me in she turned and shut the door Now then she said without any preliminary where is Jennie Brice I don t know Miss Hope I answered We looked at each other for a minute and each of us saw what the other suspected He has killed her she exclaimed She was afraid he would do it and he has Killed her and thrown her into the river I said That s what I think and he ll go free at that It seems there isn t any murder when there isn t any corpse Nonsense If he has done that the river will give her up eventually The river doesn t always give them up I retorted Not in flood time anyhow Or when they are found it is months later and you can t prove anything She had only a little time being due at the theater soon but she sat down and told me the story she told afterward on the stand She had known Jennie Brice for years they having been together in the chorus as long before as Nadjy She was married then to a fellow on the vaudeville circuit Miss Hope said He left her about that time and she took up with Ladley I don t think they were ever married What I said jumping to my feet and they came to a respectable house like this There s never been a breath of scandal about this house Miss Hope and if this comes out I m ruined Well perhaps they were married she said Anyhow they were always quarreling And when he wasn t playing it was worse She used to come to my hotel and cry her eyes out I knew you were friends I said Almost the last thing she said to me was about the black and white dress of hers you were to borrow for the piece this week Black and white dress I borrow one of Jennie Brice s dresses exclaimed Miss Hope I should think not I have plenty of my own That puzzled me for she had said it that was sure And then I remembered that I had not seen the dress in the room that day and I went in to look for it It was gone I came back and told Miss Hope A black and white dress Did it have a red collar she asked Yes Then I remember it She wore a small black hat with a red quill with that dress You might look for the hat She followed me back to the room and stood in the doorway while I searched The hat was gone too Perhaps after all he s telling the truth she said thoughtfully Her fur coat isn t in the closet is it It was gone It is strange that all day I had never thought of looking over her clothes and seeing what was missing I hadn t known all she had of course but I had seen her all winter in her fur coat and admired it It was a striped fur brown and gray and very unusual But with the coat missing and a dress and hat gone it began to look as if I had been making a fool of myself and stirring up a tempest in a teacup Miss Hope was as puzzled as I was Anyhow if he didn t kill her she said it isn t because he did not want to Only last week she had hysterics in my dressing room and said he had threatened to poison her It was all mister Bronson the business manager and I could do to quiet her She looked at her watch and exclaimed that she was late and would have to hurry I saw her down to her boat The river had been falling rapidly for the last hour or two and I heard the boat scrape as it went over the door sill I did not know whether to be glad that the water was going down and I could live like a Christian again or to be sorry for fear of what we might find in the mud that was always left Peter was lying where I had put him on a folded blanket laid in a clothes basket I went back to him and sat down beside the basket Peter I said Poor old Peter Who did this to you Who hurt you He looked at me and whined as if he wanted to tell me if only he could Was it mister Ladley I asked and the poor thing cowered close to his bed and shivered I wondered if it had been he and if it had why he had come back Perhaps he had remembered the towel Perhaps he would come again and spend the night there I was like Peter I cowered and shivered at the very thought At nine o clock I heard a boat at the door It had stuck there and its occupant was scolding furiously at the boatman Soon after I heard splashing and I knew that whoever it was was wading back to the stairs through the foot and a half or so of water still in the hall I ran back to my room and locked myself in and then stood armed with the stove lid lifter in case it should be Ladley and he should break the door in The steps came up the stairs and Peter barked furiously It seemed to me that this was to be my end killed like a rat in a trap and thrown out the window to float like my kitchen chair into Mollie Maguire s kitchen or to be found lying in the ooze of the yard after the river had gone down The steps hesitated at the top of the stairs and turned back along the hall Peter redoubled his noise he never barked for mister Reynolds or the Ladleys I stood still hardly able to breathe The door was thin and the lock loose one good blow and The door knob turned and I screamed I recall that the light turned black and that is all I do remember until I came to a half hour later and saw mister Holcombe stooping over me The door with the lock broken was standing open I tried to move and then I saw that my feet were propped up on the edge of Peter s basket Better leave them up mister Holcombe said It sends the blood back to the head Half the damfool people in the world stick a pillow under a fainting woman s shoulders How are you now All right I said feebly I thought you were mister Ladley He helped me up and I sat in a chair and tried to keep my lips from shaking And then I saw that mister Holcombe had brought a suit case with him and had set it inside the door Ladley is safe until he gets bail anyhow he said They picked him up as he was boarding a Pennsylvania train bound east For murder I asked As a suspicious character he replied grimly That does as well as anything for a time He sat down opposite me and looked at me intently missus Pitman he said did you ever hear the story of the horse that wandered out of a village and could not be found I shook my head Well the best wit of the village failed to locate the horse But one day the village idiot walked into town leading the missing animal by the bridle When they asked him how he had done it he said Well I just thought what I d do if I was a horse and then I went and did it I see I said humoring him You don t see Now what are we trying to do We re trying to find a body Do you intend to become a corpse He leaned over and tapped on the table between us We are trying to prove a crime I intend for the time to be the criminal He looked so curious bent forward and glaring at me from under his bushy eyebrows with his shoes on his knee for he had taken them off to wade to the stairs and his trousers rolled to his knees that I wondered if he was entirely sane But mister Holcombe eccentric as he might be was sane enough Not really a criminal As really as lies in me Listen missus Pitman I want to put myself in Ladley s place for a day or two live as he lived do what he did even think as he thought if I can I am going to sleep in his room to night with your permission I could not see any reason for objecting although I thought it silly and useless I led the way to the front room mister Holcombe following with his shoes and suit case I lighted a lamp and he stood looking around him I see you have been here since we left this afternoon he said Twice I replied First with mister Graves and later The words died on my tongue Some one had been in the room since my last visit there He has been here I gasped I left the room in tolerable order Look at it When were you here last At seven thirty or thereabouts Where were you between seven thirty and eight thirty In the kitchen with Peter I told him then about the dog and about finding him shut in the room The wash stand was pulled out The sheets of mister Ladley s manuscript usually an orderly pile were half on the floor The bed coverings had been jerked off and flung over the back of a chair Peter imprisoned might have moved the wash stand and upset the manuscript Peter had never put the bed clothing over the chair or broken his own leg Humph he said and getting out his note book he made an exact memorandum of what I had told him and of the condition of the room That done he turned to me missus Pitman he said I ll thank you to call me mister Ladley for the next day or so I am an actor out of employment forty one years of age short stout and bald married to a woman I would like to be quit of and I am writing myself a play in which the Shuberts intend to star me or in which I intend the Shuberts to star me Very well mister Ladley I said trying to enter into the spirit of the thing and God knows seeing no humor in it Then you ll like your soda from the ice box Soda For what For your whisky and soda before you go to bed sir Oh certainly yes Bring the soda And just a moment missus Pitman mister Holcombe is a total abstainer and has always been so It is Ladley not Holcombe who takes this abominable stuff I said I quite understood but that mister Ladley could skip a night if he so wished But the little gentleman would not hear to it and when I brought the soda poured himself a double portion He stood looking at it with his face screwed up as if the very odor revolted him The chances are he said that Ladley that I having a nasty piece of work to do during the night would will take a larger drink than usual He raised the glass only to put it down Don t forget he said to put a large knife where you left the one last night I m sorry the water has gone down but I shall imagine it still at the seventh step Good night missus Pitman Good night mister Ladley I said smiling and remember you are three weeks in arrears with your board His eyes twinkled through his spectacles I shall imagine it paid he said I went out and I heard him close the door behind me Then through the door I heard a great sputtering and coughing and I knew he had got the whisky down somehow I put the knife out as he had asked me to and went to bed I was ready to drop Not even the knowledge that an imaginary mister Ladley was about to commit an imaginary crime in the house that night could keep me awake mister Reynolds came in at eleven o clock I was roused when he banged his door That was all I knew until morning The sun on my face wakened me Peter in his basket lifted his head as I moved and thumped his tail against his pillow in greeting I put on a wrapper and called mister Reynolds by knocking at his door Then I went on to the front room The door was closed and some one beyond was groaning My heart stood still and then raced on I opened the door and looked in mister Holcombe was on the bed fully dressed He had a wet towel tied around his head and his face looked swollen and puffy He opened one eye and looked at me What a night he groaned What happened What did you find He groaned again Find he said Nothing except that there was something wrong with that whisky It poisoned me I haven t been out of the house So for that day at least mister Ladley became mister Holcombe again and as such accepted ice in quantities a mustard plaster over his stomach and considerable nursing By evening he was better but although he clearly intended to stay on he said nothing about changing his identity again and I was glad enough The very name of Ladley was horrible to me The river went down almost entirely that day although there was still considerable water in the cellars It takes time to get rid of that The lower floors showed nothing suspicious The papers were ruined of course the doors warped and sprung and the floors coated with mud and debris Terry came in the afternoon and together we hung the dining room rug out to dry in the sun As I was coming in I looked over at the Maguire yard Molly Maguire was there and all her children around her gaping Molly was hanging out to dry a sodden fur coat that had once been striped brown and gray I went over after breakfast and claimed the coat as belonging to missus Ladley But she refused to give it up There is a sort of unwritten law concerning the salvage of flood articles and I had to leave the coat as I had my kitchen chair But it was missus Ladley s beyond a doubt I shuddered when I thought how it had probably got into the water And yet it was curious too for if she had had it on how did it get loose to go floating around Molly Maguire s yard And if she had not worn it how did it get in the water CHAPTER VI The newspapers were full of the Ladley case with its curious solution and many surprises It was considered unique in many ways mister Pitman had always read all the murder trials and used to talk about the corpus delicti and writs of habeas corpus corpus being the legal way I believe of spelling corpse But I came out of the Ladley trial for it came to trial ultimately with only one point of law that I was sure of that was that it is mighty hard to prove a man a murderer unless you can show what he killed And that was the weakness in the Ladley case There was a body but it could not be identified The police held mister Ladley for a day or two and then nothing appearing they let him go mister Holcombe who was still occupying the second floor front almost wept with rage and despair when he read the news in the papers He was still working on the case in his curious way wandering along the wharves at night and writing letters all over the country to learn about Philip Ladley s previous life and his wife s But he did not seem to get anywhere The newspapers had been full of the Jennie Brice disappearance For disappearance it proved to be So far as could be learned she had not left the city that night or since and as she was a striking looking woman very blond as I have said with a full voice and a languid manner she could hardly have taken refuge anywhere without being discovered The morning after her disappearance a young woman tall like Jennie Brice and fair had been seen in the Union Station But as she was accompanied by a young man who bought her magazines and papers and bade her an excited farewell sending his love to various members of a family and promising to feed the canary this was not seriously considered A sort of general alarm went over the country When she was younger she had been pretty well known at the Broadway theaters in New York One way or another the Liberty Theater got a lot of free advertising from the case and I believe Miss Hope s salary was raised The police communicated with Jennie Brice s people she had a sister in Olean New York but she had not heard from her The sister wrote I heard later that Jennie had been unhappy with Philip Ladley and afraid he would kill her And Miss Hope told the same story But there was no corpus as the lawyers say and finally the police had to free mister Ladley Beyond making an attempt to get bail and failing he had done nothing Asked about his wife he merely shrugged his shoulders and said she had left him and would turn up all right He was unconcerned smoked cigarettes all day ate and slept well and looked better since he had had nothing to drink And two or three days after the arrest he sent for the manuscript of his play mister Howell came for it on the Thursday of that week I was on my knees scrubbing the parlor floor when he rang the bell I let him in and it seemed to me that he looked tired and pale Well missus Pitman he said smiling what did you find in the cellar when the water went down I m glad to say that I didn t find what I feared mister Howell Not even the onyx clock Not even the clock I replied And I feel as if I d lost a friend A clock is a lot of company Do you know what I think he said looking at me closely I think you put that clock away yourself in the excitement and have forgotten all about it Nonsense Think hard He was very much in earnest You knew the water was rising and the Ladleys would have to be moved up to the second floor front where the clock stood You went in there and looked around to see if the room was ready and you saw the clock And knowing that the Ladleys quarreled now and then and were apt to throw things Nothing but a soap dish and that only once you took the clock to the attic and put it say in an old trunk I did nothing of the sort I went in as you say and I put up an old splasher because of the way he throws ink about Then I wound the clock put the key under it and went out And the key is gone too he said thoughtfully I wish I could find that clock missus Pitman So do I Ladley went out Sunday afternoon about three didn t he and got back at five I turned and looked at him Yes mister Howell I said Perhaps you know something about that I He changed color Twenty years of dunning boarders has made me pretty sharp at reading faces and he looked as uncomfortable as if he owed me money I I knew then that I had been right about the voice It had been his You I retorted You were here Sunday morning and spent some time with the Ladleys I am the old she devil I notice you didn t tell your friend mister Holcombe about having been here on Sunday He was quick to recover I ll tell you all about it missus Pitman he said smilingly You see all my life I have wished for an onyx clock It has been my ambition my Great Desire Leaving the house that Sunday morning and hearing the ticking of the clock up stairs I recognized that it was an onyx clock clambered from my boat through an upper window and so reached it The clock showed fight but after stunning it with a chair Exactly I said Then the thing missus Ladley said she would not do was probably to wind the clock He dropped his bantering manner at once missus Pitman he said I don t know what you heard or did not hear But I want you to give me a little time before you tell anybody that I was here that Sunday morning And in return I ll find your clock I hesitated but however put out he was he didn t look like a criminal Besides he was a friend of my niece s and blood is thicker even than flood water There was nothing wrong about my being here he went on but I don t want it known Don t spoil a good story missus Pitman I did not quite understand that although those who followed the trial carefully may do so Poor mister Howell I am sure he believed that it was only a good story He got the description of my onyx clock and wrote it down and I gave him the manuscript for mister Ladley That was the last I saw of him for some time That Thursday proved to be an exciting day For late in the afternoon Terry digging the mud out of the cellar came across my missing gray false front near the coal vault and brought it up grinning And just before six mister Graves the detective rang the bell and then let himself in I found him in the lower hall looking around Well missus Pitman he said has our friend come back yet She was no friend of mine Not she Ladley He ll be out this evening and he ll probably be around for his clothes I felt my knees waver as they always did when he was spoken of He may want to stay here said mister Graves In fact I think that s just what he will want Not here I protested The very thought of him makes me quake If he comes here better take him in I want to know where he is I tried to say that I wouldn t have him but the old habit of the ward asserted itself From taking a bottle of beer or a slice of pie to telling one where one might or might not live the police were autocrats in that neighborhood And respectable woman that I am my neighbors fears of the front office have infected me All right mister Graves I said He pushed the parlor door open and looked in whistling This is the place isn t it Yes But it was up stairs that he I see Tall woman missus Ladley Tall and blond Very airy in her manner He nodded and still stood looking in and whistling Never heard her speak of a town named Horner did you Horner No I see He turned and wandered out again into the hall still whistling At the door however he stopped and turned Look anything like this he asked and held out one of his hands with a small kodak picture on the palm It was a snap shot of a children s frolic in a village street with some onlookers in the background Around one of the heads had been drawn a circle in pencil I took it to the gas jet and looked at it closely It was a tall woman with a hat on not unlike Jennie Brice She was looking over the crowd and I could see only her face and that in shadow I shook my head I thought not he said We have a lot of stage pictures of her but what with false hair and their being retouched beyond recognition they don t amount to much He started out and stopped on the door step to light a cigar Take him on if he comes he said And keep your eyes open Feed him well and he won t kill you I had plenty to think of when I was cooking mister Reynolds supper the chance that I might have mister Ladley again and the woman at Horner For it had come to me like a flash as mister Graves left that the Horn on the paper slip might have been Horner CHAPTER VII After all there was nothing sensational about mister Ladley s return He came at eight o clock that night fresh shaved and with his hair cut and although he had a latch key he rang the door bell I knew his ring and I thought it no harm to carry an old razor of mister Pitman s with the blade open and folded back on the handle the way the colored people use them in my left hand But I saw at once that he meant no mischief Good evening he said and put out his hand I jumped back until I saw there was nothing in it and that he only meant to shake hands I didn t do it I might have to take him in and make his bed and cook his meals but I did not have to shake hands with him You too he said looking at me with what I suppose he meant to be a reproachful look But he could no more put an expression of that sort in his eyes than a fish could I suppose then there is no use asking if I may have my old room The front room I won t need two I didn t want him and he must have seen it But I took him You may have it as far as I m concerned I said But you ll have to let the paper hanger in to morrow Assuredly He came into the hall and stood looking around him and I fancied he drew a breath of relief It isn t much yet he said but it s better to look at than six feet of muddy water Or than stone walls I said He looked at me and smiled Or than stone walls he repeated bowing and went into his room So I had him again and if I gave him only the dull knives and locked up the bread knife the moment I had finished with it who can blame me I took all the precaution I could think of had Terry put an extra bolt on every door and hid the rat poison and the carbolic acid in the cellar Peter would not go near him He hobbled around on his three legs with the splint beating a sort of tattoo on the floor but he stayed back in the kitchen with me or in the yard It was Sunday night or early Monday morning that Jennie Brice disappeared On Thursday evening her husband came back On Friday the body of a woman was washed ashore at Beaver but turned out to be that of a stewardess who had fallen overboard from one of the Cincinnati packets mister Ladley himself showed me the article in the morning paper when I took in his breakfast Public hysteria has killed a man before this he said when I had read it Suppose that woman had been mangled or the screw of the steamer had cut her head off How many people do you suppose would have been willing to swear that it was my was missus Ladley Even without a head I should know missus Ladley I retorted He shrugged his shoulders Let s trust she s still alive for my sake he said But I m glad anyhow that this woman had a head You ll allow me to be glad won t you You can be anything you want as far as I m concerned I snapped and went out mister Holcombe still retained the second story front room I think although he said nothing more about it that he was still playing horse He wrote a good bit at the wash stand and from the loose sheets of manuscript he left I believe actually tried to begin a play But mostly he wandered along the water front or stood on one or another of the bridges looking at the water and thinking It is certain that he tried to keep in the part by smoking cigarettes but he hated them and usually ended by throwing the cigarette away and lighting an old pipe he carried On that Thursday evening he came home and sat down to supper with mister Reynolds He ate little and seemed much excited The talk ran on crime as it always did when he was around and mister Holcombe quoted Spencer a great deal Herbert Spencer mister Reynolds was impressed not knowing much beyond silks and the National League Spencer mister Holcombe would say Spencer shows that every occurrence is the inevitable result of what has gone before and carries in its train an equally inevitable series of results Try to interrupt this chain in the smallest degree and what follows Chaos my dear sir chaos We see that at the store mister Reynolds would say Accustom a lot of women to a silk sale on Fridays and then make it toothbrushes That s chaos all right Well mister Holcombe came in that night about ten o clock and I told him Ladley was back He was almost wild with excitement wanted to have the back parlor so he could watch him through the keyhole and was terribly upset when I told him there was no keyhole that the door fastened with a thumb bolt On learning that the room was to be papered the next morning he grew calmer however and got the paper hanger s address from me He went out just after that Friday as I say was very quiet mister Ladley moved to the back parlor to let the paper hanger in the front room smoked and fussed with his papers all day and mister Holcombe stayed in his room which was unusual In the afternoon Molly Maguire put on the striped fur coat and went out going slowly past the house so that I would be sure to see her Beyond banging the window down I gave her no satisfaction At four o clock mister Holcombe came to my kitchen rubbing his hands together He had a pasteboard tube in his hand about a foot long with an arrangement of small mirrors in it He said it was modeled after the something or other that is used on a submarine and that he and the paper hanger had fixed a place for it between his floor and the ceiling of mister Ladley s room so that the chandelier would hide it from below He thought he could watch mister Ladley through it and as it turned out he could I want to find his weak moment he said excitedly I want to know what he does when the door is closed and he can take off his mask And I want to know if he sleeps with a light If he does I replied I hope you ll let me know mister Holcombe The gas bills are a horror to me as it is I think he kept it on all last night I turned off all the other lights and went to the cellar The meter was going around Fine he said Every murderer fears the dark And our friend of the parlor bedroom is a murderer missus Pitman Whether he hangs or not he s a murderer The mirror affair which mister Holcombe called a periscope was put in that day and worked amazingly well I went with him to try it out and I distinctly saw the paper hanger take a cigarette from mister Ladley s case and put it in his pocket Just after that mister Ladley sauntered into the room and looked at the new paper I could both see and hear him It was rather weird God what a wall paper he said CHAPTER VIII That was Friday afternoon All that evening and most of Saturday and Sunday mister Holcombe sat on the floor with his eye to the reflecting mirror and his note book beside him I have it before me On the first page is the dog meat two dollars entry On the next the description of what occurred on Sunday night March fourth and Monday morning the fifth Following that came a sketch made with a carbon sheet of the torn paper found behind the wash stand And then came the entries for Friday Saturday and Sunday Friday evening six thirty Eating hearty supper seven zero Lights cigarette and paces floor Notice that when missus P knocks he goes to desk and pretends to be writing eight

stared at it then flung the paper away Have sent out for same paper ten zero A M Paper says Body of woman washed ashore yesterday at Sewickley Much mutilated by flood debris Ladley in bed staring at ceiling Wonder if he sees tube He is ghastly That is the last entry in the note book for that day mister Holcombe called me in great excitement shortly after ten and showed me the item Neither of us doubted for a moment that it was Jennie Brice who had been found He started for Sewickley that same afternoon and he probably communicated with the police before he left For once or twice I saw mister Graves the detective sauntering past the house mister Ladley ate no dinner He went out at four and I had mister Reynolds follow him But they were both back in a half hour mister Reynolds reported that mister Ladley had bought some headache tablets and some bromide powders to make him sleep mister Holcombe came back that evening He thought the body was that of Jennie Brice but the head was gone He was much depressed and did not immediately go back to the periscope I asked if the head had been cut off or taken off by a steamer he was afraid the latter as a hand was gone too It was about eleven o clock that night that the door bell rang It was mister Graves with a small man behind him I knew the man he lived in a shanty boat not far from my house a curious affair with shelves full of dishes and tinware In the spring he would be towed up the Monongahela a hundred miles or so and float down tying up at different landings and selling his wares Timothy Senft was his name We called him Tim mister Graves motioned me to be quiet Both of us knew that behind the parlor door Ladley was probably listening Sorry to get you up missus Pitman said mister Graves but this man says he has bought beer here to day That won t do missus Pitman Beer I haven t such a thing in the house Come in and look I snapped And the two of them went back to the kitchen Now said mister Graves when I had shut the door where s the dog s meat man Up stairs Bring him quietly I called mister Holcombe and he came eagerly note book and all Ah he said when he saw Tim So you ve turned up Yes sir It seems mister Dog s mister Holcombe said mister Graves that you are right partly anyhow Tim here did help a man with a boat that night Threw him a rope sir Tim broke in He d got out in the current and what with the ice and his not knowing much about a boat he d have kept on to New Orleans if I hadn t caught him or Kingdom Come Exactly And what time did you say this was Between three and four last Sunday night or Monday morning He said he couldn t sleep and went out in a boat meaning to keep in close to shore But he got drawn out in the current Where did you see him first By the Ninth Street bridge Did you hail him He saw my light and hailed me I was making fast to a coal barge after one of my ropes had busted You threw the line to him there No sir He tried to work in to shore I ran along River Avenue to below the Sixth Street bridge He got pretty close in there and I threw him a rope He was about done up Would you know him again Yes sir He gave me five dollars and said to say nothing about it He didn t want anybody to know he had been such a fool They took him quietly up stairs then and let him look through the periscope He identified mister Ladley absolutely When Tim and mister Graves had gone mister Holcombe and I were left alone in the kitchen mister Holcombe leaned over and patted Peter as he lay in his basket We ve got him old boy he said The chain is just about complete He ll never kick you again But mister Holcombe was wrong not about kicking Peter although I don t believe mister Ladley ever did that again but in thinking we had him I washed that next morning Monday but all the time I was rubbing and starching and hanging out my mind was with Jennie Brice The sight of Molly Maguire next door at the window rubbing and brushing at the fur coat only made things worse At noon when the Maguire youngsters came home from school I bribed Tommy the youngest into the kitchen with the promise of a doughnut I see your mother has a new fur coat I said with the plate of doughnuts just beyond his reach Yes m She didn t buy it She didn t buy it Say missus Pitman gimme that doughnut Oh so the coat washed in No m Pap found it down by the Point on a cake of ice He thought it was a dog and rowed out for it Well I hadn t wanted the coat as far as that goes I d managed well enough without furs for twenty years or more But it was a satisfaction to know that it had not floated into missus Maguire s kitchen and spread itself at her feet as one may say However that was not the question after all The real issue was that if it was Jennie Brice s coat and was found across the river on a cake of ice then one of two things was certain either Jennie Brice s body wrapped in the coat had been thrown into the water out in the current or she herself hoping to incriminate her husband had flung her coat into the river I told mister Holcombe and he interviewed Joe Maguire that afternoon The upshot of it was that Tommy had been correctly informed Joe had witnesses who had lined up to see him rescue a dog and had beheld his return in triumph with a wet and soggy fur coat At three o clock missus Maguire instructed by mister Graves brought the coat to me for identification turning it about for my inspection but refusing to take her hands off it If her husband says to me that he wants it back well and good she said but I don t give it up to nobody but him Some folks I know of would be glad enough to have it I was certain it was Jennie Brice s coat but the maker s name had been ripped out With Molly holding one arm and I the other we took it to mister Ladley s door and knocked He opened it grumbling I have asked you not to interrupt me he said with his pen in his hand His eyes fell on the coat What s that he asked changing color I think it s missus Ladley s fur coat I said He stood there looking at it and thinking Then It can t be hers he said She wore hers when she went away Perhaps she dropped it in the water He looked at me and smiled And why would she do that he asked mockingly Was it out of fashion That s missus Ladley s coat I persisted but Molly Maguire jerked it from me and started away He stood there looking at me and smiling in his nasty way This excitement is telling on you missus Pitman he said coolly You re too emotional for detective work Then he went in and shut the door When I went down stairs Molly Maguire was waiting in the kitchen and had the audacity to ask me if I thought the coat needed a new lining It was on Monday evening that the strangest event in years happened to me I went to my sister s house And the fact that I was admitted at a side entrance made it even stranger It happened in this way Supper was over and I was cleaning up when an automobile came to the door It was Alma s car The chauffeur gave me a note DEAR missus PITMAN I am not at all well and very anxious Will you come to see me at once My mother is out to dinner and I am alone The car will bring you Cordially LIDA HARVEY I put on my best dress at once and got into the limousine Half the neighborhood was out watching I leaned back in the upholstered seat fairly quivering with excitement This was Alma s car that was Alma s card case the little clock had her monogram on it Even the flowers in the flower holder yellow tulips reminded me of Alma a trifle showy but good to look at And I was going to her house I was not taken to the main entrance but to a side door The queer dream like feeling was still there In this back hall relegated from the more conspicuous part of the house there were even pieces of furniture from the old home and my father s picture in an oval gilt frame hung over my head I had not seen a picture of him for twenty years I went over and touched it gently Father father I said Under it was the tall hall chair that I had climbed over as a child and had stood on many times to see myself in the mirror above The chair was newly finished and looked the better for its age I glanced in the old glass The chair had stood time better than I I was a middle aged woman lined with poverty and care shabby prematurely gray a little hard I had thought my father an old man when that picture was taken and now I was even older Father I whispered again and fell to crying in the dimly lighted hall Lida sent for me at once I had only time to dry my eyes and straighten my hat Had I met Alma on the stairs I would have passed her without a word She would not have known me But I saw no one Lida was in bed She was lying there with a rose shaded lamp beside her and a great bowl of spring flowers on a little stand at her elbow She sat up when I went in and had a maid place a chair for me beside the bed She looked very childish with her hair in a braid on the pillow and her slim young arms and throat bare I m so glad you came she said and would not be satisfied until the light was just right for my eyes and my coat unfastened and thrown open I m not really ill she informed me I m I m just tired and nervous and and unhappy missus Pitman I am sorry I said I wanted to lean over and pat her hand to draw the covers around her and mother her a little I had had no one to mother for so long but I could not She would have thought it queer and presumptuous or no not that She was too sweet to have thought that missus Pitman she said suddenly who was this Jennie Brice She was an actress She and her husband lived at my house Was she was she beautiful Well I said slowly I never thought of that She was handsome in a large way Was she young Yes Twenty eight or so That isn t very young she said looking relieved But I don t think men like very young women Do you I know one who does I said smiling But she sat up in bed suddenly and looked at me with her clear childish eyes I don t want him to like me she flashed I I want him to hate me Tut tut You want nothing of the sort missus Pitman she said I sent for you because I m nearly crazy mister Howell was a friend of that woman He has acted like a maniac since she disappeared He doesn t come to see me he has given up his work on the paper and I saw him to day on the street he looks like a ghost That put me to thinking He might have been a friend I admitted Although as far as I know he was never at the house but once and then he saw both of them When was that Sunday morning the day before she disappeared They were arguing something She was looking at me attentively You know more than you are telling me missus Pitman she said You do you think Jennie Brice is dead and that mister Howell knows who did it I think she is dead and I think possibly mister Howell suspects who did it He does not know or he would have told the police You do not think he was was in love with Jennie Brice do you I m certain of that I said He is very much in love with a foolish girl who ought to have more faith in him than she has Illustration She sat up in bed suddenly She colored a little and smiled at that but the next moment she was sitting forward tense and questioning again If that is true missus Pitman she said who was the veiled woman he met that Monday morning at daylight and took across the bridge to Pittsburgh I believe it was Jennie Brice If it was not who was it I don t believe he took any woman across the bridge at that hour Who says he did Uncle Jim saw him He had been playing cards all night at one of the clubs and was walking home He says he met mister Howell face to face and spoke to him The woman was tall and veiled Uncle Jim sent for him a day or two later and he refused to explain Then they forbade him the house Mama objected to him anyhow and he only came on sufferance He is a college man of good family but without any money at all save what he earns And now I had had some young newspaper men with me and I knew what they got They were nice boys but they made fifteen dollars a week I m afraid I smiled a little as I looked around the room with its gray grass cloth walls its toilet table spread with ivory and gold and the maid in attendance in her black dress and white apron collar and cuffs Even the little nightgown Lida was wearing would have taken a week s salary or more She saw my smile It was to be his chance she said If he made good he was to have something better My Uncle Jim owns the paper and he promised me to help him But So Jim was running a newspaper That was a curious career for Jim to choose Jim who was twice expelled from school and who could never write a letter without a dictionary beside him I had a pang when I heard his name again after all the years For I had written to Jim from Oklahoma after mister Pitman died asking for money to bury him and had never even had a reply And you haven t seen him since Once I didn t hear from him and I called him up We we met in the park He said everything was all right but he couldn t tell me just then The next day he resigned from the paper and went away missus Pitman it s driving me crazy For they have found a body and they think it is hers If it is and he was with her Don t be a foolish girl I protested If he was with Jennie Brice she is still living and if he was not with Jennie Brice If it was not Jennie Brice then I have a right to know who it was she declared He was not like himself when I met him He said such queer things he talked about an onyx clock and said he had been made a fool of and that no matter what came out I was always to remember that he had done what he did for the best and that that he cared for me more than for anything in this world or the next That wasn t so foolish I couldn t help it I leaned over and drew her nightgown up over her bare white shoulder You won t help anything or anybody by taking cold my dear I said Call your maid and have her put a dressing gown around you I left soon after There was little I could do But I comforted her as best I could and said good night My heart was heavy as I went down the stairs For twist things as I might it was clear that in some way the Howell boy was mixed up in the Brice case Poor little troubled Lida Poor distracted boy I had a curious experience down stairs I had reached the foot of the staircase and was turning to go back and along the hall to the side entrance when I came face to face with Isaac the old colored man who had driven the family carriage when I was a child and whom I had seen at intervals since I came back pottering around Alma s house The old man was bent and feeble he came slowly down the hall with a bunch of keys in his hand I had seen him do the same thing many times He stopped when he saw me and I shrank back from the light but he had seen me Miss Bess he said Foh Gawd s sake Miss Bess You are making a mistake my friend I said quivering I am not Miss Bess He came close to me and stared into my face And from that he looked at my cloth gloves at my coat and he shook his white head I sure thought you was Miss Bess he said and made no further effort to detain me He led the way back to the door where the machine waited his head shaking with the palsy of age muttering as he went He opened the door with his best manner and stood aside Good night ma am he quavered I had tears in my eyes I tried to keep them back Good night I said Good night Ikkie It had slipped out my baby name for old Isaac Miss Bess he cried Oh praise Gawd it s Miss Bess again He caught my arm and pulled me back into the hall and there he held me crying over me muttering praises for my return begging me to come back recalling little tender things out of the past that almost killed me to hear again But I had made my bed and must lie in it I forced him to swear silence about my visit I made him promise not to reveal my identity to Lida and I told him Heaven forgive me that I was well and prosperous and happy Dear old Isaac I would not let him come to see me but the next day there came a basket with six bottles of wine and an old daguerreotype of my mother that had been his treasure Nor was that basket the last CHAPTER IX The coroner held an inquest over the headless body the next day Tuesday mister Graves telephoned me in the morning and I went to the morgue with him I do not like the morgue although some of my neighbors pay it weekly visits It is by way of excursion like nickelodeons or watching the circus put up its tents I have heard them threaten the children that if they misbehaved they would not be taken to the morgue that week I failed to identify the body How could I It had been a tall woman probably five feet eight and I thought the nails looked like those of Jennie Brice The thumb nail of one was broken short off I told mister Graves about her speaking of a broken nail but he shrugged his shoulders and said nothing There was a curious scar over the heart and he was making a sketch of it It reached from the center of the chest for about six inches across the left breast a narrow thin line that one could hardly see It was shaped like this I felt sure that Jennie Brice had had no such scar and mister Graves thought as I did Temple Hope called to the inquest said she had never heard of one and mister Ladley himself at the inquest swore that his wife had had nothing of the sort I was watching him and I did not think he was lying And yet the hand was very like Jennie Brice s It was all bewildering mister Ladley s testimoney at the inquest was disappointing He was cool and collected said he had no reason to believe that his wife was dead and less reason to think she had been drowned she had left him in a rage and if she found out that by hiding she was putting him in an unpleasant position she would probably hide indefinitely To the disappointment of everybody the identity of the woman remained a mystery No one with such a scar was missing A small woman of my own age a missus Murray whose daughter a stenographer had disappeared attended the inquest But her daughter had had no such scar and had worn her nails short because of using the typewriter Alice Murray was the missing girl s name Her mother sat beside me and cried most of the time One thing was brought out at the inquest the body had been thrown into the river after death There was no water in the lungs The verdict was death by the hands of some person or persons unknown mister Holcombe was not satisfied In some way or other he had got permission to attend the autopsy and had brought away a tracing of the scar All the way home in the street car he stared at the drawing holding first one eye shut and then the other But like the coroner he got nowhere He folded the paper and put it in his note book None the less missus Pitman he said that is the body of Jennie Brice her husband killed her probably by strangling her he took the body out in the boat and dropped it into the swollen river above the Ninth Street bridge Why do you think he strangled her There was no mark on the body and no poison was found Then if he strangled her where did the blood come from I didn t limit myself to strangulation he said irritably He may have cut her throat Or brained her with my onyx clock I added with a sigh For I missed the clock more and more He went down in his pockets and brought up a key I d forgotten this he said It shows you were right that the clock was there when the Ladleys took the room I found this in the yard this morning It was when I got home from the inquest that I found old Isaac s basket waiting I am not a crying woman but I could hardly see my mother s picture for tears Well after all that is not the Brice story I am not writing the sordid tragedy of my life That was on Tuesday Jennie Brice had been missing nine days In all that time although she was cast for the piece at the theater that week no one there had heard from her Her relatives had had no word She had gone away if she had gone on a cold March night in a striped black and white dress with a red collar and a red and black hat without her fur coat which she had worn all winter She had gone very early in the morning or during the night How had she gone mister Ladley said he had rowed her to Federal Street at half after six and had brought the boat back After they had quarreled violently all night and when she was leaving him wouldn t he have allowed her to take herself away Besides the police had found no trace of her on an early train And then at daylight between five and six my own brother had seen a woman with mister Howell a woman who might have been Jennie Brice But if it was why did not mister Howell say so mister Ladley claimed she was hiding in revenge But Jennie Brice was not that sort of woman there was something big about her something that is found often in large women a lack of spite She was not petty or malicious Her faults like her virtues were for all to see In spite of the failure to identify the body mister Ladley was arrested that night Tuesday and this time it was for murder I know now that the police were taking long chances They had no strong motive for the crime As mister Holcombe said they had provocation but not motive which is different They had opportunity and they had a lot of straggling links of clues which in the total made a fair chain of circumstantial evidence But that was all That is the way the case stood on Tuesday night March the thirteenth mister Ladley was taken away at nine o clock He was perfectly cool asked me to help him pack a suit case and whistled while it was being done He requested to be allowed to walk to the jail and went quietly with a detective on one side and I think a sheriff s officer on the other Just before he left he asked for a word or two with me and when he paid his bill up to date and gave me an extra dollar for taking care of Peter I was almost overcome He took the manuscript of his play with him and I remember his asking if he could have any typing done in the jail I had never seen a man arrested for murder before but I think he was probably the coolest suspect the officers had ever seen They hardly knew what to make of it mister Reynolds and I had a cup of tea after all the excitement and were sitting at the dining room table drinking it when the bell rang It was mister Howell He half staggered into the hall when I opened the door and was for going into the parlor bedroom without a word mister Ladley s gone if you want him I said I thought his face cleared Gone he said Where To jail He did not reply at once He stood there tapping the palm of one hand with the forefinger of the other He was dirty and unshaven His clothes looked as if he had been sleeping in them So they ve got him he muttered finally and turning was about to go out the front door without another word but I caught his arm You re sick mister Howell I said You d better not go out just yet Oh I m all right He took his handkerchief out and wiped his face I saw that his hands were shaking Come back and have a cup of tea and a slice of home made bread He hesitated and looked at his watch I ll do it missus Pitman he said I suppose I d better throw a little fuel into this engine of mine It s been going hard for several days He ate like a wolf I cut half a loaf into slices for him and he drank the rest of the tea mister Reynolds creaked up to bed and left him still eating and me still cutting and spreading Now that I had a chance to see him I was shocked The rims of his eyes were red his collar was black and his hair hung over his forehead But when he finally sat back and looked at me his color was better So they ve canned him he said Time enough too said I He leaned forward and put both his elbows on the table missus Pitman he said earnestly I don t like him any more than you do But he never killed that woman Somebody killed her How do you know How do you know she is dead Well I didn t of course I only felt it The police haven t even proved a crime They can t hold a man for a supposititious murder Perhaps they can t but they re doing it I retorted If the woman s alive she won t let him hang I m not so sure of that he said heavily and got up He looked in the little mirror over the sideboard and brushed back his hair I look bad enough he said but I feel worse Well you ve saved my life missus Pitman Thank you How is my how is Miss Harvey I asked as we started out He turned and smiled at me in his boyish way The best ever he said I haven t seen her for days and it seems like centuries She she is the only girl in the world for me missus Pitman although I He stopped and drew a long breath She is beautiful isn t she Very beautiful I answered Her mother was always Her mother He looked at me curiously I knew her mother years ago I said putting the best face on my mistake that I could Then I ll remember you to her if she ever allows me to see her again Just now I m persona non grata If you ll do the kindly thing mister Howell I said you ll forget me to her He looked into my eyes and then thrust out his hand All right he said I ll not ask any questions I guess there are some curious stories hidden in these old houses Peter hobbled to the front door with him He had not gone so far as the parlor once while mister Ladley was in the house They had had a sale of spring flowers at the store that day and mister Reynolds had brought me a pot of white tulips That night I hung my mother s picture over the mantel in the dining room and put the tulips beneath it It gave me a feeling of comfort I had never seen my mother s grave or put flowers on it CHAPTER X I have said before that I do not know anything about the law I believe that the Ladley case was unusual in several ways 
1298-142233-0000	train-other-500	mister Ladley had once been well known in New York among the people who frequent the theaters and Jennie Brice was even better known A good many lawyers I believe said that the police had not a leg to stand on
1298-142233-0001	train-other-500	and I know the case was watched with much interest by the legal profession People wrote letters to the newspapers protesting against mister Ladley being held And I believe that the district attorney in taking him before the grand jury
1298-142233-0002	train-other-500	hardly hoped to make a case But he did to his own surprise I fancy and the trial was set for May But in the meantime many curious things happened In the first place the week following mister Ladley s arrest
1298-142233-0003	train-other-500	my house was filled up with eight or ten members
none	none	 of a company from the Gaiety Theater 
1298-142233-0004	train-other-500	very cheerful and jolly and well behaved Three men I think and the rest girls One of the men was named Bellows John Bellows and it turned out that he had known Jennie Brice very well
1298-142233-0005	train-other-500	From the moment he learned that mister Holcombe hardly left him He walked to the theater with him and waited to walk home again He took him out to restaurants and for long street car rides in the mornings and on the last night of their stay
1298-142233-0006	train-other-500	Saturday they got gloriously drunk together mister Holcombe no doubt in his character of Ladley and came reeling in at three in the morning singing mister Holcombe was very sick the next day but by Monday he was all right
1298-142233-0007	train-other-500	and he called me into the room We ve got him missus Pitman he said looking mottled but cheerful As sure as God made little fishes we ve got him That was all he would say however
1298-142233-0008	train-other-500	It seemed he was going to New York and might be gone for a month I ve no family he said and enough money to keep me If I find my relaxation in hunting down criminals it s a harmless and cheap amusement
1298-142233-0009	train-other-500	and it s my own business He went away that night and I must admit I missed him I rented the parlor bedroom the next day to a school teacher and I found the periscope affair very handy
1298-142233-0010	train-other-500	I could see just how much gas she used and although the notice on each door forbids cooking and washing in rooms I found she was doing both making coffee and boiling an egg in the morning and rubbing out stockings and handkerchiefs in her wash bowl
1298-142233-0011	train-other-500	I d much rather have men as boarders than women The women are always lighting alcohol lamps on the bureau and wanting the bed turned into a cozy corner so they can see their gentlemen friends in their rooms
1298-142233-0012	train-other-500	Well with mister Holcombe gone and mister Reynolds busy all day and half the night getting out the summer silks and preparing for remnant day and with mister Ladley in jail and Lida out of the city for I saw in the papers
1298-142233-0013	train-other-500	that she was not well and her mother had taken her to Bermuda I had a good bit of time on my hands And so I got in the habit of thinking things over and trying to draw conclusions as I had seen mister Holcombe do
none	none	 I would sit down and write things out as they had happened 
1298-142233-0014	train-other-500	and study them over and especially I worried over how we could have found a slip of paper in mister Ladley s room with a list almost exact of the things we had discovered there I used to read it over rope
1298-142233-0015	train-other-500	knife shoe towel Horn and get more and more bewildered Horn might have been a town or it might not have been There was such a town according to mister Graves
1298-142233-0016	train-other-500	but apparently he had made nothing of it Was it a town that was meant The dictionary gave only a few words beginning with horn hornet hornblende hornpipe and horny
1298-142233-0017	train-other-500	none of which was of any assistance And then one morning I happened to see in the personal column of one of the newspapers that a woman named Eliza Shaeffer of Horner
none	none	 had day old Buff Orpington and Plymouth Rock chicks for sale and it started me to puzzling again 
1298-142233-0018	train-other-500	Perhaps it had been Horner and possibly this very Eliza Shaeffer I suppose my lack of experience was in my favor for after all Eliza Shaeffer is a common enough name
1298-142233-0019	train-other-500	and the Horn might have stood for hornswoggle for all I knew The story of the man who thought of what he would do if he were a horse came back to me and for an hour or so I tried to think I was Jennie Brice
1298-142233-0020	train-other-500	trying to get away and hide from my rascal of a husband But I made no headway I would never have gone to Horner or to any small town if I had wanted to hide I think I should have gone around the corner
1298-142233-0021	train-other-500	and taken a room in my own neighborhood or have lost myself in some large city It was that same day that since I did not go to Horner Horner came to me
1298-142233-0022	train-other-500	The bell rang about three o clock and I answered it myself For with times hard and only two or three roomers all winter I had not had a servant except Terry to do odd jobs for some months
1298-142233-0023	train-other-500	There stood a fresh faced young girl with a covered basket in her hand Are you missus Pitman she asked I don t need anything to day I said trying to shut the door And at that minute
1298-142233-0024	train-other-500	something in the basket cheeped Young women selling poultry are not common in our neighborhood What have you there I asked more agreeably Chicks day old chicks but I m not trying to sell you any I
1298-142233-0025	train-other-500	may I come in It was dawning on me then that perhaps this was Eliza Shaeffer I led her back to the dining room with Peter sniffing at the basket My name is Shaeffer she said
1298-142233-0026	train-other-500	I ve seen your name in the papers and I believe I know something about Jennie Brice Eliza Shaeffer s story was curious She said that she was postmistress at Horner
none	none	 and lived with her mother on a farm a mile out of the town driving in and out each day in a buggy On Monday afternoon March the fifth a woman had alighted at the station from a train and had taken luncheon at the hotel She told the clerk she was on the road selling corsets 
1298-142233-0027	train-other-500	and was much disappointed to find no store of any size in the town The woman who had registered as missus Jane Bellows said she was tired and would like to rest for a day or two on a farm
1298-142233-0028	train-other-500	She was told to see Eliza Shaeffer at the post office and as a result drove out with her to the farm after the last mail came in that evening Asked to describe her she was over medium height light haired
1298-142233-0029	train-other-500	quick in her movements and wore a black and white striped dress with a red collar and a hat to match She carried a small brown valise that Miss Shaeffer presumed contained her samples
1298-142233-0030	train-other-500	missus Shaeffer had made her welcome although they did not usually take boarders until June She had not eaten much supper and that night she had asked for pen and ink and had written a letter
1298-142233-0031	train-other-500	The letter was not mailed until Wednesday All of Tuesday missus Bellows had spent in her room and missus Shaeffer had driven to the village in the afternoon with word that she had been crying all day
1298-142233-0032	train-other-500	and bought some headache medicine for her On Wednesday morning however she had appeared at breakfast
none	none	 eaten heartily and had asked Miss Shaeffer to take her letter to the post office 
1298-142233-0033	train-other-500	It was addressed to mister Ellis Howell in care of a Pittsburgh newspaper That night when Miss Eliza went home about half past eight the woman was gone
1298-142233-0034	train-other-500	She had paid for her room and had been driven as far as Thornville where all trace of her had been lost On account of the disappearance of Jennie Brice being published shortly after that she and her mother had driven to Thornville
1298-142233-0035	train-other-500	but the station agent there was surly as well as stupid They had learned nothing about the woman Since that time three men had made inquiries about the woman in question One had a pointed Vandyke beard
1298-142233-0036	train-other-500	the second from the description I fancied must have been mister Graves The third without doubt was mister Howell Eliza Shaeffer said that this last man had seemed half frantic
1298-142233-0037	train-other-500	I brought her a photograph of Jennie Brice as Topsy and another one as Juliet She said there was a resemblance but that it ended there But of course as mister Graves had said
1298-142233-0038	train-other-500	by the time an actress gets her photograph retouched to suit her it doesn t particularly resemble her And unless I had known Jennie Brice myself I should hardly have recognized the pictures Well in spite of all that
1298-142233-0039	train-other-500	there seemed no doubt that Jennie Brice had been living three days after her disappearance and that would clear mister Ladley But what had mister Howell to do with it all Why had he not told the police of the letter from Horner
1298-142233-0040	train-other-500	Or about the woman on the bridge Why had mister Bronson who was likely the man with the pointed beard said nothing about having traced Jennie Brice to Horner I did as I thought mister Holcombe would have wished me to do
none	none	 I wrote down on a clean sheet of note paper 
1298-142233-0041	train-other-500	all that Eliza Shaeffer said the description of the black and white dress the woman s height and the rest and then I took her to the court house chicks and all and she told her story there to one of the assistant district attorneys
1298-142233-0042	train-other-500	The young man was interested but not convinced He had her story taken down and she signed it He was smiling as he bowed us out I turned in the doorway This will free mister Ladley I suppose
none	none	 I asked Not just yet he said pleasantly This makes just eleven places where Jennie Brice spent the first three days after her death But I can positively identify the dress My good woman that dress has been described 
1298-142233-0043	train-other-500	to the last stilted arch and Colonial volute in every newspaper in the United States That evening the newspapers announced that during a conference at the jail between mister Ladley and James Bronson
none	none	 business manager at the Liberty Theater 
1298-142233-0044	train-other-500	mister Ladley had attacked mister Bronson with a chair
none	none	 and almost brained him CHAPTER XI Eliza Shaeffer went back to Horner after delivering her chicks somewhere in the city Things went on as before The trial was set for May The district attorney s office had all the things we had found in the house that Monday afternoon the stained towel the broken knife and its blade the slipper that had been floating in the parlor and the rope that had fastened my boat to the staircase Somewhere wherever they keep such things was the headless body of a woman with a hand missing and with a curious scar across the left breast The slip of paper however which I had found behind the base board was still in mister Holcombe s possession nor had he mentioned it to the police mister Holcombe had not come back He wrote me twice asking me to hold his room once from New York and once from Chicago To the second letter he added a postscript Have not found what I wanted but am getting warm If any news address me at Des Moines Iowa General Delivery H It was nearly the end of April when I saw Lida again I had seen by the newspapers that she and her mother were coming home I wondered if she had heard from mister Howell for I had not and I wondered too if she would send for me again But she came herself on foot late one afternoon and the school teacher being out I took her into the parlor bedroom She looked thinner than before and rather white My heart ached for her I have been away she explained I thought you might wonder why you did not hear from me But you see my mother she stopped and flushed I would have written you from Bermuda but my mother watched my correspondence so I could not No I knew she could not Alma had once found a letter of mine to mister Pitman Very little escaped Alma I wondered if you have heard anything she asked I have heard nothing mister Howell was here once just after I saw you I do not believe he is in the city Perhaps not although missus Pitman I believe he is in the city hiding Hiding Why I don t know But last night I thought I saw him below my window I opened the window so if it were he he could make some sign But he moved on without a word Later whoever it was came back I put out my light and watched Some one stood there in the shadow until after two this morning Part of the time he was looking up Don t you think had it been he he would have spoken when he saw you She shook her head He is in trouble she said He has not heard from me and he thinks I don t care any more Just look at me missus Pitman Do I look as if I don t care She looked half killed poor lamb He may be out of town searching for a better position I tried to comfort her He wants to have something to offer more than himself I only want him she said looking at me frankly I don t know why I tell you all this but you are so kind and I must talk to some one She sat there in the cozy corner the school teacher had made with a portiere and some cushions and I saw she was about ready to break down and cry I went over to her and took her hand for she was my own niece although she didn t suspect it and I had never had a child of my own But after all I could not help her much I could only assure her that he would come back and explain everything and that he was all right and that the last time I had seen him he had spoken of her and had said she was the best ever My heart fairly yearned over the girl and I think she felt it For she kissed me shyly when she was leaving With the newspaper files before me it is not hard to give the details of that sensational trial It commenced on Monday the seventh of May but it was late Wednesday when the jury was finally selected I was at the court house early on Thursday and so was mister Reynolds The district attorney made a short speech We propose gentlemen to prove that the prisoner Philip Ladley murdered his wife he said in part We will show first that a crime was committed then we will show a motive for this crime and finally we expect to show that the body washed ashore at Sewickley is the body of the murdered woman and thus establish beyond doubt the prisoner s guilt mister Ladley listened with attention He wore the brown suit and looked well and cheerful He was much more like a spectator than a prisoner and he was not so nervous as I was Of that first day I do not recall much I was called early in the day The district attorney questioned me Your name Elizabeth Marie Pitman Your occupation I keep a boarding house at forty two Union Street You know the prisoner Yes He was a boarder in my house For how long From December first He and his wife came at that time Was his wife the actress Jennie Brice Yes sir Were they living together at your house the night of March fourth Yes sir In what part of the house They rented the double parlors down stairs but on account of the flood I moved them up stairs to the second floor front That was on Sunday You moved them on Sunday Yes sir At what time did you retire that night Not at all The water was very high I lay down dressed at one o clock and dropped into a doze How long did you sleep An hour or so mister Reynolds a boarder roused me to say he had heard some one rowing a boat in the lower hall Do you keep a boat around during flood times Yes sir What did you do when mister Reynolds roused you I went to the top of the stairs My boat was gone Was the boat secured Yes sir Anyhow there was no current in the hall What did you do then I waited a time and went back to my room What examination of the house did you make if any mister Reynolds looked around What did he find He found Peter the Ladleys dog shut in a room on the third floor Was there anything unusual about that I had never known it to happen before State what happened later I did not go to sleep again At a quarter after four I heard the boat come back I took a candle and went to the stairs It was mister Ladley He said he had been out getting medicine for his wife Did you see him tie up the boat Yes Did you observe any stains on the rope I did not notice any What was the prisoner s manner at that time I thought he was surly Now missus Pitman tell us about the following morning I saw mister Ladley at a quarter before seven He said to bring breakfast for one His wife had gone away I asked if she was not ill and he said no that she had gone away early that he had rowed her to Federal Street and that she would be back Saturday It was shortly after that that the dog Peter brought in one of missus Ladley s slippers water soaked You recognized the slipper Positively I had seen it often What did you do with it I took it to mister Ladley What did he say He said at first that it was not hers Then he said if it was she would never wear it again and then added because it was ruined Did he offer any statement as to where his wife was No sir Not at that time Before he had said she had gone away for a few days Tell the jury about the broken knife The dog found it floating in the parlor with the blade broken You had not left it down stairs No sir I had used it up stairs the night before and left it on a mantel of the room I was using as a temporary kitchen Was the door of this room locked No It was standing open Were you not asleep in this room Yes You heard no one come in No one until mister Reynolds roused me Where did you find the blade Behind the bed in mister Ladley s room What else did you find in the room A blood stained towel behind the wash stand Also my onyx clock was missing Where was the clock when the Ladleys were moved up into this room On the mantel I wound it just before they came up stairs When you saw missus Ladley on Sunday did she say she was going away No sir Did you see any preparation for a journey The black and white dress was laid out on the bed and a small bag She said she was taking the dress to the theater to lend to Miss Hope Is that all she said No She said she d been wishing her husband would drown that he was a fiend I could see that my testimony had made an impression CHAPTER XII The slipper the rope the towel and the knife and blade were produced in court and I identified them all They made a noticeable impression on the jury Then mister Llewellyn the lawyer for the defense cross examined me Is it not true missus Pitman he said that many articles particularly shoes and slippers are found floating around during a flood Yes I admitted Now you say the dog found this slipper floating in the hall and brought it to you Are you sure this slipper belonged to Jennie Brice She wore it I presume it belonged to her Ahem Now missus Pitman after the Ladleys had been moved to the upper floor did you search their bedroom and the connecting room down stairs No sir Ah Then how do you know that this slipper was not left on the floor or in a closet It is possible but not likely Anyhow it was not the slipper alone It was the other things and the slipper It was Exactly Now missus Pitman this knife Can you identify it positively I can But isn t it true that this is a very common sort of knife One that nearly every housewife has in her possession Yes sir But that knife handle has three notches in it I put the notches there myself Before this presumed crime Yes sir For what purpose My neighbors were constantly borrowing things It was a means of identification Then this knife is yours Yes Tell again where you left it the night before it was found floating down stairs On a shelf over the stove Could the dog have reached it there Not without standing on a hot stove Is it not possible that mister Ladley unable to untie the boat borrowed your knife to cut the boat s painter No painter was cut that I heard about The paper hanger No no The boat s painter the rope Oh Well he might have He never said Now then this towel missus Pitman Did not the prisoner on the following day tell you that he had cut his wrist in freeing the boat and ask you for some court plaster He did not I said firmly You have not seen a scar on his wrist No I glanced at mister Ladley he was smiling as if amused It made me angry And what s more I flashed if he has a cut on his wrist he put it there himself to account for the towel I was sorry the next moment that I had said it but it was too late The counsel for the defense moved to exclude the answer and I received a caution that I deserved Then You saw mister Ladley when he brought your boat back Yes What time was that A quarter after four Monday morning Did he come in quietly like a man trying to avoid attention Not particularly It would have been of no use The dog was barking What did he say That he had been out for medicine That his wife was sick Do you know a pharmacist named Alexander Jonathan Alexander There is such a one but I don t know him I was excused and mister Reynolds was called He had heard no quarreling that Sunday night had even heard missus Ladley laughing This was about nine o clock Yes they had fought in the afternoon He had not overheard any words but their voices were quarrelsome and once he heard a chair or some article of furniture overthrown Was awakened about two by footsteps on the stairs followed by the sound of oars in the lower hall He told his story plainly and simply Under cross examination admitted that he was fond of detective stories and had tried to write one himself that he had said at the store that he would like to see that conceited ass swing referring to the prisoner that he had sent flowers to Jennie Brice at the theater and had made a few advances to her without success My head was going round I don t know yet how the police learned it all but by the time poor mister Reynolds left the stand half the people there believed that he had been in love with Jennie Brice that she had spurned his advances and that there was more to the story than any of them had suspected Miss Hope s story held without any alteration under the cross examination She was perfectly at ease looked handsome and well dressed and could not be shaken She told how Jennie Brice had been in fear of her life and had asked her only the week before she disappeared to allow her to go home with her Miss Hope She told of the attack of hysteria in her dressing room and that the missing woman had said that her husband would kill her some day There was much wrangling over her testimony and I believe at least a part of it was not allowed to go to the jury But I am not a lawyer and I repeat what I recall Did she say that he had attacked her Yes more than once She was a large woman fairly muscular and had always held her own Did she say that these attacks came when he had been drinking I believe he was worse then Did she give any reason for her husband s attitude to her She said he wanted to marry another woman There was a small sensation at this If proved it established a motive Did she know who the other woman was I believe not She was away most of the day and he put in his time as he liked Did Miss Brice ever mention the nature of the threats he made against her No I think not Have you examined the body washed ashore at Sewickley Yes in a low voice Is it the body of Jennie Brice I can not say Does the remaining hand look like the hand of Jennie Brice Very much The nails are filed to points as she wore hers Did you ever know of Jennie Brice having a scar on her breast No but that would be easily concealed Just what do you mean Many actresses conceal defects She could have worn flesh colored plaster and covered it with powder Also such a scar would not necessarily be seen Explain that Most of Jennie Brice s decollete gowns were cut to a point This would conceal such a scar Miss Hope was excused and Jennie Brice s sister from Olean was called She was a smaller woman than Jennie Brice had been very lady like in her manner She said she was married and living in Olean she had not seen her sister for several years but had heard from her often The witness had discouraged the marriage to the prisoner Why She had had bad luck before She had been married before Yes to a man named John Bellows They were in vaudeville together on the Keith Circuit They were known as The Pair of Bellows I sat up at this for John Bellows had boarded at my house mister Bellows is dead I think not She divorced him Did you know of any scar on your sister s body I never heard of one Have you seen the body found at Sewickley Yes faintly Can you identify it No sir A flurry was caused during the afternoon by Timothy Senft He testified to what I already knew that between three and four on Monday morning during the height of the flood he had seen from his shanty boat a small skiff caught in the current near the Ninth Street bridge He had shouted encouragingly to the man in the boat running out a way on the ice to make him hear He had told him to row with the current and to try to steer in toward shore He had followed close to the river bank in his own boat Below Sixth Street the other boat was within rope throwing distance He had pulled it in and had towed it well back out of the current The man in the boat was the prisoner Asked if the prisoner gave any explanation yes he said he couldn t sleep and had thought to tire himself rowing Had been caught in the current before he knew it Saw nothing suspicious in or about the boat As they passed the police patrol boat prisoner had called to ask if there was much distress and expressed regret when told there was Tim was excused He had made a profound impression I would not have given a dollar for mister Ladley s chance with the jury at that time CHAPTER XIII The prosecution produced many witnesses during the next two days 
1298-142236-0000	train-other-500	Shanty boat Tim s story withstood the most vigorous cross examination After him mister Bronson from the theater corroborated Miss Hope s story of Jennie Brice s attack of hysteria in the dressing room
1298-142236-0001	train-other-500	and told of taking her home that night He was a poor witness nervous and halting He weighed each word before he said it and he made a general unfavorable impression I thought he was holding something back
1298-142236-0002	train-other-500	In view of what mister Pitman would have called the denouement his attitude is easily explained But I was puzzled then So far the prosecution had touched but lightly on the possible motive for a crime the woman
none	none	 But on the third day to my surprise a missus Agnes Murray was called It was the missus Murray I had seen at the morgue I have lost the clipping of that day s trial 
1298-142236-0003	train-other-500	but I remember her testimony perfectly She was a widow living above a small millinery shop on Federal Street Allegheny She had one daughter Alice who did stenography and typing as a means of livelihood
1298-142236-0004	train-other-500	She had no office and worked at home Many of the small stores in the neighborhood employed her to send out their bills There was a card at the street entrance beside the shop and now and then strangers brought her work
1298-142236-0005	train-other-500	Early in December the prisoner had brought her the manuscript of a play to type and from that time on he came frequently sometimes every day bringing a few sheets of manuscript at a time
1298-142236-0006	train-other-500	Sometimes he came without any manuscript and would sit and talk while he smoked a cigarette They had thought him unmarried On Wednesday February twenty eighth Alice Murray had disappeared She had taken some of her clothing
1298-142236-0007	train-other-500	not all and had left a note The witness read the note aloud in a trembling voice DEAR MOTHER When you get this I shall be married to mister Ladley
none	none	 Don t worry Will write again from N Y 
1298-142236-0008	train-other-500	Lovingly ALICE From that time until a week before she had not heard from her daughter Then she had a card mailed from Madison Square Station New York City The card merely said Am well and working
1298-142236-0009	train-other-500	ALICE The defense was visibly shaken They had not expected this and I thought even mister Ladley whose calm had continued unbroken paled So far all had gone well for the prosecution
none	none	 They had proved a crime 
1298-142236-0010	train-other-500	as nearly as circumstantial evidence could prove a crime and they had established a motive But in the identification of the body so far they had failed The prosecution rested as they say although they didn t rest much
1298-142236-0011	train-other-500	on the afternoon of the third day The defense called first of all Eliza Shaeffer She told of a woman answering the general description of Jennie Brice having spent two days at the Shaeffer farm at Horner
1298-142236-0012	train-other-500	Being shown photographs of Jennie Brice she said she thought it was the same woman but was not certain She told further of the woman leaving unexpectedly on Wednesday of that week from Thornville On cross examination
1298-142236-0013	train-other-500	being shown the small photograph which mister Graves had shown me she identified the woman in the group as being the woman in question As the face was in shadow knew it more by the dress and hat she described the black and white dress and the hat with red trimming
1298-142236-0014	train-other-500	The defense then called me I had to admit that the dress and hat as described were almost certainly the ones I had seen on the bed in Jennie Brice s room the day before she disappeared I could not say definitely
1298-142236-0015	train-other-500	whether the woman in the photograph was Jennie Brice or not under a magnifying glass thought it might be Defense called Jonathan Alexander a druggist who testified that on the night in question
1298-142236-0016	train-other-500	he had been roused at half past three by the prisoner who had said his wife was ill and had purchased
none	none	 a bottle of a proprietary remedy from him 
1298-142236-0017	train-other-500	His identification was absolute The defense called Jennie Brice s sister and endeavored to prove that Jennie Brice had had no such scar
1298-142236-0018	train-other-500	It was shown that she was on intimate terms with her family and would hardly have concealed an operation of any gravity from them The defense scored that day They had shown that the prisoner had told the truth
none	none	 when he said he had gone to a pharmacy for medicine that night for his wife 
1298-142236-0019	train-other-500	and they had shown that a woman answering the description of Jennie Brice spent two days in a town called Horner and had gone from there on Wednesday after the crime And they had shown that this woman was attired as Jennie Brice had been
1298-142236-0020	train-other-500	That was the way things stood on the afternoon of the fourth day when court adjourned mister Reynolds was at home when I got there He had been very much subdued since the developments of that first day of the trial
none	none	 sat mostly in his own room and had twice brought me a bunch of jonquils as a peace offering He had the kettle boiling when I got home You have had a number of visitors he said Our young friend Howell has been here and mister Holcombe has arrived and has a man in his room 
1298-142236-0021	train-other-500	mister Holcombe came down a moment after with his face beaming I think we ve got him missus Pitman he said The jury won t even go out of the box But further than that he would not explain He said he had a witness locked in his room
1298-142236-0022	train-other-500	and he d be glad of supper for him as they d both come a long ways And he went out and bought some oysters and a bottle or two of beer But as far as I know he kept him locked up all that night in the second story front room
1298-142236-0023	train-other-500	I don t think the man knew he was a prisoner I went in to turn down the bed and he was sitting by the window reading the evening paper s account of the trial an elderly gentleman rather professional looking
1298-142236-0024	train-other-500	mister Holcombe slept on the upper landing of the hall that night rolled in a blanket not that I think his witness even thought of escaping but the little man was taking no chances At eight o clock that night the bell rang It was mister Howell
none	none	 I admitted him myself and he followed me back to the dining room I had not seen him for several weeks and the change in him startled me He was dressed carefully but his eyes were sunken in his head and he looked as if he had not slept for days mister Reynolds had gone up stairs not finding me socially inclined 
1298-142236-0025	train-other-500	You haven t been sick mister Howell have you I asked Oh no I m well enough I ve been traveling about Those infernal sleeping cars His voice trailed off and I saw him looking at my mother s picture
1298-142236-0026	train-other-500	with the jonquils beneath That s curious he said going closer It it looks almost like Lida Harvey My mother I said simply Have you seen her lately
1298-142236-0027	train-other-500	My mother I asked startled No Lida I saw her a few days ago Here Yes She came here mister Howell two weeks ago She looks badly
none	none	 as if she is worrying Not about me he asked eagerly Yes about you What possessed you to go away as you did When my bro when her uncle accused you of something you ran away 
1298-142236-0028	train-other-500	instead of facing things like a man I was trying to find the one person who could clear me missus Pitman He sat back with his eyes closed he looked ill enough to be in bed And you succeeded No
1298-142236-0029	train-other-500	I thought perhaps he had not been eating and I offered him food as I had once before But he refused it with the ghost of his boyish smile I m hungry but it s not food I want
none	none	 I want to see 
1298-142236-0030	train-other-500	her he said I sat down across from him and tried to mend a table cloth but I could not sew I kept seeing those two young things each sick for a sight of the other and from wishing they could have a minute together
1298-142236-0031	train-other-500	I got to planning it for them Perhaps I said finally if you want it very much Very much And if you will sit quiet and stop tapping your fingers together until you drive me crazy I might contrive it for you
1298-142236-0032	train-other-500	For five minutes I said Not a second longer He came right over and put his arms around me Who are you anyhow he said You who turn to the world the frozen mask of a Union Street boarding house landlady
1298-142236-0033	train-other-500	who are a gentlewoman by every instinct and training and a girl at heart Who are you I ll tell you what I am I said I m a romantic old fool and you d better let me do this quickly before I change my mind
1298-142236-0034	train-other-500	He freed me at that but he followed to the telephone and stood by while I got Lida He was in a perfect frenzy of anxiety turning red and white by turns and in the middle of the conversation
1298-142236-0035	train-other-500	taking the receiver bodily from me and holding it to his own ear She said she thought she could get away she spoke guardedly as if Alma were near but I gathered that she would come as soon as she could and from the way her voice broke
1298-142236-0036	train-other-500	I knew she was as excited as the boy beside me She came heavily coated and veiled at a quarter after ten that night and I took her back to the dining room where he was waiting He did not make a move toward her
1298-142236-0037	train-other-500	but stood there with his very lips white looking at her And at first she did not make a move either but stood and gazed at him thin and white a wreck of himself Then Ell she cried
1298-142236-0038	train-other-500	and ran around the table to him as he held out his arms The school teacher was out I went into the parlor bedroom and sat in the cozy corner in the dark I had done a wrong thing and I was glad of it
1298-142236-0039	train-other-500	And sitting there in the darkness I went over my own life again After all it had been my own life I had lived it no one else had shaped it for me And if it was cheerless and colorless now
1298-142236-0040	train-other-500	it had had its big moments Life is measured by big moments If I let the two children in the dining room have fifteen big moments instead of five
none	none	 who can blame me CHAPTER XIV The next day was the sensational one of the trial We went through every phase of conviction Jennie Brice was living Jennie Brice was dead The body found at Sewickley could not be Jennie Brice s The body found at Sewickley was Jennie Brice s And so it went on The defense did an unexpected thing in putting mister Ladley on the stand That day for the first time he showed the wear and tear of the ordeal He had no flower in his button hole and the rims of his eyes were red But he was quite cool His stage training had taught him not only to endure the eyes of the crowd but to find in its gaze a sort of stimulant He made a good witness I must admit He replied to the usual questions easily After five minutes or so mister Llewellyn got down to work mister Ladley you have said that your wife was ill the night of March fourth Yes What was the nature of her illness She had a functional heart trouble not serious Will you tell us fully the events of that night I had been asleep when my wife wakened me She asked for a medicine she used in these attacks I got up and found the bottle but it was empty As she was nervous and frightened I agreed to try to get some at a drug store I went down stairs took missus Pitman s boat and went to several stores before I could awaken a pharmacist You cut the boat loose Yes It was tied in a woman s knot or series of knots I could not untie it and I was in a hurry How did you cut it With my pocket knife You did not use missus Pitman s bread knife I did not And in cutting it you cut your wrist did you Yes The knife slipped I have the scar still What did you do then I went back to the room and stanched the blood with a towel From whom did you get the medicine From Alexander s Pharmacy At what time I am not certain About three o clock probably You went directly back home mister Ladley hesitated No he said finally My wife had had these attacks but they were not serious I was curious to see how the river front looked and rowed out too far I was caught in the current and nearly carried away You came home after that Yes at once missus Ladley was better and had dropped asleep She wakened as I came in She was disagreeable about the length of time I had been gone and would not let me explain We quarreled and she said she was going to leave me I said that as she had threatened this before and had never done it I would see that she really started At daylight I rowed her to Federal Street What had she with her A small brown valise How was she dressed In a black and white dress and hat with a long black coat What was the last you saw of her She was going across the Sixth Street bridge Alone No She went with a young man we knew There was a stir in the court room at this Who was the young man A mister Howell a reporter on a newspaper here Have you seen mister Howell since your arrest No sir He has been out of the city I was so excited by this time that I could hardly hear I missed some of the cross examination The district attorney pulled mister Ladley s testimony to pieces You cut the boat s painter with your pocket knife I did Then how do you account for missus Pitman s broken knife with the blade in your room I have no theory about it She may have broken it herself She had used it the day before to lift tacks out of a carpet That was true I had That early Monday morning was cold was it not Yes Very Why did your wife leave without her fur coat I did not know she had until we had left the house Then I did not ask her She would not speak to me I see But is it not true that upon a wet fur coat being shown you as your wife s you said it could not be hers as she had taken hers with her I do not recall such a statement You recall a coat being shown you Yes missus Pitman brought a coat to my door but I was working on a play I am writing and I do not remember what I said The coat was ruined I did not want it I probably said the first thing I thought of to get rid of the woman I got up at that I d held my peace about the bread knife but this was too much However the moment I started to speak somebody pushed me back into my chair and told me to be quiet Now you say you were in such a hurry to get this medicine for your wife that you cut the rope thus cutting your wrist Yes I have the scar still You could not wait to untie the boat and yet you went along the river front to see how high the water was Her alarm had excited me But when I got out and remembered that the doctors had told us she would never die in an attack I grew more composed You got the medicine first you say Yes mister Alexander has testified that you got the medicine at three thirty It has been shown that you left the house at two and got back about four Does not this show that with all your alarm you went to the river front first I was gone from two to four he replied calmly mister Alexander must be wrong about the time I wakened him I got the medicine first When your wife left you at the bridge did she say where she was going No You claim that this woman at Horner was your wife I think it likely Was there an onyx clock in the second story room when you moved into it I do not recall the clock Your wife did not take an onyx clock away with her mister Ladley smiled No The defense called mister Howell next He looked rested and the happier for having seen Lida but he was still pale and showed the strain of some hidden anxiety What that anxiety was the next two days were to tell us all mister Howell mister Llewellyn asked you know the prisoner Slightly State when you met him On Sunday morning March the fourth I went to see him Will you tell us the nature of that visit My paper had heard he was writing a play for himself I was to get an interview with photographs if possible You saw his wife at that time Yes When did you see her again The following morning at six o clock or a little later I walked across the Sixth Street bridge with her and put her on a train for Horner Pennsylvania You are positive it was Jennie Brice Yes I watched her get out of the boat while her husband steadied it If you knew this why did you not come forward sooner I have been out of the city But you knew the prisoner had been arrested and that this testimony of yours would be invaluable to him Yes But I thought it necessary to produce Jennie Brice herself My unsupported word You have been searching for Jennie Brice Yes Since March the eighth How was she dressed when you saw her last She wore a red and black hat and a black coat She carried a small brown valise Thank you The cross examination did not shake his testimony But it brought out some curious things mister Howell refused to say how he happened to be at the end of the Sixth Street bridge at that hour or why he had thought it necessary on meeting a woman he claimed to have known only twenty four hours to go with her to the railway station and put her on a train The jury was visibly impressed and much shaken For mister Howell carried conviction in every word he said he looked the district attorney in the eye and once when our glances crossed he even smiled at me faintly But I saw why he had tried to find Jennie Brice and had dreaded testifying Not a woman in that court room and hardly a man but believed when he left the stand that he was or had been Jennie Brice s lover and as such was assisting her to leave her husband Then you believe the district attorney said at the end you believe mister Howell that Jennie Brice is living Jennie Brice was living on Monday morning March the fifth he said firmly Miss Shaeffer has testified that on Wednesday this woman who you claim was Jennie Brice sent a letter to you from Horner Is that the case Yes The letter was signed Jennie Brice It was signed J B Will you show the court that letter I destroyed it It was a personal letter It merely said she had arrived safely and not to let any one know where she was And yet you destroyed it A postscript said to do so Why I do not know An extra precaution probably You were under the impression that she was going to stay there She was to have remained for a week And you have been searching for this woman for two months He quailed but his voice was steady Yes he admitted He was telling the truth even if it was not all the truth I believe had it gone to the jury then mister Ladley would have been acquitted But late that afternoon things took a new turn Counsel for the prosecution stated to the court that he had a new and important witness and got permission to introduce this further evidence The witness was a Doctor Littlefield and proved to be my one night tenant of the second story front Holcombe s prisoner of the night before took the stand The doctor was less impressive in full daylight he was a trifle shiny a bit bulbous as to nose and indifferent as to finger nails But his testimony was given with due professional weight You are a doctor of medicine Doctor Littlefield asked the district attorney Yes In active practise I have a Cure for Inebriates in Des Moines Iowa I was formerly in general practise in New York City You knew Jennie Ladley I had seen her at different theaters And she consulted me professionally at one time in New York You operated on her I believe Yes She came to me to have a name removed It had been tattooed over her heart You removed it Not at once I tried fading the marks with goat s milk but she was impatient On the third visit to my office she demanded that the name be cut out You did it Yes She refused a general anesthetic and I used cocaine The name was John I believe a former husband She intended to marry again A titter ran over the court room People strained to the utmost are always glad of an excuse to smile The laughter of a wrought up crowd always seems to me half hysterical Have you seen photographs of the scar on the body found at Sewickley Or the body itself No I have not Will you describe the operation I made a transverse incision for the body of the name and two vertical ones one longer for the J the other shorter for the stem of the h There was a dot after the name I made a half inch incision for it Will you sketch the cicatrix as you recall it The doctor made a careful drawing on a pad that was passed to him The drawing was much like this Line for line dot for dot it was the scar on the body found at Sewickley You are sure the woman was Jennie Brice She sent me tickets for the theater shortly after And I had an announcement of her marriage to the prisoner some weeks later Were there any witnesses to the operation My assistant I can produce him at any time That was not all of the trial but it was the decisive moment Shortly after the jury withdrew and for twenty four hours not a word was heard from them CHAPTER XV After twenty four hours deliberation the jury brought in a verdict of guilty It was a first degree verdict mister Howell s unsupported word had lost out against a scar Contrary to my expectation mister Holcombe was not jubilant over the verdict He came into the dining room that night and stood by the window looking out into the yard It isn t logical he said In view of Howell s testimony it s ridiculous Heaven help us under this jury system anyhow Look at the facts Howell knows the woman he sees her on Monday morning and puts her on a train out of town The boy is telling the truth He has nothing to gain by coming forward and everything to lose Very well she was alive on Monday We know where she was on Tuesday and Wednesday Anyhow during those days her gem of a husband was in jail He was freed Thursday night and from that time until his rearrest on the following Tuesday I had him under observation every moment He left the jail Thursday night and on Saturday the body floated in at Sewickley If it was done by Ladley it must have been done on Friday and on Friday he was in view through the periscope all day mister Reynolds came in and joined us There s only one way out that I see he said mildly Two women have been fool enough to have a name tattooed over their hearts No woman ever thought enough of me to have my name put on her I hope not I retorted mister Reynold s first name is Zachariah But as mister Holcombe said all that had been proved was that Jennie Brice was dead probably murdered He could not understand the defense letting the case go to the jury without their putting more stress on mister Howell s story But we were to understand that soon and many other things mister Holcombe told me that evening of learning from John Bellows of the tattooed name on Jennie Brice and of how after an almost endless search he had found the man who had cut the name away At eight o clock the door bell rang mister Reynolds had gone to lodge he being an Elk and several other things and much given to regalia in boxes and having his picture in the newspapers in different outlandish costumes mister Pitman used to say that man being denied his natural love for barbaric adornment in his every day clothing took to the different fraternities as an excuse for decking himself out But this has nothing to do with the door bell It was old Isaac He had a basket in his hand and he stepped into the hall and placed it on the floor Evening Miss Bess he said Can you see a bit of company to night I can always see you I replied But he had not meant himself He stepped to the door and opening it beckoned to some one across the street It was Lida She came in her color a little heightened and old Isaac stood back beaming at us both I believe it was one of the crowning moments of the old man s life thus to see his Miss Bess and Alma s child together Is is he here yet she asked me nervously I did not know he was coming There was no need to ask which he There was only one for Lida He telephoned me and asked me to come here Oh missus Pitman I m so afraid for him She had quite forgotten Isaac I turned to the school teacher s room and opened the door The woman who belongs here is out at a lecture I said Come in here Ikkie and I ll find the evening paper for you Ikkie said Lida and stood staring at me I think I went white The lady heah and I is old friends Isaac said with his splendid manner Her mothah Miss Lida her mothah But even old Isaac choked up at that and I closed the door on him How queer Lida said looking at me So Isaac knew your mother Have you lived always in Allegheny missus Pitman I was born in Pittsburgh I evaded I went away for a long time but I always longed for the hurry and activity of the old home town So here I am again Fortunately like all the young her own affairs engrossed her She was flushed with the prospect of meeting her lover tremulous over what the evening might bring The middle aged woman who had come back to the hurry of the old town and who pushed back into an eddy of the flood district could only watch the activity and the life from behind a Rooms to Let sign did not concern her much Nor should she have mister Howell came soon after He asked for her and going back to the dining room kissed her quietly He had an air of resolve a sort of grim determination that was a relief from the half frantic look he had worn before He asked to have mister Holcombe brought down and so behold us all four of us sitting around the table mister Holcombe with his note book I with my mending and the boy with one of Lida s hands frankly under his on the red table cloth I want to tell all of you the whole story he began To morrow I shall go to the district attorney and confess but I want you all to have it first I can t sleep again until I get it off my chest missus Pitman has suffered through me and mister Holcombe here has spent money and time Lida did not speak but she drew her chair closer and put her other hand over his I want to get it straight if I can Let me see It was on Sunday the fourth that the river came up wasn t it Yes Well on the Thursday before that I met you mister Holcombe in a restaurant in Pittsburgh Do you remember mister Holcombe nodded We were talking of crime and I said no man should be hanged on purely circumstantial evidence You affirmed that a well linked chain of circumstantial evidence could properly hang a man We had a long argument in which I was worsted There was a third man at the table Bronson the business manager of the Liberty Theater Who sided with you put in mister Holcombe and whose views I refused to entertain because as publicity man for a theater he dealt in fiction rather than in fact Precisely You may recall mister Holcombe that you offered to hang any man we would name given a proper chain of circumstantial evidence against him Yes After you left Bronson spoke to me He said business at the theater was bad and complained of the way the papers used or would not use his stuff He said the Liberty Theater had not had a proper deal and that he was tempted to go over and bang one of the company on the head and so get a little free advertising I said he ought to be able to fake a good story but he maintained that a newspaper could smell a faked story a mile away and that anyhow all the good stunts had been pulled off I agreed with him I remember saying that nothing but a railroad wreck or a murder hit the public very hard these days and that I didn t feel like wrecking the Pennsylvania Limited He leaned over the table and looked at me Well how about a murder then he said You get the story for your paper and I get some advertising for the theater We need it that s sure I laughed it off and we separated But at two o clock Bronson called me up again I met him in his office at the theater and he told me that Jennie Brice who was out of the cast that week had asked for a week s vacation She had heard of a farm at a town called Horner and she wanted to go there to rest Now the idea is this he said She s living with her husband and he has threatened her life more than once It would be easy enough to frame up something to look as if he d made away with her We d get a week of excitement more advertising than we d ordinarily get in a year you get a corking news story and find Jennie Brice at the end getting the credit for that Jennie gets a hundred dollars and a rest and Ladley her husband gets say two hundred mister Bronson offered to put up the money and I agreed The flood came just then and was considerable help It made a good setting I went to my city editor and got an assignment to interview Ladley about this play of his Then Bronson and I went together to see the Ladleys on Sunday morning and as they needed money they agreed But Ladley insisted on fifty dollars a week extra if he had to go to jail We promised it but we did not intend to let things go so far as that In the Ladleys room that Sunday morning we worked it all out The hardest thing was to get Jennie Brice s consent but she agreed finally We arranged a list of clues to be left around and Ladley was to go out in the night and to be heard coming back I told him to quarrel with his wife that afternoon although I don t believe they needed to be asked to do it and I suggested also the shoe or slipper to be found floating around Just a moment said mister Holcombe busy with his note book Did you suggest the onyx clock No No clock was mentioned The the clock has puzzled me The towel Yes I said no murder was complete without blood but he kicked on that said he didn t mind the rest but he d be hanged if he was going to slash himself But as it happened he cut his wrist while cutting the boat loose and so we had the towel Pillow slip asked mister Holcombe Well no There was nothing said about a pillow slip Didn t he say he burned it accidentally So he claimed mister Holcombe made another entry in his book Then I said every murder had a weapon He was to have a pistol at first but none of us owned one missus Ladley undertook to get a knife from missus Pitman s kitchen and to leave it around not in full view but where it could be found A broken knife No Just a knife He was to throw the knife into the water That was not arranged I only gave him a general outline He was to add any interesting details that might occur to him The idea of course was to give the police plenty to work on and just when they thought they had it all and when the theater had had a lot of booming and I had got a good story to produce Jennie Brice safe and well We were not to appear in it at all It would have worked perfectly but we forgot to count on one thing Jennie Brice hated her husband Not really hated him cried Lida Hated him She is letting him hang She could save him by coming forward now and she won t do it She is hiding so he will go to the gallows There was a pause at that It seemed too incredible too inhuman Then early that Monday morning you smuggled Jennie Brice out of the city Yes That was the only thing we bungled We fixed the hour a little too late and I was seen by Miss Harvey s uncle walking across the bridge with a woman Why did you meet her openly and take her to the train mister Howell bent forward and smiled across at the little man One of your own axioms sir he said Do the natural thing upset the customary order of events as little as possible Jennie Brice went to the train because that was where she wanted to go But as Ladley was to protest that his wife had left town and as the police would be searching for a solitary woman I went with her We went in a leisurely manner I bought her a magazine and a morning paper asked the conductor to fix her window and in general acted the devoted husband seeing his wife off on a trip I even he smiled I even promised to feed the canary Lida took her hands away Did you kiss her good by she demanded Not even a chaste salute he said His spirits were rising It was as often happens as if the mere confession removed the guilt I have seen little boys who have broken a window show the same relief after telling about it For a day or two Bronson and I sat back enjoying the stir up Things turned out as we had expected Business boomed at the theater I got a good story and some few kind words from my city editor Then the explosion came I got a letter from Jennie Brice saying she was going away and that we need not try to find her I went to Horner but I had lost track of her completely Even then we did not believe things so bad as they turned out to be We thought she was giving us a bad time but that she would show up Ladley was in a blue funk for a time Bronson and I went to him We told him how the thing had slipped up We didn t want to go to the police and confess if we could help it Finally he agreed to stick it out until she was found at a hundred dollars a week It took all we could beg borrow and steal But now we have to come out with the story anyhow mister Holcombe sat up and closed his note book with a snap I m not so sure of that he said impressively I wonder if you realize young man that having provided a perfect defense for this man Ladley you provided him with every possible inducement to make away with his wife Secure in your coming forward at the last minute and confessing the hoax to save him was there anything he might not have dared with impunity But I tell you I took Jennie Brice out of town on Monday morning Did you asked mister Holcombe sternly But at that the school teacher having come home and found old Isaac sound asleep in her cozy corner set up such a screaming for the police that our meeting broke up Nor would mister Holcombe explain any further CHAPTER XVI mister Holcombe was up very early the next morning I heard him moving around at five o clock and at six he banged at my door and demanded to know at what time the neighborhood rose he had been up for an hour and there were no signs of life He was more cheerful after he had had a cup of coffee commented on Lida s beauty and said that Howell was a lucky chap That is what worries me mister Holcombe I said I am helping the affair along and what if it turns out badly He looked at me over his glasses It isn t likely to turn out badly he said I have never married missus Pitman and I have missed a great deal out of life Perhaps you re better off if you had married and lost your wife I was thinking of mister Pitman Not at all he said with emphasis It s better to have married and lost than never to have married at all Every man needs a good woman and it doesn t matter how old he is The older he is the more he needs her I am nearly sixty I was rather startled and I almost dropped the fried potatoes But the next moment he had got out his note book and was going over the items again Pillow slip he said knife broken onyx clock wouldn t think so much of the clock if he hadn t been so damnably anxious to hide the key the discrepancy in time as revealed by the trial yes it is as clear as a bell missus Pitman does that Maguire woman next door sleep all day She s up now I said looking out the window He was in the hall in a moment only to come to the door later hat in hand Is she the only other woman on the street who keeps boarders She s the only woman who doesn t I snapped She ll keep anything that doesn t belong to her except boarders Ah He lighted his corn cob pipe and stood puffing at it and watching me He made me uneasy I thought he was going to continue the subject of every man needing a wife and I m afraid I had already decided to take him if he offered and to put the school teacher out and have a real parlor again but to keep mister Reynolds he being tidy and no bother But when he spoke he was back to the crime again Did you ever work a typewriter he asked What with the surprise I was a little sharp I don t play any instrument except an egg beater I replied shortly and went on clearing the table I wonder do you remember about the village idiot and the horse But of course you do missus Pitman you are a woman of imagination Don t you think you could be Alice Murray for a few moments Now think you are a stenographer with theatrical ambitions you meet an actor and you fall in love with him and he with you That s hard to imagine that last Not so hard he said gently Now the actor is going to put you on the stage perhaps in this new play and some day he is going to marry you Is that what he promised the girl According to some letters her mother found yes The actor is married but he tells you he will divorce the wife you are to wait for him and in the meantime he wants you near him away from the office where other men are apt to come in with letters to be typed and to chaff you You are a pretty girl It isn t necessary to overwork my imagination I said with a little bitterness I had been a pretty girl but work and worry Now you are going to New York very soon and in the meantime you have cut yourself off from all your people You have no one but this man What would you do Where would you go How old was the girl Nineteen I think I said slowly that if I were nineteen and in love with a man and hiding I would hide as near him as possible I d be likely to get a window that could see his going out and coming in a place so near that he could come often to see me Bravo he exclaimed Of course with your present wisdom and experience you would do nothing so foolish But this girl was in her teens she was not very far away for he probably saw her that Sunday afternoon when he was out for two hours And as the going was slow that day and he had much to tell and explain I figure she was not far off Probably in this very neighborhood During the remainder of that morning I saw mister Holcombe at intervals going from house to house along Union Street making short excursions into side thoroughfares coming back again and taking up his door bell ringing with unflagging energy I watched him off and on for two hours At the end of that time he came back flushed and excited I found the house he said wiping his glasses She was there all right not so close as we had thought but as close as she could get And can you trace her I asked His face changed and saddened Poor child he said She is dead missus Pitman Not she at Sewickley No he said patiently That was Jennie Brice But mister Howell mister Howell is a young ass he said with irritation He did not take Jennie Brice out of the city that morning He took Alice Murray in Jennie Brice s clothing and veiled Well that is five years ago Five times since then the Allegheny River from being a mild and inoffensive stream carrying a few boats and a great deal of sewage has become a raging destroyer and has filled our hearts with fear and our cellars with mud Five times since then Molly Maguire has appropriated all that the flood carried from my premises to hers and five times have I lifted my carpets and moved mister Holcombe who occupies the parlor bedroom to a second floor room A few days ago as I said at the beginning we found Peter s body floating in the cellar and as soon as the yard was dry I buried him He had grown fat and lazy but I shall miss him Yesterday a riverman fell off a barge along the water front and was drowned They dragged the river for his body but they did not find him But they found something an onyx clock with the tattered remnant of a muslin pillow slip wrapped around it It only bore out the story as we had known it for five years The Murray girl had lived long enough to make a statement to the police although mister Holcombe only learned this later On the statement being shown to Ladley in the jail and his learning of the girl s death he collapsed He confessed before he was hanged and his confession briefly was like this He had met the Murray girl in connection with the typing of his play and had fallen in love with her He had never cared for his wife and would have been glad to get rid of her in any way possible He had not intended to kill her however He had planned to elope with the Murray girl and awaiting an opportunity had persuaded her to leave home and to take a room near my house Here he had visited her daily while his wife was at the theater They had planned to go to New York together on Monday March the fifth On Sunday the fourth however mister Bronson and mister Howell had made their curious proposition When he accepted Philip Ladley maintained that he meant only to carry out the plan as suggested But the temptation was too strong for him That night while his wife slept he had strangled her I believe he was frantic with fear after he had done it Then it occurred to him that if he made the body unrecognizable he would be safe enough On that quiet Sunday night when mister Reynolds reported all peaceful in the Ladley room he had cut off the poor wretch s head and had tied it up in a pillow slip weighted with my onyx clock It is a curious fact about the case that the scar which his wife incurred to enable her to marry him was the means of his undoing He insisted and I believe he was telling the truth that he did not know of the scar that is his wife had never told him of it and had been able to conceal it He thought she had probably used paraffin in some way In his final statement written with great care and no little literary finish he told the story in detail of arranging the clues as mister Howell and mister Bronson had suggested of going out in the boat with the body covered with a fur coat in the bottom of the skiff of throwing it into the current above the Ninth Street bridge and of seeing the fur coat fall from the boat and carried beyond his reach of disposing of the head near the Seventh Street bridge of going to a drug store as per the Howell instructions and of coming home at four o clock to find me at the head of the stairs Illustration While his wife slept Several points of confusion remained One had been caused by Temple Hope s refusal to admit that the dress and hat that figured in the case were to be used by her the next week at the theater mister Ladley insisted that this was the case and that on that Sunday afternoon his wife had requested him to take them to Miss Hope that they had quarreled as to whether they should be packed in a box or in the brown valise and that he had visited Alice Murray instead It was on the way there that the idea of finally getting rid of Jennie Brice came to him And a way using the black and white striped dress of the dispute Another point of confusion had been the dismantling of his room that Monday night some time between the visit of Temple Hope and the return of mister Holcombe This was to obtain the scrap of paper containing the list of clues as suggested by mister Howell a clue that might have brought about a premature discovery of the so called hoax To the girl he had told nothing of his plan But he had told her she was to leave town on an early train the next morning going as his wife that he wished her to wear the black and white dress and hat for reasons that he would explain later and to be veiled heavily that to the young man who would put her on the train and who had seen Jennie Brice only once she was to be Jennie Brice to say as little as possible and not to raise her veil Her further instructions were simple to go to the place at Horner where Jennie Brice had planned to go but to use the name of Bellows there And after she had been there for a day or two to go as quietly as possible to New York He gave her the address of a boarding house where he could write her and where he would join her later He reasoned in this way That as Alice Murray was to impersonate Jennie Brice and Jennie Brice hiding from her husband she would naturally discard her name The name Bellows had been hers by a previous marriage and she might easily resume it Thus to establish his innocence he had not only the evidence of Howell and Bronson that the whole thing was a gigantic hoax he had the evidence of Howell that he had started Jennie Brice to Horner that Monday morning that she had reached Horner had there assumed an incognito as mister Pitman would say and had later disappeared from there maliciously concealing herself to work his undoing In all probability he would have gone free the richer by a hundred dollars for each week of his imprisonment but for two things the flood which had brought opportunity to his door had brought mister Holcombe to feed Peter the dog And the same flood which should have carried the headless body as far as Cairo or even farther on down the Mississippi had rejected it in an eddy below a clay bluff at Sewickley with its pitiful covering washed from the scar Well it is all over now mister Ladley is dead and Alice Murray and even Peter lies in the yard mister Reynolds made a small wooden cross over Peter s grave and carved Till we meet again on it I dare say the next flood will find it in Molly Maguire s kitchen mister Howell and Lida are married mister Howell inherited some money I believe and what with that and Lida declaring she would either marry him in a church or run off to Steubenville Ohio Alma had to consent I went to the wedding and stood near the door while Alma swept in in lavender chiffon and rose point lace She has not improved with age has Alma But Lida Lida under my mother s wedding veil with her eyes like stars seeing no one in the church in all that throng but the boy who waited at the end of the long church aisle I wanted to run out and claim her my own blood my more than child I sat down and covered my face And from the pew behind me some one leaned over and patted my shoulder Miss Bess old Isaac said gently Don t take on Miss Bess He came the next day and brought me some lilies from the bride s bouquet that she had sent me and a bottle of champagne from the wedding supper I had not tasted champagne for twenty years That is all of the story On summer afternoons sometimes when the house is hot I go to the park and sit I used to take Peter but now he is dead I like to see Lida s little boy the nurse knows me by sight and lets me talk to the child He can say Peter quite plainly But he does not call Alma Grandmother The nurse says she does not like it He calls her Nana Lida does not forget me Especially at flood times she always comes to see if I am comfortable The other day she brought me with apologies the chiffon gown her mother had worn at her wedding Alma had never worn it but once and now she was too stout for it I took it I am not proud and I should like Molly Maguire to see it mister Holcombe asked me last night to marry him He says he needs me and that I need him I am a lonely woman and getting old and I m tired of watching the gas meter and besides with Peter dead I need a man in the house all the time The flood district is none too orderly Besides when I have a wedding dress laid away and a bottle of good wine it seems a pity not to use them I think I shall do it THE END End of Project Gutenberg s The Case of Jennie Brice by Mary Roberts Rinehart END OF

the same number as the eBook s eBook number often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII compressed zipped HTML and others Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers Most people start at our Web
