duck pen And this pen was not far from where Sammie and Susie Littletail the rabbit children had their burrow and it was close to the trees where Johnnie and Billie Bushytail the squirrel brothers learned to jump from their nest Now I am going to tell you some stories about these ducks and what they did To begin with there was the mamma duck She was missus Wibblewobble a nice white duck being a cousin to missus Quack Quack who once rescued Billie and Johnnie Bushytail and Jennie Chipmunk from the desert island where they had been shipwrecked you remember Then there was the papa duck and of course his name was mister Wibblewobble Also there were the children ducks Jimmie Wibblewobble and his two sisters Lulu and Alice Lulu was a duckling who could throw a stone almost as well as could Jimmie but Alice was not so fond of doing this She would rather dress up and play keep house while Lulu wanted to be off having a good time with her brother But the three ducklings got along very nicely together just the same What s that Why were they named Wibblewobble Well because you see they did wibblewobble from side to side when they walked and so they had to be named Wibblewobble or things wouldn t have come out right So there Well the Wibblewobble family lived in a nice wooden house called a pen near a pond of water and their house had a door and two windows to it so you see they were quite well off In fact they were very stylish ducks and once Jimmie Wibblewobble even rode in an automobile but I can t tell you about that now because you see I am going to relate to you how Lulu was caught fast in the mud It happened one day when Jimmie and his two sisters were swimming about on the pond just like three white boats Let s see who can swim the fastest suddenly called the little boy duck We ll race over to the other side of the pond and he put his head down under the water to get a fine juicy bit of weed with some water cress sauce on it Oh no exclaimed Alice Wibblewobble it s not nice for girl ducks to race and she spread out her wings to see how they looked Yes it is said Lulu Come on Jimmie I ll race with you So off they started splashing the water with their yellow webbed feet throwing up a little spray which sparkled in the sunshine just like baby s eyes when you come close to her and she laughs at you so cunningly On they went faster and faster and faster Lulu and Jimmie while Alice remained behind to gaze in the water which was just like a looking glass you know Oh my yes but please don t try it unless the water is very very shallow You see Alice wanted to see if all her feathers were on straight and they were believe me as straight as straight can be Well of course Jimmie won the race being a very good swimmer but Lulu was close behind him and would have beaten only one of her legs got caught in a weed Now I call that too bad don t you For I was hoping all the while that Lulu would win But you never can tell what is going to happen in this world now can you No indeed Let s race back again proposed Lulu after she had rested Oh don t race any more spoke Alice swimming up just then Let s walk out on land and see if we can t find some nice corn meal I m sure it must be almost dinner time and I just love corn meal I know something better than that suddenly said a quivery quavery voice right beside the ducks and when they looked around who should be there but mister Goosey Gander the grandfather of all the ducks in the pen I know something better than corn meal little ones he said and he splashed his wings in the water What is it asked Lulu as quickly as you can shoot a marble into the ring and out again Is it gum drops No answered Grandfather Goosey Gander it is not gum drops It is better than that It is nice sweet roots and grasses that grow down under water and with that what do you think he did Why he stood right up on his head and reached his bill down beneath the pond and got some of the nicest grass that ever was There said the old gentleman duck poking up his head do as I did little ones So those three Wibblewobble children did and pretty soon Alice and Jimmie had as much as they could eat and raised their heads Then they saw that Lulu still had her bill down under the water She must be getting lots more than we did spoke Alice Yes indeed replied Jimmie I wonder how she can hold her breath so long Just then what should happen but that Lulu began to wave her feet in the air and she flapped her wings until the spray went up in a regular shower just like at Asbury Park Oh my goodness me sakes alive and three teaspoonsfull of corn meal with pepper in cried Grandfather Goosey Gander Lulu is stuck in the mud We must pull her out Quick That s just the way he said it And would you believe me Lulu was held fast in the mud by her dear little bill Oh how terribly frightened Jimmie and Alice were They squawked and they quacked and they tried to pull Lulu out but she was stuck too fast Then all the other ducks came swimming up to see what the trouble was and they tried to pull her out but they couldn t and all the while her feet were wiggling as fast as they could wiggle almost like Sammie Littletail s nose Then Grandfather Goosey Gander called out What ho Make way there I will save her And with that what do you think he did Why he dived right down under the water yes sir right down in the mud and he pushed and he pulled and he hauled and he splashed and he yanked and he rooted and he twisted and he turned and he shoved and then all alone brave old grandfather that he was he got Lulu up from the mud where she had been stuck by her little bill And it was almost time too let me tell you for her breath was nearly gone But she soon got better and she never put her head so far down under water again Then all the ducks said Quack Quack Quack three times they were so glad and they swam around in a circle and the old rooster stood on the bank and crowed just as if he had done it all Oh how glad Papa and Mamma Wibblewobble were that Lulu was saved Now if you do not get your feet wet I shall tell you to morrow night how Jimmie rode in an automobile STORY II JIMMIE WIBBLEWOBBLE IN AN AUTO One day well it must have been about a week after Lulu Wibblewobble got caught in the mud she and Jimmie were out swimming around the pond Come on said Lulu let s go over and see missus Greenie the frog She always has some candied sweet flag root hidden away and perhaps she will give us some I don t believe there s any left spoke Jimmie for Bully the boy frog is so fond of it that he eats all he can get Well we ll go anyhow went on Lulu Just then she heard her mother calling Jimmie Lulu Where are you going We are going over to see missus Greenie replied Jimmie Wait for Alice called Mamma Wibblewobble She will go with you She is just putting a clean apron on Oh dear cried Lulu Why does Alice always make us wait while she puts on something clean I suppose answered Jimmie and he scratched his bill with his left leg I suppose it is because she wants to look nice Yes agreed Lulu with a sort of quacking sigh I suppose I ought to want to look nice too but somehow I don t ever I always seem to be in such a hurry Maybe you ll change some day suggested her brother Maybe spoke Lulu and just then Alice came swimming along looking just as nice and pretty as do some ducks which are in a picture They all went over to see missus Greenie the old lady frog who lived down on the bottom of the pond at the far edge by a big willow tree And honestly though I don t like to mention it for fear you ll think Bully a greedy little boy there wasn t a single bit of candied sweet flag root in the house No sir not a tiny weeny bit So missus Greenie gave the Wibblewobble children some nice snails which they liked very much and then they went on swimming around Jimmie was looking for Bully but the little boy frog had hopped off to see his cousin Now in a few minutes Jimmie is going to have an adventure and if you please I want you to listen very carefully so as not to miss it Well the three ducklings swam on thinking how nice it was on the water with the warm sun on their backs when they suddenly came to the end of the pond And who should be standing there but the man who owned the little puddle And more than that there was another man also standing there in the road and beside him was a queer thing with big fat wheels fatter than the fattest duck or goose you ever saw It was puffing away and some smoke and a funny smell came from it Of course you ve guessed it An automobile Now what do you think about that The ducks listened to what the men were saying for though the Wibblewobbles couldn t talk as the men did they could understand our language It s too bad said the man who owned the pond Can t you go any farther No said the man who had the automobile I can t You see my horn that I blow to tell people to get out of the way is broken I can t sound any warning and if I ran my machine I might hurt some one and I wouldn t do that for the world no not for two worlds if you were to offer them to me That is very kind of you very kind indeed I m sure went on the man who owned the pond I am glad to have met you and I wish I could help you I m afraid you can t answered the other I have to walk way down to Newark to get a new horn for my auto so I can blow it to warn people out of the way So he started to walk off and then what do you think happened Why Jimmie Wibblewobble got so excited that he gave a loud Quack Quack Oh so loud and clear As soon as the man who owned the auto heard it he cried out My gracious goodness What s that That replied the man who owned the pond is one of my ducks Doesn t he speak very loudly Then Jimmie just to show what he could do quacked again harder than before Oh extemporaneousness cried the auto man That is very fine quacking indeed I never heard better I have the greatest idea he added Would you be so kind as to lend me that little duck I will bring him safely back to you and not harm him in the least What will you do with him asked the man who owned the pond I will take him on the seat beside me replied the other and maybe he will go quack quack whenever a person gets in the way of my auto Then they will not be run over Why this little duck will be as good as an auto horn Will you let me take him I guess so answered the other man But please do not frighten him as he is very little The man who owned the auto said he would be careful and he went over to where Jimmie was and picked him right up Now I should have thought that Jimmie would have been frightened but he wasn t a bit no would you believe me not a bit So the man took him and put him on the seat and started off in the auto Jimmie knew exactly what to do Every time he came to a crossing he quack quacked as loudly as he could without being told and he did the same thing whenever he saw a person in the way of the big machine Oh what a fine ride he had in the auto and how proud he was Not too proud you know but just proud enough Well as true as I m telling you if Jimmie wasn t as good an auto horn as one could wish Not a single accident happened when he was on the seat quack quacking away and when the man went to a store and got his regular horn with the rubber handle to it why he brought Jimmie right back to the pond Now wasn t that quite an adventure All the other ducks thought so anyhow To morrow night if you do not slam the door you shall hear about Alice Wibblewobble s new bonnet STORY III ALICE WIBBLEWOBBLE S NEW BONNET When the Wibblewobble family came back to their house after a swim around the pond one bright sunny afternoon and when the grass on the edges of the water was as green as it could be Mamma Wibblewobble looked at her children who were walking ahead of her Jimmie and Lulu were throwing stones along the path but Alice who was as ladylike a little duck as one could wish would not throw pebbles even to say nothing of stones I declare exclaimed Mamma Wibblewobble those girls will have to have new bonnets I must see to it at once Very well answered Papa Wibblewobble I will get them when I come home to morrow I met missus Gooseyoosy this morning and she said they had a special sale of hats at the store by the barnyard gate A man duck cannot get bonnets for Alice and Lulu declared missus Wibblewobble You would not know what to pick out It is bad enough to have you get Jimmie s hats and shoes but you would never know how to buy bonnets for the girls Very well answered Papa Wibblewobble then I will let you do the buying I think a green colored bonnet would be nice for Alice Green With her complexion cried his wife Never It must be blue blue for Alice and a brown one for Lulu Give me the money and I will start out shopping to morrow So Mamma Wibblewobble started out the next day taking Alice and Lulu with her while Jimmie stayed home and played cross tag with Bully the frog and Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy who had a day s vacation They had lots of fun and once Jimmie nearly fell down a great big but there I started to tell you about Alice Wibblewobble s bonnet and I must not get off the track That story about Jimmie will do for another time Well you should have seen the numbers and numbers of duck bonnets that missus Wibblewobble looked at before she was satisfied with two for the girls Not that Alice and Lulu were hard to please Oh my no But their mamma wanted them to look just right and you know it is quite difficult to fit a bonnet on a duck and make it look like anything The milliner said so herself and she ought to know But at last the two duck girls both had very fine bonnets indeed as fine as mustard seeds which are very very fine Alice had a nice blue one and Lulu a brown one Well would you ever imagine it Something is going to happen to Alice s bonnet and very soon too Just be patient and you shall hear Now children said missus Wibblewobble when they had reached the pen where they lived you may go out and swim around a bit with your new bonnets on until your papa comes home I want him to see how well they fit you for I think I have very good taste when it comes to bonnets Oh I don t want to wear my new one spoke Lulu I will put on my old one and go and play with Jimmie and Bully the frog So she did but Alice who was very fond of nice clothes went for a swim on the pond At first she paddled around gazing down in the water which was just like the looking glass some men shave by and she thought Oh what a lovely bonnet I have How fine I shall look when I go for a walk on Sunday And just then really I m not exaggerating a bit If it didn t begin to rain Now of course rain couldn t hurt Alice any for she was a duck and was used to the water but she knew it would spoil her new bonnet So she took it off and laid it under a big burdock plant leaf near the pond to keep the flowers and ribbons dry I wish it would stop raining said Alice after a while I want to go home but the big drops kept on falling and she had to remain near her bonnet for fear something would happen to it Then in a little while oh maybe half an hour or so all at once as quick as a wink along came Mooleyooly the big brown cow Mooleyooly walked up to the burdock leaf under which was the new bonnet and Mooleyooly saw the pretty yellow flowers on it and she saw the blue flowers on it and she saw the red flowers on it Then Mooleyooly said as she licked her lips with her red tongue What have we here It looks very nice It is nice answered Alice proudly for she was glad to have some one even a cow admire her bonnet It looks just like the green meadow where I live went on Mooleyooly with buttercups and daisies and ragged sailor flowers and some red poppies growing in it Oh very fine indeed Why those flowers are real exclaimed the cow looking carefully at the new bonnet under the big leaf Of course cried Alice certainly they are real Better and better went on Mooleyooly Most delightful I am sure Then oh how sorry I feel that I have to tell it then if that brown cow didn t start right in and eat up Alice s new bonnet Yes sir every single bit down to a bunch of green grass that looked so pretty on it She ate it all up at one mouthful before Alice could cry out stop or halt or cease or any words like that Well of course Alice cried Wouldn t you boys and girls I mean of course you girls have done the same Well I guess so Then when the cow saw how sorry Alice felt Mooleyooly felt badly too and she cried great big tears until you would have thought it was raining harder then ever Then being a good cow Mooleyooly promised to get Alice a new bonnet which she did made of the finest straw in the stable So Alice had a hat for Sunday after all even if one was eaten up by mistake Well pretty soon it stopped raining and Alice went home with the bonnet the cow gave her and Mamma Wibblewobble said it was even better than the one she had bought Now wasn t that rather odd I thought so myself To morrow night if you do not sneeze I hope to have the pleasure of telling you how Jimmie Wibblewobble almost fell over the waterfall but don t let that alarm you the least bit for he was saved in a most wonderful way STORY IV 
8753-297942-0000	train-other-500	JIMMIE AND THE WATERFALL It was such a nice day that mister and missus Wibblewobble decided to go visiting as they had an invitation to call on missus Greenie the frog lady who lived at the end of the pond
8753-297942-0001	train-other-500	So the two ducks after seeing that the pen was in order and the windows nice and clean in case any company should call on them while they were out started off swimming very slowly for they had their best clothes on and did not want to splash water on them
8753-297942-0002	train-other-500	Now I hope you children will be good called Mamma Wibblewobble to Jimmie and Lulu and Alice Don t get into any mischief and we ll be back at supper time We ll be good promised Alice
8753-297942-0003	train-other-500	but Jimmie and Lulu didn t say anything though of course they meant to be good also Only sometimes you know how it is just when you want to be good and make no trouble something is sure to happen that is
none	none	 most always 
8753-297942-0004	train-other-500	Well that s the way it was this time The papa and mamma ducks hadn t been gone more than half an hour before Jimmie thought of something to do Of course he didn t know it was mischief but it was all the same It happened
8753-297942-0005	train-other-500	that at one end of the pond where the ducks lived there was a waterfall That is the water ran from the pond and fell over a high wall of stones upon some more stones down below and made a lot of foam and a rushing gurgling noise that was very cool in summer
8753-297942-0006	train-other-500	making you think of ice cream and all nice things like that And besides this there was near the waterfall a big mill with a wheel that went around and around to grind the corn and grain
8753-297942-0007	train-other-500	Well Jimmie s papa and mamma hadn t been gone more than half an hour before the little boy duck called to Lulu and Alice Let s see how near we can go to the waterfall he said
none	none	 Now this was a very dangerous thing to do because there was a strong and swift current at the fall and any one who went too near it might be carried over 
8753-297942-0008	train-other-500	mister and missus Wibblewobble knew this and many times had told their children to keep away But you see Jimmie forgot or else didn t want to remember so he called to his sisters telling them to see how near they could go
8753-297942-0009	train-other-500	I ll not spoke Alice And you hadn t better either Jimmie You know what mamma said Oh well the water s low now replied Jimmie I don t believe there s any danger Come on Lulu All right said Lulu
8753-297942-0010	train-other-500	So she and Jimmie started to swim as close as they could to the waterfall
none	none	 But Alice stayed near shore 
8753-297942-0011	train-other-500	and who should come along but Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat nurse who was out for a walk She told Alice about Sammie and Susie Littletail and said the little rabbit children were well
8753-297942-0012	train-other-500	Now all this while Jimmie and Lulu were swimming nearer and nearer to the waterfall They could hear the water splashing on the rocks below and they liked to listen to it
none	none	 We had better stop called Lulu after a while 
8753-297942-0013	train-other-500	No I m going closer declared Jimmie There is no danger come on
none	none	 But just then Lulu felt something pulling her down toward where the big wheel went around and around and she got frightened 
8753-297942-0014	train-other-500	Then she swam just as hard as she could toward shore
none	none	 and called to her brother Jimmie don t go any closer Come back But Jimmie was a boy duck and wanted to be brave so he answered 
8753-297942-0015	train-other-500	I m going just a little bit closer Now Lulu had a very hard time indeed getting to shore as the current was so strong but she finally managed it Jimmie however kept on swimming nearer and nearer to the falls
8753-297942-0016	train-other-500	Then all at once before you could stick a pin in a cushion what should take place but that the little boy duck felt himself being pulled along by the rushing water just as the soap floats along when you pull the plug out of the bathtub
none	none	 Oh how fast the water swept him along 
8753-297942-0017	train-other-500	Jimmie splashed and paddled with all his might and tried to swim ashore where Lulu was anxiously watching him but he couldn t seem to move
none	none	 There he was being carried along to the edge of the falls with the cruel sharp stones below 
8753-297942-0018	train-other-500	and the big millwheel going around and around Then Jimmie knew he was in great danger
none	none	 and he cried out Help Help Help three times as loudly as he could call 
8753-297942-0019	train-other-500	Lulu and Alice heard him and were much frightened They started to go to the aid of their brother but Grandfather Goosey Gander warned them not to But who will save Jimmie they cried I will try to answered the old gentleman duck
8753-297942-0020	train-other-500	So he got a rope and threw it to Jimmie but the rope wasn t long enough and the poor little boy duck kept getting closer and closer to the edge of the falls and the big millwheel Oh how hard he was swimming but the water was stronger than he was
8753-297942-0021	train-other-500	Get a board cried Bully the frog who came hopping along just then So the ducks and the geese got a board and threw it to Jimmie but it floated past him
none	none	 and he couldn t get upon it 
8753-297942-0022	train-other-500	Then it surely did look as if he were going to be carried right over the falls for he was being swept nearer and more near
8753-297942-0023	train-other-500	and he could hear the water making a terrible roaring splashing sound on the rocks You have no idea how scared Jimmie was and he wished he had never gone near the falls Then the other ducks got a long stick
8753-297942-0024	train-other-500	and Grandfather Goosey Gander held it out so the little boy duck could grasp it in his bill but the stick broke and every one said it was too bad Then just as Jimmie was almost to the edge of the falls if Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy didn t call out
8753-297942-0025	train-other-500	Stand aside everybody I am a good swimmer and I will save him
none	none	 Then what do you think happened 
8753-297942-0026	train-other-500	Why that good kind muskrat jumped right into the water
none	none	 and hurried to where Jimmie was She dived down and got hold of his yellow legs in her teeth 
8753-297942-0027	train-other-500	but she took hold very gently so as not to hurt him Then she was such a fine swimmer that she managed to get to shore towing and pulling Jimmie with her for the water could not hurt Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy no matter how hard the millwheel splashed
8753-297942-0028	train-other-500	So that is how Jimmie was saved from the waterfall and when his papa and mamma came home they were very glad of course and why shouldn t they be But all the same
8753-297942-0029	train-other-500	Lulu and Jimmie had to be punished for disobeying and going too near the falls when they had been told not to and their punishment was that they could not go in swimming for three days And if you ever were a duck
8753-297942-0030	train-other-500	you know that was very severe punishment indeed very severe But I m not going to say that Jimmie and Lulu didn t deserve it no indeed I m not not if you were to offer me an orange and a half and I m very fond of oranges very
8753-297942-0031	train-other-500	Well that s how things will sometimes happen in this world won t they do the best that you can But now I suppose you want to know what the story will be about to morrow night Well if I see a pink grasshopper
none	none	 I shall tell you about a visit the Wibblewobble children paid to poor sick Billie Bushytail STORY V A VISIT TO BILLIE BUSHTAIL You remember how Lulu and Jimmie had to be punished for disobeying their papa and mamma and going too near the waterfall I suppose They couldn t go in swimming for three days Well the three days were very nearly up that is there was just one day left so Lulu said Come on Jimmie we will go for a walk in the woods Don t you want to come too Alice Now of course Alice could go in the water if she wanted to for she was not punished as she had not gone near the waterfall but instead of going swimming alone she stayed with her brother and sister and I call that very kind of her So when Lulu asked her to take a walk in the woods Alice answered Of course I will go with you Who knows perhaps we may have an adventure For you see Alice was very romantic That is she always hoped something would happen that never had happened before and she was always hoping a fairy prince would come along and rescue her from some danger But up to this time nothing like this had ever occurred though those duck children are going to have a small adventure pretty soon I think All right spoke Jimmie let s take a walk and see what happens So they walked on through the woods which were very fine that day and they felt the nice warm brown earth on their yellow feet and it was almost as good as going in the water Pretty soon just after they had passed under a buttonball tree the ducklings heard a noise and who should run out from under a bush but little Sister Sallie You remember her I hope Sister Sallie who was named after Lolly pop Lally and who lived with Johnnie and Billie Bushytail Why Sister Sallie cried Lulu Wibblewobble where are you going this bright beautiful sunshiny day I m going for the doctor answered Sister Sallie Are you sick inquired Jimmie You don t look so No it s Billie Bushytail said the little girl squirrel He is quite ill and I am going for doctor Possum Billie has a fever and headache and he snuffles something terrible His papa and mamma are quite worried about him Isn t it terrible to be sick I don t know answered Jimmie for I was never sick I was once remarked Alice and it is not nice I do assure you Suppose we go call on Billie Bushytail Maybe we could cheer him up I think that would be lovely spoke Sister Sallie You go see him while I hurry for the doctor So the three Wibblewobble children walked on through the pleasant woods until they came to the place where the Bushytail family had moved Their home was now in a hollow stump close to the ground and there was a fallen tree leading up to it just like a plank over the brook so the ducks could easily walk up it They went right to the front door and Jimmie knocked with his strong yellow bill missus Bushytail opened the door and when she saw the little ducklings she said Oh my dears Do not come too near for we don t know what disease Billie may have I would not want you to catch it Oh we are not afraid spoke Jimmie But we will not come too near We were out walking in the woods and we met little Sister Sallie We came to call on Billie and cheer him up That is very kind of you said Mamma Bushytail The poor little fellow is quite miserable I put his feet in hot mustard water and gave him some Jamaica ginger and he is now in bed I fear he has the epizootic which is a very dreadful disease Oh I hope not exclaimed Alice kindly Perhaps he only has the pip which is not nearly so bad Perhaps answered Mamma Bushytail I have sent Johnnie for some quinine and that may help Billie May we see him asked Lulu Perhaps we can cheer him up To be sure you may see him replied Billie s mamma so she opened the door a little wider in order that the ducklings might look in the hollow stumphouse for of course they could not enter as it was too small They saw Billie all wrapped up in blankets in bed and he looked quite ill But he seemed happy in spite of that for the hot mustard footbath had helped him some He smiled when he saw Jimmie and Lulu and Alice Then Jimmie gave missus Bushytail some nice acorns he had picked up in the woods and had carried under his wing They are for Billie said Jimmie Next Lulu gave the sick squirrel boy some nice sweet grass she had gathered on the edge of the pond and Alice had some lovely sugared sweet flag root which is very good in case of sickness Then Billie felt much better and after a while Jimmie said Let s sing a funny little song for Billie So Jimmie Alice and Lulu sang this little verse to cheer up poor sick Billie and if you can get a good singer to sing it for you it doesn t sound at all bad I assure you Don t mind if you have to take stuff from a spoon Tis better than having to climb to the moon You might make a stumble or else have a tumble And then you would fall pretty soon We came little Billie to make you feel better At first we were going to write you a letter But we had no ink dear so that s why we came here We re dry now but we ll soon be wetter Then Billie laughed right out loud he felt so much better and he ate some acorns and the sweet flag root nibbling at it with his sharp teeth Then a scratching sound was heard on the stump and who should come up it but Sister Sallie with doctor Possum The doctor said He and he said Hum and he said Ahem Then he felt Billie s pulse and made him put out his tongue Then doctor Possum exclaimed Why this little squirrel isn t sick at all No sir Not at all My goodness me no indeed Why the very idea Sick I guess not But missus Bushytail said her little boy had been very ill and doctor Possum answered Well if he was sick these little ducks have cured him They are just as good at doctoring as I am yes indeed and a thermometer or two besides There is no need for me It was the funny little song that cured me said Billie Then he got out of bed and began frisking around the doctor went home and the little squirrel was all well After a while Jimmie Lulu and Alice had to leave and they went home feeling very happy for the good they had done to Billie Bushytail for it always makes you feel happy to help some one Now if you promise not to whisper in school next week you shall hear to morrow night how Jimmie tried to become a flying machine Illustration STORY VI JIMMIE AS A FLYING MACHINE One day I think it must have been about three and a half quacks past cornmeal time there was a great commotion in the yard and around the pond where Jimmie Wibblewobble and his two sisters and his papa and mamma lived There was a great fluttering in the air and something colored in beautiful tints flew down and settled on the water with a little splash My goodness what is that asked Alice Wibblewobble who was easily frightened At first no one knew for though the creature was shaped just like a duck it was not colored like any duck Jimmie had even seen It was gold and bronze and green with little patches of red and blue here and there and was a most beautiful creature Maybe that is a fairy suggested Lulu who sometimes read fairy stories Oh if it only might be one and could tell me where the fairy prince is exclaimed Alice with a sigh Nonsense cried Jimmie who was just going off to see his friend Bully the frog Stuff and nonsense That s what I say too called out the strange creature Nonsense I m not a fairy at all I m a duck like yourselves only I am a wild duck Then its wings beat the air and water and the wild duck arose and flew right over the pond and back again as quickly as could be My goodness How do you do that asked Jimmie who never could fly more than a few feet Why answered the wild duck I just did it that s all Snippery snappery snails cried Jimmie you re just like a flying machine that my papa read about in the paper Well somewhat like one perhaps admitted the wild duck I can fly a long distance Did you ever try No answered Jimmie I never did Perhaps you would like to try now suggested the other I will stay here a little while and show you It is very easy You can just as well become a flying machine as not Come I will fly up on the fence You come up here too and when I say Go why start off and who knows perhaps you will do as well as I Don t be afraid Of course I ll try said Jimmie very bravely for he was always wanting to try new things So will I cried Lulu I want to fly too Oh you had better be careful warned Alice who was a very cautious duckling never getting into danger if she could help it Oh we ll be careful but we are going to become flying machines just the same said Jimmie So the wild duck flew up on the fence which was at one edge of the pond and oh how beautiful he looked with the sun shining on his finely colored feathers Jimmie had quite a struggle to get on the top rail of the fence and so did Lulu but they finally managed it and just as they stood beside the wild duck who should come along but Grandfather Goosey Gander He asked the two Wibblewobble children what they were going to do and when Jimmie said they were going to learn to become flying machines the old duck said Humph just as quickly as he could If you had such hard work getting to the top of the fence how do you think you can fly across the pond he asked and then he sneezed three times for he was catching cold Oh we will do it answered Jimmie for of course you see he really thought he could But something is going to happen just as sure as you can add up two and three and make five out of them Are you all ready asked the wild duck of Jimmie and Lulu as they stood beside him balanced on the fence rail Yes replied Jimmie trying to stop his heart from beating so rapidly we are ready mister Wild Duck You fly and we will fly also Watch me carefully said the beautiful creature and do exactly as I do They were just about to fly when the old rooster who had been picking up corn down the road come running up Hold on he cried I can fly as good as that wild duck Wait for me and we will have a race So they waited until the old rooster got up on the fence rail too Then the wild duck counted One to begin with two for a show three to make ready and four to go Then he flapped his wings gave a loud squawk squawk and sailed over that pond as nice as you please Well of course I ve got to tell exactly what happened or it wouldn t be fair Jimmie tried to fly but I wish you could have seen him He only went a little way and then because his body was too heavy for his wings or because his wings were too light for his body he came flopping right down to the ground ker thump and he hurt his nose considerably let me tell you for considerably is quite a lot Well poor Lulu if she didn t fall too Yes sir she turned a somersault right in the air before all those watching ducks and she too came down ker flimmax ker flump and she hurt her left hand wing Then she cried once Boo hoo just like that Then she stopped Jimmie didn t cry at all if you ll believe me no sir not a mite but he felt badly all the same And then that rooster Oh dear me how foolish some roosters are anyhow now aren t they really Well he started off all right but just then the wind got in the wrong place and it turned him upside down Now no rooster can fly upside down no matter what else he can do so that one came flippity flop down into the water ker splash ker sposh and one more besides Maybe he didn t feel mortified But that wild duck Oh my goodness me How he did fly Around and around and around that pond he went never touching the water once Then he came to where Jimmie and Lulu were and he told them how sorry he felt for them before he flew away to a far far distant land where only wild ducks live Then Grandfather Goosey Gander went up to those two Wibblewobble children and so did Alice to lend Lulu her handkerchief And Grandfather Goosey said It is better for tame ducks to stay on the water or on land They were not made for flying So that was the end of Jimmie trying to become an air ship To morrow night you may hear about Lulu and the gold fish that is if the lemon squeezer doesn t pinch me STORY VII LULU AND THE GOLD FISH Well here we are again after a rest over night and all ready for another story I suppose Let me see it was to be about the fairy prince and Alice Wibblewobble no hold on there I m wrong I know it Lulu and the gold fish to be sure Well here we go Now of course I could make this about the fairy prince in fact he has something to do with this story but as the gold fish has more I put her name at the top Lulu Wibblewobble the little duck girl who could throw stones almost as straight as a boy was swimming around the pond near the pen where she lived It was a nice warm sunshiny day and Lulu wanted to do something but she didn t just know what Jimmie her brother was off playing with Bully the frog and Alice her sister was straightening out her feathers in the back parlor bedroom where a piece of tin could be used for a looking glass All at once Lulu s mamma called to her Lulu I want you to go to the store to get some acorn meal and a yeast cake I am going to set bread to night Hurry now that s a good girl All right mamma answered Lulu and she steered herself around just like a motorboat in the water and started for the store paddling as hard as she could She had not gone very far with the little ripples and waves chasing each other across the pond before she saw something swimming close beside her Lulu looked down and what do you think she saw Well you might guess but then again you might not so I ll tell you It was a gold fish Oh it was such a beautiful gold fish with red and silvery spots and streaks and a long feathery tail that looked like lace in the water Hello exclaimed Lulu I didn t know you lived here Oh yes answered the fish I have lived here for some time but you see during the cold weather I stay down in the mud However as it is now spring I have come up and I am going to play around all summer That s nice remarked Lulu What s your name My name is Fannie Tail replied the fish You see I got that name because my tail is shaped like a fan but most persons just call me Fan Tail You may if you like All right agreed Lulu I will My name is Lulu but you may call me Lu if you wish Good answered the fish turning a double somersault in the water and wiggling her right fin as if trying to shake hands Now we are well acquainted And may I ask where you are going So Lulu told the fish girl about having to go to the store and Fan seemed quite pleased to hear it The two swam on together for some distance the fish just under the water and Lulu on top Pretty soon Lulu asked Fan where she was going and the gold fish replied I am going to the drug store for some sweet flag root for the fairy prince and once more the fish girl turned a double somersault and opened her mouth wide for she had a cold in her head in consequence of being so wet But as it is very difficult to write a story and make a gold fish talk as if she had a cold in the head I have decided to make Fan talk just ordinarily You never would have known anything about the cold if I hadn t mentioned it so it s just as well Pardon me said Lulu just like a telephone girl but did I understand you to say you were going for some sweet flag root for the fairy prince Yes answered Fan Tail that s what I said But cried Lulu A fairy prince I never knew there were fairies in this pond Neither did lots of other persons replied Fan It s supposed to be a secret but I ll tell you And another thing There is something strange about this fairy prince Do you promise never to tell Yes answered Lulu Cross my heart I ll never tell and she lifted one leg out of the water and crossed her heart as well as she could Then said the gold fish in a whisper If you will come with me I will show you the fairy prince That is after I go to the drug store for him But mind it s a great secret So the two swam on together but Lulu felt sad And the reason she felt sad was this Her sister Alice who was very romantic that is she continually wanted things to happen that never could happen Alice always had wished to see a fairy prince Now unless Fan would let Lulu tell the secret Alice would never see a prince And to think he was right in the same pond with her Oh it s dreadful to have a secret you can t tell even to your own sister I think Lulu sighed so that she made quite a wave in the pond and when the fish saw this she knew something was the matter So she asked Lulu what it was and Lulu told her how Alice was just crazy to see a fairy prince and had been dreaming of one for ever and ever so long And I ve promised not to tell ended Lulu Poor Alice How disappointed she will be not to see a real live fairy Well perhaps it is too bad admitted Fan Tail and she sneezed so hard that the water flew up in a spray just like a fountain Perhaps I shall let you off from your promise the gold fish went on Yes I think you may bring Alice to see the fairy prince And Jimmie Jimmie s my brother I know he would love to see him too May he come Yes you may bring Jimmie also But mind I don t want you to be disappointed Most fairy princes are disappointing so don t say I didn t warn you Oh that will be all right spoke Lulu now quite happy again May I bring them this afternoon Oh I suppose so but no one else mind You see the fairy prince is rather bashful So Lulu promised she would bring no one else and she hurried to the store and back again Fan Tail the gold fish went to the drug store for the sweet flag root for the fairy prince and on the way she stubbed her nose against a stone which made her cold in the head worse than ever but of course we have nothing to do with that except to feel sorry for her When Lulu got home she was so excited she dropped the yeast cake in the pond and it would have gotten all wet only it was wrapped in tin foil Then she told Alice and Jimmie about the fairy prince she was going to see but as this story is too long already I must stop and in case the postman does not blow his whistle too loud and scary I shall have the pleasure to morrow night of telling you about the fairy prince And I hope you won t be disappointed STORY VIII 
8753-297946-0000	train-other-500	WHO THE FAIRY PRINCE WAS Mamma and Papa Wibblewobble were sitting in front of the duck pen talking with Grandfather Goosey Gander and the big rooster
8753-297946-0001	train-other-500	They were so busily engaged in conversation about the best way to serve cold corn meal mixed with water that when Lulu asked her parents if she and Jimmie and Alice could go for a swim missus Wibblewobble said Yes my dear
8753-297946-0002	train-other-500	but be careful you don t get wet Now wasn t that a funny thing for a duck mamma to say to her little duck girl But Mamma Wibblewobble was absent minded so we must excuse her You see she thought Lulu wanted to go for a walk in the woods
8753-297946-0003	train-other-500	Well it didn t much matter but I thought I would speak about it Can we go asked Jimmie when Lulu came back Yes she answered Hurry now for we are going to see the fairy prince as the gold fish promised
none	none	 Oh I m so excited I can hardly wait exclaimed Alice who was quite romantic as 
8753-297946-0004	train-other-500	I have explained Am I swimming straight Lulu I wouldn t for all the world have a fairy prince see me swimming crooked
none	none	 Oh don t be so fussy called out Jimmie 
8753-297946-0005	train-other-500	I wish Bully the frog was here He and I could have some fun
none	none	 Oh no cried Lulu 
8753-297946-0006	train-other-500	We are the only ones allowed to see the fairy prince It s a secret and he is quite bashful
none	none	 How are you going to find him asked Jimmie This is a large pond and it s going to be quite a task to locate the fairy prince 
8753-297946-0007	train-other-500	or even the gold fish Oh let s don t worry suggested Alice Worrying is one of the very worst things you can do especially when there is anything in it about a fairy Don t you know that fairies are especially made not to worry
8753-297946-0008	train-other-500	We will find our way somehow
none	none	 Either a golden ball will appear and roll on before us to show us the right direction or else a magical boat will suddenly come up in the water and we can ride right to the place Hu What do we want of a boat asked Jimmie 
8753-297946-0009	train-other-500	Can t we swim I don t believe much in this fairy business anyhow
none	none	 Then if you don t believe you never will see the fairy prince declared Alice 
8753-297946-0010	train-other-500	Only those who believe in fairies can see them I know for I ve read lots of fairy stories You see Alice was very much in earnest about this matter
none	none	 So the three children swam on together over the pond and the waters sparkled in the sun until you would have thought there were thousands of diamonds floating on top 
8753-297946-0011	train-other-500	The breeze blew just enough to make little ripples
none	none	 and altogether it was a very fine day They went on and on until pretty soon they were in a part of the pond they had never before visited Tall rushes grew on either side and the long meadow grass came right down to the edge of the water and trailed in it making little green caves in which to hide It was cool and quiet there and very lovely 
8753-297946-0012	train-other-500	The ducks liked it but still there was no sign of the fairy prince and the gold fish had not come to show them the way I don t believe we ll ever see any fairy prince said Jimmie Oh but the gold fish promised me
8753-297946-0013	train-other-500	spoke Lulu Hush cried Alice
none	none	 We must keep very quiet 
8753-297946-0014	train-other-500	We may meet the magical boat or the golden ball any minute And just then what should happen but that they heard a voice singing Yes sir just as true as I m telling you a voice singing
8753-297946-0015	train-other-500	right down under the water And this is what it sang in silvery tones just like the little bell that tinkles on pussy s neck The fairy prince lies deep and dark Waiting for the firefly s spark
8753-297946-0016	train-other-500	If you wish to see him now Follow me and make a bow And all at once who should appear but Fan Tail the gold fish
none	none	 She popped right out of the water 
8753-297946-0017	train-other-500	and when she saw the three duck children she asked Did you hear me singing Was that you asked Lulu It was replied Fan But why don t you do as I said
8753-297946-0018	train-other-500	If you wish to see the fairy prince you must bow He always wants people to do that So Lulu and Jimmie bowed once and Alice bowed three times
none	none	 and when they asked why she did that 
8753-297946-0019	train-other-500	she said you must always do things by threes where fairies are concerned Now follow me called the gold fish
none	none	 so they swam farther and farther up the part of the pond where they had never before been It got smaller and smaller until it was like a little brook with rushes bending over it 
8753-297946-0020	train-other-500	while the water whispered to the green stems
none	none	 The fairy prince lives in there suddenly said the gold fish poking her head up out of the water so she could speak more plainly 
8753-297946-0021	train-other-500	and she pointed with her fin to a hole in the bank He will come out presently Bow your prettiest Well you can just imagine how excited the duck children were Alice fairly trembled and even Jimmie was interested
8753-297946-0022	train-other-500	as they all bowed All ready now went on the gold fish Behold the fairy prince Behold Behold and she made a booming noise under the water
8753-297946-0023	train-other-500	just like the big bass drum when a man in the circus jumps over sixteen elephants and a quarter all at once
none	none	 Then all of a sudden oh maybe in a second and a little more 
8753-297946-0024	train-other-500	what should come out of that hole in the side of the bank just above the water what I say should come out of that hole now be careful take tight hold of the arms of the chair and hold your breaths so as not to be disappointed
8753-297946-0025	train-other-500	what should come out of the hole but a big brownish black spotted with red and yellow wrinkle legged hard shelled sharp beaked mud turtle There now
none	none	 At first the duck children were so frightened and surprised that they did not know what to do or say They had expected something so different 
8753-297946-0026	train-other-500	Did you Well I m awfully sorry but you know I m not responsible I merely tell what happens
none	none	 Why that isn t a fairy prince cried Jimmie speaking first Of course not added Lulu 
8753-297946-0027	train-other-500	Then the gold fish came quite close to them and whispered something
none	none	 Do you know said Fan Tail I have always had my doubts about it myself 
8753-297946-0028	train-other-500	He says he s the fairy prince insists on it in fact and he has it engraved on his visiting cards But I have my doubts only I don t dare say so for you see I work for him run errands and the like of that
8753-297946-0029	train-other-500	so far be it from me to say he is not a fairy prince I have however guided you to him Behold the fairy prince and she called the last real loudly for the mud turtle was looking right at her
none	none	 Then she added in a whisper But I have my doubts 
8753-297946-0030	train-other-500	Hush Oh hush please begged Alice Of course he is a fairy prince They are always disguised like that always appearing as something different from what they really are you know
none	none	 Sometimes they are toads and sometimes frogs and sometimes mud turtles I suppose though I never heard of any of the last kind 
8753-297946-0031	train-other-500	But of course he is a fairy prince Then she bowed again three times and said Fairy prince I salute thee Fairy nothing grunted Jimmie He is no more a fairy than I am Then the mud turtle heard them talking
none	none	 and he stuck his head farther out of the shell and he looked around 
8753-297946-0032	train-other-500	with his snaky neck and he came a little more out of the hole and said Of course I am the fairy prince Everybody knows that I ve been a fairy prince for ever and ever so long
8753-297946-0033	train-other-500	And then he sneezed just to show that though he was a fairy prince he was not proud
none	none	 What shall I do O fairy prince to change you back into your own rightful shape asked Alice 
8753-297946-0034	train-other-500	Tell me and I will do it at once Dost thou need three drops of magical water No answered the mud turtle
none	none	 not any at all thank you so much 
8753-297946-0035	train-other-500	I am a fairy prince but I am satisfied with my shape as I am and I do not want to change I have always been this way and I always want to stay so Please be so kind as to go away I want to eat my dinner
8753-297946-0036	train-other-500	So they hurried away for the gold fish whispered that the mud turtle was always cross when he ate
none	none	 Jimmie and Lulu were much disappointed 
8753-297946-0037	train-other-500	but Alice was not for she insisted that the mud turtle was really wonderful
none	none	 and was a fairy prince in disguise Now what do you think about it 
8753-297946-0038	train-other-500	I leave it to you But whatever you may think please don t be hasty Take plenty of time Perhaps you had better wait for the story to morrow night
none	none	 which if the cow bell doesn t ring and awaken the doll in the baby carriage will be about how Grandfather Goosey Gander got into trouble and out again STORY IX GRANDFATHER GOOSEY GANDER IN TROUBLE On their way home after having seen the mud turtle fairy prince Jimmie Lulu and Alice Wibblewobble of course talked of nothing else They wished the prince had done something wonderful instead of merely sending them away when he ate his dinner and they hoped he would perform a magical feat another time He really did as I shall tell you about later if I do not forget it The gold fish swam a little way back with the duck children as she said the prince always liked to be alone when he ate Well how did you like him asked Fan Tail of the ducks Not very much replied Lulu I never did care for mud turtles Nor I added Jimmie I don t believe he was really a mud turtle at all declared Alice He was a real truly fairy prince and he only looked like a mud turtle because we did not have the right kind of eyes with which to see him or else because we had no faith in him It is always so in fairy stories You must believe or you can t see the beautiful things Well I d rather have some snails to eat said Jimmie You don t care how they look it s how they taste I m never going to bother with fairies again It was about three days after this that Jimmie and Lulu were walking in the deep green woods under the trees picking tender leaves and roots to eat They were hoping they might meet Johnnie and Billie Bushytail the squirrels whom they had not seen for some time Alice stayed home to curl her feathers All at once as they were walking along the little boy and girl duck heard a funny noise What s that cried Jimmie I don t know answered Lulu It sounds like some one calling And sure enough it was As they stopped to listen they could hear some one crying Help Help Oh help Let s go and see who it is suggested Jimmie Maybe it s a dog or a bad rat or a fox objected Lulu No said her brother they would never call for help Come on Illustration So they walked on looking this way and that to see what they could see on and on through the woods until just as they came from behind a big oak tree what should they catch sight of but poor Grandfather Goosey Gander caught fast in the middle of a pile of brush Oh dear me Oh my goodness me sakes alive Oh floppy floppy floppy Oh a bag of salt and some corn meal cried the poor old gentleman duck I am in a terrible state Help me Then Lulu and Jimmie ran right up to him and asked him what was the matter Oh dear he said I really can t say I ve lost my glasses and I can t see very well All I know is that I was walking in the woods thinking what a nice day it was when all of a sudden in about a quack and a half I found myself caught fast And the worst part of it is that I can t get loose Let me take a look said Jimmie So he went quite close and looked and he saw that Grandfather Goosey Gander s right leg was held in between two sticks The old gentleman duck was in great pain Is my leg broken he asked Jimmie No answered the little boy duck but some of the skin is scraped off I knew it cried Grandfather Goosey Gander Now I won t be able to go fishing next week Oh I do seem to have the worst luck don t I We will get you out Lulu said to him and then she and her brother went to the aid of the poor old duck They pushed this way and that way and they pulled that way and this way and they lifted up on the pieces of sticks and they pushed down on them but it was no use Poor Grandfather Goosey Gander was stuck fast there and I think it was a shame but it couldn t be helped Oh my no and a bit of peppermint candy besides Well I guess I will have to stay here and die said the discouraged old duck and he felt so badly that he wept Lulu and Jimmie cried also they felt so sorry The three of them cried and their tears were so many that if they had cried long enough there would have been quite a pond there and they could have gone in swimming That is of course all but Grandfather Goosey Gander and he couldn t swim for he was held fast But they didn t weep long enough Let s try once more said Lulu after a while and then she and Jimmie tried harder than ever to get grandfather s leg out But they couldn t If I only had a saw cried Jimmie I could get him loose Ha perhaps I can help you suddenly exclaimed a voice Then as quickly as you can break an egg by dropping it on the floor only of course you must not do it without permission who should appear but Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat She was out walking with Sammie and Susie Littletail Oh somebody do please help me cried Grandfather Goosey Gander I ve lost my glasses my leg is caught and I have a pain in my back Oh oh oh I ll gnaw through those sticks in a jiffy cried Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy for a jiffy is very quick time indeed Oh yes and a broken down couch besides So telling Sammie and Susie Littletail to stand back and calling to Jimmie and Lulu to remain with them the muskrat nurse set to work to free Grandfather Goosey Gander Her teeth were like the chisels the carpenter uses and in a few seconds the old duck s leg was free Oh how glad he was and how thankful to Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy Of course the duck and rabbit children also were glad Then Jane gnawed out a little crutch for grandfather to walk with as he was a trifle lame and what do you think Why Susie Littletail found his glasses for him and Sammie and Jimmie rubbed his back so nicely that the pain all went out of that Now I call that doing something don t you Well Grandfather Goosey Gander started for home and Jimmie and Lulu asked Sammie and Susie to come and play with them Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy said they might and they had a fine time under the trees in the woods playing tag of all kinds cross tag wood tag dirt tag leaf tag stump tag and a new kind called acorn tag which I will explain about later Then the bunny children went home with their nurse and Jimmie and Lulu also went home and about two days after that a very funny thing happened What it was you shall hear to morrow night if the trolley car doesn t get off the track but I ll let you know this much it s going to be about the rooster trying to swim STORY X 
8753-297948-0000	train-other-500	THE ROOSTER TRIES TO SWIM Grandfather Goosey Gander was quite lame the next day from having been caught in the brush pile and could not go very far away from the duck pen
8753-297948-0001	train-other-500	He did manage to hobble around on the crutch which Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy made for him and he sat in a sunny corner reading the newspaper with his glasses which Susie Littletail found He was reading away as Alice Lulu and Jimmie Wibblewobble
8753-297948-0002	train-other-500	were playing about on the edge of the pond and the little duck children made so much noise that the old grandfather could not understand what was in the papers Can t you children play something quiet
8753-297948-0003	train-other-500	he asked for Papa and Mamma Wibblewobble had gone visiting and Grandfather Goosey Gander was left to mind the house Play some nice easy game he suggested Let s play acorn tag said Lulu All right you re it answered Jimmie
8753-297948-0004	train-other-500	So they each took an acorn which they found in the woods and put it in their bills Then Lulu had to chase after Jimmie and Alice and when she touched either one of them with her wing she had to call out
8753-297948-0005	train-other-500	You can t run a little bit I ve tagged you and now you re it Yes that s what she had to call and she had to do it without letting the acorn fall out of her bill Now if you think that s a very easy thing to do
8753-297948-0006	train-other-500	just you try it that s all Lulu didn t have much trouble putting her wing on Jimmie or Alice but every time she tried to call out the little verse the acorn would roll out of her bill
none	none	 and she d have to start all over again or it wouldn t have been fair So it was some time before she got over being it 
8753-297948-0007	train-other-500	and then it was Jimmie s turn Well they played acorn tag for quite a while and when they got tired of that they all went in swimming They swam around in circles and criss crossed and went in squares and in triangles and all sorts of queer figures
8753-297948-0008	train-other-500	including eight nine ten which are very difficult figures indeed for little ducks While they were swimming away having lots of fun and far enough off so that Grandfather Goosey Gander could read his paper in peace
8753-297948-0009	train-other-500	who should come down to the edge of the pond but the rooster His name was mister Cock A Doodle and he was very proud He walked right down to the edge of the water and looked at the ducks
8753-297948-0010	train-other-500	Then he crowed as loud as he could and flapped his wings just as if he were saying There I d like to see any of you do that Ha Hum Oh my yes indeed How do you do mister Cock A Doodle asked Jimmie
8753-297948-0011	train-other-500	Ahem I am pretty well my young friend replied the rooster And how may you happen to be to day And how are your sisters Lulu and Alice Wibblewobble
none	none	 We are very well 
8753-297948-0012	train-other-500	answered Lulu and Alice and Lulu went on Don t you wish you could swim mister Doodle I can said the rooster and he strutted back and forth at the edge of the pond Certainly I can swim What put the notion into your heads that I can t
8753-297948-0013	train-other-500	We never saw you spoke Jimmie Ahem Perhaps not You never saw me stand on one foot and jump over a barrel but that doesn t prove that I can t do it replied mister Doodle I can swim if I choose I have never cared to that s all
8753-297948-0014	train-other-500	Try now suggested Lulu for she didn t believe that rooster could swim no matter what he said Oh the water is too cold to go swimming now said mister Doodle I never swim in cold water
8753-297948-0015	train-other-500	Why it s as warm as warm can be declared Alice and she splashed a few drops upon the rooster so he could feel it Well er ahem The wind is blowing too much said the rooster when he felt the nice warm water Why it doesn t blow at all answered Jimmie
8753-297948-0016	train-other-500	Well I haven t my swimming shoes on objected mister Cock A Doodle I can t swim without them You ducks have pieces of skin between your toes so the water won t slip through but I haven t my webbed feet on
none	none	 Oh that is very easily fixed said Lulu We will take some pieces of cloth and tie them over your claws to make them like ours 
8753-297948-0017	train-other-500	Do you think you could swim then Yes answered the rooster I think I could You see he had no more excuses to make Oh wasn t he a tricky old rooster though eh So Lulu and Jimmie got some bits of cloth
8753-297948-0018	train-other-500	and with long pieces of ribbon grass they bound the cloth on the rooster s claws so his feet looked something like a duck s Now come on and we ll have a swimming race suggested Jimmie
none	none	 Walk right down into the water as we do 
8753-297948-0019	train-other-500	It won t hurt you the least bit mister Doodle
none	none	 Pooh Do you think I m afraid inquired mister Doodle and he actually did walk right into the water while all the ducks and chickens and geese looked on in wonder for they had never seen the rooster swim and didn t believe he could Oh but mister Doodle was proud He even tried to crow as he stepped into the water but as he wasn t used to it it made his breath feel just as if it were choking him when he tried to swallow Yes he tried to crow but all the noise he could make was a sort of a gasp and a sigh and a cough and a splutter and a sneeze and choke and a whimper Ha Aha Ahem Ha Ha Ho Ho I will now swim cried the rooster and then the water got so deep that he couldn t wade any more and he had to float He struck out with his feet and tried to paddle just as he saw Lulu and Alice and Jimmie doing but a very funny thing happened The rooster went right around in a circle 
8753-297948-0020	train-other-500	for he only used one leg at a time Then he got dizzy and went around the other way Then he had to stop Next he flapped his wings and splashed the water all over Say I wish you could have seen him It was as good as a circus
8753-297948-0021	train-other-500	He got his tail all wet and his back got all wet and as his feathers weren t the kind that water runs off from he was soon as soaked as your umbrella ever was That made him heavy and he began to sink Oh how he splashed and spluttered around in that pond
8753-297948-0022	train-other-500	He couldn t swim any more than my typewriter can
none	none	 and all at once what do you suppose happened 
8753-297948-0023	train-other-500	Why he felt himself sinking more and more and more Oh it was terrible Save me Oh save me mister Doodle cried I am going down Help me please Help Help Help
8753-297948-0024	train-other-500	Then the duck children felt sorry and swam to him as fast as they could Each one took hold of that poor rooster
none	none	 Lulu and Alice by a wing and Jimmie by the rooster s tail and they towed him to shore Oh but he was a sorry looking sight 
8753-297948-0025	train-other-500	He couldn t even crow nor flap his wings I thought you said you could swim spoke Jimmie Hush begged Alice who was very kind hearted Don t be casting up Don t make him feel bad
none	none	 Oh I feel bad enough without that said mister Doodle sighing 
8753-297948-0026	train-other-500	I guess the water wasn t right for swimming to day and with that he walked off and hid himself in some leaves to get dry for he hadn t any towels at his house
none	none	 But the Wibblewobble children kept on swimming for they knew how and now let me see well how about a story of an enchanted castle for to morrow night eh that is if the scissors don t cut up too much STORY XI ALICE WIBBLEWOBBLE S ENCHANTED CASTLE Alice Wibblewobble had made up her mind to find out more about the fairy prince She couldn t believe he was only a mud turtle She felt sure he was merely in that form until some one came along pronounced the magical words or sprinkled the magical water on him or did something else to change him back again I think I will have another talk with him she said Perhaps if I go all alone he will tell me what to do Oh wouldn t it be perfectly lovely if I could change him into a king with a golden diamond ruby crown Yes I certainly shall go So Alice swam off up the pond in the direction the gold fish had once led Lulu and Jimmie and her Well Alice went on and on and on for ever so long but she couldn t seem to find the place where the mud turtle fairy prince lived She saw the green rushes hanging over the water s edge she saw the bright ripples just like diamonds that might be in a king s crown and she heard the birds singing but there was no mud hole where the fairy prince lived Oh dear exclaimed Alice I m afraid I m lost What Lost in this beautiful place asked a voice just above her head and looking up Alice saw a dear little yellow bird sitting on a tree over the water Yes said Alice and a tear came into her eye and ran down her yellow bill I am lost I can t find the fairy prince Oh that is too bad said the little yellow bird I don t just know what a fairy prince is but it must be dreadful not to be able to find one when you want to Do not feel badly however I can take you to an enchanted castle if that will do Oh can you cried Alice That will be lovely I had almost as soon see an enchanted castle as a fairy prince Is it a really truly one Oh yes answered the bird It certainly is It is the most beautiful place in all the world Come and I will show you Then Alice felt delighted and she walked out of the water and waddled along on the land The bird flew along going slowly so as not to get ahead of Alice On and on they went over green fields and through the woods until pretty soon they came to a place where the bird stopped We are near the enchanted castle he said But you must be very careful Why asked Alice Oh because every once in a while a lot of water spouts up out of the castle and it might drown you if you were not careful Oh I don t mind water answered Alice Then they went on a little farther and in a short time oh perhaps about as long as it takes you to peel an orange and put some salt on it they came to a most beautiful place I wish you could have seen it At first Alice thought the rainbow had fallen from the sky there were so many colors There was red and green and blue and orange and violet and yellow and pink and purple and even some of that skilligimink color that once turned Sammie Littletail sky blue pink Then the little duck girl saw that the colors were all from different flowers that smelled just like mamma s perfume bottles Next as she walked on a little farther she saw a great pile of stones high in the air and around the bottom of the pile was a big basin of water not quite as large as the pond at the ducks pen but nearly Green vines and flowers were growing in and out among the stones and birds were flying here and there singing This said the little yellow bird is the enchanted castle I live here all summer and so do all my friends Sometimes we bathe in the water and sometimes we hide under the flowers Then when the water spouts up out of the top of the castle we all fly away And just then what should happen but that some water began to spurt then and there right out of the top of that big pile of stones Up up it went in a spray spreading out at the tops like an umbrella in a rain storm and the drops fell with a splash into the basin below Then Alice Wibblewobble cried out Why this isn t an enchanted castle at all No asked the yellow bird putting its head on one side so as to see better Why we always call this our enchanted castle always No answered Alice It is only a fountain in a stone pile in somebody s flower garden I ve seen one before near our house Well it looks like an enchanted castle said the bird and I m sure it s just as pretty as one Isn t it as good as your fairy prince Well replied the little duck girl I suppose it is But it s only water such as I swim in Oh do you swim asked the bird Do please show me how I ve always wanted to learn So though Alice was disappointed about the enchanted castle she got in the little pond at the foot of the fountain and swam around The water spurted up in the air and fell all over her but she didn t mind that All the birds gathered around to watch and even the flowers nodded their heads they were so delighted Oh I m sure we never can learn to swim said the yellow bird as Alice went around again It is much too difficult Then all of a sudden something happened A boy and a girl came running down the gravel walk to the fountain The little girl had yellow hair just like a daffodil and as soon as she saw Alice she cried out Oh Norman Come quick Here is a lovely duck I hope we can keep it That frightened Alice very much especially as the boy tried to grab her So she sprang out of the water and ran and hid under some bushes where the children couldn t find her and as soon as she could she went back the way she had come into the pond and started to swim home And on the way a fox chased her and a big hawk tried to swoop down and grab her but she managed to get away She was all tired out when she got home and when Jimmie and Lulu asked her where she had been she told them all her adventures Well said Jimmie when his sister had finished I think I would rather see that enchanted castle than the fairy prince again Will you take us there some day Alice Perhaps she said but before they made that trip something else happened which you shall hear about to morrow night if I find a green popcorn ball with a pink ribbon on it It s a story of a visit to Grandpa Wibblewobble s house STORY XII A VISIT TO GRANDPA WIBBLEWOBBLE Jimmie Wibblewobble was playing marbles with Bully the frog one day They had just finished one game and were beginning another when Alice Wibblewobble came alone Jimmie she said mamma wants you What does she want asked her brother She wants you to come for a walk in the woods with us Papa is going along Come right away Aw I d rather play with Bully answered Jimmie but just then his mamma called him and he had to go Bully hopped off and Jimmie and Alice walked home together Come Lulu are you all ready asked missus Wibblewobble as she saw her other daughter throwing stones in the pond and making a great splash Yes was the reply and then Jimmie said Oh mamma I don t want to go walking I think you will want to when you know where we are going said his papa Where are we going To Grandpa Wibblewobble s Oh goody cried Lulu and Jimmie at once for they always had a nice time at their grandfather s So the ducks set off through the woods and over the fields and every time they came to a bit of water they swam over it as fast as a cat can wash her face Pretty soon after awhile not very long they came to the pen where Grandpa Wibblewobble lived with his daughter Miss Weezy Wibblewobble who kept house for him Ha I think grandpa has company said Papa Wibblewobble as they came close to the pen and heard talking Yes he certainly has And sure enough the old gentleman duck had And whom do you suppose it was My Uncle Wiggily Longears the old gentleman rabbit How is your rheumatism asked missus Wibblewobble of Uncle Wiggily Longears after they had sat down Oh it doesn t seem to get any better he answered I have carried a piece of horse chestnut in one ear and a bit of dried potato in the other for ever so long but nothing seems to do me any good I am going to have a new doctor soon if I don t get well Oh my yes and some pepper hash on bread and butter also Ha Hum Oh my Ouch and Jack and the Bean Stalk Uncle Wiggily called out that last because his rheumatism hurt so Well Grandpa Wibblewobble gave each of the Wibblewobble children some nice sugared corn meal flavored with sweet flag peppermint and watercress and a few snails to eat and maybe they didn t like them Now said grandpa you children go out to play while we old folks talk about the weather and rheumatism for you see rheumatism was about all Uncle Wiggily cared to talk about Well the little duck children had a fine time playing around grandpa s house and now in about a minute something is going to happen They had wandered off a little way and just as they were resting under some burdock leaves in the shade they heard voices talking And one voice said Now I ll go up to the front door of Grandpa Wibblewobble s house and you go up to the back door We ll both knock at the same time and the ducks won t know which door to go to first Then we ll jump in the windows and eat them all up all up up There are some extra fine ducks there to day Oh maybe Jimmie and his sisters weren t frightened They trembled so that the leaves shook as if the wind was blowing them and when Jimmie got a little quiet he looked out and what do you suppose he saw Why two mean wicked sly old foxes who were getting ready to go to grandpa s house and eat him up and Mamma and Papa Wibblewobble up and probably Uncle Wiggily Longears too who knows Oh isn t this awful asked Alice in a whisper I am going to faint I know I am Silly said Jimmie to her Don t you dare faint Here smell of this and he picked some spearmint and held it under his sister s nose which made her feel better We must do something said Lulu It will never do to have those bad foxes go to grandpa s house How can we stop them Let me think whispered Jimmie quite bravely and he put his head under his wing so he could be quiet and think better Ah I have it he cried out Come with me girls So they stepped softly from under the burdock leaves those three duck children did and ran to grandpa s house as fast as they could leaving the bad foxes in the woods Well you can imagine how surprised all the folks were even Uncle Wiggily when they heard the alarming news which the children told Oh whatever shall we do cried Weezy Wibblewobble I know what I d do if it wasn t for my rheumatism said Uncle Wiggily I d bite those foxes and jump on them too but I can t Oh if Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy were only here Never mind I will save you spoke Jimmie Come now we must get a lot of stones and some boards Hurry for the foxes will soon be here So the ducks with Uncle Wiggily helping them as much as he could put a board over the front door and one over the back door just inside the house Then they piled a lot of stones on the boards and fixed them with strings so that when the cords were pulled the boards would fall down and the stones would also fall with a clatter on the head of whoever was at the door Well after all this was done the ducks and Uncle Wiggily went and hid in the house Then in a little while those bad foxes came sneaking along And sure enough one went to the back door and the other to the front door They knocked at the same time just as they had said they would and Papa Wibblewobble opened one door and Grandpa Wibblewobble the other Then just as soon as the doors were opened Jimmie who had hold of the strings that were fast to the boards pulled them with his bill and down clattered the stones rattlety bang go bung ker plunk right on top of the heads of those two bad foxes Oh how scared they were The house is falling The house is falling Run away cried one fox and they both ran as fast as they could glad enough to escape I tell you Now wasn t that a good trick Jimmie played on those bad animals I thought so myself and so did his grandpa and his papa and mamma to say nothing of Uncle Wiggily Longears And that s how the foxes didn t eat up the ducks and to morrow night if the robin sings under my window as sweetly as he did yesterday morning you shall hear about how Aunt Lettie came on a visit STORY XIII A VISIT FROM AUNT LETTIE One day it was so very pleasant out of doors that Lulu and Alice and Jimmie Wibblewobble didn t want to go to school The sun was sparkling on the water in the duck pond and Alice said as she felt the wind blowing on her feathers Oh I just wish I could go see the fairy prince again Pooh I don t spoke Jimmie But I wish we could stay home from school Bully the frog and I were going to get up a baseball nine Let s go ask papa if we can stay home Can t I play on your ball team asked Lulu who could throw a stone almost as well as a boy No said Jimmie Girls never play on ball teams Couldn t I even umpire went on his sister No Uncle Wiggily Longears is going to do that replied Jimmie Billie and Johnnie Bushytail and Sammie Littletail are going to play on the team But let s go ask papa if we can stay home It s too nice to go to school So they went and asked mister Wibblewobble who had remained at home from work that day because you see he happened to swallow a shoe button by mistake for a grain of corn and he had indigestion something awful yes really You know it was a tan shoe button and if your eyesight isn t very good why it does look like a grain of corn especially if you re very hungry and in a hurry So mister Wibblewobble wasn t feeling very well when Jimmie and Lulu came in to ask him if they could stay home from school and he was the least bit cross perhaps because his indigestion was really very bad at that moment So he answered them No indeed you can t stay home Go to school at once Quack Now when a duck says one quack instead of a double quack quack you may know he is feeling very very miserable and you don t want to bother him any more than you can help Lulu and Jimmie knew this and they hurried out of the pen to go to school Then their papa felt sorry for them because you see he did not really mean to be cross only he knew it was best for them to learn all they could So he said Quack quack which meant he was feeling better and he added When you come home my dears you may each have a penny Run along now like good ducks So though Jimmie felt badly about not being able to get up a ball nine he waddled along with his sisters and pretty soon they were at the owl school where they met Sammie and Susie Littletail and Billie and Johnnie Bushytail and Sister Sallie and Bully the frog Yes they were all there and what s more they had their lessons too so they were not kept in They hurried home after school Alice and Lulu and Jimmie I mean because this story is about them you see and they got their pennies from their papa and each one bought some watercress snails preserved in salted cornmeal very fine they were too for ducks Just as the three Wibblewobble children were finishing the last of the snails who should come hopping along but Bully the frog He hopped into the water to cool himself off and then when he had hopped out again he asked I say Jimmie are your folks expecting company I don t think so answered Jimmie I saw mamma setting the table and she wasn t putting the clean cloth on No I guess we re not going to have company or there d be a clean cloth put on Why do you ask Because as I was coming through the woods just now I met a funny looking creature asking the way to your pen Who was it inquired Lulu Oh it was a nice old lady She had long hair and she carried a basket and she wore such a funny bonnet Two sharp things stuck right out of the top of it I offered to show her the way here but she said I went in the water so often that she couldn t follow me for she didn t want to get her feet wet You must be going to have company Maybe we are cried Alice Let s go ask mamma So they went and asked their mother but she said she did not know of any company coming but for fear some one might come along unexpectedly she did put the clean table cloth on and she got out the napkins and opened a jar of preserved sweet flag root Come on proposed Lulu after a bit let s go through the woods Bully you show us where you met the queer lady and maybe we ll see her So the four started off Bully hopping along in front and pretty soon just as they got to the place where the weeping willow tree stands what should they hear but a funny noise It sounded like Ma a a a a You know just like a sheep cries There she is exclaimed Bully That s just the way she talks And there she is Look The nice old lady The three Wibblewobble children looked and what should they see but a big white goat She was an old lady goat and she was walking along with her basket on her arm and the things sticking out of her bonnet were her horns As soon as she saw the children she called Oh my dears can you show me the way to missus Wibblewobble s I m afraid I m lost Why missus Wibblewobble is our mamma answered Lulu quickly Oh my dears You don t mean it cried the goat Then you must be my little nieces and nephew I ve heard so much about But who is this little green boy I ve seen him before Oh he s the catcher on our base ball nine said Jimmie He catches the balls in his mouth But who are you if I may be so bold as to ask I m your Aunt Lettie replied the goat I ve come to pay you a long visit Oh I m so glad I found you for I feared I would never get to your house See I have brought you some apple turnovers and some gooseberry tarts Now let s hurry home but first kiss me So Aunt Lettie kissed them all even Bully the frog and then she and the Wibblewobble children went to the ducks pen where she stayed several days And quite a number of things happened too In fact one took place the very next day as you shall hear to morrow night when I am going to tell you about Lulu and the pussy willows provided a doggie with a yellow nose and pink ears doesn t scare me STORY XIV LULU AND THE PUSSY WILLOWS What shall we do now asked Lulu the next morning after Aunt Lettie came and the duck children had gone out to play leaving their mamma and the old lady goat to do the dishes Let s go see the fairy prince suggested Alice Oh you re always thinking of that fairy prince objected Jimmie I say let s go for a walk All right agreed Lulu I know where there are some nice pussy willows We ll get some to take to our school teacher next Monday So they started off up the pond to the place where the pussy willows grew They gathered quite a number breaking off the stems in their strong yellow bills and then putting the willows under their wings they started back home again They didn t have to hurry because you see it was Saturday and there wasn t any school Oh my no Ducks don t have to go to school on Saturday any more than you do even if they are only in the kindergarten class Now if you please pay close attention for something is going to happen very shortly if Uncle Wiggily Longears doesn t come along and bother me and I don t believe he will Well Lulu and Alice and Jimmie got safely home with the pussy willows and as they were putting them in water to keep until Monday Aunt Lettie came into the room What have you there my dears she asked wiggling her horns and looking over the tops of her glasses as easily as you can draw a picture of a horse What have you there my dears They are pussy willows Aunt Lettie replied Lulu Oh dearie me oh Sacramento cried Aunt Lettie who was quite excitable at times Why ever did you bring them here little ones Why we want them for teacher explained Alice I don t declared Jimmie Boys never bring the teacher flowers that is unless they don t want to be kept in when there s a ball game But don t you like pussy willows Aunt Lettie Oh no indeed she answered I don t like cats of any description But these are only pussy willows said Alice Oh they ll turn into cats quickly enough remarked Aunt Lettie There was a family who once lived next to us and they had kittens Why it wasn t any time at all before those kittens had turned into cats and land goodness how they did howl nights and keep me awake And I had lumbago that summer too Oh yes indeed kittens are all very well but when they turn into old cats they re not so nice Oh but Aunt Lettie you don t understand explained Jimmie smiling the least bit You see these are only plant pussies They can t ever become real cats you know They grow don t they asked the old lady goat shaking her horns again Don t they grow Yes admitted Lulu They certainly grow Well if they re pussies now they ll grow to be cats soon enough you mark my words went on Aunt Lettie quite sorrowfully That is unless they drown in that water she added quickly Why no pussy willows can t drown in water said Lulu We put them there to keep them fresh You don t need to worry about those pussy willows dear Aunt Lettie Illustration But Aunt Lettie did worry In fact she had to worry about something anyhow so I suppose it is just as well that she worried about the pussy willows And when they all went to bed that night the last thing she said was Now you mark my words Those pussies will be cats before you know it But Lulu and Alice and Jimmie did not think so However you just wait and see what happened Along in the middle of the night when it was all still and quiet and when even the frogs had stopped croaking and it wasn t time for the roosters to begin to crow yes when it was dark and still and silent and not a sound was heard suddenly what should happen but that right in the Wibblewobble house there came a loud Mew Mew Mew There exclaimed Aunt Lettie jumping out of bed What did I tell you Those pussy willows have turned into cats and the house will be full of them Oh dear Why did you bring them in here It s dreadfully bad luck Lulu and Jimmie and Alice jumped out of bed too So did mister and missus Wibblewobble All the while they kept hearing that Mew Mew Mew Whatever can it be asked Mamma Wibblewobble Maybe it s a burglar Nonsense replied mister Wibblewobble burglars don t mew I ll go look So he went to look and what do you think he found Why right under a vase of the pussy willows on a cushion was a dear sweet little white kitten Yes sir as true as I m telling you And so soon as Lulu saw it she cried It s mine One of my pussy willows has turned into a kittie Oh how glad I am And honestly the kittie was right under Lulu s vase of pussy willows just as sure as that two and two make four I told you so cried Aunt Lettie Now maybe you ll believe me next time The pussy willows turned into a kitten Oh but this kitten can t be from those willows said Papa Wibblewobble This is a real pussy It must have come in from out of doors I guess I must have left a window open And the funny part of it was that he had left a window up and it was a real kittie that had wandered in straying away from its mamma But Aunt Lettie was sure it had come from a pussy willow Lulu didn t care because she was allowed to keep the kittie for herself and what do you think Why that kittie joined Jimmie s baseball nine and to morrow night I ll tell you about a game of ball that was played That is if the man in the moon doesn t tumble down and hurt his nose STORY XV PLAYING A BALL GAME One day Jimmie Wibblewobble was going over to where Bully the frog lived Come on cried the little boy duck to the frog Let s get up a ball game We ll find Johnnie and Billie Bushytail and Sammie Littletail and have some fun Have you seen Uncle Wiggily Longears He will umpire for us I know and tell who s out and when the balls go straight and all that Have you seen him I saw him limping along a while ago answered Bully He can t have gone very far for his rheumatism is bad again Let s hurry up and catch him suggested Jimmie So they ran on through the woods as fast as they could and sure enough they soon saw the old gentleman rabbit Will you come to our ball game asked Jimmie Why of course to be sure answered Uncle Wiggily But I can t play very well you know on account of Oh my Ouch Oh dear Um Um Present arms Ready Aim Fire Oh Oh Oh That s the way he cried all of a sudden What s the matter asked Jimmie Matter Why my rheumatism that s what s the matter It does seem to catch me at the wrong time I m afraid I won t be able to play ball to day after all boys I m sorry but Oh dear There it goes again and that poor old gentleman rabbit had to lean on his crutch because his legs hurt him so Oh we only want you to look on and tell us when the game is going all right said Jimmie very kindly You can have a seat in the shade and you will decide who s out and who makes a run and which side wins Well I might manage that replied Uncle Wiggily Come on but please walk very slowly So they walked on very slowly and pretty soon they met Johnnie and Billie Bushytail with Sister Sallie And the little girl squirrel was singing Hippity hop to the barber shop To buy a lolly pop lally One for me and one for thee And one for Sister Sallie Come on let s play ball called Jimmie to Johnnie and Billie The Bushytail brothers said they would and on they all went through the woods and over the fields and pretty soon oh maybe in about two quacks and a half whom should they meet but Sammie and Susie Littletail Sammie said he would play ball and Susie said she would look on Then along came Lulu and Alice Wibblewobble and Lulu had her white kittie with her My kittie ought to play as long as I can t play especially as she knew how to roll a ball spoke Lulu So Jimmie said the kittie could very nicely with her paws But that s all the girls who are going to be on the team said Jimmie very decidedly Well they started to play and they had an old wooden door knob for a ball I just wish you could have seen them honestly I do It was as good as going to a show where they charge five pins to get in Bully the frog was the catcher for all he had to do was to open his large mouth and the ball would go right in Uncle Wiggily was a sort of judge or umpire That is he sat in the shade on a pile of soft leaves and told when it was right for one of the players to give up the bat and let some one else have a chance Now whom do you suppose threw the ball Why Johnnie Bushytail And Billie was on first base while Jimmie Wibblewobble had the bat which was a piece of hickory stick He was to hit the ball and Sammie Littletail and the white kittie whose name was Sadie were to chase it Oh what fun they had Jimmie knocked the ball as hard as he could and then he ran and Sadie and Sammie tried to put him out that is to tag him with the ball for that s the way they played Then it came Bully s turn to bat while Johnnie Bushytail caught and then you should have seen how cutely Sadie the kittie would roll the ball along to first base whenever any one hit it And as for Billie Bushytail when it was his turn he knocked a ball away over in the field and Lulu ran after it even if she wasn t supposed to play She threw it back too and then she went and sat down with Alice and Susie and Sister Sallie Uncle Wiggily did fine at umpiring and he was as kind and good as could be so no one found fault with what he said even when he had to rub his leg that had rheumatism in it But something dreadful happened I ve got to tell about it or else it wouldn t be fair and we must always be honest and fair in this world no matter whether we want to or not It was Jimmie s turn at the bat again He hit the ball very hard Away it sailed over the fence and across the field and then oh don t breathe or wiggle for a few seconds now then if that ball didn t smash bang crash right into the window of Grandfather Goosey Gander s house Yes sir it broke the window all to flinders and out rushed Grandfather Goosey Gander Oh but he was angry He quacked and he squawked and he called out Who broke my window I I did please sir answered Jimmie But I didn t mean to It was an accident Ha hum An accident eh Well you ll have to pay for it said Grandfather Goosey Gander Yes that s what you will Oh we ll all chip in and pay for it said Bully quickly That s what we always do in a ball game when a window is broken I ll pay my share Ha Hum cried Grandfather Goosey Gander and then he sneezed for he had run out without his cap on and he was bald headed So they all agreed to pay for the window and even Sister Sallie said she would help But they didn t have to No sir as true as I m telling you if Aunt Lettie didn t happen along just then and when she heard what the matter was she just took out her purse and said I ll pay for the window which Jimmie broke I am rich and I ll never miss the money Boys and girls must have some fun Fine cried Uncle Wiggily I m the umpire and I say that s just fine Now wasn t that kind of Aunt Lettie Well I guess so Then the game went on and Billie and Johnnie Bushytail won but no more windows were broken Now if we don t get an April shower to morrow you shall hear in the next story to morrow night about how the duck s pen caught fire and who put it out STORY XVI THE WIBBLEWOBBLE HOME ON FIRE After the ball game which I told you about last night all the players and those who had looked on and Uncle Wiggily the umpire started for home On the way they talked of how kind Aunt Lettie was She s the kindest person I have ever known said Uncle Wiggily as he limped along on his crutch that Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy had gnawed out of a cornstalk for him She is very Oh dear Oh me Oh my Oh disproportionability Wow Ouch My rheumatism again and it hurt him so he had to stand still and waggle his ears as hard as ever he could Then he felt better especially after he had rubbed a horse chestnut on his sore leg You see the rheumatism which was cured by a red fairy as I told you about in the first book came back because Uncle Wiggily got his feet wet going out one day without his umbrella Of course Papa and Mamma Wibblewobble were much surprised to hear about the ball game and the broken window but they didn t scold Jimmie very much and pretty soon oh in a little while after supper you know it was bedtime for the duck children and they went to bed Well it got darker and darker and soon it was nice and quiet around the pond where the ducks lived Only the frogs seemed to be awake and they were croaking away in the water And pretty soon Lulu and Alice were dreaming and so was Jimmie and the funny part of it is that they all dreamed different things Pretty soon it got even darker and then up popped the silvery moon and it wasn t quite so dark But it was more quiet Oh my yes It was so quiet that I believe if a feather had fallen off a duck s back it would have made a noise when it struck the ground Oh it was very quiet Then all of a sudden Jimmie awakened He sniffed and he snuffed and he smelled smoke So he got up and he called to Lulu and Alice in the next room Say don t you smell smoke Yes said Alice I do Maybe it s Grandfather Goosey Gander smoking his pipe suggested Lulu No he doesn t smoke as late as this said Jimmie Then the smell of smoke got stronger and in about as long as it would take you to count one and a half what should happen but that the whole duckhouse was suddenly lighted up Then there came a crackling roaring sound and Papa and Mamma Wibblewobble jumped up Oh dear It s burglars I know it s burglars cried missus Wibblewobble Quack real loud Leander you see mister Wibblewobble s name was Leander Quack real loud and call the police So mister Leander Wibblewobble quacked as loudly as he could and just then Aunt Lettie jumped out of bed Oh dear Oh dear Oh dear she cried three times just like that The house is on fire The house is burning up Run Jump everybody And sure enough the ducks house was on fire and it wasn t a burglar at all no sir Whether the moon was so hot that it caused the fire or whether it was sparks from grandfather s pipe I can t say but anyhow the house was on fire and it was burning fiercely Oh dear Oh dear cried Aunt Lettie again And Mamma Wibblewobble cried just the same too Then they all ran and jumped out of the second story window but it didn t hurt them for they could fly a little bit you know and they came down like balloons That is all but Aunt Lettie and she was used to jumping so she came down like a lot of dishes falling off the table Well you should have seen that house burn Oh it was a dreadful sight All the other ducks and the geese and the chickens gathered around The rooster crowed the alarm Box number twenty one it was but of course there were no engines to come and put out the fire Oh we must save the house shouted Papa Wibblewobble Everybody bring water from the pond and throw it on the fire cried Aunt Lettie and she ran down and filled her two horns which she carried on her head The horns were hollow and had the tops sawed off so she could fill them quickly and pour out the water just as easily She splashed some water on the fire but it didn t do much good Then Lulu and Alice and Jimmie they filled their bills with water and threw it on the blaze but that didn t do much good No sad to tell all the water the ducks and the geese and Aunt Lettie could carry to say nothing of the rooster who couldn t bring much because he stopped to crow every now and then all this water didn t do a bit of good and the house was burning faster and faster Then what do you think happened Why all at once there came running up old Nero the big shaggy yellow dog who was so old and kind that he would never hurt any one Yes he ran right up and called out Make way if you please I will put out that fire So he ran down into the pond as fast as he could run and soaked himself in the water Then he ran up close to the fire and shook himself hard and the drops of water scattered from his shaggy sides all over the blaze just like a rain storm And the fire was partly out Then he ran down again and got all wet and shook himself and scattered some more water over the fire And that fire was pretty nearly out Then for the third time that dog Nero ran down into the water and got all soaking wet and scattered the drops over the blaze like two showers and a half And then that fire was all completely out Oh wasn t he a good dog though Well the house wasn t burned so much after all and the ducks could go back into it And maybe they weren t thankful to Nero but he only said Ah you should have watched me gnaw bones when I was a young dog That was a sight worth seeing But I think it was great for him to put out the fire don t you Now to morrow night s story providing my automobile doesn t hit a balloon will be about how the fairy prince was caught STORY XVII HOW THE FAIRY PRINCE WAS CAUGHT Aunt Lettie the nice old lady goat wanted Lulu and Alice and Jimmie to have a good time so one day she fixed them up a basket of lunch to take off in the woods and eat She made some jam tarts oh such lovely flaky ones and there were cookies and bread and butter and I don t know what all I just wish I had that basket of lunch now don t you But of course we wouldn t want to take it away from the duck children would we So they started off and as they passed by Nero he opened one eye only one mind you and looked at them And he said I am feeling a little hungry but I don t s pose you have anything for me Yes said Lulu you may have a jam tart because you saved our house from burning up So they gave Nero one tart and he gobbled it up as quickly as you can cross your t or dot your i when you re writing in school Pretty soon well not so very long you know the three duck children came to the woods Oh the woods were the nicest place you ever saw There was a little brook running in and out among the trees and it sounded like music when it went over the stones Well they sat down on the grass near a mossy old stump and ate their lunch until there wasn t even so much as a crumb of a jam tart left They had just gotten through when all of a sudden they heard a big noise It was like some one stamping his feet down and breaking sticks The duck children were terribly frightened for they thought maybe it was an elephant or a rhinoceros coming along but Jimmie peeked through the bushes and whispered to his sisters It s a big boy What s he doing asked Alice I guess he s going fishing said Lulu for he has a fish pole over his shoulder And sure enough that boy was going fishing He walked on a little farther stepping on sticks and breaking them and then he sat down on the edge of the little brook and began to fish Then the duck children weren t so much afraid and they watched him Pretty soon the boy pulled up his line with a jerk but there wasn t anything on it Then he said Oh dear That was a big fish but he got away I m glad it got away whispered Alice for I don t like to see the poor fish caught Then in about two quacks and a waddle the boy pulled up his pole again and this time he didn t have anything on the hook either So he said again Oh dear me and an angle worm That s two big fish that have gotten loose Then he threw in his line again and the next time when he pulled it up something came with it Something wiggily and black and yellow and red spotted with wrinkly legs and a long snaky neck and head Ker thump it landed on the bank and the boy ran up to it Why I ve caught a mud turtle he cried I am not the mud turtle called out only he couldn t speak very plainly for the hook was in his mouth I m a fairy prince and you had no right to catch me he said Now of course the boy couldn t hear this for he didn t understand the language used by the fairy prince But Alice heard him and so did Lulu and Jimmie Oh dear cried Alice That bad boy has caught the fairy prince Let s run out and make him let the prince go Oh no answered Lulu the boy might catch us then I know what let s do whispered Jimmie We ll get in the bushes right behind that boy and quack and squawk as loud as we can That will scare him and make him run away I don t believe the mud turtle is fairy prince but I don t want to see him hurt Come on girls Now when I say ready quack real loud So the three duck children went softly up to a bush right behind where that fisherman I mean fisherboy was sitting All this while the fairy prince was talking to the boy and asking to be let go for the hook hurt him The boy finally did take the hook out not hurting the mud turtle any more than he could help for he was not a bad boy Then in an instant or maybe in an instant and a half Jimmie cried Ready and he and his sisters quacked as loudly as possible or even louder The boy was just going to put the mud turtle into the basket but when he heard the quacking coming right out of the bushes behind him he was so frightened that he dropped the fairy prince on the ground And the fairy prince crawled off as fast as he could let me tell you Then the boy saw that it was the duck children who had frightened him and he laughed but they didn t care not a bit Then the boy said Oh I guess there is no good fishing here I m going to try a new place so he walked away Then Alice went right up to the mud turtle and said O fairy prince art thou much hurt I am hurt considerable said the mud turtle I am hurt in two ways My mouth hurts where the hook went in and my feelings are hurt because the boy didn t believe I was a fairy prince Well if you are a fairy prince asked Jimmie why didn t you turn him into an elephant or a lion and scare him or why didn t you change him into a bug or a mosquito so he could fly away Why didn t you do that eh There are several reasons replied the mud turtle Oh wilt thou tell them to us asked Alice romantically Not now replied the fairy prince but I will later Return here to morrow and I will tell you and he stretched first one wrinkly leg and then the other and went to sleep We will return said Alice and then the duck children hurried home and to morrow night you shall hear about a magic trick and why the fairy prince didn t turn that boy into an elephant or a lion That is if the Thanksgiving turkey doesn t go to a football game STORY XVIII THE FAIRY PRINCE DOES A MAGIC TRICK One day after they had been out roller skating Lulu and Alice and Jimmie Wibblewobble suddenly remembered that it was time they went back to the woods to meet the fairy prince who was to tell them why he didn t turn that fisher boy into a lion or an elephant So they took off their skates and hurried to the place and by and by after awhile not so very long they got there Then they stopped and looked around Hu exclaimed Jimmie He isn t here I thought he was fooling us Hush begged Alice He may be only hiding to test us to see if we really believe in him He may appear any moment in a big balloon or on the back of a great bird Somebody s coming now said Lulu suddenly for she heard a rustling in the bushes They all turned around and whom do you think they saw coming right out of the woods Why Uncle Wiggily Longears The old gentleman rabbit was limping along making his nose go up and down and sideways at the same time the way you have seen all the bunnies do you know Ha Ha he exclaimed What have we here Why I do declare If it isn t Jimmie Wibblewobble and his sisters What are you doing here little ones We came here to meet the fairy prince replied Jimmie He was going to tell us about why he didn t change a boy into an elephant But he isn t here Who the fairy prince the boy or the elephant asked Uncle Wiggily gently rubbing a horse chestnut on his left hind leg that had the worst rheumatism in it Neither one said Alice but the fairy prince is sure to come Stuff and nonsense Nonsense and stuff also snuff and red pepper cried Uncle Wiggily Fairy prince indeed There s no such thing Oh yes there is said Alice Pray do not speak so loudly He might hear you Thank you my dear for trusting in me exclaimed a voice suddenly and honestly you may not believe me but if there wasn t that mud turtle Yes sir as true as I m telling you he appeared right from behind a bush Thank you my dear for believing me said the fairy prince to Alice again As for this ahem this person and the mud turtle looked very severely at Uncle Wiggily very severely indeed as for this person I will soon show him Oh my yes and a tortoiseshell comb in addition he said and then the turtle stuck out its long neck straight at the old rabbit until Uncle Wiggily thought it was a snake Fairy prince we salute thee exclaimed Alice making a low bow Good very good remarked the mud turtle I believe I promised you I would tell you why I did not change the boy who caught me into something strange say an elephant or a lion Yes replied Jimmie you did promise us Go ahead please That s not the way to talk to a fairy prince objected Alice You should speak more politely Never mind him he doesn t know any better went on the mud turtle I will now give you my reasons In the first place I did not want to scare that boy after the way you frightened him He had been punished enough I thought Besides if I had turned him into a lion or an elephant he would have run through the woods scaring every one he met and that would not have been right And the reason I didn t change him into a bug or a mosquito was because he might fly away and then when the magic spell had passed off and he was changed back into a boy again the transformation might have happened in the air and he would fall right down on somebody s head and that would never do never never not in a year and a half So I concluded not to do anything to him I don t believe you could have changed him into anything at all said Uncle Wiggily quite boldly I don t even believe you are a fairy prince There it goes again cried the mud turtle and he wept big tears that made a little puddle of water Very few persons do believe in me But I assure you I am a fairy prince he added and what s more all I would have had to say to that boy was Oskaluluhinniumhaddy and he would have been turned into anything I liked But I see you still do not believe me that is all but Alice So I will just do a magic trick for you Return here in an hour and in this very spot you shall find a round stone Take a rock and break open the stone and you will see what happens So the Wibblewobble children and Uncle Wiggily went away wondering what was going to happen They came back in an hour and sure enough right where the mud turtle had been standing was a large round stone Wonderful cried Alice Let s see what s inside suggested Jimmie So he and Uncle Wiggily took up a rock and hit that stone once and they hit it twice and they hit it three times and at the third blow if that stone didn t break open and out stepped the mud turtle fairy prince He was right inside that stone Now wasn t that a magic trick I think so anyhow Oh tell us how you did it begged Lulu It was very simple very simple said the turtle as he flicked a bit of mud off his nose You see I just rolled myself up in some soft clay and then made it round like a stone Then I stayed in the sun until it was baked as hard as a rock and then I rolled along here to wait for you Very simple indeed But now do you believe I am a fairy prince And they all declared they did even Uncle Wiggily and Alice said three times We salute thee fairy prince Oh it was as good as a play Well now let s see about to morrow night How about a story of the rat who took the eggs Do you think you would like that Very well then you shall hear it providing my golden slipper doesn t fall off STORY XIX THE RATS WHO TOOK THE EGGS Nothing had happened at the Wibblewobble house in several days and Jimmie and Lulu and Alice were beginning to feel that it was about time they went off on another picnic or else tried to find the fairy prince again But one day just as Jimmie was looking for his baseball and his catching glove his mamma came out of the pantry where she had gone to get some dishes to set the table Did any of you children take my eggs she asked and she looked very severely at them What Are the eggs gone asked Aunt Lettie the old lady goat Yes said Mamma Wibblewobble there were just thirteen eggs and now there are only ten Three have been taken and I hope Lulu and Alice and Jimmie didn t touch them Oh no indeed mamma spoke Alice very quickly as she finished tying a sky blue pink ribbon around her neck I never touched them Neither did I added Lulu Nor me said Jimmie I don t like eggs anyhow I was saving them to hatch more little ducklings out of went on Mamma Wibblewobble in sorrowful tones Now I shall have to wait Oh it s such a disappointment to me Maybe they fell off the shelf suggested Jimmie No replied his mother If they had fallen from the shelf out of the basket where I had them the eggs would have broken and made a mark on the floor and of course you know they would for when an egg breaks on the floor it makes a splish and a splash and a big yellow and white spot that you can t help but see now doesn t it So Mamma Wibblewobble knew the eggs couldn t have fallen Well remarked Aunt Lettie it s very strange Perhaps they have been stolen You should notify the police Or tell mister Cock A Doodle the rooster added Jimmie He would crow over it and if we offered a reward maybe we would get the eggs back Well I m glad you children didn t take them at all events said their mother Run along and play now Aunt Lettie has made some molasses cookies with corn meal and raisins on top and you may have some of them So Lulu and Alice and Jimmie went out to play but all the while they were thinking of the missing eggs It was very strange Their mamma and Aunt Lettie hunted all over the duck pen for them but the eggs couldn t be found any more than you can find a penny after you drop it down a crack in the board walk Well when Papa Wibblewobble came home he was told about the three missing eggs He was much surprised but he said at once Why a burglar has taken them that s what I remember now I heard a suspicious noise last night It was some one sneezing That was the burglar taking the eggs I thought of getting up and going down to catch him but I was too sleepy so I stayed in bed No it wasn t a burglar who sneezed said Aunt Lettie It was I I left my window open and I caught a little cold Then who did sneeze and take the eggs asked Papa Wibblewobble But no one could tell him and it was more mysterious and wonderful than ever yes indeed Not a trace of those eggs could be found and Mamma Wibblewobble felt terribly Illustration Well that night Jimmie thought of a plan He decided he would catch the bad burglar or whoever it was that had taken the eggs for the little boy duck thought if they took three eggs they would come back for more I m going to hide in the pantry to night he said to Lulu and Alice and when the burglar comes I m going to grab him Won t you be afraid asked Alice shivering Afraid Humph I guess not replied her brother So that night after every one had gone to bed and it was all still and quiet in the house and Aunt Lettie was snoring the least little bit Jimmie crawled softly out of bed Oh so softly and went and hid in the pantry It was dark so he took a candle and was all ready to light it whenever he heard a sound Well he had to wait quite some time and it was getting pretty lonesome and he was beginning to feel sleepy when all of a sudden he heard a noise Then he heard another noise and then a scratching and a squeaking Then he lighted the candle as quickly as he could and what do you suppose he saw Why two great big rats no relation to good kind Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the muskrat oh not at all but two other bad rats Well as true as I m telling you if one rat didn t climb up on the shelf where the duck eggs were in the basket and take one up in his paws and then what do you suppose he did Why he went to the edge of the shelf and dropped the egg to the rat on the floor below Then the rat on the floor caught it and lay down on his back and hugged the egg in his four paws and the rat on the shelf ran down and got hold of the tail of the rat that had the egg and began pulling him along the floor just as if he were a little wagon or sled with an egg on it All this Jimmie saw and he cried out Oh you bad rats you to steal my mamma s eggs Well you should have seen how frightened those rats were at that One dropped the egg out of his paws and ran away and the other followed Oh but they were frightened though and wasn t Jimmie brave to hide in the pantry and discover them So that s how the first three eggs were taken but no more were for Papa Wibblewobble stopped up the rat hole And that s the end of this story The one to morrow night will be about how Jimmie tried to stand on his head that is if the pussy cat doesn t go to sleep in the milk bottle STORY XX HOW JIMMIE STOOD ON HIS HEAD Jimmie Wibblewobble was quite a hero after he had found out about the rats taking the eggs and every time he walked in the chicken yard the old rooster would crow and say There goes Jimmie the boy who scared the rats But do you s pose Jimmie was proud Not a bit of it He was just as nice as ever and Lulu and Alice thought a lot of him let me tell you Well one day Bully the frog came over to play with Jimmie They tossed a baseball around Bully catching it in his mouth All of a sudden the frog boy cried out Oh my I m so warm I think I ll jump in the pond and cool off So he jumped into the pond just as easily as butter melts on a hot stove and when he came up he felt better Then he said to Jimmie Why don t you dive down under the water the way I do It s lots of fun I would answered Jimmie only I can t stay under water as you do I have to float on top I can put my head under to dig in the mud for snails and sweet spicy weeds but I can t get my whole body under I know how you could do it went on Bully How asked Jimmie and he wobbled his tail so fast you could hardly see it move Tie a stone around your neck went on Bully That will make you sink under water and you can then dive as good as I can Come on we ll have some fun Oh don t you do it Jimmie cried Lulu who came along just then with Alice Maybe you can t get the stone loose and you ll be drowned Oh I guess not answered Jimmie I can stay under water a long time I want to see how it feels to dive in ker plunk like a frog I m going to tell mamma cried Alice Tattle tale Tattle tale called Jimmie I never tell on you Well then I won t tell said Alice but Lulu and I will stay close by so if you can t get the stone off we can help you Well that s kind of you spoke her brother but I ll be all right You will see me stand on my head just like Bully does and dive under the water So he got a stone and a piece of long grass for a string and Bully tied the stone around Jimmie s neck Now this was a very risky thing to do but you see Jimmie didn t know any better Neither did Bully But you just wait and see what happens I m coming to it very shortly now Pretty soon the stone was tied on good and tight and then Jimmie and Bully stood on the edge of the pond Are you all ready asked Bully Yep replied Jimmie and he stretched out his neck for it felt funny to have a stone tied around it Oh how foolish some ducks are now aren t they honestly All ready went on Bully One for the money two for a show three to make ready and FOUR to go and he yelled the FOUR real loudly Then they jumped in Jimmie and Bully ker splash ker splosh ker splish ker thump Oh what a lot of water they scattered about wetting Lulu and Alice but the girl ducks didn t mind it Of course Bully went right to the bottom and so did Jimmie too His head went right down in the mud the way Lulu s did that terrible day I told you about once And poor Jimmie s yellow feet were right up in the air and that s where a duck s feet ought never to be Oh my no and some shingle nails besides Well Jimmie tried to swim along under water as he saw Bully doing but he couldn t No sir not the least bit You see the stone was too heavy and it held him down Besides his feet were out of the water and as a duck has to have his feet in water to swim with of course Jimmie couldn t move along at all There he was held down under water and all the while his breath was getting shorter and shorter and he kept feeling worse and worse and he wished he had taken Lulu s advice and not tried to stand on his head and dive Well naturally when Jimmie didn t come up in some time Lulu and Alice got worried Bully popped up after swimming across the pond under water and out of sight and they asked him what had become of Jimmie I ll go look he said and when he dived down and came back he was pale green instead of dark green as he usually was You see he turned pale green because he was so frightened Oh dear cried Bully Jimmie is held fast down there by the stone on his neck and can t get up Can t you bite the stone loose asked Alice Then Bully tried but he couldn t and Lulu and Alice tried but they couldn t And there wasn t any one else around to help and it began to look pretty bad for poor Jimmie And then just as he surely thought he would never see his papa and mamma and sisters and Aunt Lettie again who should come walking along the bottom of the pond but the mud turtle fairy prince He saw right away what the matter was and it didn t take him a second with his sharp jaws to bite through the grass that held the stone around Jimmie s neck and up popped the little boy duck His life had been saved just in time let me tell you And oh how thankful Alice and Lulu were to say nothing of Jimmie and how they thanked the fairy prince Maybe you will believe that I am a fairy now said the mud turtle to Jimmie and Jimmie said he would He also said he would never stand on his head again with a stone tied around his neck and I m glad to say he never did Now in case I should see a sky blue pink green rose in blossom to morrow I ll tell you a story about Lulu and how Aunt Lettie did her a great favor STORY XXI LULU AND AUNT LETTIE Lulu Wibblewobble was walking in the deep dark woods and what is more she was all alone Yes and she wasn t afraid You see Jimmie had gone off with the boys in the lots back of the duck pond to play ball and Alice had gone shopping with her mamma Lulu could have gone too only felt she would rather go walking in the woods so she went At first it was very pleasant with the birds singing in the trees and the wind blowing through the leaves and making music and Lulu liked it very much She found some fine eel grass in a little brook and she was eating the green stems and thinking how nice it was when all at once she heard a funny noise It was just like when a great big door swings on rusty hinges Lulu stopped eating eel grass at once and she called right out loud My goodness What s that Then it was all still and quiet as quiet you know as when a little mouse walks along and doesn t want any one to hear him going after the crackers and cheese and maybe the jam tarts too who knows Well it was just as still and quiet as it could be when all of a sudden the noise came again Oh dear cried Lulu I believe I m going to be frightened I wish Jimmie was here But Jimmie the brave boy duck was a long way off playing ball with Bully the frog and his other friends though he would have come at once to help his sister if he had known what a dreadful thing was almost going to happen to her Well as I said the noise sounded again and then when Lulu looked right at a tree what should she see but something big and bushy waving in the wind Oh maybe it s Johnnie and Billie Bushytail and perhaps Sister Sallie is with them she said aloud and she didn t feel quite so frightened Then that terrible noise came again and the bushy thing got bigger and Lulu saw that it was the tail of a great big black dog Oh such a big black dog as it was And he was growling and that s what made the sound like a big door creaking on big rusty hinges The dog came out from behind the tree and he stared right in the face of Lulu as bold as bold could be Who are you growled the dog If if you please kind sir I m Lulu she answered Bur r r r growled the dog I m not a kind Sir at all I m a bad dog Bur r r r Bur r r r What s your last name Bur r r r My last name is Wibblewobble Bad Dog she replied Bur r r r What are you calling me names for he asked and he showed his teeth something frightful yes indeed Now cuddle up close to me if you want to and you won t be a bit afraid because in a few minutes Lulu is going to be saved in a wonderful way Just you wait and see Why do you call me names asked the dog again I I If you please said Lulu I thought you said your name was Bad Dog sir Bur r r r cried the dog I didn t at all No matter what my name is I am a bad dog however and I m proud of it Oh wasn t he the bold ugly dog though Then he looked at Lulu some more and growled even louder and he asked her What are you a chicken or a turkey Neither replied Lulu I m a duck if you please Ha exclaimed the bad dog A duck The very idea Of all things I love ducks I just dote on em I love em just like you love jam tarts I expect But why aren t you larger Lulu I like big ducks Oh cried the little duck girl are you going to eat me up Yes replied the dog I am Then went on Lulu very bravely for she was trying to think of a way to get out of the deep dark woods if you will wait a year or two I will be larger No said the dog I can t wait I m in a hurry I must have you now Then he growled some more and rushed right at Lulu and I suppose he would have eaten her up feathers and all only for what happened Now what do you suppose prevented him Why just as he was about to grab the little duck girl there was a crashing and a smashing in the bushes and who should appear but dear Aunt Lettie the old lady goat As soon as she laid eyes on that dog she knew what he was going to do and without speaking a word she rushed right at him and lowered her horns Now it s a good thing for that dog that the sharp ends of Aunt Lettie s horns had been sawed off So you see when she stuck them in that dog s ribs they only tickled him and he had to laugh instead of sticking right through him Oh how hard he laughed But he didn t want to not a bit Then Aunt Lettie just lowered her head and then she raised it up and over her back that bad dog went right up in the air and he was tossed in some briars and brambles that scratched him well But he wasn t satisfied yet and he rushed back at Lulu but Aunt Lettie tickled him in the ribs again and he laughed Ha Ho though he didn t want to at all and over into the briars and brambles he was tossed once more Then he had had enough and he ran off howling instead of laughing and that s the way it was that Aunt Lettie saved Lulu You see the old lady goat happened to be walking in the woods when she heard the dog growl and she ran up just in time Then she went home with Lulu and Jimmie said if he ever saw that dog he would throw a stone at him and I wouldn t blame him would you Now to morrow night I think the story is going to be about how Alice cut her foot and what happened after it But I can t tell it unless I happen to see a grasshopper standing on his head and eating jam tarts STORY XXII HOW ALICE CUT HER FOOT Did you ever go barefooted in the summer time I suppose you have and I don t blame you a bit especially on hot days or when you are at Asbury Park or Ocean Grove Now to go barefooted you know you have to take off your shoes and stockings and that s quite a bother at times Well Alice Wibblewobble didn t have to do this when she wanted to go barefooted for you know she never wore shoes and stockings in summer You see it would be too much trouble to take them off every time she went in swimming with Lulu and Jimmie so that s why it was arranged that she never had to wear any Now it happened one day oh I guess it must have been about a week and a minute after Lulu had been frightened by that big dog that Alice was going to the store for her mother The store was kept by mister Drake who had a little round door knob on the top of his head so his hat wouldn t blow off in windy weather Bring me a pound of butter and some cornmeal Alice her mother had said to her and be sure the cornmeal is fresh I am going to fry some for your father s supper So Alice said she would be sure about it and she started off Want me to come Alice asked Lulu No dear replied her sister I think it is too hot for you to day I ll soon be back again Better take Jimmie went on Lulu You may meet the bad dog or an ugly fox No spoke Alice again I think I ll go alone Besides Jimmie is off with Sammie Littletail playing leapfrog I ll go alone So off she went Now I m going to tell you why she wanted to go alone but don t whisper it to any one You see Alice thought maybe she might meet the fairy prince for she still hoped that some day he would change into a king with a golden diamond crown on his head But as she walked on toward mister Drake s store she saw nothing of the fairy prince though she kept a sharp lookout Well she got the pound of butter and the cornmeal and to make sure it was fresh she ate a little for that s the surest way to tell Then she started for home with the butter under one wing and the cornmeal under the other Well all of a sudden just as she got past the weeping willow tree if she didn t step on a sharp stone and cut her foot because you see she had no shoes on and the stone was very very sharp almost as sharp as an exclamation point yes indeed There I had the printer put one in so you could see how very sharp it is Always be careful of exclamation points children Oh Oh Oh cried Alice as she felt the sharp stone go in her foot and she had to sink down to the ground it hurt her so Then the cornmeal fell from under her wing and the bag burst and it spilled all over Then the butter fell from under the other wing but that didn t get hurt any It only got some dents in it and you know that doesn t matter for butter Oh dear Whatever shall I do cried Alice again I I can t walk on my sore foot and I can t carry the cornmeal and the butter Oh dear Oh dear My foot s bleeding too and sure enough it was Poor Alice How sorry I feel for her Ah if only the fairy prince would appear now she went on He would cause a golden chariot to take me home You see Alice hadn t gotten over being romantic even if she had cut her foot Oh my no and a diamond earring besides Well as true as I m telling you no sooner had she made that wish about the fairy prince than a voice called out Who is crying Does any one need help Yes replied Alice I do I ve cut my foot and I ve dented the butter in several places but that doesn t matter much and I ve spilled the cornmeal Oh what a lot of troubles for one poor little duck girl cried the voice again Perhaps I can help you and who should come along but Uncle Wiggily Longears the nice old gentleman rabbit Let us see what s the trouble he went on and he put his strongest spectacles over his nose and he looked at the cut in Alice s foot Then he cried Oh I should say that was a cut Oh my yes No doubt about it whatever But there don t cry he added for he saw some tears running down Alice s yellow bill I ll fix it for you So he got some nice soft leaves and he tied them on her sore foot with some stout grass Then she felt better but she couldn t walk and she didn t know how she was ever going to get home So she asked Uncle Wiggily Why the easiest thing in the world cried Uncle Wiggily All I have to do is to say a little verse and I ll think of a way So he said this little verse Wiggily waggily woggily wome How shall I get Alice home She has hurt herself quite much And she ll have to use my crutch Of course Uncle Wiggily knew that wasn t a very good verse but it was the best he could do You shall use my cornstalk crutch that Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy made for me he went on It will be just the thing Won t you need it asked Alice very politely No said Uncle Wiggily My rheumatism is much better to day You may have it and he fitted it under Alice s wing and she could walk pretty well not having to use her sore foot Then that kind old rabbit scraped up all the cornmeal and he put some in his big left ear and some in his big right ear because the bag was broken and he carried the dented butter which wasn t hurt the least mite Then they started for the duck pen and they reached it safely Alice limping along as well as she could And Uncle Wiggily told Mamma Wibblewobble about the accident after he had emptied his left ear and his right ear of the cornmeal and had handed over the dented butter doctor Possum was called in to put some salve on Alice s foot and she was soon better Now that s all to night but if the moving man doesn t take my typewriter away I shall tell you to morrow night about Jimmie in a tall tree STORY XXIII JIMMIE IN A TALL TREE It had rained in the morning and of course the grounds were too slippery and wet to play ball That is they were for Sammie Littletail and Billie and Johnnie Bushytail but naturally Jimmie Wibblewobble the boy duck and Bully the boy frog would not have minded the wet the least bit But there wasn t any ball game and so Jimmie was playing all alone in the woods back of his house and wishing it hadn t rained Oh I wish some of the boys would come over he said We could do something even if it is wet I m lonesome Just then he heard a voice singing in the woods and he heard the branches of the trees moving about and bits of bark falling off And this is the song he heard you have to sing it quite slowly to get the full effect Oh it is such fun if you see the sun When the rain has gone away If you ll come with me you may climb a tree And in the top we ll play Oh the winds may blow and the cows may crow But what care we for that As you scamper high near the bright blue sky Look out or you ll lose your hat And with that who should come scampering out of a tree but Billie and Johnnie Bushytail the squirrel brothers No Sister Sallie wasn t with them this time having stayed at home to wheel her corncob doll in the carriage her brothers had made for her Hello cried Billie and Johnnie Hello Jimmie Aw why didn t you chaps come over to play ball asked the little boy duck Oh it was too wet replied Johnnie But say Jimmie did you hear us singing Sure answered Jimmie But say cows don t crow I know it replied Johnnie Billie made up that verse and I made the first one He said he had to have something like that in it or it wouldn t be right But no matter Did you like it Yes pretty well Shall we sing it again asked Johnnie No don t begged his brother He s been singing it all the morning and I m getting tired of it even if I did make up one verse he explained But say Jimmie don t you wish you could climb a tall tree like this and before you could say Salimagundy or maybe incomprehensibility or even disproportionability why Billie had run to the top of the tree and down again Don t you wish you could he asked again Yes answered Jimmie looking up I wish I could climb a tree but I guess ducks weren t made for that I once tried to fly and I didn t succeed very well I ll stay on the ground I think Come on let s have a catch I ve got a ball No spoke Johnnie I have an idea Billie why can t you and I teach Jimmie to climb a tree If we pick out one with branches close together I m sure he could get up it We can help him and he can take hold of some limbs in his bill like a parrot takes hold of the wires in his cage Fine cried Billie Will you do it Jimmie Sure answered the little boy duck but he didn t know what was going to happen or maybe he wouldn t have tried to climb up Well the squirrels selected quite a tall tree but rather an easy one and Jimmie managed to scramble up to the first low limbs with Billie and Johnnie boosting him After that it wasn t quite so hard and he was able to get up quite a distance pulling himself with his yellow bill He was not very graceful and I m sure if you ever saw a duck climb a tree you would agree with me but finally after a great deal of hard work Jimmie was right on the top branch where the two squirrels sat blinking their eyes How do you like it asked Johnnie Fine cried Jimmie Quack Quack Quack Now when a duck says quack three times you may know he is very much pleased indeed Oh what a fine view Jimmie had but he didn t dare frisk around as Billie and Johnnie did for he was a trifle dizzy Then after he had been up there some time he thought he had better go down for the wind was blowing the treetop and he wasn t used to it So after Billie and Johnnie had sung their song again Jimmie started for the ground Well you know how it is yourself if you have ever climbed a tree It s easy to go up but it s hard to get down The limb for your feet is never where you think it is Poor Jimmie tried and Billie and Johnnie helped him but he didn t dare turn around to go down backward and that s the only way you can get down a tree unless you re a squirrel Then Jimmie began to get frightened He knew it was time for him to go home but it began getting darker and darker and darker and there he was right in the top of the tree as far away from the ground as ever He tried once more but he didn t dare let go of one branch with his bill while he put his foot down on another limb below and there he was Oh what an unpleasant situation to be in to say the least Oh I ll never get down cried Jimmie I wish I d stayed on the ground Billie and Johnnie began to get frightened too for it was partly their fault and they were just going off for some kind of help though what kind they didn t know when they heard a noise It was a swishing swooping swoshing noise and who should fly down out of the sky but that good kind fishhawk who once carried Billie and Johnnie on his big back to Lincoln Park As soon as the squirrels saw him they cried out Oh please help Jimmie Wibblewobble down He s in a tall tree and can t reach the ground Why of course to be sure replied the kind fishhawk and he alighted in the tree and Jimmie got upon his strong broad back and the fishhawk flew gently to the earth and that s how Jimmie got down And maybe he wasn t glad of it I know I am anyhow Now listen the moving man didn t get my typewriter after all so if we have cocoanut chocolate mustard apple pie cake for supper I can tell you a story to morrow night and it will be about the party Alice and Lulu had and what happened at it Something wonderful too let me tell you STORY XXIV 
8753-297962-0000	train-other-500	THE WIBBLEWOBBLES PARTY There was great excitement in the duck pen And the reason for it
none	none	 was that Lulu and Alice were going to have a party 
8753-297962-0001	train-other-500	It was the first party they had ever had
none	none	 and it was on their birthday 
8753-297962-0002	train-other-500	You see it was this way Lulu and Alice both had the same birthday that is they were twins Jimmie was a day older than they were and he wasn t a twin There now I ve explained it all to you and I ll get on with the story Well
8753-297962-0003	train-other-500	Mamma Wibblewobble arranged for the party She did all the baking and got the ice cream ready and made the pies and tarts and Alice and Lulu sent out the invitations
8753-297962-0004	train-other-500	They were written on nice little pieces of white birch bark that Johnnie and Billie Bushytail gnawed off the trees for the little duck girls Of course Johnnie and Billie were invited and so was Sammie Littletail and Susie and Sister Sallie
8753-297962-0005	train-other-500	and mister and missus Bushytail and mister and missus Littletail and Uncle Wiggily Longears and Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy and Grandfather Goosey Gander and Bully the frog and the goldfish and let me see who else Oh of course
8753-297962-0006	train-other-500	the fairy prince Alice would not have had him left out for anything
none	none	 Alice and Lulu had their best hair ribbons on and their new dresses and were all dressed up for the party nearly an hour before it was time 
8753-297962-0007	train-other-500	Jimmie got ready too That is he put on a clean collar and a new red necktie and he looked very nice But he really didn t care much about the party He said he and the boys would go off by themselves and talk about baseball No said his mother
8753-297962-0008	train-other-500	you must not do that I want you and the boys to entertain the little girls Be nice now Jimmie So Jimmie said he would and pretty soon the company began to come
none	none	 Bully the frog hopped along first and right after him came Grandfather Goosey Gander 
8753-297962-0009	train-other-500	and would you believe me he never said a word about Jimmie breaking his window that time We are very glad to see you said Alice and Lulu as they stood at the front door to receive their friends
8753-297962-0010	train-other-500	Aunt Lettie the nice old lady goat was also there and as the guests came up she called out Now girls walk right in the bedroom and put your things on the bed You boys take your things in Jimmie s room
none	none	 Oh it was a real party let me tell you 
8753-297962-0011	train-other-500	Uncle Wiggily was the last to arrive and you know why that was It was because his rheumatism hurt him so But he finally got there and then the party was complete that is all but the fairy prince and even the goldfish didn t know what had become of him
8753-297962-0012	train-other-500	First the boys all stayed on one side of the room and the girls on the other but when Alice said Let s play spin the platter
none	none	 they all cried out Oh yes let s do it And they used one of Mamma Wibblewobble s dishes for the platter and didn t break it a bit 
8753-297962-0013	train-other-500	Jimmie was it part of the time and so was Johnnie Bushytail Now let s play going to Jerusalem proposed Lulu and they did Grandfather Goosey Gander whistling through his bill just like a fife to make the music
8753-297962-0014	train-other-500	Then they played blind duck bluff and post office and clap in clap out and forfeits and
none	none	 oh such lots of games that I can hardly remember them 
8753-297962-0015	train-other-500	Oh yes there was one more puss in the corner and whom do you suppose was the puss Why the little kittie Lulu s little kittie you know that Aunt Lettie thought had come from the pussy willows When are we going to eat
8753-297962-0016	train-other-500	asked Bushytail after a while and he spoke out loud Hush cried Sister Sallie You mustn t ask that Billie it isn t polite
none	none	 Well I wanted to know said the little boy squirrel 
8753-297962-0017	train-other-500	Bless your heart exclaimed Aunt Lettie Of course you do It must be time to serve the refreshments I ll go ask missus Wibblewobble I don t want refreshments objected Billie in a whisper to Sister Sallie I m hungry and I want something to eat
none	none	 Hush cried his little sister again Refreshments are good things to eat 
8753-297962-0018	train-other-500	Oh said Billie and just then in came Mamma Wibblewobble and Aunt Lettie and missus Bushytail and missus Littletail and Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy all of whom helped serve the good things to eat
none	none	 Oh what a lot of refreshments there were including maple sugar 
8753-297962-0019	train-other-500	hickorynut ice cream and chocolate covered carrots and cornmeal made into little balls with cocoanut marshmallow on the outside and candied cabbage leaves and water cress flavored with spearmint
none	none	 and the land knows what Well those children at Alice s and Lulu s party ate so much it s a wonder that they ever got home They had a lovely time though Alice felt disappointed because the fairy prince didn t come and everyone wished Alice and Lulu many happy returns and Bully the frog said 
8753-297962-0020	train-other-500	When you have a party Jimmie I m coming to that too Sure answered Jimmie I ll have one next week if mamma will let me for you see he found he liked parties better than he thought he would Well they played some more games including one called hide the peanut
8753-297962-0021	train-other-500	and then it was time to go home and now comes the queer part of it Just as they were all saying good night and Uncle Wiggily was looking for his crutch there sounded out in the woods three blasts from a silver trumpet Ta ra ta ra ta ra
8753-297962-0022	train-other-500	You know just like when the procession starts in a circus and who should come riding up to the ducks house but a little boy all dressed in silver and gold with a long white plume in his hat and he was on a white horse
8753-297962-0023	train-other-500	Once more the trumpet sounded and the boy called out Am I too late for the party
none	none	 Yes you are said Uncle Wiggily leaning on his crutch which he found behind the door But who are you Illustration Me I am the fairy prince cried the boy and the trumpets blew again 
8753-297962-0024	train-other-500	What Not the mud turtle fairy prince asked Alice fanning herself so she wouldn t faint The very same answered the boy I got tired of being a mud turtle but I am still a fairy prince I don t believe it exclaimed Uncle Wiggily
8753-297962-0025	train-other-500	You are only a little boy on a horse and not a fairy prince at all Wait and you shall see cried the boy waving his hand and the silver trumpet blew again
none	none	 Ta ra ta ra ta ra 
8753-297962-0026	train-other-500	and the horse reared up on his hind legs I certainly am the fairy prince and to prove it I will do something wonderful Come to the woods to morrow Uncle Wiggily Longears and see What will I see asked Uncle Wiggily
8753-297962-0027	train-other-500	You will see a red fairy answered the boy who used to be mud turtle and the red fairy will do something wonderful for you Oh cried Uncle Wiggily I don t believe in fairies But all the same he had to after what happened for he went back to the woods and met a red fairy
none	none	 and the red fairy stopped Uncle Wiggily s rheumatism for a time as you can find out by reading the first book of this series entitled Sammie and Susie Littletail which tells a lot about two little rabbit children and their friends as well as about Uncle Wiggily Longears Now I ve reached the end of this story but there s another one for to morrow night in case you don t hit anybody with your bean shooter and it s going to be about Lulu and the Golden fairy STORY XXV LULU AND THE GOLDEN FAIRY Once upon a time it was raining very hard one morning It was just when Lulu and Alice and Jimmie Wibblewobble were looking out of the window of the duck pen getting ready for school Jimmie is your hair combed asked his mamma No ma am he answered but I m just going to comb it And did you brush your teeth No mamma but I m just going Now now Jimmie that s what you always say Hurry to the bathroom and clean your teeth at once or else there ll be a dentist coming to the school looking into your mouth and goodness knows what will happen then Hurry now or you ll be late Jimmie cleaned his teeth quickly and ran on to school so he wouldn t be late and get a bad mark What s that You didn t know ducks had teeth Well the next time you get a chance when a duck opens his mouth real wide you look in and maybe you ll see them They re very small I know but that doesn t count Well Lulu and Alice ran on ahead and Jimmie came following after He wasn t late at school because he met Bully the frog who hopped and so Jimmie had to run to keep up The little boy duck was the first one in the classroom and the teacher said Why Jimmie this is a delightful surprise You are not late this morning though you were every other day this week Yes ma am was all Jimmie said as he took his seat Well you should have seen it rain Honestly I don t know when it ever rained so hard before maybe not since the animals came out of the ark or the last time I wanted to go to a picnic Some of the kindergarten children got quite wet because you see they were so little that they couldn t hold their umbrellas up straight And even some of the high school girls got wet too but they didn t mind Jimmie and his sisters didn t need an umbrella for you know water always runs off a duck s back and doesn t do a bit of harm It rained when the duck children got home from school and it was still raining when missus Wibblewobble said My dears I don t like to ask you to go out in the storm again but I do wish you would run over to Grandfather Goosey Gander s house He is ill and I want to send him some hot watercress tea Now Alice didn t want to go because her foot that she once had cut on a stone pained her And Jimmie well no sooner had he gotten in the house and taken some bread and butter with jam on it than he had run out in the rain again to play with Bully the frog That left only Lulu to go to Grandfather Goosey Gander s house but she said she didn t mind in the least and afterward she was very glad she went for she saw a most wonderful sight Just you wait and I ll tell you about it So missus Wibblewobble put the hot tea in a tin pan and covered it over with a burdock leaf to keep the rain out and then she put some cold potatoes in a dish for she thought the old gentleman duck might like them as well Then Lulu started off through the woods to go to her grandfather s house It was still raining but she didn t mind and pretty soon oh maybe in about ten quacks she came to where mister Gander lived Well you would have felt sorry for him if you could have seen him There he was sitting on a stool with his feet in a pail of hot water and seven bottles of medicine on a table at his right wing and six bottles of pills on a table at his left wing and there was a blanket up around his neck and he had a nightcap on and he was groaning something terrible yes really he was Oh grandfather cried Lulu Are you very sick Yes he replied I am very sick I think I have the pip or maybe the epizoodic Which is worse asked Lulu as she set the hot tea and the cold potatoes on the table They are both worse answered the old gentleman duck That is they seem so when you have them both at once But I think I would feel better if I had a hot cornmeal poultice on the back of my neck Only I can t make it and put it there for I can t take my feet out of the hot water and I don t know where the cornmeal is and I m home all alone for my wife has gone shopping Oh I ll make it for you said Lulu very kindly I know where the cornmeal is So she went to get some and on the way to the meal box she began to think Wouldn t it be lovely if a blue fairy or a green one or a purple one or even a skilligimink colored one would appear now I would ask her to make grandfather better But I don t s pose one will come for I never have any luck seeing fairies and she sighed three times as she opened the cornmeal box Then all of a sudden as she lifted the cover as true as I m telling you if she didn t see something all glittering and shining down in one corner of the box At first she thought it was the yellow meal but then she saw that it was a little creature all gold with shimmering wings like those of a humming bird Oh cried Lulu are you a fairy Yes replied the little creature I am the golden cornmeal fairy I have been shut up here for ever and ever so long and I thought I would never get out But since you have let me out I will do anything in the world for you and she waved her golden wings and sang a jolly golden song about diamonds Will you cried Lulu Then please make my grandfather better for he is very sick and has to take thirteen kinds of medicine I will make him well said the fairy as she flew out of the box and it is very kind of you to ask that instead of something for yourself Now you make a nice hot poultice of this meal which is magical and put it on the back of his neck Then you say this fairy word Bibbilybab bilyboobily bag and see what happens But don t tell your grandfather I am a fairy in fact say nothing to any one about it for we fairies are going away for a time but we may come back later Then the golden fairy waved her wings and disappeared But Lulu did just as she had been told even to saying that magical word and my gracious if Grandfather Goosey Gander didn t get all well in a second and he thanked Lulu very much She felt sorry about the fairy disappearing so suddenly but you can t always have fairies you know Now if you girls don t lose your pink hair ribbon I ll tell you to morrow night about Jimmie and the black cow STORY XXVI JIMMIE AND THE BLACK COW Lulu Wibblewobble felt quite proud of having seen the golden fairy in the corn meal box In fact she was the only one of her family who saw a fairy for ever and ever so long after that because the fairies happened to go away from that part of the country Of course Lulu wondered how the tiny creature got into the meal box and she wondered if she might tell Alice and Jimmie about having seen her but she decided she had better not Now it was about a week after Lulu had taken Grandfather Goosey Gander the hot tea and the cold potatoes that something happened to Jimmie Wibblewobble It was one afternoon when he was on his way home from school and he was all alone for he had been kept in for missing his spelling lesson and all the other children had gone on You see he couldn t spell vinegar Of course that s an easy word I know but Jimmie didn t like sour things and I suppose that s why he missed vinegar He put the x and a k of the word in the wrong places Anyway he was kept in and he had to write ketchup on his paper fifty times Well after he was let out Jimmie started off through the woods and over the fields Pretty soon right after he was passing along a deep dark dingly dell which is a sort of little valley with flowers and ferns growing in it he heard a bell ring Ding dong Ding dong Ding dong went the bell At first Jimmie thought he was near a church but just then the bell rang differently This time it went Tinkle tankle Tinkle tankle Tinkle tank just like that Why exclaimed Jimmie I wonder what that can be Then he went on a little farther and he came out of the deep dark dingle dell and he heard the bell more plainly still This time it rang very rapidly and right after it Jimmie heard a loud voice calling Moo Moo Moo Help me will you will you Why cried Jimmie That s a cow Then in another moment he came from behind a big tree and what should he see but a big black cow standing in a swamp The cow was shaking her head and shaking her horns at the same time and ringing the bell which was fastened around her neck by a strap and she was mooing as hard as she could moo Why what s the matter asked Jimmie wobbling up quite close to her What ever is the matter Lots and lots is the matter answered the cow But aren t you afraid of me little boy duck afraid of me and my sharp horns Why no answered Jimmie after he had thought it over for a minute or two I don t believe I am afraid of you Why should I be afraid No reason at all none in the world replied the cow But since I m in trouble so many creatures seem to be afraid of me I saw a frog hopping past and I asked him to help me but I guess he was afraid I d step on him so he wouldn t come near but hopped off as far as he could That must have been Bully said Jimmie He s afraid of lots of things But maybe he was in a hurry he added for he did not want to say that Bully was afraid if the frog wasn t frightened you know Well agreed the cow maybe he was Then a rabbit boy hopped past and I asked him to help me but he was afraid too That must have been Sammie Littletail said Jimmie But I don t believe he was afraid Sammie is very brave Maybe he was in a hurry Well admitted the cow maybe he was But then two little squirrel boys came along and I asked them to help me but they ran away frisking their tails I guess they were afraid No answered Jimmie they weren t afraid They were Billie and Johnnie Bushytail and the reason they ran was to get some one to help you for they are very kind Maybe Bully and Sammie will bring some one to help you also But what seems to be the matter My foot is caught under a stone said the cow and she blinked her big brown eyes as fast as she could In fact they opened and shut so rapidly that big tears came from them and splashed down her nose Oh I am so sorry cried Jimmie Your foot caught under a stone Wait a minute Hold on exclaimed the cow That is not the worst of it You have not heard all My foot is under a stone and the stone is under water so I can t see to get my foot out That s why I feel so badly about it You can see for yourself Johnnie My name is Jimmie said the little boy duck quickly Well Jimmie then went on the cow You can see for yourself how it is or rather you can t see for the water is in the way and then Jimmie noticed that one of the cow s hoofs was down in a puddle of water and no matter how hard she pulled she couldn t get loose from that stone no sir any more than you can tie a string to one of your teeth and get the tooth loose that is not counting a tooth that needs pulling of course Well remarked Jimmie after he had looked very carefully at the puddle where the cow s foot was it s too bad It certainly is agreed the cow You see if the stone wasn t under water I could see to loosen it with my horn but as it is I can t and I ve tried several times and she tried once more just to show she was telling the truth I ve been here some time the cow went on and no one seems able to help me and she mooed some more and the bell tinkled some more and more of her tears fell splish splash in the puddle of water making it bigger than ever I will help you cried Jimmie suddenly I am a duck and I know all about water So he jumped right in that puddle and he commenced to splash with his wings and his yellow feet and my goodness gracious sakes alive if in about two quacks he didn t have all the water splashed out of that hole where the poor cow s foot was fast Then the cow could see to loosen the stone with her horn and she could walk home And because Jimmie was so kind she gave him a pail of milk to take to the duck pen for Alice and Lulu Now to morrow night the story will be about Alice and the puppy dogs providing the automobile does not turn upside down and spill me out STORY XXVII ALICE AND THE PUPPY DOGS Alice Wibblewobble had been over to pay a visit to Sister Sallie the little squirrel sister of Johnnie and Billie Bushytail and she had ever so much fun and a good time and such a nice supper ending up with butternut ice cream with maple sugar for dessert Well before Alice knew it night had come and it was all dark Oh dear she cried I didn t know it was so late Are you afraid to go home in the dark asked missus Bushytail No not exactly answered Alice but you see it s so dark I might tumble into a hole or cut my foot again on a sharp stone I m not exactly afraid of the dark but Oh I understand said Mamma Bushytail But I hardly know what to do she went on My husband is away this evening or he would take you home and Billie and Johnnie are over at Grandpa Lightfoot s and I m so busy getting through my spring housecleaning and sewing a new dress for Sister Sallie that I don t believe I could spare the time to go Oh I wouldn t think of asking you spoke Alice quickly but she looked out into the dark and she didn t feel very happy even if she had just eaten a large plate of butternut ice cream Couldn t you stay all night my dear asked Sister Sallie s mother No I m afraid my mamma would worry replied Alice Perhaps Jimmie will come for you pretty soon suggested Sister Sallie and then she hummed that little verse about going hippity hop to the barber shop to buy a lolly pop lally You remember it I dare say Maybe he will agreed Alice so she and Sister Sallie played another game but it got darker and darker and no Jimmie came and then Alice knew she must start for home or her papa and mamma would be worried But she didn t like to go out in the black night and she was almost ready to cry and didn t know what to do when all of a sudden Sister Sallie called out Oh mamma I know the very thing I ll run next door to where missus Bow Wow lives and ask her to send Jackie and Peetie home with Alice Who are Peetie and Jackie asked the little girl duck They are puppy dogs replied Sister Sallie and the cutest ones you ever saw Oh they are darlings They ll go home with you through the woods because they are very brave Some day they will grow to be big dogs and guard the house I ll ask missus Bow Wow their mamma to let them take you home That will be a good plan agreed missus Bushytail Run in and ask missus Bow Wow Sister Sallie So Sister Sallie ran in next door and pretty soon she came back with two of the cutest puppy dogs Alice had ever seen Which one is Peetie and which one is Jackie Alice asked as they tumbled about on the floor getting up and falling down again I am Peetie answered one You can tell that because I am all white with a black spot on my nose And I am Jackie said his brother I am all black with a white spot on my nose So you see it is easy to tell us apart Yes agreed Alice with a laugh I see that is I would see if you kept still long enough only you don t for you wiggle and tumble about so much But will you please take me home Of course we will answered Jackie rubbing the black spot on his brother s nose with his paw Just then if those two puppy dogs didn t see one of Papa Bushytail s boots and land sakes alive if one didn t grab one end and one the other end and they began to pull and growl Puppy dogs always do such things you know Oh Oh You mustn t do that cried Mamma Bushytail You must take Alice home We will answered Peetie rubbing the black spot on his own nose with his little white paw We were only doing this for practice Come on Alice Bow wow Bow wow So pretty soon after a while oh not so very long Alice started for the duck pen with Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow tumbling over each other in their eagerness to see which would walk at her right wing and which at her left Well weren t those puppy dogs brave though to go out in the dark night They never thought anything about it really any more than you mind going to bed in the dark Then all of a sudden as they were walking through a very dismal place in the woods Jackie began to growl Oh don t do that cried Alice you frighten me Did you see a burglar or a wolf Why I only growled because I smelled a bone said Jackie and he laughed and fell over and over turning a complete somersault I smelled the bone first cried Peetie and I m going to have it Then the two of them made a rush for the nice juicy bone and they each got hold of it and began to pull one on one end and one on the other and they fell down and slipped and stumbled all over in the darkness getting mixed up in the leaves growling and snarling but of course it was all in fun you know for the puppy dogs loved each other Oh don t do that Peetie begged Alice touching one of the puppy dogs with her foot Don t tumble about so Peetie I m not Peetie I m Jackie was the answer Can t you tell by the white spot on my nose Peetie has a black spot I can t see very well in the dark replied Alice Then something very funny happened for when Jackie opened his mouth to speak to Alice he had to let go of the bone and of course Peetie ran off with it and hid it But that was a good thing for they couldn t pull on it any more and when Peetie came back they both rubbed noses and went on through the dark woods taking Alice home They had only one accident That is they fell down a hole but they weren t hurt at all I m glad to say Then when Alice was safe in the duckpen the puppy dogs ran back home and went right to sleep Now if you don t spill the salt in the sugar bowl I m going to tell you to morrow night about Jimmie and Jackie STORY XXVIII JIMMIE AND JACKIE BOW WOW When Alice reached the duckpen that night after she had gone visiting Sister Sallie and was brought home by the puppy dogs she told her folks all about it Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow eh remarked Jimmie her brother when she had told their names I never heard of them They must be new around here They are answered Alice But they are just as cute as they can be really they are Cute eh asked Jimmie Can they play ball I don t know replied his sister But you ought to see them pull on that old boot and the bone Oh it was too funny And they took good care of you didn t they asked Lulu Indeed they did answered Alice They weren t afraid of anything even when an owl hooted So the next day which was Saturday when there wasn t any school Jimmie started off with his wooden bat over his shoulder his catching glove under one wing and his ball under the other Where are you going asked his mother I m going over to missus Bow Wow s house to see if I can find the puppy dogs he said I want to get acquainted with them All right Jimmie but be sure to wipe your feet if you go in missus Bow Wow s house and don t forget to take off your cap and say yes ma am and no ma am Jimmie S posin she doesn t ask me anything inquired Jimmie What ll I say Well then of course you needn t say anything but be polite warned the little boy duck s mother for sometimes he forgot though he didn t mean to Well he was walking along through the woods and over the green fields where the dandelions were just coming up looking like buttons on a policeman s coat if the policeman s coat was green instead of blue and I think green would be a nice color But no matter about that Jimmie was walking along when all of a sudden he heard a little growl At first he thought it was the bad fox after him again but in a moment he saw a little black ball of fur rolling along and then he saw a little white spot and he thought that might be Sammie Littletail only he knew the rabbit boy never growled Then all at once if that ball of fur didn t unroll and there stood a puppy dog Hello called Jimmie Wibblewobble real friendly like Hello answered the puppy dog Are you Peetie or Jackie Bow Wow asked the little boy duck for he knew the puppy dog must be one or the other I m Jackie was the answer Can t you tell I m all black with a white spot on my nose and my brother Peetie is all white with a black spot on his nose See I m black with a black spot no I mean I m black with a white spot and Jackie he s black no hold on he s white no I m Jackie and he s Peetie he s white with a white no a black spot Oh for mercy sakes stop cried Jimmie I m all tangled up with white spots and black spots So am I admitted Jackie It s hard to tell who I am sometimes Is it really asked Jimmie Yes it is In fact I m mixed up now Would you kindly look and tell me if I have a white or a black spot on my nose I could look myself only it makes me cross eyed and I don t like that So Jimmie looked very carefully and he saw a white spot on the puppy dog s nose and told him so It s all right I m Jackie then answered the little fellow I thought I was but it s best to make sure Can you play ball asked Jimmie My sister told me about you It was very kind of you to bring her home You haven t lived here very long have you Not very But I m glad I could help your sister She is a nice girl Where s your brother Peetie asked Jimmie Oh he s gone to the store for mamma Then let s you and I have a catch until he comes back You can play ball can t you Of course So Jimmie tossed the ball to Jackie and the puppy dog stood up on his hind legs and caught it in his front paws and then he fell right over ker thump and rolled along the ground Here cried the boy duck That s no way to play ball You must stand up and catch Oh I know that declared Jackie You see I was only practising at biting the ball with my teeth I always bite things to sharpen my teeth so I can gnaw big bones when I get to be a big dog Well you needn t sharpen your teeth on my new ball cried Jimmie and he felt a little angry not much you know but a little and he took the ball and was going home for he didn t like Jackie he thought It was too bad the little creatures had had a falling out so soon but please wait just a moment and see what happens No sooner had Jimmie started to go home Jackie didn t know why you see for he didn t know it was wrong to bite the ball no sooner I say did Jimmie start home than out from the bushes jumped a great big water rat with ugly cruel sharp teeth and wicked eyes Oh how frightened Jimmie was for he knew big water rats ate ducks But what do you suppose Jackie that puppy dog did Why he just growled away down in his throat and he stuck up one ear as far as it would go and he let the other ear fall down as far as it would fall and he opened his mouth and he showed his teeth that he had sharpened on Jimmie s ball and he jumped right at that bad rat Yes sir right at him growling all the while At first the rat was going to fight but when it saw how brave Jackie was it turned and ran away And then that puppy dog just put his little tail between his legs and howled and ran away too Jimmie waddling after him You see Jackie was frightened after it was all over but he had frightened the rat worse yet How brave you were cried Jimmie when they were at missus Bow Wow s house You were very brave indeed Do you really think so asked Jackie Then I must be You can bite my ball all you want to went on Jimmie and then Peetie came home from the store and they all had a fine time playing catch Now to morrow night I m going to tell you about Grandfather Goosey Gander s tall hat if I don t lose a penny off the front stoop STORY XXIX GRANDFATHER GOOSEY GANDER S TALL HAT Jimmie Wibblewobble was in the back lots playing ball with Billie and Johnnie Bushytail Sammie Littletail and Bully the frog besides some other friends of his They were having a fine time knocking the ball this way and that just as if the ball didn t care what happened to it When it came Jimmie s turn to bat he called out Watch me knock it away over the tree and land sakes goodness me and a pop corn cake if that ball didn t fly away over the tree just like a little bird Well Jimmie was pretty proud I can tell you and he was such a good hitter that Bully said Let Jimmie knock some more balls for us to catch So he did after Billie Bushytail had run to get the one that went over the tree and brought it back Well so the game went on and pretty soon oh I guess it must have been about as long as it takes to eat two pieces of bread and butter but not with jam on mind you I guess in about that time it was Billie Bushytail s turn to bat And just as he stepped up to hit the ball if all the boy animals didn t see something black moving along by the hedge fence It was black and round and shiny this moving object was and as soon as Sammie Littletail saw it he cried out Oh there s a bad fox Let s see who can hit him So they all caught up stones to throw at the bad fox to drive him away Jimmie had the largest stone and he could throw the straightest so it is no wonder he hit the tall round shining black thing by the hedge But this is the funny part of it that black thing wasn t a fox at all No siree It was Grandfather Goosey Gander s new tall hat and that wasn t at all funny I do assure you And the worst part of it was that Grandfather Goosey Gander was under that hat For you know a tall hat couldn t walk along by a hedge all alone its own self now could it Of course I know it could if this were a fairy story but it isn t Illustration Well something dreadful happened The stone which Jimmie threw hit grandfather s tall hat went inside just grazing the top of the old gentleman duck s head and then what do you think Well I don t believe you could guess if you tried a week so I ll tell you That stone came out on the other side It went right through the hat making a hole where it went in and another hole where it came out Two holes you could easily have counted them if you had been there Of course as soon as Jimmie heard the noise made by the stone which he threw hitting the hat he could tell by the plinkity plunkity sound that there was going to be trouble And there was Grandfather Goosey Gander jumped up in the air He uttered a loud quack and then he took off his tall hat He looked at the two ragged holes in it and then he looked over at the boys in the field He knew right away they had done it but he didn t know which one Jimmie however was a good boy and he wasn t going to have any one else blamed for what he had done So he ran to where his grandfather stood sorrowfully looking at his hat and Jimmie said I did it grandpa I cannot tell a story I did it with my little stone Ha Hum Did you eh cried Grandfather Goosey Gander Well that s a pretty bad thing to do Jimmie This is my best hat I put it on to go down to the bank to put money in I mean to put money in the bank not in the hat of course I always wear it when I go to the bank so folks will know I am rich Now I can t wear it any more It s too bad And the old gentleman duck looked very sorrowful Yes agreed Jimmie it is too bad for he couldn t think of anything else to say You will have to pay for a new hat for me went on his grandfather I haven t any money said Jimmie and tears began to run down his broad yellow bill for the little boy duck felt pretty bad I can tell you You will have to save up all the pennies you get decided Grandfather Goosey Gander Boys should not be so careless We thought you were a fox said Billie Bushytail And we all threw stones at you added Sammie Littletail But I m the only one who hit your hat though admitted Jimmie Do I look like a fox demanded the old duck That s what I want to know Do I look like a fox Well of course you know he didn t and the ball players had to admit it You will have to pay for my hat Jimmie grandpa continued looking again at two ragged holes Have you any money now No said Jimmie and he was crying real hard by this time Then all the other boys felt badly too and they were just looking in their pockets to see if they had any money but they hadn t All they had was some marbles and tops and broken knives and chewing gum all sticky and some strings Then it began to look as if Grandfather Goosey Gander would never have a new hat but all at once there was a buzzing sound in the air and what should come flying along but a darning needle You know what I mean one of those funny long bugs sometimes called a dragon fly with beautiful wings and long legs and body What is the trouble asked the darning needle and then the boys told him about the broken hat Ah said the darning needle careless like do not distress yourself Jimmie I know you are a good boy To fix that hat is a mere trifle for me and I ll do it And what did that dragon fly darning needle do but buzz back and forth all around the holes in Grandfather Goosey Gander s tall hat right through the hat itself until he had the holes all sewed up and you could hardly tell where they were Then missus Spider came along and she spun some glossy silk web over the places where the seams were and presto chango if that hat wasn t as good as ever Well you can just imagine how glad Jimmie was that he didn t have to pay for it And his grandpa was pleased too and so were the boys Then the darning needle flew away missus Spider crawled off Grandfather Goosey Gander went to the bank the boys played ball some more and everything was lovely Now if the window curtain doesn t fly up lickety split and come off the roller I ll tell you to morrow night about Jimmie flying a kite STORY XXX JIMMIE WIBBLEWOBBLE S KITE Jimmie Wibblewobble was out flying his kite He had made it all himself out of sticks and paste and paper and strings and it was a very fine kite indeed It was nearly as large as the little boy duck and it was the kind of a kite that doesn t need a tail That was good because a tail gets all tangled up in the weeds Well Jimmie was flying his kite and the wind was pretty strong and the kite was pulling real hard just like a little dog pulls when you tie a rope to his collar and he wants to get away Pretty soon along came Bully the frog Does your kite pull much he asked Does it replied Jimmie Well I should say it did Let me hold it a minute will you asked Bully and Jimmie very kindly let him Then along came Billie and Johnnie Bushytail and Sammie Littletail and they all took turns holding the kite Well now in a few minutes something dreadful is going to happen to Jimmie I tell you in advance so you won t be frightened and really there is no need to be for I ll see to it that after the thing happens Jimmie will be all right again Now if you watch and listen closely you can tell the moment the thing happens It s almost time The wind kept growing stronger and stronger and it blew the dust up in a cloud and it blew bits of paper and sticks along with the dust and raised a dreadful commotion Then long came Alice and Lulu Wibblewobble They had been to the store for their mamma and had just come back They felt the strong wind blowing on their feathers and Alice said to her brother You had better take down your kite Jimmie The wind may blow it away and you with it Oh I guess I can hold it answered the little boy duck as he let out some more cord The kite was now almost out of sight and it was pulling harder than ever Then all at once if Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow the two puppy dogs didn t come along Jackie had his white spot on his nose and Peetie had his black spot on his nose so that you could tell them apart And those two doggies felt so full of fun that they ran right up and made believe bite Jimmie s yellow heels Now you know it feels queer to have two puppy dogs biting your heels even if it is only in fun and as soon as Jimmie felt Jackie and Peetie nipping him he turned around quickly and cried out Oh don t do that But the minute he looked around if the kite string didn t get tangled in his legs and then if the wind didn t blow a regular strong blast the kind that howls down the chimney on a cold night and oh dear me suz dud if Jimmie wasn t carried right up in the air by his kite There I told you something would happen and it did Maybe you ll believe me next time Well up and up and up went Jimmie pulled by the kite until he was quite high in the air hanging dingling dangling down O by his yellow heels Oh it was a perfectly dreadful position to be in really it was and I m not fooling a bit honestly Oh oh Save him cried Lulu Yes somebody get him down please do added Alice flapping her wings Billie Bushytail tried to jump up in the air and grab hold of poor Jimmie but he couldn t reach him and then Sammie Littletail he tried but he couldn t reach him and all the while poor Jimmie was being carried higher and higher by the kite Save me Oh save me he cried but there didn t seem to be any way of getting him down and it began to look as if he would go right up to the sky On the ground Lulu and Alice were running here and there flapping their wings and quacking and Billie and Johnnie Bushytail were chattering and as for Sammie Littletail he made a noise just like a rabbit Oh there was great excitement I can tell you mister Cock A Doodle the rooster he came running out and he crowed as loud as ever he could crow as if that could do any good Then he flapped his wings as hard as he could and that didn t do any good either Jimmie kept going farther and farther away Oh will no one save him asked Lulu crying big tears Wait a minute I ll try it said Bully the frog I am a good jumper and I ll jump up Maybe I can pull the kite down So he jumped up as high as ever he could but it wasn t nearly high enough and Bully came back on the ground ker thump ker bump and Jimmie Wibblewobble kept on going up Poor Bully hurt his ankle too and he was lame for some days Run and tell Grandfather Goosey Gander cried Lulu Maybe he can think up a way of getting Jimmie down So they all ran and told the old gentleman duck for mister and missus Wibblewobble were away that afternoon Grandfather Goosey Gander hurried out and he squinted up at Jimmie who looked only about as big as a baby chicken now he was so far away and then the Grandfather flapped his wings Nothing can save him said Grandfather Goosey Gander very solemnly Jimmie has gone to the sky Then oh how badly Lulu and Alice felt for their little brother and all the others felt badly too for they liked Jimmie But don t get excited now All will be well in a very few minutes Do not fear Bully the frog made one more jump hoping to reach the kite and pull it down but he might as well have tried to jump over the moon which only a hey diddle diddle cat and the fiddle cow can do Well it looked as if Jimmie was gone for ever when all at once there was a rushing of wings and who should appear but a kind fish hawk that once gave Johnnie and Billie Bushytail a ride on his back I will save Jimmie cried the fish hawk So he flew up in the air right to the kite and with his strong beak he tore a hole in the paper to let the air through Then the kite came gently down just like a red balloon or maybe a blue one that you get at the circus and some one sticks a pin in it Yes the kite came gently down and Jimmie came with it and that s how he was saved And maybe he wasn t glad Well I just guess and some cornstarch pudding besides Of course Peetie and Jackie were very sorry for biting Jimmie s heels and never did it again Now if I don t get stung by a bee I ll tell you to morrow night about Alice in a bag Illustration STORY XXXI 
8753-297969-0000	train-other-500	ALICE WIBBLEWOBBLE IN A BAG You remember I told you last night about Jimmie Wibblewobble being carried up by a kite
none	none	 Well when his papa and mamma came home that evening they heard all about it and how much excitement there was and they told Jimmie he must be more particular after this 
8753-297969-0001	train-other-500	He promised that he would be very careful I ll fly smaller kites he said
none	none	 and he went out the next time with one about the size of a postage stamp and that couldn t take any one up in the air you know except maybe a mosquito and they don t count Well it was about two days after this that something happened to Alice You see she had been sent to the store for a yeast cake and some prunes 
8753-297969-0002	train-other-500	for her mamma was going to make prune bread that is bread with prunes in it and it s very nice I assure you for I ve eaten it As Alice was coming home through a lonely part of the woods where the trees were so thick that it was almost dark
8753-297969-0003	train-other-500	she began to feel a little bit frightened So to stop herself from feeling scared she began to sing
none	none	 If she had been a boy she would have shouted or if she had been Lulu she would have whistled for Lulu could whistle as good as could Jimmie 
8753-297969-0004	train-other-500	But instead Alice sang and this is the song she made up so she wouldn t be frightened You are allowed to sing it if you are not more than seven and three quarters years old If you are any older than that you will have to have a special excuse
8753-297969-0005	train-other-500	or some one else will have to sing it for you Well this is the song I m not afraid to wander In woodlands dark and drear
none	none	 For who is there to harm me When not a soul is near 
8753-297969-0006	train-other-500	The birds the trees and flowers Are kind as kind can be I m sure that not a single one Would do a thing to me The bugs and pretty butterflies Will form a fairy band And guard me safely while I walk Throughout this dark woodland
8753-297969-0007	train-other-500	But just the same I ll hurry And not stay here too long Because you see I only know Two verses of this song Well as soon as Alice finished singing
none	none	 land sakes goodness gracious me if a big fox didn t pop out from behind a tree and before Alice could say How do you do or even Good afternoon or anything like that if he didn t grab her by the legs and put her into a bag he carried over his shoulder and then he tied the bag tight and started to run away Oh Oh cried Alice Let me out Please let me out of this bag mister Fox and I ll give you all the money I ve got saved up in my bank Honest I will every cent in my bank 
8753-297969-0008	train-other-500	No answered the fox savagely
none	none	 I don t want your money 
8753-297969-0009	train-other-500	What good would money be to me I can t eat money Ha ha ha and he laughed that way three times just like a mooley cow
8753-297969-0010	train-other-500	Are you going to eat me asked Alice from inside the bag where she was trembling so that she squashed the yeast cake all out as flat as a pancake on a cold winter morning when you have brown sausage gravy and maple syrup to pour on it Eat you
none	none	 Of course I m going to eat you cried the fox That is why I caught you 
8753-297969-0011	train-other-500	But I can t decide whether to have you boiled or roasted It s quite trying not to know I must make up my mind soon however Then he ran on some more over the hills bumpity bump
none	none	 with poor Alice jouncing around in that bag and the little duck girl wished the fox would be a long time making up his mind which way to cook her for she thought that maybe Jimmie might come and save her in the meanwhile It didn t do much good to sing that song thought Alice and I suppose it didn t but you know you can t always have what you want in this world Oh my no and a bottle of cough medicine besides 
8753-297969-0012	train-other-500	Well the old fox hurried on with Alice in the bag and he ran fast to get to his den and pretty soon the little duck girl felt him coming to a stop Then she heard some one saying
none	none	 Ah good day mister Fox 
8753-297969-0013	train-other-500	what have you in that bag I have apples in this bag said the fox Oh but wasn t he the bold bad story telling fox though Apples eh asked the voice again
8753-297969-0014	train-other-500	and then Alice knew right away who it was Can you guess No Well I ll tell you It was Nurse Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy the kind old muskrat lady It was she who had asked the question Oh so you have apples in there
8753-297969-0015	train-other-500	Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy repeated to the fox Well now do you know she went on I am very fond of apples
none	none	 I wish you would give me one 
8753-297969-0016	train-other-500	No answered the bad fox I can t
none	none	 These are very special apples very sour in fact and I m sure you wouldn t like them Oh I just love sour apples said the muskrat 
8753-297969-0017	train-other-500	moving nearer to the fox and showing her sharp teeth like the carpenter s chisel when he shaves the door down to make it smaller I just love sour apples said the nurse Oh
8753-297969-0018	train-other-500	I made a mistake these are sweet apples said the fox quickly waggling his big tail like a dusting brush I made a mistake too went on Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy I guess I love sweet apples instead of sour ones
8753-297969-0019	train-other-500	You will have to excuse me again spoke the fox quickly
none	none	 I made two mistakes These apples are half sweet and half sour and not good at all If there is anything I am fonder of than anything else it s a half sweet and a half sour apple 
8753-297969-0020	train-other-500	declared the muskrat and she showed her teeth some more as if she were smiling only she wasn t She was getting ready to bite the bad fox I guess
none	none	 Just then Alice moved around in the bag hoping Miss Fuzzy Wuzzy would see her 
8753-297969-0021	train-other-500	and what s more the kind muskrat nurse did Ah she exclaimed you have moving apples I see I just love moving apples
none	none	 Then the fox knew it was of no use to tell any more stories so he started to hurry off with Alice in the bag But Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy jumped right at him 
8753-297969-0022	train-other-500	and she bit him on the nose and on his front legs and on his hind legs until he was glad enough to drop the bag containing poor Alice and run away over the hills as fast as he could go Then the muskrat gnawed open the bag and Alice came out her feathers all ruffled up
8753-297969-0023	train-other-500	but she was not much hurt only the yeast cake was all squashed out of shape like a piece of putty Then Jane Fuzzy Wuzzy took Alice home safely and nothing more happened right away Well now to morrow night let s see Ha Hum Oh
8753-297969-0024	train-other-500	how careless of me Of course there isn t going to be any story to morrow night because we re at the end of this book You can see for yourself if you look carefully that there are no more stories in it not a single one But listen as the telephone girl says
none	none	 I think in case that you liked the stories about the ducks that I will write something about the adventures of Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow you know those two puppy dogs who once took Alice home after she had been on a visit to Sister Sallie and was afraid to go out in the dark I have quite a number of stories about those two puppy dogs Peetie you know who was all white with a black spot on his nose and Jackie who was all black with a white spot on his nose 
8753-297969-0025	train-other-500	So if you want to read about them you may do so in the next book of the Bed Time series which will be called Jackie and Peetie Bow Wow and the book will have in it some pictures of the doggies and tell how they had a show and built a swing
8753-297969-0026	train-other-500	and got lost and ran away to join a circus and did ever so many things that it was really astonishing honestly it was Well I think I ll say good night now
