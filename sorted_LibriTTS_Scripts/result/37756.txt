The End Of A Long Tale thirteen seventy fourteen fifty three Table Of Emperors Index Footnotes Illustration Interior of saint Sophia PREFACE Fifty years ago the word Byzantine was used as a synonym for all that was corrupt and decadent and the tale of the East Roman Empire was dismissed by modern historians as depressing and monotonous The great Gibbon had branded the successors of Justinian and Heraclius as a series of vicious weaklings and for several generations no one dared to contradict him Two books have served to undeceive the English reader the monumental work of Finlay published in eighteen fifty six and the more modern volumes of mister Bury which appeared in eighteen eighty nine Since they have written the Byzantines no longer need an apologist and the great work of the East Roman Empire in holding back the Saracen and in keeping alive throughout the Dark Ages the lamp of learning is beginning to be realized The writer of this book has endeavoured to tell the story of Byzantium in the spirit of Finlay and Bury not in that of Gibbon He wishes to acknowledge his debts both to the veteran of the war of Greek Independence and to the young Dublin professor Without their aid his task would have been very heavy with it the difficulty was removed The author does not claim to have grappled with all the chroniclers of the Eastern realm but thinks that some acquaintance with Ammianus Procopius Maurice s Strategikon Leo the Deacon Leo the Wise Constantine Porphyrogenitus Anna Comnena and Nicetas may justify his having undertaken the task he has essayed OXFORD February eighteen ninety two Illustration I BYZANTIUM Two thousand five hundred and fifty eight years ago a little fleet of galleys toiled painfully against the current up the long strait of the Hellespont rowed across the broad Propontis and came to anchor in the smooth waters of the first inlet which cuts into the European shore of the Bosphorus There a long crescent shaped creek which after ages were to know as the Golden Horn strikes inland for seven miles forming a quiet backwater from the rapid stream which runs outside On the headland enclosed between this inlet and the open sea a few hundred colonists disembarked and hastily secured themselves from the wild tribes of the inland by running some rough sort of a stockade across the ground from beach to beach Thus was founded the city of Byzantium The settlers were Greeks of the Dorian race natives of the thriving seaport state of Megara one of the most enterprising of all the cities of Hellas in the time of colonial and commercial expansion which was then at its height Wherever a Greek prow had cut its way into unknown waters there Megarian seamen were soon found following in its wake One band of these venturesome traders pushed far to the West to plant colonies in Sicily but the larger share of the attention of Megara was turned towards the sunrising towards the mist enshrouded entrance of the Black Sea and the fabulous lands that lay beyond There as legends told was to be found the realm of the Golden Fleece the Eldorado of the ancient world where kings of untold wealth reigned over the tribes of Colchis there dwelt by the banks of the river Thermodon the Amazons the warlike women who had once vexed far off Greece by their inroads there too was to be found if one could but struggle far enough up its northern shore the land of the Hyperboreans the blessed folk who dwell behind the North Wind and know nothing of storm and winter To seek these fabled wonders the Greeks sailed ever North and East till they had come to the extreme limits of the sea The riches of the Golden Fleece they did not find nor the country of the Hyperboreans nor the tribes of the Amazons but they did discover many lands well worth the knowing and grew rich on the profits which they drew from the metals of Colchis and the forests of Paphlagonia from the rich corn lands by the banks of the Dnieper and Bug and the fisheries of the Bosphorus and the Maeotic Lake Presently the whole coastland of the sea which the Greeks on their first coming called Axeinos the Inhospitable became fringed with trading settlements and its name was changed to Euxeinos the Hospitable in recognition of its friendly ports It was in a similar spirit that two thousand years later the seamen who led the next great impulse of exploration that rose in Europe turned the name of the Cape of Storms into that of the Cape of Good Hope The Megarians almost more than any other Greeks devoted their attention to the Euxine and the foundation of Byzantium was but one of their many achievements Already seventeen years before Byzantium came into being another band of Megarian colonists had established themselves at Chalcedon on the opposite Asiatic shore of the Bosphorus The settlers who were destined to found the greater city applied to the oracle of Delphi to give them advice as to the site of their new home and Apollo we are told bade them build their town over against the city of the blind They therefore pitched upon the headland by the Golden Horn reasoning that the Chalcedonians were truly blind to have neglected the more eligible site on the Thracian shore in order to found a colony on the far less inviting Bithynian side of the strait Illustration Early Coin Of Byzantium Illustration Late Coin Of Byzantium Showing Crescent And Star From the first its situation marked out Byzantium as destined for a great future Alike from the military and from the commercial point of view no city could have been better placed Looking out from the easternmost headland of Thrace with all Europe behind it and all Asia before it was equally well suited to be the frontier fortress to defend the border of the one or the basis of operations for an invasion from the other As fortresses went in those early days it was almost impregnable two sides protected by the water the third by a strong wall not commanded by any neighbouring heights In all its early history Byzantium never fell by storm famine or treachery accounted for the few occasions on which it fell into the hands of an enemy In its commercial aspect the place was even more favourably situated It completely commanded the whole Black Sea trade every vessel that went forth from Greece or Ionia to traffic with Scythia or Colchis the lands by the Danube mouth or the shores of the Maeotic Lake had to pass close under its walls so that the prosperity of a hundred Hellenic towns on the Euxine was always at the mercy of the masters of Byzantium The Greek loved short stages and frequent stoppages and as a half way house alone Byzantium would have been prosperous but it had also a flourishing local trade of its own with the tribes of the neighbouring Thracian inland and drew much profit from its fisheries so much so that the city badge its coat of arms as we should call it comprised a tunny fish as well as the famous ox whose form alluded to the legend of the naming of the Bosphorus one As an independent state Byzantium had a long and eventful history For thirty years it was in the hands of the kings of Persia but with that short exception it maintained its freedom during the first three hundred years that followed its foundation Many stirring scenes took place beneath its walls it was close to them that the great Darius threw across the Bosphorus his bridge of boats which served as a model for the more famous structure on which his son Xerxes crossed the Hellespont Fifteen years later when Byzantium in common with all its neighbours made an ineffectual attempt to throw off the Persian yoke in the rising called the Ionic Revolt it was held for a time by the arch rebel Histiaeus who as much to enrich himself as to pay his seamen invented strait dues He forced every ship passing up or down the Bosphorus to pay a heavy toll and won no small unpopularity thereby for the cause of freedom which he professed to champion Ere long Byzantium fell back again into the hands of Persia but she was finally freed from the Oriental yoke seventeen years later when the victorious Greeks fresh from the triumph of Salamis and Mycale sailed up to her walls and after a long leaguer starved out the obstinate garrison B C four hundred seventy nine The fleet wintered there and it was at Byzantium that the first foundations of the naval empire of Athens were laid when all the Greek states of Asia placed their ships at the disposal of the Athenian admirals Cimon and Aristeides During the fifth century Byzantium twice declared war on Athens now the mistress of the seas and on each occasion fell into the hands of the enemy once by voluntary surrender in four hundred thirty nine B C once by treachery from within in four hundred eight B C But the Athenians except in one or two disgraceful cases did not deal hardly with their conquered enemies and the Byzantines escaped anything harder than the payment of a heavy war indemnity In a few years their commercial gains repaired all the losses of war and the state was itself again We know comparatively little about the internal history of these early centuries of the life of Byzantium Some odd fragments of information survive here and there we know for example that they used iron instead of copper for small money a peculiarity shared by no other ancient state save Sparta Their alphabet rejoiced in an abnormally shaped which puzzled all other Greeks for it resembled a with an extra limb two The chief gods of the city were those that we might have expected Poseidon the ruler of the sea whose blessing gave Byzantium its chief wealth and Demeter the goddess who presided over the Thracian and Scythian corn lands which formed its second source of prosperity The Byzantines were if ancient chroniclers tell us the truth a luxurious as well as a busy race they spent too much time in their numerous inns where the excellent wines of Maronea and other neighbouring places offered great temptations They were gluttons too as well as tipplers on one occasion we are assured the whole civic militia struck work in the height of a siege till their commander consented to allow restaurants to be erected at convenient distances round the ramparts One comic writer informs us that the Byzantines were eating young tunny fish their favourite dish so constantly that their whole bodies had become well nigh gelatinous and it was thought they might melt if exposed to too great heat Probably these tales are the scandals of neighbours who envied Byzantine prosperity for it is at any rate certain that the city showed all through its history great energy and love of independence and never shrank from war as we should have expected a nation of epicures to do It was not till the rise of Philip of Macedon and his greater son Alexander that Byzantium fell for the fifth time into the hands of an enemy The elder king was repulsed from the city s walls after a long siege culminating in an attempt at an escalade by night which was frustrated owing to the sudden appearance of a light in heaven which revealed the advancing enemy and was taken by the Byzantines as a token of special divine aid B C three hundred thirty nine In commemoration of it they assumed as one of their civic badges the blazing crescent and star which has descended to our own days and is still used as an emblem by the present owners of the city the Ottoman Sultans But after repulsing Philip the Byzantines had to submit some years later to Alexander They formed under him part of the enormous Macedonian empire and passed on his decease through the hands of his successors Demetrius Poliorcetes and Lysimachus After the death of the latter in battle however they recovered a precarious freedom and were again an independent community for a hundred years till the power of Rome invaded the regions of Thrace and the Hellespont Byzantium was one of the cities which took the wise course of making an early alliance with the Romans and obtained good and easy terms in consequence During the wars of Rome with Macedon and Antiochus the Great it proved such a faithful assistant that the Senate gave it the status of a civitas libera et foederata a free and confederate city and it was not taken under direct Roman government but allowed complete liberty in everything save the control of its foreign relations and the payment of a tribute to Rome It was not till the Roman Republic had long passed away that the Emperor Vespasian stripped it of these privileges and threw it into the province of Thrace to exist for the future as an ordinary provincial town A D seventy three Though deprived of a liberty which had for long years been almost nominal Byzantium could not be deprived of its unrivalled position for commerce It continued to flourish under the Pax Romana the long continued peace which all the inner countries of the empire enjoyed during the first two centuries of the imperial regime and is mentioned again and again as one of the most important cities of the middle regions of the Roman world But an evil time for Byzantium as for all the other parts of the civilized world began when the golden age of the Antonines ceased and the epoch of the military emperors followed In one hundred ninety two A D Commodus the unworthy son of the great and good Marcus Aurelius was murdered and ere long three military usurpers were wrangling for his blood stained diadem Most unhappily for itself Byzantium lay on the line of division between the eastern provinces where Pescennius Niger had been proclaimed and the Illyrian provinces where Severus had assumed the imperial style The city was seized by the army of Syria and strengthened in haste Presently Severus appeared from the west after he had made himself master of Rome and Italy and fell upon the forces of his rival Pescennius Victory followed the arms of the Illyrian legions the east was subdued and the Syrian emperor put to death But when all his other adherents had yielded the garrison of Byzantium refused to submit For more than two years they maintained the impregnable city against the lieutenants of Severus and it was not till A D one hundred ninety six that they were forced to yield The emperor appeared in person to punish the long protracted resistance of the town not only the garrison but the civil magistrates of Byzantium were slain before his eyes The massive walls so firmly built with great square stones clamped together with bolts of iron that the whole seemed but one block were laboriously cast down The property of the citizens was confiscated and the town itself deprived of all municipal privileges and handed over to be governed like a dependent village by its neighbours of Perinthus Caracalla the son of Severus gave back to the Byzantines the right to govern themselves but the town had received a hard blow and would have required a long spell of peace to recover its prosperity Peace however it was not destined to see All through the middle years of the third century it was vexed by the incursions of the Goths who harried mercilessly the countries on the Black Sea whose commerce sustained its trade Under Gallienus in A D two hundred sixty three it was again seized by an usurping emperor and shared the fate of his adherents The soldiers of Gallienus sacked Byzantium from cellar to garret and made such a slaughter of its inhabitants that it is said that the old Megarian race who had so long possessed it were absolutely exterminated But the irresistible attraction of the site was too great to allow its ruins to remain desolate Within ten years after its sack by the army of Gallienus we find Byzantium again a populous town and its inhabitants are specially praised by the historian Trebellius Pollio for the courage with which they repelled a Gothic raid in the reign of Claudius II The strong Illyrian emperors who staved off from the Roman Empire the ruin which appeared about to overwhelm it in the third quarter of the third century gave Byzantium time and peace to recover its ancient prosperity It profited especially from the constant neighbourhood of the imperial court after Diocletian fixed his residence at Nicomedia only sixty miles away on the Bithynian side of the Propontis But the military importance of Byzantium was always interfering with its commercial greatness After the abdication of Diocletian the empire was for twenty years vexed by constant partitions of territory between the colleagues whom he left behind him Byzantium after a while found itself the border fortress of Licinius the emperor who ruled in the Balkan Peninsula while Maximinus Daza was governing the Asiatic provinces While Licinius was absent in Italy Maximinus treacherously attacked his rival s dominions without declaration of war and took Byzantium by surprise But the Illyrian emperor returned in haste defeated his grasping neighbour not far from the walls of the city and recovered his great frontier fortress after it had been only a few months out of his hands A D three hundred fourteen The town must have suffered severely by changing masters twice in the same year it does not however seem to have been sacked or burnt as was so often the case with a captured city in those dismal days But Licinius when he had recovered the place set to work to render it impregnable Though it was not his capital he made it the chief fortress of his realm which since the defeat of Maximinus embraced the whole eastern half of the Roman world It was accordingly at Byzantium that Licinius made his last desperate stand when in A D three hundred twenty three he found himself engaged in an unsuccessful war with his brother in law Constantine the Emperor of the West For many months the war stood still beneath the walls of the city but Constantine persevered in the siege raising great mounds which overlooked the walls and sweeping away the defenders by a constant stream of missiles launched from dozens of military engines which he had erected on these artificial heights At last the city surrendered and the cause of Licinius was lost Constantine the last of his rivals subdued became the sole emperor of the Roman world and stood a victor on the ramparts which were ever afterwards to bear his name II THE FOUNDATION OF CONSTANTINOPLE A D three hundred twenty eight three hundred thirty When the fall of Byzantium had wrecked the fortunes of Licinius the Roman world was again united beneath the sceptre of a single master For thirty seven years ever since Diocletian parcelled out the provinces with his colleagues unity had been unknown and emperors whose number had sometimes risen to six and sometimes sunk to two had administered their realms on different principles and with varying success Constantine whose victory over his rivals had been secured by his talents as an administrator and a diplomatist no less than by his military skill was one of those men whose hard practical ability has stamped upon the history of the world a much deeper impress than has been left by many conquerors and legislators of infinitely greater genius He was a man of that self contained self reliant unsympathetic type of mind which we recognize in his great predecessor Augustus or in Frederic the Great of Prussia Illustration Constantine the Great Though the strain of old Roman blood in his veins must have been but small Constantine was in many ways a typical Roman the hard cold steady unwearying energy which in earlier centuries had won the empire of the world was once more incarnate in him But if Roman in character he was anything but Roman in his sympathies Born by the Danube reared in the courts and camps of Asia and Gaul he was absolutely free from any of that superstitious reverence for the ancient glories of the city on the Tiber which had inspired so many of his predecessors Italy was to him but a secondary province amongst his wide realms When he distributed his dominions among his heirs it was Gaul that he gave as the noblest share to his eldest and best loved son Italy was to him a younger child s portion There had been emperors before him who had neglected Rome the barbarian Maximinus I had dwelt by the Rhine and the Danube the politic Diocletian had chosen Nicomedia as his favourite residence But no one had yet dreamed of raising up a rival to the mistress of the world and of turning Rome into a provincial town If preceding emperors had dwelt far afield it was to meet the exigencies of war on the frontiers or the government of distant provinces It was reserved for Constantine to erect over against Rome a rival metropolis for the civilized world an imperial city which was to be neither a mere camp nor a mere court but the administrative and commercial centre of the Roman world For more than a hundred years Rome had been a most inconvenient residence for the emperors The main problem which had been before them was the repelling of incessant barbarian inroads on the Balkan Peninsula the troubles on the Rhine and the Euphrates though real enough had been but minor evils Rome placed half way down the long projection of Italy handicapped by its bad harbours and separated from the rest of the empire by the passes of the Alps was too far away from the points where the emperor was most wanted the banks of the Danube and the walls of Sirmium and Singidunum For the ever recurring wars with Persia it was even more inconvenient but these were less pressing dangers no Persian army had yet penetrated beyond Antioch only two hundred miles from the frontier while in the Balkan Peninsula the Goths had broken so far into the heart of the empire as to sack Athens and Thessalonica Constantine with all the Roman world at his feet and all its responsibilities weighing on his mind was far too able a man to overlook the great need of the day a more conveniently placed administrative and military centre for his empire He required a place that should be easily accessible by land and sea which Rome had never been in spite of its wonderful roads that should overlook the Danube lands without being too far away from the East that should be so strongly situated that it might prove an impregnable arsenal and citadel against barbarian attacks from the north that should at the same time be far enough away from the turmoil of the actual frontier to afford a safe and splendid residence for the imperial court The names of several towns are given by historians as having suggested themselves to Constantine First was his own birth place Naissus Nisch on the Morava in the heart of the Balkan Peninsula but Naissus had little to recommend it it was too close to the frontier and too far from the sea Sardica the modern Sofia in Bulgaria was liable to the same objections and had not the sole advantage of Naissus that of being connected in sentiment with the emperor s early days Nicomedia on its long gulf at the east end of the Propontis was a more eligible situation in every way and had already served as an imperial residence But all that could be urged in favour of Nicomedia applied with double force to Byzantium and in addition Constantine had no wish to choose a city in which his own memory would be eclipsed by that of his predecessor Diocletian and whose name was associated by the Christians the class of his subjects whom he had most favoured of late with the persecutions of Diocletian and Galerius For Ilium the last place on which Constantine had cast his mind nothing could be alleged except its ancient legendary glories and the fact that the mythologists of Rome had always fabled that their city drew its origin from the exiled Trojans of AEneas Though close to the sea it had no good harbour and it was just too far from the mouth of the Hellespont to command effectually the exit of the Euxine Byzantium on the other hand was thoroughly well known to Constantine For months his camp had been pitched beneath its walls he must have known accurately every inch of its environs and none of its military advantages can have missed his eye Nothing then could have been more natural than his selection of the old Megarian city for his new capital Yet the Roman world was startled at the first news of his choice Byzantium had been so long known merely as a great port of call for the Euxine trade and as a first class provincial fortress that it was hard to conceive of it as a destined seat of empire When once Constantine had determined to make Byzantium his capital in preference to any other place in the Balkan lands his measures were taken with his usual energy and thoroughness The limits of the new city were at once marked out by solemn processions in the old Roman style In later ages a picturesque legend was told to account for the magnificent scale on which it was planned The emperor we read marched out on foot followed by all his court and traced with his spear the line where the new fortifications were to be drawn As he paced on further and further westward along the shore of the Golden Horn till he was more than two miles away from his starting point the gate of old Byzantium his attendants grew more and more surprised at the vastness of his scheme At last they ventured to observe that he had already exceeded the most ample limits that an imperial city could require But Constantine turned to rebuke them I shall go on he said until He the invisible guide who marches before me thinks fit to stop Guided by his mysterious presentiment of greatness the emperor advanced till he was three miles from the eastern angle of Byzantium and only turned his steps when he had included in his boundary line all the seven hills which are embraced in the peninsula between the Propontis and the Golden Horn The rising ground just outside the walls of the old city where Constantine s tent had been pitched during the siege of A D three hundred twenty three was selected out as the market place of the new foundation There he erected the Milion or golden milestone from which all the distances of the eastern world were in future to be measured This central point of the world was not a mere single stone but a small building like a temple its roof supported by seven pillars within was placed the statue of the emperor together with that of his venerated mother the Christian Empress Helena The south eastern part of the old town of Byzantium was chosen by Constantine for the site of his imperial palace The spot was cleared of all private dwellings for a space of one hundred fifty acres to give space not only for a magnificent residence for his whole court but for spacious gardens and pleasure grounds A wall commencing at the Lighthouse where the Bosphorus joins the Propontis turned inland and swept along parallel to the shore for about a mile in order to shut off the imperial precinct from the city Illustration The Heart of Constantinople North west of the palace lay the central open space in which the life of Constantinople was to find its centre This was the Augustaeum a splendid oblong forum about a thousand feet long by three hundred broad It was paved with marble and surrounded on all sides by stately public buildings To its east as we have already said lay the imperial palace but between the palace and the open space were three detached edifices connected by a colonnade Of these the most easterly was the Great Baths known from their builder as the Baths of Zeuxippus They were built on the same magnificent scale which the earlier emperors had used in Old Rome though they could not perhaps vie in size with the enormous Baths of Caracalla Constantine utilized and enlarged the old public bath of Byzantium which had been rebuilt after the taking of the city by Severus He adorned the frontage and courts of the edifice with statues taken from every prominent town of Greece and Asia the old Hellenic masterpieces which had escaped the rapacious hands of twelve generations of plundering proconsuls and Caesars There were to be seen the Athene of Lyndus the Amphithrite of Rhodes the Pan which had been consecrated by the Greeks after the defeat of Xerxes and the Zeus of Dodona Adjoining the Baths to the north lay the second great building on the east side of the Augustaeum the Senate House Constantine had determined to endow his new city with a senate modelled on that of Old Rome and had indeed persuaded many old senatorial families to migrate eastward by judicious gifts of pensions and houses We know that the assembly was worthily housed but no details survive about Constantine s building on account of its having been twice destroyed within the century But like the Baths of Zeuxippus it was adorned with ancient statuary among which the Nine Muses of Helicon are specially cited by the historian who describes the burning of the place in A D four hundred four Linked to the Senate House by a colonnade lay on the north the Palace of the Patriarch as the Bishop of Byzantium was ere long to be called when raised to the same status as his brethren of Antioch and Alexandria A fine building in itself with a spacious hall of audience and a garden the patriarchal dwelling was yet completely overshadowed by the imperial palace which rose behind it And so it was with the patriarch himself he lived too near his royal master to be able to gain any independent authority Physically and morally alike he was too much overlooked by his august neighbour and never found the least opportunity of setting up an independent spiritual authority over against the civil government or of founding an imperium in imperio like the Bishop of Rome Illustration The Atmeidan Hippodrome And saint Sophia All along the western side of the Augustaeum facing the three buildings which we have already described lay an edifice which played a very prominent part in the public life of Constantinople This was the great Hippodrome a splendid circus six hundred forty cubits long and one hundred sixty broad in which were renewed the games that Old Rome had known so well The whole system the chariot races between the teams that represented the factions of the Circus was reproduced at Byzantium with an energy that even surpassed the devotion of the Romans to horse racing From the first foundation of the city the rivalry of the Blues and the Greens was one of the most striking features of the life of the place It was carried far beyond the circus and spread into all branches of life We often hear of the Green faction identifying itself with Arianism or of the Blue supporting a pretender to the throne Not merely men of sporting interests but persons of all ranks and professions chose their colour and backed their faction The system was a positive danger to the public peace and constantly led to riots culminating in the great sedition of A D five hundred twenty three which we shall presently have to describe at length In the Hippodrome the Greens always entered by the north eastern gate and sat on the east side the Blues approached by the north western gate and stretched along the western side The emperor s box called the Kathisma occupied the whole of the short northern side and contained many hundreds of seats for the imperial retinue The great central throne of the Kathisma was the place in which the monarch showed himself most frequently to his subjects and around it many strange scenes were enacted It was on this throne that the rebel Hypatius was crowned emperor by the mob with his own wife s necklace for an impromptu diadem Here also two centuries later the Emperor Justinian II sat in state after his reconquest of Constantinople with his rivals Leontius and Apsimarus bound beneath his footstool while the populace chanted in allusion to the names of the vanquished princes the verse Thou shalt trample on the Lion and the Asp Down the centre of the Hippodrome ran the spina or division wall which every circus showed it was ornamented with three most curious monuments whose strange juxtaposition seemed almost to typify the heterogeneous materials from which the new city was built up The first and oldest was an obelisk brought from Egypt and covered with the usual hieroglyphic inscriptions the second was the most notable though one of the least beautiful of the antiquities of Constantinople it was the three headed brazen serpent which Pausanias and the victorious Greeks had dedicated at Delphi in four hundred seventy nine B C after they had destroyed the Persian army at Plataea The golden tripod which was supported by the heads of the serpents had long been wanting the sacrilegious Phocians had stolen it six centuries before but the dedicatory inscriptions engraved on the coils of the pedestal survived then and survive now to delight the archaeologist The third monument on the spina was a square bronze column of more modern work contrasting strangely with the venerable antiquity of its neighbours By some freak of chance all three monuments have remained till our own day the vast walls of the Hippodrome have crumbled away but its central decorations still stand erect in the midst of an open space which the Turks call the Atmeidan or place of horses in dim memory of its ancient use Along the outer eastern wall of the Hippodrome on the western edge of the Augustaeum stood a range of small chapels and statues the most important landmark among them being the Milion or central milestone of the empire which we have already described The statues few at first were increased by later emperors till they extended along the whole length of the forum Constantine s own contribution to the collection was a tall porphyry column surmounted by a bronze image which had once been the tutelary Apollo of the city of Hierapolis but was turned into a representation of the emperor by the easy method of knocking off its head and substituting the imperial features It was exactly the reverse of a change which can be seen at Rome where the popes have removed the head of the Emperor Aurelius and turned him into saint Peter on the column in the Corso Illustration Building A Palace from a Byzantine MS North of the Hippodrome stood the great church which Constantine erected for his Christian subjects and dedicated to the Divine Wisdom Hagia Sophia It was not the famous domed edifice which now bears that name but an earlier and humbler building probably of the Basilica shape then usual Burnt down once in the fifth and once in the sixth centuries it has left no trace of its original character From the west door of saint Sophia a wooden gallery supported on arches crossed the square and finally ended at the Royal Gate of the palace By this the emperor would betake himself to divine service without having to cross the street of the Chalcoprateia brass market which lay opposite to saint Sophia The general effect of the gallery must have been somewhat like that of the curious passage perched aloft on arches which connects the Pitti and Uffizi palaces at Florence The edifices which we have described formed the heart of Constantinople Between the Palace the Hippodrome and the Cathedral most of the important events in the history of the city took place But to north and west the city extended for miles and everywhere there were buildings of note though no other cluster could vie with that round the Augustaeum The Church of the Holy Apostles which Constantine destined as the burying place of his family was the second among the ecclesiastical edifices of the town Of the outlying civil buildings the public granaries along the quays the Golden Gate by which the great road from the west entered the walls and the palace of the praetorian praefect who acted as governor of the city must all have been well worthy of notice A statue of Constantine on horseback which stood by the last named edifice was one of the chief shows of Constantinople down to the end of the Middle Ages and some curious legends gathered around it Illustration Fifteenth Century Drawing Of The Equestrian Statue Of Constantine It was in A D three hundred twenty eight or three hundred twenty nine the exact date is not easily to be fixed that Constantine had definitely chosen Byzantium for his capital and drawn out the plan for its development As early as May eleven three hundred thirty the buildings were so far advanced that he was able to hold the festival which celebrated its consecration Christian bishops blessed the partially completed palace and held the first service in saint Sophia for Constantine though still unbaptized himself had determined that the new city should be Christian from the first Of paganism there was no trace in it save a few of the old temples of the Byzantines spared when the older streets were levelled to clear the ground for the palace and adjoining buildings The statues of the gods which adorned the Baths and Senate House stood there as works of art not as objects of worship To fill the vast limits of his city Constantine invited many senators of Old Rome and many rich provincial proprietors of Greece and Asia to take up their abode in it granting them places in his new senate and sites for the dwellings they would require The countless officers and functionaries of the imperial court with their subordinates and slaves must have composed a very considerable element in the new population The artizans and handicraftsmen were enticed in thousands by the offer of special privileges Merchants and seamen had always abounded at Byzantium and now flocked in numbers which made the old commercial prosperity of the city seem insignificant Most effective though most demoralizing of the gifts which Constantine bestowed on the new capital to attract immigrants was the old Roman privilege of free distribution of corn to the populace The wheat tribute of Egypt which had previously formed part of the public provision of Rome was transferred to the use of Constantinople only the African corn from Carthage being for the future assigned for the subsistence of the older city On the completion of the dedication festival in three hundred thirty A D an imperial edict gave the city the title of New Rome and the record was placed on a marble tablet near the equestrian statue of the emperor opposite the Strategion But New Rome was a phrase destined to subsist in poetry and rhetoric alone the world from the first very rightly gave the city the founder s name only and persisted in calling it Constantinople III THE FIGHT WITH THE GOTHS Constantine lived seven years after he had completed the dedication of his new city and died in peace and prosperity on the twenty second of May A D three hundred thirty seven received on his death bed into that Christian Church on whose verge he had lingered during the last half of his life By his will he left his realm to be divided among his sons and nephews but a rapid succession of murders and civil wars thinned out the imperial house and ended in the concentration of the whole empire from the Forth to the Tigris under the sceptre of Constantius II the second son of the great emperor The Roman world was not yet quite ripe for a permanent division it was still possible to manage it from a single centre for by some strange chance the barbarian invasions which had troubled the third century had ceased for a time and the Romans were untroubled save by some minor bickerings on the Rhine and the Euphrates Constantius II an administrator of some ability but gloomy suspicious and unsympathetic was able to devote his leisure to ecclesiastical controversies and to dishonour himself by starting the first persecution of Christian by Christian that the world had seen The crisis in the history of the empire was not destined to fall in his day nor in the short reign of his cousin and successor Julian the amiable and cultured but entirely wrongheaded pagan zealot who strove to put back the clock of time and restore the worship of the ancient gods of Greece Both Constantius and Julian if asked whence danger to the empire might be expected would have pointed eastward to the Mesopotamian frontier where their great enemy Sapor King of Persia strove with no very great success to break through the line of Roman fortresses that protected Syria and Asia Minor But it was not in the east that the impending storm was really brewing It was from the north that mischief was to come Illustration Gothic Idols From the Column of Arcadius For a hundred and fifty years the Romans had been well acquainted with the tribes of the Goths the most easterly of the Teutonic nations who lay along the imperial border All through the third century they had been molesting the provinces of the Balkan Peninsula by their incessant raids as we have already had occasion to relate Only after a hard struggle had they been rolled back across the Danube and compelled to limit their settlements to its northern bank in what had once been the land of the Dacians The last struggle with them had been in the time of Constantine who in a war that lasted from A D three hundred twenty eight to A D three hundred thirty two had beaten them in the open field compelled their king to give his sons as hostages and dictated his own terms of peace Since then the appetite of the Goths for war and adventure seemed permanently checked for forty years they had kept comparatively quiet and seldom indulged in raids across the Danube They were rapidly settling down into steady farmers in the fertile lands on the Theiss and the Pruth they traded freely with the Roman towns of Moesia many of their young warriors enlisted among the Roman auxiliary troops and one considerable body of Gothic emigrants had been permitted to settle as subjects of the empire on the northern slope of the Balkans By this time many of the Goths were becoming Christians priests of their own blood already ministered to them and the Bible translated into their own language was already in their hands One of the earliest Gothic converts the good Bishop Ulfilas the first bishop of German blood that was ever consecrated had rendered into their idiom the New Testament and most of the Old A great portion of his work still survives incomparably the most precious relic of the old Teutonic tongues that we now possess The Goths were rapidly losing their ancient ferocity Compared to the barbarians who dwelt beyond them they might almost be called a civilized race The Romans were beginning to look upon them as a guard set on the frontier to ward off the wilder peoples that lay to their north and east The nation was now divided into two tribes the Visigoths whose tribal name was the Thervings lay more to the south in what are now the countries of Moldavia Wallachia and Southern Hungary the Ostrogoths or tribe of the Gruthungs lay more to the north and east in Bessarabia Transylvania and the Dniester valley But a totally unexpected series of events were now to show how prescient Constantine had been in rearing his great fortress capital to serve as the central place of arms of the Balkan Peninsula About the year A D three hundred seventy two the Huns an enormous Tartar horde from beyond the Don and Volga burst into the lands north of the Euxine and began to work their way westward The first tribe that lay in their way the nomadic race of the Alans they almost exterminated Then they fell upon the Goths The Ostrogoths made a desperate attempt to defend the line of the Dniester against the oncoming savages men with faces that can hardly be called faces rather shapeless black collops of flesh with little points instead of eyes little in stature but lithe and active skilful in riding broad shouldered good at the bow stiff necked and proud hiding under a barely human form the ferocity of the wild beast But the enemy whom the Gothic historian describes in these uninviting terms was too strong for the Teutons of the East The Ostrogoths were crushed and compelled to become vassals of the Huns save a remnant who fought their way southward to the Wallachian shore near the marshes of the Delta of the Danube Then the Huns fell on the Visigoths The wave of invasion pressed on the Bug and the Pruth proved no barrier to the swarms of nomad bowmen and the Visigoths under their Duke Fritigern fell back in dismay with their wives and children their waggons and flocks and herds till they found themselves with their backs to the Danube Surrender to the enemy was more dreadful to the Visigoths than to their eastern brethren they were more civilized most of them were Christians and the prospect of slavery to savages seems to have appeared intolerable to them Pressed against the Danube and the Roman border the Visigoths sent in despair to ask permission to cross from the Emperor A contemporary writer describes how they stood All the multitude that had escaped from the murderous savagery of the Huns no less than two hundred thousand fighting men besides women and old men and children were there on the river bank stretching out their hands with loud lamentations and earnestly supplicating leave to cross bewailing their calamity and promising that they would ever faithfully adhere to the imperial alliance if only the boon was granted them At this moment A D three hundred seventy six the Roman Empire was again divided The house of Constantine was gone and the East was ruled by Valens a stupid cowardly and avaricious prince who had obtained the diadem and half the Roman world only because he was the brother of Valentinian the greatest general of the day Valentinian had taken the West for his portion and dwelt in his camp on the Rhine and Upper Danube while Valens slothful and timid shut himself up with a court of slaves and flatterers in the imperial palace at Constantinople The proposal of the Goths filled Valens with dismay It was difficult to say which was more dangerous to refuse a passage to two hundred thousand desperate men with arms in their hands and a savage foe at their backs or to admit them within the line of river and fortress that protected the border with an implied obligation to find land for them After much doubting he chose the latter alternative if the Goths would give hostages and surrender their arms they should be ferried across the Danube and permitted to settle as subject allies within the empire The Goths accepted the terms gave up the sons of their chiefs as hostages and streamed across the river as fast as the Roman Danube flotilla could transport them But no sooner had they reached Moesia than troubles broke out The Roman officials at first tried to disarm the immigrants but the Goths were unwilling to surrender their weapons and offered large bribes to be allowed to retain them in strict disobedience to the Emperor s orders the bribes were accepted and the Goths retained their arms Further disputes soon broke out The provisions of Moesia did not suffice for so many hundred thousand mouths as had just entered its border and Valens had ordered stores of corn from Asia to be collected for the use of the Goths till they should have received and commenced to cultivate land of their own But the governor Lupicinus to fill his own pockets held back the food and doled out what he chose to give at exorbitant prices In sheer hunger the Goths were driven to barter a slave for a single loaf of bread and ten pounds of silver for a sheep This shameless extortion continued as long as the stores and the patience of the Goths lasted At last the poorer immigrants were actually beginning to sell their own children for slaves rather than let them starve This drove the Goths to desperation and a chance affray set the whole nation in a blaze Fritigern with many of his nobles was dining with Count Lupicinus at the town of Marcianopolis when some starving Goths tried to pillage the market by force A party of Roman soldiers strove to drive them off and were at once mishandled or slain On hearing the tumult and learning its cause Lupicinus recklessly bade his retinue seize and slay Fritigern and the other guests at his banquet The Goths drew their swords and cut their way out of the palace Then riding to the nearest camp of his followers Fritigern told his tale and bade them take up arms against Rome There followed a year of desperate fighting all along the Danube and the northern slope of the Balkans The Goths half starved for many months and smarting under the extortion and chicanery to which they had been subjected soon showed that the old barbarian spirit was but thinly covered by the veneer of Christianity and civilization which they had acquired in the last half century The struggle resolved itself into a repetition of the great raids of the third century towns were sacked and the open country harried in the old style nor was the war rendered less fierce by the fact that many runaway slaves and other outcasts among the provincial population joined the invaders But the Roman armies still retained their old reputation the ravages of the Goths were checked at the Balkans and though joined by the remnants of the Ostrogoths from the Danube mouth as well as by other tribes flying from the Huns the Visigoths were at first held at bay by the imperial armies A desperate pitched battle at Ad Salices near the modern Kustendje thinned the ranks of both sides but led to no decisive result Next year however the unwarlike Emperor driven into the field by the clamours of his subjects took the field in person with great reinforcements brought from Asia Minor At the same time his nephew Gratian a gallant young prince who had succeeded to the Empire of the West set forth through Pannonia to bring aid to the lands of the Lower Danube The personal intervention of Valens in the struggle was followed by a fearful disaster In three hundred seventy eight A D the main body of the Goths succeeded in forcing the line of the Balkans they were not far from Adrianople when the Emperor started to attack them with a splendid army of sixty thousand men Every one expected to hear of a victory for the reputation of invincibility still clung to the legions and after six hundred years of war the disciplined infantry of Rome robur peditum whose day had lasted since the Punic wars were still reckoned superior when fairly handled to any amount of wild barbarians But a new chapter of the history of the art of war was just commencing during their sojourn in the plains of South Russia and Roumania the Goths had taken first of all German races to fighting on horseback Dwelling in the Ukraine they had felt the influence of that land ever the nurse of cavalry from the day of the Scythian to that of the Tartar and Cossack They had come to consider it more honourable to fight on horse than on foot and every chief was followed by his war band of mounted men Driven against their will into conflict with the empire they found themselves face to face into the army that had so long held the world in fear and had turned back their own ancestors in rout three generations before Valens found the main body of the Goths encamped in a great laager on the plain north of Adrianople After some abortive negotiations he developed an attack on their front when suddenly a great body of horsemen charged in on the Roman flank It was the main strength of the Gothic cavalry which had been foraging at a distance receiving news of the fight it had ridden straight for the battle field Some Roman squadrons which covered the left flank of the Emperor s army were ridden down and trampled under foot Then the Goths swept down on the infantry of the left wing rolled it up and drove it in upon the centre So tremendous was their impact that legions and cohorts were pushed together in hopeless confusion Every attempt to stand firm failed and in a few minutes left centre and reserve were one undistinguishable mass Imperial guards light troops lancers auxiliaries and infantry of the line were wedged together in a press that grew closer every moment The Roman cavalry saw that the day was lost and rode off without another effort Then the abandoned infantry realized the horror of their position equally unable to deploy or to fly they had to stand to be cut down Men could not raise their arms to strike a blow so closely were they packed spears snapped right and left their bearers being unable to lift them to a vertical position many soldiers were stifled in the press Into this quivering mass the Goths rode plying lance and sword against the helpless enemy It was not till forty thousand men had fallen that the thinning of the ranks enabled the survivors to break out and follow their cavalry in a headlong flight They left behind them dead on the field the Emperor the Grand Masters of the Infantry and Cavalry the Count of the Palace and thirty five commanders of different corps The battle of Adrianople was the most fearful defeat suffered by a Roman army since Cannae a slaughter to which it is aptly compared by the contemporary historian Ammianus Marcellinus The army of the East was almost annihilated and was never reorganized again on the old Roman lines This awful catastrophe brought down on Constantinople the first attack which it experienced since it had changed its name from Byzantium After a vain assault on Adrianople the victorious Goths pressed rapidly on towards the imperial city Harrying the whole country side as they passed by they presented themselves before the Golden Gate its south western exit But the attack was destined to come to nothing their courage failed them when they looked on the vast circuit of walls and the enormous extent of streets all that mass of riches within appeared inaccessible to them They cast away the siege machines which they had prepared and rolled backward on to Thrace three Beyond skirmishing under the walls with a body of Saracen cavalry which had been brought up to strengthen the garrison they made no hostile attempt on the city So forty years after his death Constantine s prescience was for the first time justified He was right in believing that an impregnable city on the Bosphorus would prove the salvation of the Balkan Peninsula even if all its open country were overrun by the invader The unlucky Valens was succeeded on the throne by Theodosius a wise and virtuous prince who set himself to repair by caution and courage combined the disaster that had shaken the Roman power in the Danube lands With the remnants of the army of the East he made head against the barbarians without venturing to attack their main body he destroyed many marauders and scattered bands and made the continuance of the war profitless to them If they dispersed to plunder they were cut off if they held together in masses they starved Presently Fritigern died and Theodosius made peace with his successor Athanarich a king who had lately come over the Danube at the head of a new swarm of Goths from the Carpathian country Theodosius frankly promised and faithfully observed the terms that Fritigern had asked of Valens ten years before He granted the Goths land for their settlement in the Thracian province which they had wasted and enlisted in his armies all the chiefs and their war bands Within ten years after the fight of Adrianople he had forty thousand Teutonic horsemen in his service they formed the best and most formidable part of his host and were granted a higher pay than the native Roman soldiery The immediate military results of the policy of Theodosius were not unsatisfactory it was his Gothic auxiliaries who won for him his two great victories over the legions of the West when in A D three hundred eighty eight he conquered the rebel Magnus Maximus and in A D three hundred ninety four the rebel Eugenius Illustration Gothic Captives From the Column of Arcadius But from the political side the experiment of Theodosius was fraught with the greatest danger that the Roman Empire had yet known When barbarian auxiliaries had been enlisted before they had been placed under Roman leaders and mixed with equal numbers of Roman troops To leave them under their own chiefs and deliberately favour them at the expense of the native soldiery was a most unhappy experiment It practically put the command of the empire in their hands for there was no hold over them save their personal loyalty to Theodosius and the spell which the grandeur of the Roman name and Roman culture still exercised over their minds That spell was still strong as is shown in the story which the Gothic historian Jornandes tells about the visit of the old King Athanarich to Constantinople When he entered the royal city Now said he do I at last behold what I had often heard and deemed incredible He passed his eyes hither and thither admiring first the site of the city then the fleets of corn ships then the lofty walls then the crowds of people of all nations mingled as the waters from divers springs mix in a single pool then the ranks of disciplined soldiery And at last he cried aloud Doubtless the Emperor is as a god on earth and he who raises a hand against him is guilty of his own blood But this impression was not to continue for long In A D three hundred ninety five the good Emperor Theodosius the lover of peace and of the Goths as he was called died and left the throne to his two weakly sons Arcadius and Honorius IV THE DEPARTURE OF THE GERMANS The Roman Empire at the end of the fourth century was in a condition which made the experiment of Theodosius particularly dangerous The government was highly centralized and bureaucratic hosts of officials appointed directly from Constantinople administered every provincial post from the greatest to the least There was little local self government and no local patriotism The civil population was looked on by the bureaucratic caste as a multitude without rights or capacities existing solely for the purpose of paying taxes So strongly was this view held that to prevent the revenue from suffering the land holding classes from the curialis or local magnate down to the poorest peasant were actually forbidden to move from one district to another without special permission A landowner was even prohibited from enlisting in the army unless he could show that he left an heir behind him capable of paying his share in the local rates An almost entire separation existed between the civil population and the military caste it was hard for a civilian of any position to enlist only the lower classes who were of no account in tax paying were suffered to join the army On the other hand every pressure was used to make the sons of soldiers continue in the service Thus had arisen a purely professional army which had no sympathy or connection with the unarmed provincials whom it protected The army had been a source of unending trouble in the third century for a hundred years it had made and unmade Caesars at its pleasure That was while it was still mainly composed of men born within the empire and officered by Romans But Theodosius had now swamped the native element in the army by his wholesale enlistment of Gothic war bands And he had moreover handed many of the chief military posts to Teutons Some of them indeed had married Roman wives and taken kindly to Roman modes of life while nearly all had professed Christianity But at the best they were military adventurers of alien blood while at the worst they were liable to relapse into barbarism cast all their loyalty and civilization to the winds and take to harrying the empire again in the old fearless fashion of the third century Clearly nothing could be more dangerous than to hand over the protection of the timid and unarmed civil population to such guardians The contempt they must have felt for the unwarlike provincials was so great and the temptation to plunder the wealthy cities of the empire so constant and pressing that it is no wonder if the Teutons yielded Caesar making seemed as easy to the leaders as the sack of provincial churches and treasuries did to the rank and file When the personal ascendency of Theodosius was removed the empire fell at once into the troubles which were inevitable Both at the court of Arcadius who reigned at Constantinople and at that of Honorius who had received the West as his share a war of factions commenced between the German and the Roman party Theodosius had distributed so many high military posts to Goths and other Teutons that this influence was almost unbounded Stilicho Magister militum commander in chief of the armies of Italy was predominant at the council board of Honorius though he was a pure barbarian by blood Theodosius had married him to his own niece Serena and left him practically supreme in the West for the young emperor was aged only eleven In the East Arcadius the elder brother had attained his eighteenth year and might have ruled his own realm had he possessed the energy But he was a witless young man short thin and sallow so inactive that he seldom spoke and always looked as if he was about to fall asleep His prime minister was a Western Roman named Rufinus but before the first year of his reign was over a Gothic captain named Gainas slew Rufinus at a review before the Emperor s very eyes The weak Arcadius was then compelled to make the eunuch Eutropius his minister and to appoint Gainas Magister militum for the East Gainas and Stilicho contented themselves with wire pulling at Court but another Teutonic leader thought that the time had come for bolder work Alaric was a chief sprung from the family of the Balts whom the Goths reckoned next to the god descended Amals among their princely houses He was young daring and untameable several years spent at Constantinople had failed to civilize him but had succeeded in filling him with contempt for Roman effeminacy Soon after the death of Theodosius he raised the Visigoths in revolt making it his pretext that the advisers of Arcadius were refusing the foederati or auxiliaries certain arrears of pay The Teutonic sojourners in Moesia and Thrace joined him almost to a man and the Constantinopolitan government found itself with only a shadow of an army to oppose the rebels Alaric wandered far and wide from the Danube to the gates of Constantinople and from Constantinople to Greece ransoming or sacking every town in his way till the Goths were gorged with plunder No one withstood him save Stilicho who was summoned from the West to aid his master s brother By skilful manoeuvres Stilicho blockaded Alaric in a mountain position in Arcadia but when he had him at his mercy it was found that dog does not eat dog The Teutonic prime minister let the Teutonic rebel escape him and the Visigoths rolled north again into Illyricum Sated with plunder Alaric then consented to grant Arcadius peace on condition that he was made a Magister militum like Stilicho and Gainas and granted as much land for his tribesmen as he chose to ask A D three hundred ninety six For the next five years Alaric now proclaimed King of the Goths by his victorious soldiery reigned with undisputed sway over the eastern parts of the Balkan Peninsula paying only a shadow of homage to the royal phantom at Constantinople There appeared every reason to believe that a German kingdom was about to be permanently established in the lands south and west of the Danube The fate which actually befell Gaul Spain and Britain a few years later seemed destined for Moesia and Macedonia How different the history of Europe would have been if the Germans had settled down in Servia and Bulgaria we need hardly point out But another series of events was impending In A D four hundred one Alaric instead of resuming his attacks on Constantinople suddenly declared war on the Western Emperor Honorius He marched round the head of the Adriatic and invaded Northern Italy The half Romanized Stilicho who wished to keep the rule of the West to himself fought hard to turn the Goths out of Italy and beat back Alaric s first invasion But then the young emperor who was as weak and more worthless than his brother Arcadius slew the great minister on a charge of treason When Stilicho was gone Alaric had everything his own way he moved with the whole Visigothic race into Italy where he ranged about at his will ransoming and plundering every town from Rome downwards The Visigoths are heard of no more in the Balkan Peninsula they now pass into the history of Italy and then into that of Spain While Alaric s eyes were turned on Italy but before he had actually come into conflict with Stilicho the Court of Constantinople had been the seat of grave troubles Gainas the Gothic Magister militum of the East and his creature the eunuch Eutropius had fallen out and the man of war had no difficulty in disposing of the wretched harem bred Grand Chamberlain Instigated by Gainas the German mercenaries in the army of Asia started an insurrection under a certain Tribigild Gainas was told to march against them and collected troops ostensibly for that purpose But when he was at the head of a considerable army he did not attack the rebels but sent a message to Constantinople bidding Arcadius give up to him the obnoxious Grand Chamberlain Eutropius hearing of his danger threw himself on the protection of the Church he fled into the Cathedral of saint Sophia and clung to the altar John Chrysostom the intrepid Patriarch of Constantinople forbade the soldiers to enter the church and protected the fugitive for some days One of the most striking incidents in the history of saint Sophia followed while the cowering Chamberlain lay before the altar John preached to a crowded congregation a sermon on the text Vanity of vanities all is vanity emphasizing every period of his harangue by pointing to the fallen Eutropius prime minister of the empire yesterday and a hunted criminal to day The patriarch extorted a promise that the eunuch s life should be spared and Eutropius gave himself up Arcadius banished him to Cyprus but the inexorable Gainas was not contented with his rival s removal he had Eutropius brought back to Constantinople and beheaded The Magister militum now brought his army over to Constantinople and quartered it there to overawe the emperor It appeared quite likely that ere long the Germans would sack the city but the fate that befell Rome ten years later was not destined for Constantinople A mere chance brawl put the domination of Gainas to a sudden end He himself and many of his troops were outside the city when a sudden quarrel at one of the gates between a band of Goths and some riotous citizens brought about a general outbreak against the Germans The Constantinopolitan mob showed itself more courageous and not less unruly than the Roman mob of elder days The whole population turned out with extemporized arms and attacked the German soldiery The gates were closed to prevent Gainas and his troops from outside returning and a desperate street fight ranged over the entire city Isolated bodies of the Germans were cut off one by one and at last their barracks were surrounded and set on fire The rioters had the upper hand seven thousand soldiers fell and the remnant thought themselves lucky to escape Gainas at once declared open war on the empire but he had not the genius of Alaric nor the numerical strength that had followed the younger chief He was beaten in the field and forced to fly across the Danube where he was caught and beheaded by Uldes King of the Huns Curiously enough the officer who defeated Gainas was himself not only a Goth but a heathen he was named Fravitta and had been the sworn guest friend of Theodosius whose son he faithfully defended even against the assault of his own countrymen A D four hundred one The departure of Alaric and the death of Gainas freed the Eastern Romans from the double danger that has impended over them They were neither to see an independent German kingdom on the Danube and Morava nor to remain under the rule of a semi civilized German Magister militum making and unmaking ministers and perhaps Caesars at his good pleasure The weak Arcadius was enabled to spend the remaining seven years of his life in comparative peace and quiet His court was only troubled by an open war between his spouse the Empress AElia Eudoxia and John Chrysostom the Patriarch of Constantinople John was a man of saintly life and apostolic fervour but rash and inconsiderate alike in speech and action His charity and eloquence made him the idol of the populace of the imperial city but his austere manners and autocratic methods of dealing with his subordinates had made him many foes among the clergy The patriarch s enemies were secretly supported by the empress who had taken offence at the outspoken way in which John habitually denounced the luxury and insolence of her court She favoured the intrigues of Theophilus Patriarch of Alexandria against his brother prelate backed the Asiatic clergy in their complaints about John s oppression of them and at last induced the Emperor to allow the saintly patriarch to be deposed by a hastily summoned council the Synod of the Oak held outside the city The populace rose at once to defend their pastor riots broke out Theodosius was chased back to Egypt and the Emperor terrified by an earthquake which seemed to manifest the wrath of heaven restored John to his place Next year however the war between the empress and the patriarch broke out again John took the occasion of the erection of a statue of Eudoxia in the Augustaeum to recommence his polemics Some obsolete semi pagan ceremonies at its dedication roused his wrath and he delivered a scathing sermon in which if his enemies are to be believed he compared the empress to Herodias and himself to John the Baptist The Emperor at his wife s demand summoned another council which condemned Chrysostom and on Easter Day A D four hundred four seized the patriarch in his cathedral by armed force and banished him to Asia That night a fire probably kindled by the angry adherents of Chrysostom broke out in saint Sophia which was burnt to the ground From thence it spread to the neighbouring buildings and finally to the Senate house which was consumed with all the treasures of ancient Greek art of which Constantine had made it the repository Meanwhile the exiled John was banished to a dreary mountain fastness in Cappadocia and afterwards condemned to a still more remote prison at Pityus on the Euxine He died on his way thither leaving a wonderful reputation for patience and cheerfulness under affliction This fifth century Becket was well nigh the only patriarch of Constantinople who ever fell out with the imperial Court on a question of morals as distinguished from dogma Chrysostom s quarrel was with the luxury insolence and frivolity of the Empress and her Court no real ecclesiastical question was involved in his deposition for the charges against him were mere pretexts to cover the hatred of his disloyal clergy and the revenge of the insulted Aelia Eudoxia A D four hundred seven V THE REORGANIZATION OF THE EASTERN EMPIRE A D four hundred eight five hundred eighteen The feeble and inert Arcadius died in A D four hundred eight at the early age of thirty one his imperious consort had preceded him to the grave and the empire of the East was left to Theodosius II a child of seven years their only son There was hardly an instance in Roman history of a minor succeeding quietly to his father s throne An ambitious relative or a disloyal general had habitually supplanted the helpless heir But the ministers of Arcadius were exceptionally virtuous or exceptionally destitute of ambition The little emperor was duly crowned and the administration of the East undertaken in his name by the able Anthemius who held the office of Praetorian Praefect History relates nothing but good of this minister he made a wise commercial treaty with the king of Persia he repelled with ease a Hunnish invasion of Moesia he built a flotilla on the Danube where Roman warships had not been seen since the death of Valens forty years before he reorganized the corn supply of Constantinople and did much to get back into order and cultivation the desolated north western lands of the Balkan Peninsula from which Alaric and his Visigothic hordes had now taken their final departure The empire was still more indebted to him for bringing up the young Theodosius as an honest and god fearing man The palace under Anthemius rule was the school of the virtues the lives of the emperor and his three sisters Pulcheria Arcadia and Marina were the model and the marvel of their subjects Theodosius inherited the piety and honesty of his grandfather and namesake but was a youth of slender capacity though he took some interest in literature and was renowned for his beautiful penmanship His eldest sister Pulcheria was the ruling spirit of the family and possessed unlimited influence over him though she was but two years his senior When Anthemius died in A D four hundred fourteen she took the title of Augusta and assumed the regency of the East Pulcheria was an extraordinary woman on gathering up the reins of power she took a vow of chastity and lived as a crowned nun for thirty six years her fear had been that if she married her husband might cherish ambitious schemes against her brother s crown she therefore kept single herself and persuaded her sisters to make a similar vow Austere indefatigable and unselfish she proved equal to ruling the realms of the East with success though no woman had ever made the attempt before When Theodosius came of age he refused to remove his sister from power and treated her as his colleague and equal By her advice he married in A D four hundred twenty one the year that he came of age the beautiful and accomplished Athenais daughter of the philosopher Leontius The emperor s chosen spouse had been brought up as a pagan but was converted before her marriage and baptized by the name of Eudocia She displayed her literary tastes in writing religious poetry which had some merit according to the critics of the succeeding age The austere Pulcheria always immersed in state business or occupied in religious observances found herself ere long ill at ease in the company of the lively beautiful and volatile literary lady whom she had chosen as sister in law If Theodosius had been less easy going and good hearted he must have sent away either his sister or his wife but he long contrived to dwell affectionately with both though their bickerings were unending After many years of married life however a final quarrel came and the empress retired to spend the last years of her life in seclusion at Jerusalem The cause of her exile is not really known we have only a wild story concerning it which finds an exact parallel in one of the tales of the Arabian Nights The emperor so runs the tale was one day met by a peasant who presented him with a Phrygian apple of enormous size so that the whole Court marvelled at it And he gave the man a hundred and fifty gold pieces in reward and sent the apple to the Empress Eudocia But she sent it as a present to Paulinus the Master of the Offices because he was a friend of the emperor But Paulinus not knowing the history of the apple took it and gave it to the emperor as he reentered the Palace And Theodosius having received it recognized it and concealed it and called his wife and questioned her saying Where is the apple that I sent you She answered I have eaten it Then he bade her swear by his salvation the truth whether she had eaten it or sent it to some one And Eudocia swore that she had sent it to no man but had herself eaten it Then the emperor showed her the apple and was exceedingly wrath suspecting that she was enamoured of Paulinus and had sent it to him as a love gift for he was a very handsome man And on this account he put Paulinus to death but he permitted Eudocia to go to the Holy Places to pray And she went down from Constantinople to Jerusalem and dwelt there all her days That Paulinus was executed and that Eudocia spent her last years of retirement in Palestine we know for certain All the rest of the story is in reality hidden from us The chief improbability of the tale is that Eudocia had reached the age of forty when the breach between her and her husband took place and that Paulinus was also an official of mature years Theodosius long reign passed by in comparative quiet Its only serious troubles were a short war with the Persians and a longer one with Attila the great king of the Huns whose empire now stretched over all the lands north of the Black Sea and Danube where the Goths had once dwelt In this struggle the Roman armies were almost invariably unfortunate The Huns ravaged the country as far as Adrianople and Philippopolis and had to be bought off by the annual payment of seven hundred lbs of gold Lthirty one thousand It is true that they fell on Theodosius while his main force was engaged on the Persian frontier but the constant ill success of the imperial generals seems to show that the armies of the East had never been properly reorganized since the military system of Theodosius I had been broken up by the revolt of Gainas forty years before His grandson had neither a trustworthy body of German auxiliaries nor a sufficiently large native levy of born subjects of the empire to protect his borders Illustration Angel Of Victory From a Fifth century Diptych Reproduced from L Art Byzantin Par Charles Bayet Paris Quantin eighteen eighty three The reconstruction of the Roman military forces was reserved for the successors of Theodosius II He himself was killed by a fall from his horse in four hundred fifty A D leaving an only daughter who was married to her cousin Valentinian III Emperor of the West Theodosius with great wisdom had designated as his successor not his young son in law a cruel and profligate prince but his sister Pulcheria who at the same time ended her vow of celibacy and married Marcianus a veteran soldier and a prominent member of the Senate The marriage was but formal for both were now well advanced in years as a political expedient it was all that could be desired The empire had peace and prosperity under their rule and freed itself from the ignominious tribute to the Huns Before Attila died in four hundred fifty two he had met and been checked by the succours which Marcianus sent to the distressed Romans of the West When Marcianus and Pulcheria passed away the empire came into the hands of a series of three men of ability They were all bred as high civil officials not as generals all ascended the throne at a ripe age not one of them won his crown by arms all were peaceably designated either by their predecessors or by the Senate and army These princes were Leo I four hundred fifty seven four hundred seventy four Zeno four hundred seventy four four hundred ninety one Anastasius four hundred ninety one five hundred eighteen Their chief merit was that they guided the Roman Empire in the East safely through the stormy times which saw its extinction in the West While beyond the Adriatic province after province was being lopped off and formed into a new Germanic kingdom the emperors who reigned at Constantinople kept a tight grip on the Balkan Peninsula and on Asia and succeeded in maintaining their realm absolutely intact Both East and West were equally exposed to the barbarian in the fifth century and the difference of their fate came from the character of their rulers not from the diversity of their political conditions In the West after the extinction of the house of Theodosius four hundred fifty five A D the emperors were ephemeral puppets made and unmade by the generals of their armies who were invariably Germans The two Magistri militum Ricimer and Gundovald one Suabian the other Burgundian by birth deposed or slew no less than five of their nominal masters in seventeen years In the East on the other hand it was the emperors who destroyed one after another the ambitious generals who by arms or intrigue threatened their throne While this comparison bears witness to the personal ability of the three emperors who ruled at Constantinople between A D four hundred fifty seven and A D five hundred eighteen it is only fair to remember they were greatly helped by the fact that the German element in their armies had never reached the pitch of power to which it had attained in the West the suppression of Gainas forty years before had saved them from that danger But unruly and aspiring generals were not wanting in the East the greatest danger of Leo I was the conspiracy of the great Magister militum Aspar whom he detected and slew when he was on the eve of rebelling Zeno was once chased out of his capital by rebels and twice vexed by dangerous risings in Asia Minor but on each occasion he triumphed over his adversaries and celebrated his victory by the execution of the leaders of the revolt Anastasius was vexed for several years by the raids of a certain Count Vitalian who ranged over the Thracian provinces with armies recruited from the barbarians beyond the Danube But in spite of all these rebellions the empire was never in serious danger of sinking into disorder or breaking up as the Western realm had done into new un Roman kingdoms So far was it from this fate that Anastasius left his successor when he died in A D five hundred eighteen a loyal army of one hundred fifty thousand men a treasure of three hundred twenty thousand lbs of gold and an unbroken frontier to East and West The main secret of the success of the emperors of the fifth century in holding their own came from the fact that they had reorganized their armies and filled them up with native troops in great numbers Leo I was the first ruler who utilized the military virtues of the Isaurians or mountain populations of Southern Asia Minor He added several regiments of them to the army of the East but it was his son in law and successor Zeno himself an Isaurian born who developed the scheme He raised an imperial guard from his countrymen and enlisted as many corps of them as could be raised moreover he formed regiments of Armenians and other inhabitants of the Roman frontier of the East and handed over to his successor Anastasius an army in which the barbarian auxiliaries now composed of Teutons and Huns in about equal numbers were decidedly dominated by the native elements The last danger which the Eastern Empire was to experience from the hands of the Germans fell into the reign of Zeno The Ostrogoths had submitted to the Huns ninety years before when their brethren the Visigoths fled into Roman territory in the reign of Valens But when the Hunnish Empire broke up at the death of Attila A D four hundred fifty two the Ostrogoths freed themselves and replaced their late masters as the main danger on the Danube The bulk of them streamed south westward and settled in Pannonia the border province of the Western Empire on the frontier of the East Roman districts of Dacia and Moesia They soon fell out with Zeno and two Ostrogothic chiefs Theodoric the son of Theodemir and Theodoric the son of Triarius were the scourges of the Balkan Peninsula for more than twenty years While the bulk of their tribesmen settled down on the banks of the Save and Mid Danube the two Theodorics harried the whole of Macedonia and Moesia by never ending raids Zeno tried to turn them against each other offering first to the one then to the other the title of Magister militum and a large pension But now as in the time of Alaric and Stilicho it was seen that dog will not eat dog the two Theodorics after quarrelling for a while banded themselves together against Zeno The story of their reconciliation is curious Theodoric the son of Theodemir the ally of Rome for the moment had surrounded his rival on a rocky hill in a defile of the Balkans While they lay opposite each other Theodoric the son of Triarius he is usually known as Theodoric the One Eyed rode down to his enemy s lines and called to him Madman betrayer of your race do you not see that the Roman plan is always to destroy Goths by Goths Whichever of us fails they not we will be the stronger They never give you real help but send you out against me to perish here in the Desert Then all the Goths cried out The One Eyed is right These men are Goths like ourselves So the two Theodorics made peace and Zeno had to cope with them both at once A D four hundred seventy nine Two years later Theodoric the One Eyed was slain by accident his horse flung him as he mounted against a spear fixed by the door of his tent but his namesake continued a thorn in the side of the empire till four hundred eighty eight A D In that year Zeno bethought him of a device for ridding himself of the Ostrogoth who though he made no permanent settlement in Moesia or Macedonia was gradually depopulating the realm by his incursions The line of ephemeral emperors who reigned in Italy over the shrunken Western realm had ended in four hundred seventy six when the German general Odoacer deposed Romulus Augustulus and did not trouble himself to nominate another puppet Caesar to succeed him By his order a deputation from the Roman Senate visited Zeno at Constantinople to inform him that they did not require an emperor of their own to govern Italy but would acknowledge him as ruler alike of East and West at the same time they besought Zeno to nominate as his representative in the Italian lands their defender the great Odoacer Zeno replied by advising the Romans to persuade Odoacer to recognize as his lord Julius Nepos one of the dethroned nominees of Ricimer who had survived his loss of the imperial diadem Odoacer refused and proclaimed himself king in Italy while still affecting against Zeno s own will to recognize the Constantinopolitan emperor as his suzerain In four hundred eighty eight A D it occurred to Zeno to offer Theodoric the government of Italy if he would conquer it from Odoacer The Ostrogoth who had harried the inland of the Balkan Peninsula bare and had met several reverses of late from the Roman arms took the offer He was made patrician and consul and started off with all the Ostrogothic nation at his back to win the realm of Italy After hard fighting with Odoacer and the mixed multitude of mercenaries that followed him the Goths conquered Italy and Theodoric German king and Roman patrician began to reign at Ravenna He always professed to be the vassal and deputy of the emperor at Constantinople and theoretically his conquest of Italy meant the reunion of the East and the West But the Western realm had shrunk down to Italy and Illyricum and the power of Zeno therein was purely nominal With the departure of the Ostrogoths we have seen our last of the Germans in the Balkan Peninsula after four hundred eighty eight the Slavs take their place as the molesters of the Roman frontier on the Danube VI JUSTINIAN The Emperor Anastasius died in A D five hundred eighteen at the ripe age of eighty eight and his sceptre passed to Justinus the commander of his body guard whom Senate and army alike hailed as most worthy to succeed the good old man The late emperor had nephews but he had never designated them as his heirs and they retired into private life at his death Justinus was well advanced in years as all his three predecessors had been when they mounted the throne But unlike Leo Zeno and Anastasius he had won his way to the front in the army not in the civil service He had risen from the ranks was a rough uncultured soldier and is said to have been hardly able to sign his own name His reign of nine years would have been of little note in history for he made no wars and spent no treasure if he had not been the means of placing on the throne of the East the greatest ruler since the death of Constantine Justinus had no children himself but had adopted as his heir his nephew Justinian son of his deceased brother Sabatius This young man born after his father and uncle had won their way to high places in the army was no uncultured peasant as they had been but had been reared as the heir of a wealthy house in all the learning of the day He showed from the first a keen intelligence and applied himself with zeal to almost every department of civil life Law finance administrative economy theology music architecture fortification all were dear to him The only thing in which he seems to have taken little personal interest was military matters His uncle trusted everything to him and finally made him his colleague on the throne Justinian was heir designate to the empire and had passed the age of thirty five giving his contemporaries the impression that he was a staid business like and eminently practical personage No one ever remembered him young it was said and most certainly no one ever expected him to scandalize the empire by a sensational marriage But in A D five hundred twenty six the world learnt to the horror of the respectable and the joy of all scandal mongers that he had declared his intention of taking to wife the dancer Theodora the star of the Byzantine comic stage So many stories have gathered around Theodora s name that it is hard to say how far her early life had been discreditable A libellous work called the Secret History written by an enemy of herself and her husband four gives us many scandalous details of her career but the very virulence of the book makes its tales incredible It is indisputable however that Theodora was an actress and that Roman actresses enjoyed an unenviable reputation for light morals There was actually a law which forbade a member of the senate to marry an actress and Justinian had to repeal it in order to legalize his own marriage There had been scores of bad and reckless men on the throne before but none of them had ever dared to commit an action which startled the world half so much as this freak of the staid Justinian His own mother used every effort to turn him from his purpose and his uncle the Emperor threatened to disinherit him but he was quietly persistent and ere the aged Justinus died he had been induced to acknowledge the marriage of his nephew and to confer on Theodora the title of Patrician Illustration The Empress Theodora And Her Court Reproduced from L Art Byzantin Par Charles Bayet Paris Quantin eighteen eighty three Theodora as even her enemies allow was the most beautiful woman of her age Procopius the best historian of the day says that it was impossible for mere man to describe her comeliness in words or imitate it in art All that her detractors could say was that she was below the middle height and that her complexion was rather pale though not unhealthy It is unfortunate that we have no representation of her surviving save the famous mosaic in San Vitale at Ravenna and mosaic is of all forms of art that least suited to reproduce beauty Whatever her early life may have been Theodora was in spirit and intelligence well suited to be the mate of the Emperor of the East After her marriage no word of scandal was breathed against her life She rose to the height of her situation once her courage saved her husband s throne and always she was the ablest and the most trusted of his councillors The grave studious and hard working Emperor never regretted his choice of a consort It cannot be said however that either Justinian or Theodora are sympathetic characters The Emperor was a hard and suspicious master and not over grateful to subjects who served him well he was intolerant in religious and unscrupulous in political matters When his heart was set on a project he was utterly unmindful of the slaughter and ruin which it might bring upon his people In the extent of his conquests and the magnificence of his public works he was incomparably the greatest of the emperors who reigned at Constantinople But the greatness was purely personal he left the empire weaker in resources if broader in provinces than he found it Of all the great sovereigns of history he may be most fairly compared with Louis XIV of France but it may be remembered to his credit in the comparison that Louis has nothing to set against Justinian s great legal work the compilation of the Pandects and Institutes and that Justinian s private life unlike that of the Frenchman was strict even to austerity All night long we read he sat alone over his State papers in his cabinet or paced the dark halls in deep thought His sleepless vigilance so struck his subjects that the strangest legends became current even in his life time his enemies whispered that he was no mere man but an evil spirit that required no rest One grotesque tale even said that the Emperor had been seen long after midnight traversing the corridors of his palace without his head If Justinian seemed hardly human to those who feared him Theodora is represented as entirely given up to pride and ambition never forgiving an offence but hunting to death or exile all who had crossed her in the smallest thing She is reproached but who that has risen from a low estate is not of an inordinate love for the pomps and vanities of imperial state High officials complained that she had as great a voice in settling political matters as her husband Yet on the whole her influence would appear not to have been an evil one historians acknowledge that she was liberal in almsgiving religious after her own fashion and that she often interfered to aid the oppressed It is particularly recorded that remembering the dangers of her own youth she was zealous in establishing institutions for the reclaiming of women who had fallen into sin The aged Justinus died in five hundred twenty seven A D and Justinian became the sole occupant of the throne which he was destined to occupy for thirty eight years It was less than half the century yet his personality seems to pervade the whole period and history hardly remembers the insignificant predecessors and successors whose reigns eke out the remainder of the years between five hundred and six hundred The empire when Justinian took it over from the hands of his uncle was in a more prosperous condition than it had known since the death of Constantine Since the Ostrogoths had moved out of the Balkan Peninsula in A D four hundred eighty seven it had not suffered from any very long or destructive invasion from without The Slavonic tribes now heard of for the first time and the Bulgarians had made raids across the Danube but they had not yet shown any signs of settling down as the Goths had done within the limits of the empire Their incursions though vexatious were not dangerous Still the European provinces of the empire were in worse condition than the Asiatic and were far from having recovered the effects of the ravages of Fritigern and Alaric Attila and Theodoric But the more fortunate Asiatic lands had hardly seen a foreign enemy for centuries five Except in the immediate neighbourhood of the Persian frontier there was no danger and Persian wars had been infrequent of late Southern Asia Minor had once or twice suffered from internal risings rebellions of the warlike Isaurians but civil war left no such permanent mark on the land as did barbarian invasions On the whole the resources of the provinces beyond the Bosphorus were intact Justinus in his quiet reign had spent little or none of the great hoard of treasure which Anastasius had bequeathed to him There were more than three hundred thousand lbs of gold Lthirteen million four hundred thousand in store when Justinian came to the throne The army as we have had occasion to relate in the last chapter was in good order and composed in a larger proportion of born subjects of the empire than it had been at any time since the battle of Adrianople There would appear to have been from one hundred fifty thousand to two hundred thousand men under arms but the extent of the frontiers of the empire were so great that Justinian never sent out a single army of more than thirty thousand strong and forces of only a third of that number are often found entrusted with such mighty enterprises as the invasion of Africa or the defence of the Armenian border The flower of the Roman army was no longer its infantry but its mailed horsemen Cataphracti armed with lance and bow as the Parthian cavalry had once been of old The infantry comprised more archers and javelin men than heavy troops the Isaurians and other provincials of the mountainous parts of Asia Minor were reckoned the best of them Among both horse and foot large bodies of foreign auxiliaries were still found the Huns and Arabs supplied light cavalry the German Herules and Gepidae from beyond the Danube heavier troops The weakest point in the empire when Justinian took it over was its financial system The cardinal maxim of political economy that taxes should be raised in the manner least oppressive to those who pay them was as yet undreamt of The exaction of arbitrary customs dues and the frequent grant of monopolies was noxious to trade The deplorable system of tax farming through middlemen was employed in many branches of the revenue Landed proprietors small and great were still mercilessly overtaxed in consideration of their exemption from military service The budget was always handicapped by the necessity for providing free corn for the populace of Constantinople Yet in spite of all these drawbacks Justinian enjoyed an enormous and steady revenue His finance minister John of Cappadocia was such an ingenious extortioner that the treasury was never empty in the hardest stress of war and famine but it was kept full at the expense of the future The grinding taxation of Justinian s reign bore fruit in the permanent impoverishment of the provinces his successors were never able to raise such a revenue again Here again Justinian may well be compared to Louis XIV Justinian s policy divides into the departments of internal and foreign affairs Of his doings as legislator administrator theologian and builder we shall speak in their proper place But the history of his foreign policy forms the main interest of his reign He had determined to take up a task which none of his predecessors since the division of the Empire under Arcadius and Honorius had dared to contemplate It was his dream to re unite under his sceptre the German kingdoms in the Western Mediterranean which had been formed out of the broken fragments of the realm of Honorius and to end the solemn pretence by which he was nominally acknowledged as Emperor West of the Adriatic while really all power was in the hands of the German rulers who posed as his vicegerents He aimed at reconquering Italy Africa and Spain if not the further provinces of the old empire We shall see that he went far towards accomplishing his intention But during the first five years of his reign his attention was distracted by other matters The first of them was an obstinate war of four years duration with Kobad King of Persia The causes of quarrel were ultimately the rival pretensions of the Roman and Persian Empires to the suzerainty of the small states on their northern frontiers near the Black Sea the kingdoms of Lazica and Iberia and more proximately the strengthening of the fortresses on the Mesopotamian border by Justinian His fortification of Dara close to the Persian frontier town of Nisibis was the casus belli chosen by Kobad who declared war in five hundred twenty eight a year after Justinian s accession The Persian war was bloody but absolutely indecisive All the attacks of the enemy were repelled and one great pitched battle won over him at Dara in five hundred thirty But neither party succeeded in taking a single fortress of importance from the other and when on the death of Kobad his son Chosroes made peace with the empire the terms amounted to the restoration of the old frontier The only importance of the war was that it enabled Justinian to test his army and showed him that he possessed an officer of first rate merit in Belisarius the victor of the battle of Dara This famous general was a native of the Thracian inland he entered the army very young and rose rapidly till at the age of twenty three he was already Governor of Dara and at twenty five Magister militum of the East six His influence at Court was very great as he had married Antonina the favourite and confidante of the Empress Theodora His position indeed was not unlike that which Marlborough owing to his wife s ascendency enjoyed at the Court of Queen Anne Like Marlborough too Belisarius was ruled and bullied by his clever and unscrupulous wife Unlike the great Duchess Sarah Antonina never set herself to thwart her mistress but after Theodora s death she and her husband lost favour and in declining years knew much the same misfortune as did the Marlboroughs The year which saw the Persian War end A D five hundred thirty two saw also the rise and fall of another danger which while it lasted was much more threatening to the Emperor s life and power We have already noticed the Blues and Greens the great factions of the Byzantine Circus seven All through the fifth century they had been growing stronger and interfered more and more in politics and even in religious controversies To be a Green in five hundred thirty meant to be a partisan of the house of the late Emperor Anastasius and a Monophysite eight The Blues posed as partisans of the house of Justinus and as strictly orthodox in matters ecclesiastical From mere Circus factions they had almost grown into political parties but they still retained at the bottom many traces of their low sporting origin The rougher elements pre dominated in them they were prone to riot and mischief and as the events of five hundred thirty two were to show they were a serious danger to the State In January of that year there was serious rioting in the streets Justinian though ordinarily he favoured the Blue faction impartially ordered the leaders of the rioters on both sides to be put to death Seven were selected for execution and four of them were duly beheaded in the presence of a great and angry mob in front of the monastery of saint Conon The last three rioters were to be hung but the hangman so bungled his task that two of the criminals one a Blue the other a Green fell to the ground alive The guards seized them and they were again suspended but once more owing no doubt to the terror of the executioners at the menaces of the mob the rope slipped Then the multitude broke loose the guards were swept away and the half hung criminals were thrust into sanctuary at the adjacent monastery This exciting incident proved the commencement of six days of desperate rioting The Blues and Greens united and taking as their watchword Nika conquer swept through the city crying for the deposition of John of Cappadocia the unpopular finance minister and of Eudemius Praefect of the city who was immediately responsible for the executions The ordinary police of the capital were quite unable to master them and Justinian was weak enough to promise to dismiss the officials But the mob was now quite out of hand and refused to disperse the trouble was fomented by the partisans of the house of the late emperor who began to shout for the deposition of Justinian and wished to make Hypatius nephew of Anastasius Caesar in his stead The city was almost empty of troops owing to the garrison having been sent to the Persian War The Emperor could only count on four thousand men of the Imperial Guard a few German auxiliaries and a regiment of five hundred Cataphracti mailed horsemen under Belisarius who had just returned from the seat of war Belisarius was placed in command of the whole and sallied out to clear the streets but the rioters showing the same pluck that the Byzantine mob displayed against the soldiers of Gainas a hundred and twenty five years before offered a stout resistance The main fighting took place around the great square of the Augustaeum between the Imperial palace and the Hippodrome In the heat of the fight the rebels set fire to the Brazen Porch by the Senate House The Senate House caught fire and then the conflagration spread east and north till it was wafted across the square to saint Sophia On the third day of the riot the great cathedral was burnt to the ground and from thence the flames issued out to burn the hospital of Sampson and the church of saint Irene nine The fire checked the fighting and the insurgents were now in possession of most of the city But they could not find their chosen leader for the unfortunate Hypatius who had no desire to risk his neck had taken refuge with the Emperor in the palace It was not till he was actually driven out by Justinian who feared to have him about his person that this rebel in spite of himself fell into the hands of his own adherents But on the sixth day of the riots they led him to the Hippodrome installed him in the royal seat of the Kathisma and crowned him there with a gold chain of his wife s for want of a proper diadem Illustration Theodora Imperatrix From the Painting by Val Prinsep The copyright is in the Artist s hands Meanwhile there was dismay and diversity of councils in the Palace John of Cappadocia and many other ministers strove to persuade the Emperor to fly by sea and gather additional troops at Heraclea There was nothing left in his power save the palace and they insisted that if he remained there longer he would be surrounded by the rebels and cut off from escape It was then that the Empress Theodora rose to the level of the occasion refused to fly and urged her husband to make one final assault on the enemy Her words are preserved by Procopius This is no occasion to keep to the old rule that a woman must not speak in the council Those who are most concerned have most right to dictate the course of action Now every man must die once and for a king death is better than dethronement and exile May I never see the day when my purple robe is stripped from me and when I am no more called Lady and Mistress If you wish O Emperor to save your life nothing is easier there are your ships and the sea But I agree with the old saying that Empire is the best winding sheet Spurred on by his wife s bold words Justinian ordered a last assault on the rebels and Belisarius led out his full force The factions were now in the Hippodrome saluting their newly crowned leader with shouts of Hypatie Auguste tu vincas preparatory to a final attack on the palace Belisarius attacked at once all three gates of the Hippodrome that directed against the door of the Kathisma failed but the soldiery forced both the side entrances and after a hard struggle the rebels were entirely routed Crowded into the enormous building with only five exits they fell in thousands by the swords of the victorious Imperialists It is said that thirty five thousand men were slain in the six days of this great Sedition of Nika It is curious to learn that not even this awful slaughter succeeded in crushing the factions We hear of the Blues and Greens still rioting on various occasions during the next fifty years But they never came again so near to changing the course of history as in the famous rising of A D five hundred thirty two VII JUSTINIAN S FOREIGN CONQUESTS After the Persians had drawn back foiled in their attempt to conquer Mesopotamia and after the suppression of the Nika sedition had cowed the unruly populace of Constantinople Justinian found himself at last free and was able to take in hand his great scheme for the reconquest of the lost provinces of the empire The enforced delay of six years between his accession and his first attempt to execute his great plan was as it happened extremely favourable to the Emperor In each of the two German kingdoms with which he had first to deal the power had passed within those six years into the hands of a weak and incapable sovereign In Africa Hilderic the king of the Vandals had been dethroned by his cousin Gelimer a warlike and ambitious but very incapable ruler In Italy Theodoric the great king of the Ostrogoths had died in A D five hundred twenty six and his grandson and successor Athalaric in A D five hundred thirty three After the death of the young Athalaric the kingdom fell to his mother Amalasuntha and she compelled by Gothic public opinion to take a husband to rule in her behalf had unwisely wedded Theodahat her nearest kinsman He was cruel scheming and suspicious and murdered his wife within a year of her having brought him the kingdom of Italy as a dowry ten Cowardly and avaricious as well as ungrateful Theodahat possessed exactly those vices which were most suited to make him the scorn of his warlike subjects he could count neither on their loyalty nor their respect in the event of a war Both the Vandals in Africa and the Goths in Italy were at this time so weak as to invite an attack by an enterprising neighbour They had in fact conquered larger realms than their limited numbers were really able to control The original tribal hordes which had subdued Africa and Italy were composed of fifty or sixty thousand warriors with their wives and children Now such a body concentrated on one spot was powerful enough to bear down everything before it But when the conquerors spread themselves abroad they were but a sprinkling among the millions of provincials whom they had to govern In all Italy there were probably but three cities Ravenna Verona and Pavia in which the Ostrogoths formed a large proportion of the population A great army makes but a small nation and the Goths and Vandals were too few to occupy such wide tracts as Italy and Africa They formed merely a small aristocracy governing by dint of the ascendency which their fathers had won over the minds of the unwarlike populations which they had subdued The only chance for the survival of the Ostrogothic and Vandal monarchies lay in the possibility of their amalgamating with the Roman provincial population as the Franks under more favourable circumstances did with the conquered inhabitants of Gaul This was seen by Theodoric the great conqueror of Italy and he did his best to reconcile Goth and Roman held the balance with strict justice between the two and employed Romans as well as Goths in the government of the country But one generation does little to assuage old hatreds such as that between the conquerors and the conquered in Italy Theodoric was succeeded by a child and then by a ruffian and his work ended with him Even he was unable to strike at the most fatal difference of all between his countrymen and the Italians The Goths were Arians having been converted to Christianity in the fourth century by missionaries who held the Arian heresy Their subjects on the other hand were Orthodox Catholics almost without exception When religious hatred was added to race hatred there was hardly any hope of welding together the two nationalities Another source of weakness in the kingdoms of Africa and Italy must be noted The Vandals of the third generation and the Goths of the second after their settlement in the south seem to have degenerated in courage and stamina It may be that the climate was unfavourable to races reared in the Danube lands it may be that the temptations of unlimited luxury offered by Roman civilization sufficed to demoralize them A Gothic sage observed at the time that the Goth when rich tends to become Roman in his habits the Roman when poor Gothic in his There was truth in this saying and the result of the change was ominous for the permanence of the kingdom of Italy If the masters softened and the subjects hardened they would not preserve for ever their respective positions The case of the kingdom of Africa was infinitely worse than that of the kingdom of Italy The Vandals were less numerous than the Goths in proportion to their subjects they were not merely heretics but fanatical and persecuting heretics which the Goths were not Moreover they had never had at their head a great organizer and administrator like Theodoric but only a succession of turbulent princes of the Viking type fit for war and nothing else Justinian declared war on King Gelimer the moment that he had made peace with Persia using as his casus belli not a definite re assertion of the claim of the empire over Africa for such language would have provoked the rulers of Italy and Spain to join the Vandals but the fact that Gelimer had wrongfully deposed Hilderic the Emperor s ally In July five hundred thirty three Belisarius who was now at the height of his favour for his successful suppression of the Nika rioters sailed from the Bosphorus with an army of ten thousand foot and five thousand horse He was accompanied luckily for history by his secretary Procopius a very capable writer who has left a full account of his master s campaigns Belisarius landed at Tripoli at the extreme eastern limit of the Vandal power The town was at once betrayed to him by its Roman inhabitants From thence he advanced cautiously along the coast meeting with no opposition for the incapable Gelimer had been caught unprepared and was still engaged in calling in his scattered warriors It was not till he had approached within ten miles of Carthage that Belisarius was attacked by the Vandals After a hard struggle he defeated them and the city fell into his hands next clay The provincials were delighted at the rout of their masters and welcomed the imperial army with joy there was neither riot nor pillage and Carthage had not the aspect of a conquered town Calling up his last reserves Gelimer made one more attempt to try the fortunes of war He advanced on Carthage and was met by Belisarius at Tricameron on the road to Bulla Again the day went against him his army broke up his last fortresses threw open their gates and there was an end of the Vandal kingdom It had existed just one hundred four years since Genseric entered Africa in A D four hundred twenty nine Gelimer took refuge for a time with the Moorish tribes who dwelt in the fastnesses of Mount Atlas But ere long he resolved to surrender himself to Belisarius whose humanity was as well known as his courage He sent to Carthage to say that he was about to give himself up and so the story goes asked but for three things a harp to which to chant a dirge he had written on the fate of himself and the Vandal race a sponge to wipe away his tears and a loaf a delicacy he had not tasted ever since he had been forced to partake of the unsavoury food of the Moors Belisarius received Gelimer with kindness and took him to Constantinople along with the treasures of the palace of Carthage which included many of the spoils of Rome captured by the Vandals eighty six years before when they sacked the imperial city in four hundred fifty three It is said that among these spoils were some of the golden vessels of the Temple at Jerusalem which Titus had brought in triumph to Rome and which Gaiseric had carried from Rome to Carthage Illustration Cavalry Scouts From a Byzantine MS Reproduced from L Art Byzantin Par Charles Bayet Paris Quantin eighteen eighty three The triumphal entry of Belisarius into Constantinople with his captives and his spoils encouraged Justinian to order instant preparations for an attack on the second German kingdom on his western frontier He declared war on the wretched King Theodahat in the summer of A D four hundred thirty five using as his pretext the murder of Queen Amalasuntha whom as we have already said her ungrateful spouse had first imprisoned and then strangled within a year of their marriage The king of the Goths whether he was conscience stricken or merely cowardly showed the greatest terror at the declaration of war He even wrote to Constantinople offering to resign his crown if the Emperor would guarantee his life and his private property Meanwhile he consulted soothsayers and magicians about his prospects for he was as superstitious as he was incompetent Procopius tells us a strange tale of the doings of a Jewish magician of note to whom Theodahat applied He took thirty pigs to represent unclean Gentiles we must suppose and penned them in three styes ten in each The one part he called Goths the second Italians and the third Imperialists He left the beasts without food or water for ten days and bade the king visit them at the end of that time and take augury from their condition When Theodahat looked in he found all but two of the Goth pigs dead and half of the Italians but the Imperialists though gaunt and wasted were all or almost all alive This portent the Jew expounded as meaning that at the end of the approaching war the Gothic race would be exterminated and their Italian subjects terribly thinned while the Imperial troops would conquer though with toil and difficult While Theodahat was busying himself with portents actual war had broken out on the Illyrian frontier between the Goths and the governor of Dalmatia There was no use in making further offers to Justinian and the king of Italy had to face the situation as best he could In the summer of five hundred thirty five Belisarius landed in Sicily with an even smaller army than had been given him to conquer Africa only three thousand Roman troops all Isaurians and four thousand five hundred barbarian auxiliaries of different sorts Belisarius first campaign was as fortunate as had been that which he had waged against Gelimer All the Sicilian towns threw open their gates except Palermo where there was a considerable Gothic garrison and Palermo fell after a short siege In six months the whole island was in the hands of Belisarius Theodahat seemed incapable of defending himself he fell into a condition of abject helplessness which so provoked his warlike subjects that when the news came that Belisarius had crossed over into Italy and taken Rhegium they rose and slew him In his stead the army of the Goths elected as their king Witiges a middle aged warrior well known for personal courage and integrity but quite incompetent to face the impending storm After the fall of Rhegium Belisarius marched rapidly on Naples meeting no opposition for the Goths were very thinly scattered through Southern Italy and had not even enough men to garrison the Lucanian and Calabrian fortresses Naples was taken by surprise the Imperialists finding their way within the walls by crawling up a disused aqueduct After this important conquest Belisarius made for Rome though his forces were reduced to a mere handful by the necessity of leaving garrisons in his late conquests King Witiges made no effort to obstruct his approach He had received news that the Franks were threatening an evasion of Northern Italy and went north to oppose an imaginary danger in the Alps when he should have been defending the line of the Tiber Having staved off the danger of a Frankish war by ceding Provence to King Theuderic Witiges turned back only to learn that Rome was now in the hands of the enemy The troops of Leudaris the Gothic general who had been left with four thousand men to defend the city had been struck with panic at the approach of Belisarius and were cowardly and idiotic enough to evacuate it without striking a blow Five thousand men had sufficed to seize the ancient capital of the world December five hundred thirty six Next spring King Witiges came down with the main army of the Goths more than one hundred thousand strong and laid siege to Rome The defence of the town by Belisarius and his very inadequate garrison forms the most interesting episode in the Italian war For more than a year the Ostrogoths lay before its walls essaying every device to force an entry They tried open storm they endeavoured to bribe traitors within the city they strove to creep along the bed of a disused aqueduct as Belisarius had done a year before at Naples All was in vain though the besiegers outnumbered the garrison twenty fold and exposed their lives with the same recklessness that their ancestors had shown in the invasion of the empire a hundred years back The scene best remembered in the siege was the simultaneous assault on five points in the wall on the twenty first of March five hundred thirty seven Three of the attacks were beaten back with ease but near the Praenestine Gate at the south east of the city one storming party actually forced its way within the walls and had to be beaten out by sheer hard fighting and at the mausoleum of Hadrian on the north west another spirited combat took place Hadrian s tomb a great quadrangular structure of white marble three hundred feet square and eighty five feet high was surmounted by one of the most magnificent collections of statuary in ancient Rome including four great equestrian statues of emperors at its corners The Goths with their ladders swarmed at the foot of the tomb in such numbers that the arrows and darts of the defenders were insufficient to beat them back Then as a last resource the Imperialists tore down the scores of statues which adorned the mausoleum and crushed the mass of assailants beneath a rain of marble fragments Two famous antiques that form the pride of modern galleries the Dancing Faun at Florence and the Barberini Faun at Munich were found a thousand years later buried in the ditch of the tomb of Hadrian and must have been among the missiles employed against the Goths The rough usage which they then received proved the means of preserving them for the admiration of the modern world A year and nine days after he had formed the siege of Rome the unlucky Witiges had to abandon it His army reduced by sword and famine had given up all hope of success and news had just arrived that the Imperialists had launched a new army against Ravenna the Gothic capital Belisarius indeed had just received a reinforcement of six thousand or seven thousand men and had wisely sent a considerable force under an officer named John to fall on the Adriatic coast The scene of the war was now transported further to the north but its character still remained the same The Romans gained territory the Goths lost it Firmly fixed at Ancona and Rimini and Osimo Belisarius gradually forced his way nearer to Ravenna and in A D five hundred forty laid siege to it Witiges blockaded by Belisarius in his capital made no such skilful defence as did his rival at Rome three years before To add to his troubles the Franks came down into Northern Italy and threatened to conquer the valley of the Po the last Gothic stronghold Witiges then made proposals for submission but Belisarius refused to grant any terms other than unconditional surrender though his master Justinian was ready to acknowledge Witiges as vassal king in Trans Padane Italy Famine drove Ravenna to open its gates and the Goths enraged at their imbecile king and struck with admiration for the courage and generosity of Belisarius offered to make their conqueror Emperor of the West The loyal general refused but bade the Goths disperse each to his home and dwell peaceably for the future as subjects of the empire May five hundred forty A D He himself taking the great Gothic treasure hoard from the palace of Theodoric and the captive Witiges sailed for Constantinople and laid his trophies at his master s feet Italy now seemed even as Africa only Pavia and Verona were still held by Gothic garrisons and when he sailed home Belisarius deemed his work so nearly done that his lieutenants would suffice to crush out the last embers of the strife He himself was required in the East for a new Persian war with Chosroesroes son of Kobad was on the eve of breaking out But things were not destined to end so At the last moment the Goths found a king and a hero to rescue them and the conquest of Italy was destined to be deferred for twelve years more Two ephemeral rulers reigned for a few months at Pavia and came to bloody ends but their successor was Baduila eleven the noblest character of the sixth century the first knight of the Middle Ages as he has been called When the generals of Justinian marched against him to finish the war by the capture of Verona and Pavia he won over them the first victory that the Goths had obtained since their enemies landed in Italy This was followed by two more successes the scattered armies of Witiges rallied round the banner of the new king and at once the cities of Central and Southern Italy began to fall back into Gothic hands with the same rapidity with which they had yielded to Belisarius The fact was that the war had been a cruel strain on the Italians and that the imperial governors and still more their fiscal agents or logothetes had become unbearably oppressive Italy had lived through the fit of enthusiasm with which it had received the armies of Justinian and was now regretting the days of Theodoric as a long lost golden age Most of its cities were soon in Baduila s hands the Imperialists retained only the districts round Rome Naples Otranto and Ravenna Of Naples they were soon deprived B C five hundred forty three Baduila invested it and ere long constrained it to surrender He treated the inhabitants with a kindness and consideration which no Roman general except Belisarius had ever displayed A speech which he delivered to his generals soon after this success deserves a record as showing the character of the man A Gothic warrior had been convicted of violating the daughter of a Roman Baduila condemned him to death His officers came round him to plead for the soldier s life He answered them that they must choose that day whether they preferred to save one man s life or the life of the Gothic race At the beginning of the war as they knew well the Goths had brave soldiers famous generals countless treasure horses weapons and all the forts of Italy And yet under Theodahat a man who loved gold better than justice they had so angered God by their unrighteous lives that all the troubles of the last ten years had come upon them Now God seemed to have avenged Himself on them enough He had begun a new course with them and they must begin a new course with Him and justice was the only path As for the present criminal being a valiant hero let them know that the unjust man and the ravisher was never brave in fight but that according to a man s life such was his luck in battle Such was the justice of Baduila and it seemed as if his dream was about to come true and that the regenerate Goths would win back all that they had lost Ere long he was at the gates of Rome prepared to essay with fifteen thousand men what Witiges had failed to do with one hundred thousand Lest all his Italian conquests should be lost Justinian was obliged to send back Belisarius for no one else could hold back the Goths But Belisarius was ill supplied with men he had fallen into disfavour at Court and the imperial ministers stinted him of troops and money Unable to relieve Rome he had to wait at Portus by the mouth of the Tiber watching for a chance to enter the city That chance he never got The famine stricken Romans angry with the cruel and avaricious Bessas who commanded the garrison began to long for the victory of their enemy and one night some traitors opened the Asinarian Gate and let in Baduila and his Goths The King thought that his troubles were over he assembled his chiefs and bade them observe how in the time of Witiges seven thousand Greeks had conquered and robbed of kingdom and liberty one hundred thousand well armed Goths But now that they were few poor and wretched the Goths had conquered more than twenty thousand of the enemy And why Because of old they looked to anything rather than justice they had sinned against each other and the Romans Therefore they must choose henceforth and be just men and have God with them or unjust and have God against them Baduila had determined to do that which no general since Hannibal had contemplated he would destroy Rome and with it all the traditions of the world empire of the ancient city to him they seemed but snares tending to corrupt the mind of the Goths The people he sent away unharmed they were but a few thousand left after the horrors of the famine during the siege But he broke down the walls and dismantled the palaces and arsenals For a few weeks Rome was a deserted city given up to the wolf and the owl A D five hundred fifty For eleven unquiet years Baduila the brave and just ruled Italy holding his own against Belisarius till the great general was called home by some wretched court intrigue But presently Justinian gathered another army more numerous than any that Belisarius had led and sent it to Italy under the command of the eunuch Narses It was a strange choice that made the chamberlain into a general but it succeeded Narses marched round the head of the Adriatic and invaded Italy from the north Baduila went forth to meet him at Tagina in the Apennines For a long day the Ostrogothic knights rode again and again into the Imperialist ranks but all their furious charges failed At evening they reeled back broken and their king received a mortal wound in the flight A D five hundred fifty three With the death of Baduila it was all up with the Goths their hero s knightly courage and kingly righteousness had not sufficed to save them from the same doom which had overtaken the Vandals The broken army made one last stand in Campania under a chief named Teia but he was slain in battle at Nuceria and then the Goths surrendered They told Narses that the hand of God was against them they would quit Italy and go back to dwell in the north in the land of their fathers So the poor remnant of the conquering Ostrogoths marched off crossed the Po and the Alps and passed away into oblivion in the northern darkness The scheme of Justinian was complete Italy was his but an Italy so wasted and depopulated that the traces of the ancient Roman rule had almost vanished The land says a contemporary chronicler was reduced to primeval solitude war and famine had swept it bare Illustration Details Of saint Sophia It is strange to find that the Emperor was not tired out by waging this desperate war with the Goths the moment it ended he began to essay another western conquest There was civil war in Spain and taking advantage of it Liberius governor of Africa landed in Andalusia and rapidly took the great towns of the south of the peninsula Cordova Cartagena Malaga and Cadiz The factious Visigoths then dropped their strife united in arms under King Athangild and checked the further progress of the imperial arms But a long slip of the lost territory was not recovered by them Justinian and his successors down to A D six hundred twenty three reigned over the greater part of the sea coast of Southern Spain VIII THE END OF JUSTINIAN S REIGN The slackness with which the generals of Justinian prosecuted the Gothic war in the period between the triumph of Belisarius at Ravenna in A D five hundred forty and the final conquest of Italy in A D five hundred fifty three is mainly to be explained by the fact that just at the moment of the fall of Ravenna the empire became involved in a new struggle with its great Eastern neighbour Chosroes of Persia was seriously alarmed at the African and Italian conquests of Justinian and remembered that he too as well as the Vandals and Goths was in possession of provinces that had formerly been Roman and might one day be reclaimed by the Emperor He determined to strike before Justinian had got free from his Italian war and while the flower of the Roman army was still in the West Using as his pretext for war some petty quarrels between two tribes of Arabs subject respectively to Persia and the empire he declared war in the spring of A D five hundred forty Justinian as the king had hoped was caught unprepared the army of the Euphrates was so weak that it never dared face the Persians in the field and the opening of the war was fraught with such a disaster to the empire as had not been known since the battle of Adrianople more than a hundred and sixty years before Avoiding the fortresses of Mesopotamia Chosroes who led his army in person burst into Northern Syria His main object was to strike a blow at Antioch the metropolis of the East a rich city that had not seen an enemy for nearly three centuries and was reckoned safe from all attacks owing to its distance from the frontier Antioch had a strong garrison of six thousand men and the Blues and Greens of its circus factions had taken arms to support the regular troops But the commander was incompetent and the fortifications had been somewhat neglected of late After a sharp struggle Chosroes took the town by assault the garrison cut its way out and many of the inhabitants escaped with it but the city was sacked from cellar to garret and thousands of captives were dragged away by the Persians Chosroes planted them by the Euphrates as Nebuchadnezzar had done of old with the Jews and built for them a city which he called Chosroantiocheia blending his own name with that of their ancient abode This horrible disaster to the second city of the Roman East roused all Justinian s energy neglecting the Italian war he sent all his disposable troops to the Euphrates frontier and named Belisarius himself as the chief commander After this Chosroes won no such successes as had distinguished his first campaign Having commenced an attack on the Roman border fortresses in Colchis far to the north he was drawn home by the news that Belisarius had invaded Assyria and was besieging Nisibis On the approach of the king the imperial general retired but his manoeuvre had cost the Persian the fruits of a whole summer s preparation and the year A D five hundred forty one ended without serious fighting In the next spring very similar operations followed Belisarius defended the line of the Euphrates with success and the invaders retired after having reduced one single Mesopotamian fortress The war lingered for two years more till Chosroes disgusted at the ill success of all his efforts since his first success at Antioch and more especially humiliated by a bloody repulse from the walls of Edessa consented to treat for peace A D five hundred forty five He gave up his conquests which were of small importance but regarded the honours of the war as being his own because Justinian consented to pay him two thousand lbs of gold Lone hundred eight thousand on the ratification of the treaty One curious clause was inserted in the document though hostilities ceased everywhere else the rights of the two monarchs to the suzerainty of the kingdom of Lazica on the Colchian frontier hard by the Black Sea were left undefined For no less than seven years a sort of by war was maintained in this small district while peace prevailed on all other points of the Perso Roman frontier It was not till A D five hundred fifty six after both parties had wasted much treasure and many men on the unprofitable contest that Chosroes resigned the attempt to hold the small and rugged mountain kingdom of the Lazi and resigned it to Justinian on the promise of an annual grant of Leighteen thousand as compensation money But although Justinian had brought his second Persian war to a not unsuccessful end the empire had come badly out of the struggle and was by five hundred fifty six falling into a condition of incipient disorder and decay This was partly caused by the reckless financial expedients of the Emperor who taxed the provinces with unexampled rigour while forced to maintain at once a Persian and an Italian war The main part of the damage however was wrought by other than human means In A D five hundred forty two there broke out in the empire a plague such as had not been known for three hundred years the last similar visitation had fallen in the reign of Trebonianus Gallus far back in the third century This pestilence was one of the epoch making events in the history of the empire as great a landmark as the Black Death in the history of England The details which Procopius gives us concerning its progress and results leave no doubt that it operated more powerfully than any other factor in that weakening of the empire which is noticeable in the second half of the sixth century When it reached Constantinople five thousand persons a day are said to have fallen victims to it All customary occupations ceased in the city and the market place was empty save for corpse bearers In many houses not a single soul remained alive and the government had to take special measures for the burial of neglected corpses The disease says the chronicler did not attack any particular race or class of men nor prevail in any particular region nor confine itself to any period of the year Summer or winter North or South Greek or Arabian washed or unwashed of such distinctions the plague took no account A man might climb to the hill top and it was there he might retire to the depths of a cavern and it was there also The only marked characteristic of its ravages that the chronicler could find was that whether by chance or providential design it strictly spared the most wicked twelve Justinian himself fell ill of the plague he recovered but was never his old self again Though he persevered inflexibly to his last day in his scheme for the reconquest of the empire yet he seems to have declined in energy and more especially to have lost that power of organization which had been his most marked characteristic The chroniclers complain that he had grown less hopeful and less masterful After achieving so much in the days of his vigour when he entered into the last stage of his life he seemed to weary of his labours and preferred to create discord among his foes or to mollify them with gifts instead of trusting to his arms and facing the dangers of war So he allowed his troops to decline in numbers because he did not expect to require their services And his ministers who collected his taxes and maintained his armies were affected with the same indifference thirteen One feature of the Emperor s later years was that he took more and more interest in theological disputes even to the neglect of State business The Church question of the day was the dispute on Monophysitism the heresy which denied the existence both of a human and a divine nature in Our Lord Justinian was not a monophysite himself but wished to unify the sect with the main body of the Church by edicts of comprehension which forbade the discussion of the subject and spent much trouble in coercing prelates orthodox and heretical into a reconciliation which had no chance of permanent success His chief difficulty was with the bishops of Rome He forced Pope Vigilius to come to Constantinople and kept him under constraint for many months till he signed all that was required of him A D five hundred fifty four The only result was to win Vigilius the reputation of a heretic and to cause a growing estrangement between East and West The gloom of Justinian s later years was even more marked after the death of his wife Theodora died in A D five hundred forty eight six years after the great plague and it may be that her loss was no less a cause of the diminished energy of his later years than was his enfeebled health Her bold and adventurous spirit must have buoyed him up in many of the more difficult enterprises of the first half of his reign After her death Justinian seems to have trusted no one his destined successor Justinus son of his sister was kept in the background and no great minister seems to have possessed his confidence Even Belisarius the first and most loyal soldier of the empire does not appear to have been trusted in the second Gothic war the Emperor stinted him of troops and hampered him with colleagues At last he was recalled A D five hundred forty nine and sent into private life from which he was only recalled on the occurrence of a sudden military crisis in A D five hundred fifty eight This crisis was a striking example of the mismanagement of Justinian s later years A nomad horde from the South Russian steppes the Cotrigur Huns had crossed the frozen Danube at mid winter when hostilities were least expected and thrown themselves on the Thracian provinces The empire had one hundred fifty thousand men under arms at the moment but they were all dispersed abroad many in Italy others in Africa others in Spain others in Colchis some in the Thebaid and a few on the Mesopotamian frontier There was such a dearth of men to defend the home provinces that the barbarians rode unhindered over the whole country side from the Danube to the Propontis plundering and burning One body only seven thousand strong came up to within a few miles of the city gates and inspired such fear that the Constantinopolitans began to send their money and church plate over to Asia Justinian then summoned Belisarius from his retirement and placed him in command of what troops there were available a single regiment of three hundred veterans from Italy and the Scholarian guards a body of local troops three thousand five hundred strong raised in the city and entrusted with the charge of its gates which inspired little confidence as its members were allowed to practice their trades and avocations and only called out in rotation for occasional service With this undisciplined force which had never seen war at his back Belisarius contrived to beat off the Huns He led them to pursue him back to a carefully prepared position where the only point that could be attacked was covered with woods and hedges on either side The untrustworthy Scholarians were placed on the flanks where they could not be seriously molested while the three hundred Italian veterans covered the one vulnerable point The Huns attacked were shot down from the woods and beaten off in front and fled leaving four hundred men on the field while the Romans only lost a few wounded and not a single soldier slain Thus the last military exploit of Belisarius preserved the suburbs of the imperial city itself from molestation after defending Old Rome in his prime he saved New Rome in his old age Even this last service did not prevent Justinian from viewing his great servant with suspicion Four years later an obscure conspiracy against his life was discovered and one of the conspirators named Belisarius as being privy to the plot The old emperor affected to believe the accusation sequestrated the general s property and kept him under surveillance for eight months Belisarius was then acquitted and restored to favour he lived two years longer and died in March five hundred sixty five fourteen The ungrateful master whom he had served so well followed him to the grave nine months later Of Justinian as conqueror and governor we have said much But there remain two more aspects of his life which deserve notice his work as a builder and his codification of the laws From the days of Diocletian the style of architecture which we call Byzantine for want of a better name had been slowly developing from the old classic forms and many of the emperors of the fourth and fifth centuries had been given to building But no previous monarch had combined in such a degree as did Justinian the will and the power to launch out into architectural experiments He had at his disposal the hoarded treasures of Anastasius and his tastes were as magnificent as those of the great builders of the early empire Augustus and Nero and Hadrian All over the empire the monuments of his wealth and taste were seen in dozens of churches halls of justice monasteries forts hospitals and colonnades The historian Procopius was able to compose a considerable volume entirely on the subject of Justinian s buildings and numbers of them survive some perfect and more in ruins to witness to the accuracy of the work Even in the more secluded or outlying portions of the empire any fine building that is found is in two cases out of three one of the works of Justinian Not merely great centres like Constantinople or Jerusalem but out of the way tracts in Cappadocia and Isauria are full of his buildings Even in the newly conquered Ravenna his great churches of San Vitale containing the celebrated mosaic portraits of himself and his wife and of saint Apollinare in the suburb of Classis outshine the older works of the fifth century emperors and of the Goth Theodoric Illustration Columns In saint Sophia Illustration Galleries Of saint Sophia Justinian s churches indeed are the best known of his buildings In Oriental church architecture his reign forms a landmark up to his time Christian architects had still been using two patterns copied straight from Old Roman models The first was the round domed church whose origin can be traced back to such Roman originals as the celebrated Temple of Vesta of such the Church of the Holy Sepulchre at Rome may serve as a type The second was the rectangular church with apses which was nothing more than an adaptation for ecclesiastical purposes of the Old Roman law courts and which had borrowed from them its name of Basilica saint Paul s Outside the Walls at Rome is a fair specimen Justinian brought into use for the first time on a large scale the combination of a cruciform ground plan and a very large dome The famous Church of saint Sophia may serve as the type of this style The great cathedral of Constantinople had already been burnt down twice as we have had occasion to relate the first time on the eve of the banishment of John Chrysostom the second in the great Nika riot of five hundred thirty two Within forty days of its destruction Justinian had commenced preparations for rebuilding it as a monument of his triumph in the civil strife He chose as his architect Anthemius of Tralles the greatest of Byzantine builders and one of the few whose names have survived The third church was different in plan from either of its predecessors showing the new combination which we have already specified It is a Greek cross two hundred forty one feet long and two hundred twenty four broad having in its midst a vast dome pierced by no less than forty windows light and airy and soaring one hundred eighty feet above the floor In the nave the aisles and side apses are parted from the main central spaces by magnificent colonnades of marble pillars the majority of verde antique These are not for the most part the work of Justinian s day but were plundered from the chief pagan temples of Asia which served as an inexhaustible quarry for the Christian builder The whole of the interior both roof and dome was covered with gilding or mosaics which the Vandalism of the Turks has covered with a coat of whitewash to hide the representations of human forms which are offensive to the Moslems creed Procopius describes the church with enthusiasm and his praises are well justified It presents a most glorious spectacle extraordinary to those who behold it and altogether incredible to those who know it by report only In height it rises to the very heavens and overtops the neighbouring buildings like a ship anchored among them It towers above the city which it adorns and from it the whole of Constantinople can be beheld as from a watch tower Its breadth and length are so judiciously chosen that it appears both broad and long without disproportion For it excels both in size and harmony being more magnificent than ordinary buildings and much more elegant than the few which approach it in size Within it is singularly full of light and sunshine you would declare that the place is not lighted from without but that the rays are produced within itself such an abundance of light is poured into it The gilded ceiling adds glory to its interior though the light reflected upon the gold from the marble surpasses it in beauty Who can tell of the splendour of the columns and marbles with which the church is adorned One would think that one had come upon a meadow full of flowers in bloom one wonders at the purple tints of some the green of others the glowing red and glittering white and those too which nature like a painter has marked with the strongest contrasts of colour Moreover it is impossible accurately to describe the treasures of gold and silver plate and gems which the Emperor has presented to the church the Sanctuary alone contains forty thousand pounds weight of silver Justinian was almost as great a builder of forts as of churches but his military works have for the most part disappeared It may give some idea of his energy in fortifying the frontiers when we state that the Illyrian provinces alone were protected by two hundred ninety four forts of which Procopius gives a list disposed in four successive lines from the Danube back to the Thessalian hills Some were single towers but many were elaborate fortresses with outworks and all had to be protected by garrisons Thus much of Justinian as builder space fails to enumerate a tithe of his works Of his great legal achievement we must speak at even shorter length The Roman law as he received it from his predecessors was an enormous mass of precedents and decisions in which the original basis was overlaid with the various and sometimes contradictory rescripts of five centuries of emperors Several of his predecessors and most especially Theodosius II had endeavoured to codify the chaotic mass and reduce it to order But no one of them had produced a code which sufficed to bring the law of the day into full accord with the spirit of the times It was no mean work to bring the ancient legislation of Rome from the days of the Twelve Tables down to the days of Justinian into strict and logical connection with the new Christian ideas which had worked their way into predominance since the days of Constantine Much of the old law was hopelessly obsolete owing to the change in moral ideas which Christianity had introduced but it is still astonishing to see how much of the old forms of the times of the early empire survived into the sixth century Justinian employed a commission headed by the clever but unpopular lawyer Tribonian to draw up his new code The work was done for ever and a day and his Institutes and Pandects were the last revision of the Old Roman laws and the starting point of all systematic legal study in Europe when six hundred years later the need for something more than customary folk right began to make itself felt as mediaeval civilization evolved itself out of the chaos of the dark ages If the Roman Empire had flourished in the century after Justinian as in that which preceded him other revisers of the laws might have produced compilations that would have made the Institutes seem out of date But as a matter of fact decay and chaos followed after Justinian and succeeding emperors had neither the need nor the inclination to do his work over again Hence it came to pass that his name is for ever associated with the last great revision of Roman law and that he himself went down to posterity as the greatest of legislators destined to be enthroned by Dante in one of the starry thrones of his Paradise and to be worshipped as the father of law by all the legists of the Renaissance IX THE COMING OF THE SLAVS The thirty years which followed the death of Justinian are covered by three reigns those of Justinus II five hundred sixty five five hundred seventy eight Tiberius Constantinus five hundred seventy eight five hundred eighty two and Maurice five hundred eighty two six hundred two These three emperors were men of much the same character as the predecessors of Justinian each of them was an experienced official of mature age who was selected by the reigning emperor as his most worthy successor Justinus was the favourite nephew of Justinian and had served him for many years as Curopalates or Master of the Palace Tiberius Constantinus was Count of the Excubiti a high Court officer in the suite of Justinus Maurice again served Tiberius as Count of the Foederati or chief of the Barbarian auxiliaries They were all men of capacity and strove to do their best for the empire historians concur in praising the justice of Justinus the liberality and humanity of Tiberius the piety of Maurice Yet under them the empire was steadily going down hill the exhausting effects of the reign of Justinian were making themselves felt more and more and at the end of the reign of Maurice a time of chaos and disaster was impending which came to a head under his successor The internal causes of the disaster of this time were the weakening of the empire by the great plague of five hundred forty four and still more by the grinding exactions of Justinian s financial system Its external phenomena were invasions by new hordes from the north combined with long and exhausting wars with Persia The virtues of the emperors seem to have helped them little Justin s justice made him feared rather than loved Tiberius s liberality rendered him popular but drained the treasury Maurice on the other hand who was economical and endeavoured to fill the coffers which his predecessors had emptied was therefore universally condemned as avaricious The troubles on the frontier which vexed the last thirty years of the sixth century were due to three separate sets of enemies the Lombards in Italy the Slavs and Avars in the Balkan Peninsula and the Persians in the East The empire held undisputed possession of Italy for no more than fifteen years after the expulsion of the Ostrogoths in A D five hundred fifty three Then a new enemy came in from the north following the same path that had already served for the Visigoths of Alaric and the Ostrogoths of Theodoric The new comers were the race of the Lombards who had hitherto dwelt in Hungary on the Middle Danube and had more frequently been found as friends than as foes of the Romans But their warlike and ambitious King Alboin having subdued all his nearer neighbours began to covet the fertile plains of Italy where he saw the emperors keeping a very inadequate garrison now that the Ostrogoths were finally driven away In A D five hundred sixty eight Alboin and his hordes crossed the Alps bringing with them wife and child and flocks and herds while their old land on the Danube was abandoned to the Avars The Lombards took possession of the flat country in the north of Italy as far as the line of the Po with very little difficulty The region we are told was almost uninhabited owing to the combined effects of the great plague and the Ostrogothic war In this once fertile and populous but now deserted lowland the Lombards settled down in great numbers There they have left their name as the permanent denomination of the plain of Lombardy Only one city the strong fortress of Pavia held out against them for long when it fell in five hundred seventy one after a gallant defence of three years Alboin made it his capital instead of choosing one of the larger and more famous towns of Milan and Verona the older centres of life in the land he had conquered After subduing Lombardy the king pushed forward into Etruria and overran the valley of the Arno But in the midst of his wars he was cut off if the legend tells us the truth by the vengeance of his wife Queen Rosamund She was the daughter of Cunimund King of the Gepidae whom Alboin had slain in battle The fallen monarch s skull was by the victor s orders mounted in gold and fashioned into a cup Long years after amid the revelry of a drinking bout Alboin had the ghastly cup filled with wine and bade his wife bear it around to his chosen warriors The queen obeyed but vowed to revenge herself by her husband s death By the sacrifice of her honour she bribed Alboin s armour bearer to slay his master in his bed and then fled with him to Constantinople A D five hundred seventy three But the death of Alboin did not put an end to the Lombard conquests in Italy The kingdom indeed broke up for a time into several independent duchies but the Lombard chiefs continued to win territory from the empire Two of them founded the considerable duchies of Spoleto and Benevento the one in Central and the other in Southern Italy These states survived as independent powers but the rest of the Lombard territories were reunited by King Autharis in five hundred eighty four and he and his immediate successors completed the conquest of Northern Italy Thus during the reigns of Justin Tiberius II and Maurice the greater part of Justinian s Italian conquests were lost and formed once more into Teutonic states The emperor retained only two large stretches of territory the one in Central Italy where he held a broad belt of land extending right across the peninsula from Ravenna and Ancona on the Adriatic to Rome on the Tyrrhenian Sea the other comprehending the extreme south of the land the toe and heel of the Italian boot and comprising the territory of Bruttium and the Calabrian fifteen towns of Taranto Brindisi and Otranto Sardinia and Sicily were also left untouched by the Lombards who never succeeded in building a fleet The Roman territory which stretched across Central Italy cut the Lombards in two the king ruling the main body of them in Tuscany and the valley of the Po while the dukes of Spoleto and Benevento maintained an isolated existence in the south Illustration Cross Of Justinus II From the Vatican From L Art Byzantin Par C Bayet Paris Quantin eighteen eighty three This partition of Italy between the Lombards and the empire is worth remembering from the fact that never again till our own day was the whole peninsula gathered into a single state Not till eighteen seventy when the kingdom of United Italy was completed by the conquest of Rome did a time come when all the lands between the Alps and the Straits of Messina were governed by one ruler Justinian had no successor till Victor Emmanuel After the Lombard conquest the imperial dominions in Italy were administered by a governor called the Exarch who dwelt at Ravenna the northernmost and strongest of the imperial fortresses All the Italian provinces were nominally beneath his control but as a matter of fact he was only treated with implicit obedience by those of his subordinates who dwelt in his own neighbourhood He found it harder to enforce his orders at Naples and Reggio or in the distant islands of Sicily and Sardinia But it was the bishops of Rome who profited most by his absence although a duke a military officer of some importance dwelt at Rome he was from the first overshadowed by his spiritual neighbour Even during the days of the Ostrogoths the Roman bishops had acquired considerable importance as being the chief official representatives of the Italians in dealings with their Teutonic masters But they spoke with much more freedom and weight when they had to do not with a King of Italy dwelling quite near them but with a mere governor fettered by orders from distant Constantinople Gregory the Great five hundred ninety six hundred four was the first of the popes who began to assume an independent attitude and to treat the Exarch at Ravenna with scant ceremony He was an able and energetic man who could not bear to see Rome suffering for want of a ruler on the spot and readily took upon himself civil functions in spite of the protests of his nominal superior the Exarch In five hundred ninety two for example he made a private truce for Rome with the Lombard Duke of Spoleto though the latter was at war with the empire The Emperor Maurice stormed at him as foolish and disobedient but did not venture to depose him being too much troubled with Persian and Avaric wars to send troops against Rome On another occasion Gregory nominated a governor for Naples instead of leaving the appointment to the Exarch In five hundred ninety nine he acted as mediator between the Lombard king and the government at Ravenna as if he had been a neutral and independent sovereign Although he showed no wish to sever his connection with the Roman Empire Gregory behaved as if he considered the emperor his suzerain rather than his immediate ruler He would never give in on disputed points issued orders which contradicted imperial rescripts and maintained a bitter quarrel with successive patriarchs of Constantinople who possessed the favour of Maurice When the patriarch John the Faster took the title of oecumenical bishop Gregory wrote to Maurice to tell him that the presumption of John was a sure sign that the days of Antichrist were at hand and to urge him to repress such pretensions by the force of the civil arm This is one of the first signs of the approach of that mediaeval view of the papacy which imagined that it was the pontiff s duty to censure and advise kings and emperors on all possible topics and occasions Gregory s immediate successors were not men of mark or a breach with the empire might have been precipitated The final disavowal of the supremacy of the Constantinopolitan monarch was to be still delayed for nearly two hundred years The wars between the Exarchs of Ravenna and the Lombard kings were little influenced by interference from the East The emperors during the last thirty years of the sixth century were far more engrossed with their Persian and Slavonic wars Contests with the Great king of the East occupied no less than twenty years in the reigns of Justin II Tiberius and Maurice War was declared in five hundred seventy two and did not cease till five hundred ninety two Like the struggle between Justinian and Chosroes I thirty years before it was wholly indecisive There were more plundering raids than battles and the frontier provinces of each empire were reduced to a dreadful state of desolation and depopulation if the Persians pushed their ravages as far as the gates of Antioch Roman generals penetrated deep into Media and Corduene where the imperial banner had not been seen for two hundred years The net result of the whole twenty years of strife was that each combatant had seriously weakened and distressed his rival without obtaining any definite superiority over him Forced to make peace by the pressure of a civil war Chosroes II gave back to Maurice the two frontier cities of Dara and Martyropolis the sole trophies of twenty campaigns and ceded him a slice of Armenian territory But these trivial gains were far from compensating the empire for the fearful losses caused by dozens of Persian invasions The Persian war was exhausting but successful on the northern frontier however the Roman army had been faring far worse and serious losses of territory were beginning to take place The enemies in this quarter were two new tribes who appeared on the Danube after the Lombards had departed from it to commence their invasion of Italy There were now no Teutons left on the northern frontier of the empire of the incoming tribes one was Tartar and the other Slavonic The Avars were a nomadic race from Asia wild horsemen of the Steppes much like their predecessors the Huns They had fled west to escape the Turks who were at this time building up an empire in Central Asia and betook themselves to the South Russian plains not far from the mouth of the Danube To cross the river and ravage Moesia was too tempting a prospect to be neglected and ere long the Avaric cavalry were seen only too frequently along the Balkans and on the coast of the Black Sea Their first raid into Roman territory fell into the year five hundred sixty two just before the death of Justinian and from that time forward they were always causing trouble They were ready enough to make peace when money was paid them but as they invariably broke the agreement when the money was spent it was never long before they reappeared south of the Danube But the Slavs were a far more serious danger to the empire than the Avars The latter came only to plunder the former like the Germans two centuries before came pressing into the provinces to win themselves a new home The Romans knew at first of only two tribes of them the Slovenes and Antae but behind these there were others who were gradually to push their way to the south and make their presence known Croats Servians and many more The Slavs were the easternmost of the Aryan peoples of Europe and by far the most backward They had always lain behind the Germans and it was only when the German barrier was removed by the migration of the Goths and Lombards that they came into touch with the empire They were rude races far behind the Teutons in civilization they had hardly learnt as yet the simplest arts knew nothing of defensive armour and could only use for boats tree trunks hollowed out by fire like the Australian savages of to day They had not learnt to live under kings or chiefs but dwelt in village communities governed by the patriarchs of the several families Their abodes were mud huts and they cultivated no grain but millet When they went to war they could send out thousands of spearmen and bowmen but their wild bands were not very formidable in the open field They could resist neither cavalry nor disciplined infantry and were only formidable in woods and defiles where they formed ambuscades and endeavoured to take their enemy by surprise and overwhelm him by a sudden rush We are assured that one of their favourite devices was to conceal themselves in ponds or rivers by lying down in the water for hours together breathing through reeds whose points were the only things visible above the surface Thus a thousand men might be concealed and nothing appear except a bed of rushes This strange stratagem would seem incredible if we had not on record one or two occasions on which it was actually practised The Slavs had begun to make themselves felt early in the sixth century but it was not till the death of Justinian that we hear of them as a pressing danger But when the Lombards had passed away westward they came down to the Danube and began to cross it in great numbers in the endeavour to make permanent settlements on the Roman bank The raids of the Slavs and the Avars were curiously complicated for the king or Chagan of the Tartar tribe had made vassals of many of his Slavonic neighbours They on the other hand sometimes acted in obedience to him but more frequently tried to escape from his power by pushing forward into Roman territory Hence it comes that we often find Slav and Avar leagued together but at other times find them acting separately or even in opposition to each other A more chaotic series of campaigns it is hard to conceive Down to this time the inland of the Balkan peninsula had been inhabited by Thracian and Illyrian provincials of whom the majority spoke the Latin tongue though a few still preserved their ancient barbaric idiom sixteen They formed the only large body of subjects of the empire outside Italy who still spoke the old ruling language and as they were about a quarter of its population they did much to preserve its Roman character and to prevent it from becoming Greek or Asiatic Their pride in their Latin tongue was very marked Justinian born in the heart of the district was fond of laying special stress on the fact that Latin was his native language On this Latinized Thraco Illyrian population the invasion of the Slavs and Avars fell with unexampled severity The Goths had afflicted them before but they at least had been Christian and semi civilized while the new comers were in the lowest grade of savagery It is not too much to say that between five hundred seventy and six hundred the old population was almost exterminated over the greater part of the country north of the Balkans the modern Servia and Bulgaria and very sadly cut down even in the more sheltered Macedonian and Thracian provinces The Latin speaking provincials almost disappeared the only remnants of them were the Dalmatian islanders and the Vlachs or Wallachians who are found in later times scattered in small bodies among the Slavs who had swept over the whole country side The effect of the invasion is well described by the contemporary chronicler John of Ephesus The year five hundred eighty one was famous for the invasion of the accursed people called Slavonians who overran Greece and the country by Thessalonica and all Thrace and captured the cities and took many forts and devastated and burnt and reduced the people to slavery and made themselves masters of the whole country and settled in it by main force and dwelt in it as though it had been their own Four years have now elapsed and still they live at their ease in the land and spread themselves far and wide as far as God permits them and ravage and burn and take captive and still they encamp and dwell there The open country was swept bare by the Slavs the towns resisted better for neither Slav nor Avar was skilled in siege operations Relying upon the fortified towns as his base the great general Priscus whom Maurice placed in command was able to keep his ground along the Danube and to perform many gallant exploits He even crossed the river and attacked the Slavs and Avars in their own homes beyond it but it was to no effect that he burnt their villages and slew off their warriors He could not protect the unarmed population in the open country within the Roman boundary and the girdle of fortresses along the Danube soon covered nothing but a wasted region sparsely inhabited by Slavs The limit of Roman population had fallen back to the line of the Balkans and even to the south of it and the Slavs were ever slipping across the Danube in larger and larger numbers despite the garrisons along the river which were still kept up from Singidunum Belgrade to Dorostolum Silistria The misfortunes of the Avaric and Slavonic war were the cause of the fall of the Emperor Maurice He had won some unpopularity by his manifest inability to stem the tide of the barbarian invasion and more by an act of callousness of which he was guilty in five hundred ninety nine The Chagan of the Avars had captured fifteen thousand prisoners and offered to release them for a large ransom Maurice whose treasury was empty refused to comply and the Chagan massacred the wretched captives But the immediate cause of the emperor s fall was his way of dealing with the army He was unpopular with the soldiery though an old soldier himself and did not possess their respect or confidence Yet he was an officer of some merit and had written a long military treatise called the Strategicon which was the official handbook of the imperial armies for three hundred years Maurice sealed his fate when in six hundred two he issued orders for the discontented army of the Danube to winter north of the river in the waste marshes of the Slavs The troops refused to obey the order and chased away their generals Then electing as their captain an obscure centurion named Phocas they marched on Constantinople Maurice armed the city factions the Blues and Greens and strove to defend himself But when he saw that no one would fight for him he fled across the Bosphorus with his wife and children to seek refuge in the Asiatic provinces where he was less unpopular than in Europe Soon he was pursued by orders of Phocas whom the army had now saluted as emperor and caught at Chalcedon The cruel usurper had him executed along with all his five sons the youngest a child of only three years of age Maurice died with a courage and piety that moved even his enemies exclaiming with his last breath Thou art just O Lord and just are thy judgments X THE DARKEST HOUR For the first time since Constantinople had become the seat of empire the throne had been won by armed rebellion and the murder of the legitimate ruler The break in the peaceful and orderly succession which had hitherto prevailed was not only an evil precedent but an immediate disaster The new emperor proved a far worse governor than the unfortunate Maurice who in spite of his faults and his ill luck had always been hard working moderate pious and economical Phocas was a mere brutal soldier cruel ignorant suspicious and reckless and in his incapable hands the empire began to fall to pieces with alarming rapidity He opened his reign with a series of cruel executions of his predecessor s friends and from that moment his deeds of bloodshed never ceased probably the worst of them was the execution of Constantina widow of Maurice and daughter of Tiberius II whom he slew together with her three young daughters lest their names might be used as the excuse for a conspiracy against him But even greater horror seems to have been caused when he burnt alive the able general Narses seventeen who had won many laurels in the last Persian war Narses had come up to the capital under safe conduct to clear himself from accusations of treason so the Emperor not only devised a punishment which had never yet been heard of since the empire became Christian but broke his own plighted oath The moment that Phocas had mounted the throne Chosroes of Persia declared war on him using the hypocritical pretext that he wished to revenge Maurice for whom he professed a warm personal friendship This war was far different from the indecisive contests in the reigns of Justinian and Justin II In two successive years the Persians burst into North Syria and ravaged it as far as the sea but in the third they turned north and swept over the hitherto untouched provinces of Asia Minor In six hundred eight their main army penetrated across Cappadocia and Galatia right up to the gates of Chalcedon The inhabitants of Constantinople could see the blazing villages across the water on the Asiatic shore a sight as new as it was terrifying for although Thrace had several times been harried to within sight of the city no enemy had ever been seen in Bithynia Plot after plot was formed in the capital against Phocas but he succeeded in putting them all down and slew the conspirators with fearful tortures For eight years his reign continued Constantinople was full of executions Asia was ravaged from sea to sea the Thracian and Illyrian provinces were overrun more and more by the Slavs now that the army of Europe had been transferred across the Bosphorus to make head against the Persians Yet Phocas still held on to Constantinople the creature of a military revolt himself it was by a military revolt alone that he was destined to be overthrown Africa was the only portion of the Roman Empire which in the reign of Phocas was suffering neither from civil strife nor foreign invasion It was well governed by the aged exarch Heraclius who was so well liked in the province that the emperor had not dared to depose him Urged by desperate entreaties from all parties in Constantinople to strike a blow against the tyrant and deliver the empire from the yoke of a monster Heraclius at last consented He quietly got ready a fleet which he placed under the orders of his son who bore the same name as himself This he despatched against Constantinople while at the same time his nephew Nicetas led a large body of horse along the African shore to invade Egypt When Heraclius the younger arrived with his fleet at the Dardanelles all the prominent citizens of Constantinople fled secretly to take refuge with him As he neared the capital the troops of Phocas burst into mutiny the tyrant s fleet was scattered after a slight engagement and the city threw open its gates Phocas was seized in the palace by an official whom he had cruelly wronged and brought aboard the galley of the conqueror Is it thus said Heraclius that you have governed the empire Will you govern it any better sneered the desperate usurper Heraclius spurned him away with his foot and the sailors hewed him to pieces on the deck Next day the patriarch and the senate hailed Heraclius as emperor and he was duly crowned in saint Sophia on October five A D six hundred ten Heraclius took over the empire in such a state of disorder and confusion that he must soon have felt that there was some truth in the dying sneer of Phocas It seemed almost impossible to get things into better order for resources were wanting Save Africa and Egypt and the district immediately around the capital all the provinces were overrun by the Persian the Avar and the Slav The treasury was empty and the army had almost disappeared owing to repeated and bloody defeats in Asia Minor Heraclius seems at first to have almost despaired of the possibility of evolving order out of this chaos though he was in the prime of life and strength a man of middle stature strongly built and broad chested with grey eyes and yellow hair and of a very fair complexion he wore a bushy beard when he came to the throne but afterwards cut it short For the first twelve years of his reign he remained at Constantinople endeavouring to reorganize the empire and to defend at any rate the frontiers of Thrace and Asia Minor The more distant provinces he hardly seems to have hoped to save and the chronicle of his early years is filled with the catalogue of the losses of the empire Mesopotamia and North Syria had already been lost by Phocas but in six hundred thirteen while the imperial armies were endeavouring to defend Cappadocia the Persian general Shahrbarz turned southwards and attacked Central Syria The great town of Damascus fell into his hands but worse was to come In six hundred fourteen the Persian army appeared before the holy city of Jerusalem took it after a short resistance and occupied it with a garrison But the populace rose and slaughtered the Persian troops when Shahrbarz had departed with his main army This brought him back in wrath he stormed the city and put ninety thousand Christians to the sword only sparing the Jewish inhabitants Zacharias Patriarch of Jerusalem was carried into captivity and with him went what all Christians then regarded as the most precious thing in the world the wood of the True Cross Helena the mother of Constantine had dug the relic up according to the well known legend on Mount Moriah and built for it a splendid shrine Now Shahrbarz desecrated the church and took off the True Cross to Persia This loss brought the inhabitants of the East almost to despair they thought that the luck of the empire had departed with the Holy Wood which had served as its Palladium and even imagined that the Last Day was at hand and that Chosroes of Persia was Antichrist The mad language of pride and insult which the Persian in the day of his triumph used to Heraclius might also explain their belief His blasphemous phrases seem like an echo of the letter of Sennacherib in the Second Book of Kings The epistle ran Chosroes greatest of gods and master of the whole earth to Heraclius his vile and insensate slave Have I not destroyed the Greeks You say you trust in your God why then has he not delivered out of my hand Caesarea Jerusalem and Alexandria Shall I not also destroy Constantinople But I will pardon all your sins if you will come to me with your wife and children I will give you lands vines and olive groves and will look upon you with a kindly aspect Do not deceive yourself with the vain hope in that Christ who was not even able to save himself from the Jews who slew him by nailing him to a cross The horror and rage roused by the loss of the True Cross and the blasphemies of King Chosroes brought about the first real outburst of national feeling that we meet in the history of the Eastern Empire It was felt that the fate of Christendom hung in the balance and that all from highest to lowest were bound to make one great effort to beat back the fire worshipping Persians from Palestine and recover the Holy Places The Emperor vowed that he would take the field at the head of the army a thing most unprecedented for since the death of Theodosius I in three hundred ninety five no Caesar had ever gone out in person to war The Church came forward in the most noble way at the instance of the Patriarch Sergius all the churches of Constantinople sent their treasures and ornaments to the mint to be coined down and serve as a great loan to the state which was to be repaid when the Persians should have been conquered The free dole of corn which the inhabitants of the capital had been receiving ever since the days of Constantine was abolished and the populace bore the privation without demur It was indeed observed that this measure not only saved the treasury but drove into the army where they were useful thousands of the able bodied loiterers who were the strength of the circus factions and the pest of the city If the dole had been continued Heraclius could not have found a penny for the war Egypt the granary of the empire had been lost in six hundred sixteen and the supply of government corn entirely cut off so that the dole would have had to be provided by the treasury buying corn a ruinously expensive task By the aid of the Church loan Heraclius equipped a new army and strengthened his fleet He also provided for the garrisoning of Constantinople by an adequate force a most necessary precaution for in six hundred seventeen the Persians had again forced their way to the Bosphorus and this time captured Chalcedon Heraclius would probably have taken the field next year but for troubles with the Avars That wild race had long been working their wicked will on the almost undefended Thracian provinces but now they promised peace Heraclius went out at the Chagan s pressing invitation to meet him near Heraclea But the conference was a snare for the treacherous savage had planted ambushes on the way to secure the person of the Emperor and Heraclius only escaped by the speed of his horse He cast off his imperial mantle to ride the faster and galloped into the capital just in time to close its gates as the vanguard of the Chagan s army came in sight The Avars kept the Emperor engaged for some time and it was not till six hundred twenty two that he was able to take the field against the Persians This expedition of Heraclius was in spirit the first of the Crusades It was the first war that the Roman Empire had ever undertaken in a spirit of religious enthusiasm for it was to no mere political end that the Emperor and his people looked forward The army marched out to save Christendom to conquer the Holy Places and to recover the True Cross The men were wrought up to a high pitch of enthusiasm by warlike sermons and the Emperor carried with him to stimulate his zeal a holy picture one of those eikons in which the Greek Church has always delighted which was believed to be the work of no mortal hands Heraclius made no less than six campaigns A D six hundred twenty two twenty seven in his gallant and successful attempt to save the half ruined empire He won great and well deserved fame and his name would be reckoned among the foremost of the world s warrior kings if it had not been for the misfortunes which afterwards fell on him in his old age His first campaign cleared Asia Minor of the Persian hosts not by a direct attack but by skilful strategy Instead of attacking the army at Chalcedon he took ship and landed in Cilicia in the rear of the enemy threatening in this position both Syria and Cappadocia As he expected the Persians broke up from their camp opposite Constantinople and came back to fall upon him But after much manoeuvring he completely beat the general Shahrbarz and cleared Asia Minor of the enemy In his next campaigns Heraclius endeavoured to liberate the rest of the Roman Empire by a similar plan he resolved to assail Chosroes at home and force him to recall the armies he kept in Syria and Egypt to defend his own Persian provinces In six hundred twenty three four the Emperor advanced across the Armenian mountains and threw himself into Media where his army revenged the woes of Antioch and Jerusalem by burning the fire temples of Ganzaca the Median capital and Thebarmes the birthplace of the Persian prophet Zoroaster Chosroes as might have been expected recalled his troops from the west and fought two desperate battles to cover Ctesiphon His generals were defeated in both but the Roman army suffered severely Winter was at hand and Heraclius fell back on Armenia In his next campaign he recovered Roman Mesopotamia with its fortresses of Amida Dara and Martyropolis and again defeated the general Shahrbarz But six hundred twenty six was the decisive year of the war The obstinate Chosroes determined on one final effort to crush Heraclius by concerting a joint plan of operations with the Chagan of the Avars While the main Persian army watched the emperor in Armenia a great body under Shahrbarz slipped south of him into Asia Minor and marched on the Bosphorus At the same moment the Chagan of the Avars with the whole force of his tribe and of his Slavonic dependants burst over the Balkans and beset Constantinople on the European side The two barbarian hosts could see each other across the water and even contrived to exchange messages but the Roman fleet sailing incessantly up and down the strait kept them from joining forces In the June July and August of six hundred twenty six the capital was thus beset the danger appeared imminent and the Emperor was far away on the Euphrates But the garrison was strong the patrician Bonus its commander was an able officer the fleet was efficient and the same crusading fervour which had inspired the Constantinopolitans in six hundred twenty two still buoyed up their spirits In the end of July eighty thousand Avars and Slavs with all sorts of siege implements delivered simultaneous assaults along the land front of the city but they were beaten back with great slaughter Next the Chagan built himself rafts and tried to bring the Persians across but the Roman galleys sunk the clumsy structures and slew thousands of the Slavs who had come off in small boats to attack the fleet Then the Chagan gave up the siege in disgust and retired across the Danube Heraclius had shown great confidence in the strength of Constantinople and the courage of its defenders He sent a few veteran troops to aid the garrison but did not slacken from his attack on Persia While Shahrbarz and the Chagan were besieging his capital he himself was wasting Media and Mesopotamia He imitated King Chosroes in calling in Tartar allies from the north and revenged the ravages of the Avars in Thrace by turning forty thousand Khazar horsemen loose on Northern Persia The enemy gave way before him everywhere and the Persians began to grow desperate Next year King Chosroes put into the field the last levy of Persia under a general named Rhazates whom he bid to go out and conquer or die At the same time he wrote to command Shahrbarz to evacuate Chalcedon and return home in haste But Heraclius intercepted the despatch of recall and Shahrbarz came not Near Nineveh Heraclius fell in with the Persian home army and inflicted on it a decisive defeat He himself charging at the head of his cavalry rode down the general of the enemy and slew him with his lance Chosroes could put no new army in the field and by Christmas Heraclius had seized his palace of Dastagerd and divided among his troops such a plunder as had never been seen since Alexander the Great captured Susa The Nemesis of Chosroes insane vanity had now arrived Ten years after he had written his vaunting letter to Heraclius he found himself in far worse plight than his adversary had ever been After Dastagerd had fallen he retired to Ctesiphon the capital of his empire but even from thence he had to flee on the approach of the enemy Then the end came his own son Siroes and his chief nobles seized him and threw him in chains and a few days after he died of rage and despair according to one story of starvation if the darker tale is true The new king sent the humblest messages to the victorious Roman hailing him as his father and apologizing for all the woes that the ambition of Chosroes had brought upon the world Heraclius received his ambassadors with kindness and granted peace on the condition that every inch of Roman territory should be evacuated all Roman captives freed a war indemnity paid and the spoils of Jerusalem including the True Cross faithfully restored Siroes consented with alacrity and in March six hundred twenty eight a glorious peace ended the twenty six years of the Persian war Heraclius returned to Constantinople in the summer of the same year with his spoils his victorious army and his great trophy the Holy Wood His entry was celebrated in the style of an old Roman triumph and the Senate conferred on him the title of the New Scipio The whole of the citizens bearing myrtle boughs came out to meet the army and the ceremony concluded with the exhibition of the True Cross before the high altar of saint Sophia Heraclius afterwards took it back in great pomp to Jerusalem This was perhaps the greatest triumph that any emperor ever won Heraclius had surpassed the eastern achievements of Trajan and Severus and led his troops further east than any Roman general had ever penetrated His task too had been the hardest ever imposed on an emperor none of his predecessors had ever started to war with his very capital beleaguered and with three fourths of his provinces in the hands of the enemy Since Julius Caesar no one had fought so incessantly for six years the emperor had not been out of the saddle nor met with such uniform success Heraclius returned to Constantinople to spend as he hoped the rest of his years in peace He had now reached the age of fifty four and was much worn by his incessant campaigning But the quiet for which he yearned was to be denied him and the end of his reign was to be almost as disastrous as the commencement The great Saracen invasion was at hand and it was at the very moment of Heraclius triumph that Mahomet sent out his famous circular letter to the kings of the earth inviting them to embrace Islam If the Emperor could but have known that his desolated realm spoiled for ten long years by the Persian and the Avar and drained of men and money was to be invaded by a new enemy far more terrible than the old he would have prayed that the day of his triumph might also be the day of his death XI SOCIAL AND RELIGIOUS LIFE A D three hundred twenty six hundred twenty The reign of Heraclius forms the best dividing point in the history of the empire between what may roughly be called Ancient History and the Middle Ages There is no break at all between Constantine and Heraclius though the area character social life and religion of the empire had been greatly modified in the three hundred years that separated them The new order of things which commenced when Constantine established his capital on the Bosphorus had a peaceable and orderly development The first prominent fact that strikes the eye in the history of the three centuries is that the sceptre passed from sovereign to sovereign in quiet and undisturbed devolution From the death of Valens onward there is no instance of a military usurper breaking the line of succession till the crowning of Phocas in six hundred two The emperors were either designated by their predecessors or less frequently chosen by the high officials and the senate The regularity of their sequence is all the more astonishing when we realize that only in three cases in the whole period was father succeeded by son Saving Constantine himself Theodosius I and Arcadius not a single emperor left male issue yet the hereditary instinct had grown so strong in the empire that nephews sons in law and brothers in law of sovereigns were gladly received as their legitimate heirs Considering this tendency it is extraordinary to note that the whole three hundred years did not produce a single unmitigated tyrant Constantius II was gloomy and sometimes cruel Valens was stupid and avaricious Arcadius utterly weak and inept Justinian hard and thankless but the general average of the emperors were men of respectable ability and in moral character they will compare favourably with any list of sovereigns of similar length that any country can produce The chief modifications which must be marked in the character of the empire between three hundred twenty and six hundred twenty depend on two processes of gradual change which were going on throughout the three centuries The first was the gradual de Romanization if we may coin the uncouth word alike of the governing classes and the masses of population In the fourth century the Roman impress was still strong in the East the Latin language was habitually spoken by every educated man and nearly all the machinery of the administration was worked in Latin phraseology All law terms are habitually Latin all titles of officers all names of taxes and institutions Writers born and bred in Greece or Asia still wrote in Latin as often as in the Greek which must have been more familiar to them Ammianus Marcellinus may serve as a fair example born in Greece he wrote in the tongue of the ruling race rather than in his own idiom Moreover there was still in the lands east of the Adriatic a very large body of Latin speaking population comprising all the inhabitants of the inland of the Balkan peninsula for except Greece proper Macedonia and a scattered line of cities along the Thracian coast the whole land had learnt to speak the tongue of its conquerors By the seventh century this Roman element was rapidly vanishing It is true that the Emperor was still hailed as the Pius Felix Perpetuus Augustus it was not till about A D eight hundred that he dropped the old style and called himself Nor were the old Roman official titles yet disused men were still tribunes and patricians counts and praetors but little more than the names survived Already in the sixth century a knowledge of Latin was growing unusual even among educated men The author Johannes Lydus tells us that he owed his rise in the civil service mainly to this rare accomplishment Procopius the best writer of the day and a man of real merit and discernment was absolutely ignorant of the rudiments of Latin and blunders when he tries to translate the simplest phrase Justinian was the last emperor who spoke Latin as his mother tongue all his successors were better skilled in Greek The gradual disuse of Latin has its origin in the practical though not formal solution of the continuity between Rome and the East which began with the division of the empire between the sons of Constantine and became more complete after Odoacer made himself King of Italy in four hundred seventy six In the course of a century and a half the Latin element in the East cut off from the Latin speaking West was bound to yield before the predominant Greek But the process would have been slower if the Eastern provinces which spoke Latin had not been those which suffered most from the barbarians The Visigoths and Ostrogoths harassed and decimated the Thracians Illyrians and Moesians but the Slavs a century later almost exterminated them In A D four hundred probably a quarter of the provincials east of the Adriatic spoke Latin in A D six hundred twenty not a tenth The Romanized lands of the Balkan peninsula had now become Slavonic principalities only the Dalmatian seaports and a few scattered survivors in the Balkans still used the old tongue The only districts where a considerable Latin speaking population obeyed the Emperor were Africa and the Italian Exarchate now reunited to Constantinople by the conquests of Justinian But they seem to have been too remote from the centre of life and government to have exercised any influence or delayed the de Romanizing of the East The last notable author who being a subject of the empire wrote in Latin as his native tongue was the poet Flavius Corippus who addressed a long panegyric to Justinus II as might have been expected he was an African While the empire was losing its Roman characteristics it was at the same time growing more and more Christian at heart Under Constantine and his immediate successors the machinery of government was only just beginning to be effected by the change of the emperor s religion Though the sovereign personally was Christian the system remained what it had been before Many of the high officials were still pagans and the form and spirit of all administrative and legal business was unaltered from what it had been in the third century It is not till forty years after Constantine s death that we find the Christian spirit fully penetrating out of the spiritual into the material sphere of life Attempts by the State to suppress moral sin no less than legal crime begin with Theodosius I whose crusade against sexual immorality would have been incomprehensible to even the best of the pagan emperors The old gladiatorial shows one of the most characteristic and repulsive features of Roman life were abolished not long after They survived for sixty years at Rome though Christian Constantinople never knew them But this was not the work of the State but of a single individual One day in A D four hundred four the games had begun and the gladiators were about to engage when the monk Telemachus leapt down into the arena and threw himself between the combatants adjuring them not to slay their brethren There was an angry scuffle and the good monk was slain But his death had the effect that his protests might have failed to bring about and no gladiatorial show was ever given again Illustration General View Of saint Sophia From L Art Byzantin Par C Bayet Paris Quantin eighteen eighty three In other provinces of social life the work of Christianity was no less marked It put an end to the detestable practice of infanticide which pervaded the ancient world resting on the assumption that the father had the right to decide whether or not he would rear the child he had begotten Constantine made the State assume the charge of feeding and rearing the children of the destitute lest their parents should be tempted to cast them forth to perish in the old fashion and Valentinian I in three hundred seventy four assimilated infanticide to other forms of murder and made it a capital offence Slavery was also profoundly affected by the teaching of the Church The ancient world save a few philosophers had regarded the slave with such contempt that he was hardly reckoned a moral being or conceived to have rights or virtues Christianity taught that he was a man with an immortal soul no less than his own master and bade slaves and freemen meet on terms of perfect equality around the baptismal font and before the sacred table It was from the first taught that the man who manumitted his slaves earned the approval of heaven and all occasions of rejoicing public and private were fitly commemorated by the liberation of deserving individuals Though slavery was not extinguished for centuries its evils were immensely modified Justinian s legislation shows that by his time public opinion had condemned the characteristic evils of ancient slavery he permitted the intermarriage of slaves and free persons stipulating only for the consent of the owner of the servile partner in the wedlock He declared the children of such mixed marriages free and he made the prostitution of a slave by a master a criminal offence Hereditary slavery became almost unknown and the institution was only kept up by the introduction of barbarian captives heathens and enemies whose position did not appeal so keenly to the mind of their captors The improvement of the condition of all the unhappy classes of which we have been speaking women infants slaves gladiators can be directly traced back to a single fundamental Christian truth It was the belief in the importance of the individual human soul in the eyes of God that led the converted Roman to realize his responsibility and change his attitude towards the helpless beings whom he had before despised and neglected It is only fair to add that the realization of this central truth did not always operate for good in the Roman world of the fifth and sixth centuries Some of the developments of the new idea were harmful and even dangerous to the State They took the form of laying such exclusive stress on the relations between the individual soul and heaven that the duties of man to the State were half forgotten Chief among these developments was the ascetic monasticism which starting from Egypt spread rapidly all over the empire more especially over its eastern provinces When men retire from their duties as citizens intent on nothing but on saving their own souls take up a position outside the State and cease to be of the slightest use to society the result may be harmless so long as their numbers are small But at this time the monastic impulse was working on such a large scale that its development was positively dangerous It was by thousands and ten thousands that the men who ought to have been bearing the burdens of the State stepped aside into the monastery or the hermit s cave The ascetics of the fifth century had neither of the justifications which made monasticism precious in a later age they were neither missionaries nor men of learning The monastery did not devote itself either to sending out preachers and teachers or to storing up and cherishing the literary treasures of the ancient world The first abbot to whom it occurred to turn the vast leisure of his monks to good account by setting them systematically to work at copying manuscripts was Cassiodorus the ex secretary to King Theodoric the Goth A D five hundred thirty forty Before his time monks and books had no special connection with each other When a State contains masses of men who devote their whole energies to a repulsively selfish attempt to save their own individual souls while letting the world around them slide on as best it may then the body politic is diseased The Roman Empire in its fight with the barbarians was in no small degree hampered by this attitude of so many of its subjects The ascetic took the barbarian invasions as judgments from heaven rightly inflicted upon a wicked world and not as national calamities which called on every citizen to join in the attempt to repel them Many men complacently interpreted the troubles of the fifth century as the tribulations predicted in the Apocalypse and watched them develop with something like joy since they must portend the close approach of the Second Advent of our Lord This apathetic attitude of many Christians during the afflictions of the empire was maddening to the heathen minority which still survived among the educated classes They roundly accused Christianity of being the ruin of the State by its anti social teaching which led men to neglect every duty of the citizen The Christian author Orosius felt himself compelled to write a lengthy history to confute this view aiming his work at the pagan Symmachus whose book had been devoted to tracing all the calamities of the world to the conversion of Constantine It was fortunate for the empire that its governing classes continued to preserve the old traditions of Roman state craft and fought on doggedly against all the ills of their time barbarian invasion famine and pestilence instead of bowing to the yoke and recognizing in every calamity the righteous judgment of heaven and the indication of the approaching end of the world Paganism had practically disappeared by the end of the fifth century as an active force none save a few philosophers made an open profession of it and in five hundred twenty nine Justinian put a formal end to their teaching by closing the schools of Athens the last refuge of the professors of the expiring religion But if open heathenism was dead a large measure of indifferentism prevailed among the educated classes many men who in the fifth century would have been pagans were Christians in name in the sixth but little affected by Christianity in their lives This type was extremely common among the literary and official classes There are plenty of sixth century authors Procopius may serve as an example whose works show no trace of Christian thought though the writer was undoubtedly a professing member of the Church Similar examples could be quoted by the dozen from among the administrators lawyers and statesmen of the day but all were now nominally Christian As time went on such men grew rarer and the old stern non religious Roman character passed away into the emotional and superstitious mediaeval type of mind The survival of pre Christian feeling which appeared as indifferentism among the educated classes took a very different shape among the lower strata of society It revealed itself in a crowd of gross superstitions connected with magic witchcraft fortune telling charms and trivial or obscene ceremonies practised in secret The State highly disapproved of such practices treated them as impious or heretical and imposed punishment on those who employed them but nevertheless these contemptible survivals of heathenism persisted down to the latest days of the empire It has been usual to include all the Eastern Romans of all the centuries between Constantine I and Constantine XIV in one sweeping condemnation as cowardly corrupt and effete The ordinary view of Byzantine life may be summed up in mister Lecky s irritating statement eighteen that the universal verdict of history is that it constitutes the most base and despicable form that civilization ever assumed and that there has been no other enduring civilization so absolutely destitute of all the forms and elements of greatness none to which the epithet mean may be so emphatically applied It is a monstrous story of the intrigues of priests eunuchs and women of poisoning conspiracies uniform ingratitude perpetual fratricide How mister Lecky obtained his universal verdict of history it is hard to see certainly that verdict can not have been arrived at after a study of the evidence bearing on the life of the persons accused It sounds like a cheap echo of the second hand historians of fifty years ago whose staple commodity was Gibbon and water Illustration Illuminated Initials From Byzantine MSS From L Art Byzantin Par C Bayet Paris Quantin eighteen eighty three If we must sum up the characteristics of the East Romans and their civilization the conclusion at which we arrive will be very different It is only fair to acknowledge that they had their faults what else could be expected when we know that the foundations of the Eastern Empire were laid upon the Oriental provinces of the old Roman world among races that had long been stigmatized by their masters as hopelessly effete and corrupt Syrians Egyptians and Hellenized Asiatics whom even the degenerate Romans of the third century had been wont to despise The Byzantine Empire displayed from its very cradle a taint of weakness derived from this Oriental origin It showed features particularly obnoxious to the modern mind of the nineteenth century such as the practice of a degrading and grovelling court etiquette full of prostrations and genuflexions the introduction of eunuchs and slaves into high offices of State the wholesale and deliberate use of treachery and lying in matters of diplomacy But remembering its origins we shall on the whole wonder at the good points in Byzantine civilization rather than at its faults It may fairly be said that Christianity raised the Roman East to a better moral position than it had known for a thousand years With all their faults the monks and hermits of the fifth century are a good substitute for the priests of Cybele and Mithras of the second It was something that the Government and the public opinion of the day had concurred to sweep away the orgies of Daphne and Canopus Church and State united in the reign of Justinian to punish with spiritual and bodily death the unnatural crimes which had been the open practice of emperors themselves in the first centuries of the empire The vices of which the East Romans have most commonly been accused are cowardice frivolity and treachery On each of these points they have been grossly wronged Cowardice was certainly not the chief characteristic of the centuries that produced emperors like Theodosius I and Heraclius prelates like Athanasius and Chrysostom public servants like Belisarius and Priscus It is not for cowardice that we note the Byzantine populace which routed Gainas and his mercenaries and raised the Nika sedition but for turbulence If military virtue was wanting to the East Roman armies how came the Ostrogoth and Vandal to be conquered the Persian and the Hun to be driven off how above all was the desperate struggle against the fanatical Saracen protracted for four hundred years till at last the Caliphate broke up Frivolity and luxury are an accusation easy to bring against any age Every moralist from Jeremiah to Juvenal and from Juvenal to mister Ruskin has believed his own generation to be the most obnoxious and contemptible in the world s history We have numerous tirades against the manners of Constantinople preserved in Byzantine literature and may judge from them something of the faults of the time It would seem that there was much of the sort of luxury to which ascetic preachers take exception much splendour of raiment much ostentatious display of plate and furniture of horses and chariots Luxury and evil living often go together but when we examine all the enormities laid to the charge of the Byzantines there is less alleged than we might expect When Chrysostom raged against the contemporaries of Arcadius his anathemas fell on such crimes as the use of cosmetics and dyes by fashionable dames on the gambling propensities of their husbands on the immoral tendencies of the theatre on the drunken orgies at popular festivals accusations to which any age our own included might plead guilty The races of the Circus played a disproportionate part in social life and attracted the enthusiastic attention of thousands of votaries but it is surely hard that our own age with all its sporting and athletic interests should cast a stone at the sixth century We have not to look far around us to discover classes for whom horse racing still presents an inexplicable attraction When we remember that the Constantinopolitans were excitable Orientals and had no other form of sport to distract their attention from the Circus we can easily realize the genesis of the famous riots of the Blues and Greens From the darker forms of vice great cities have never been free and there is no reason to think that Constantinople in the sixth century differed from London in the nineteenth It is fair to point out that Christian public opinion and the Government strove their best to put down sexual immorality Theodosius and Justinian are recorded to have entered upon the herculean task of endeavouring to suppress all disorderly houses the latter made exile the penalty for panders and procuresses and inflicted death on those guilty of the worst extremes of immorality We must remember too that if Constantinople showed much vice it also displayed shining examples of the social virtues The Empress Flaccilla was wont to frequent the hospitals and tend the beds of the sick Of the monastic severity which the Empress Pulcheria displayed in the palace we have spoken already After cowardice and light morals it is treachery that is popularly cited as the most prominent vice of the Eastern Empire There have been other states and epochs more given to plots and revolts but it is still true that there was too much intrigue at Constantinople The reason is not far to seek the carriere ouverte aux talents practically existed there and the army and the civil service were full of poor able and ambitious men of all races and classes mixed together The converted Goth or the renegade Persian the half civilized mountaineer from Isauria the Copt and Syrian and Armenian were all welcomed in the army or civil service if only they had ability Both the bureaucracy and the army therefore had elements which lacked patriotism conscience and stability and were prone to seek advancement either by intrigue or military revolt This being granted it is perhaps astonishing to have to record that between three hundred fifty and six hundred the empire never once saw its legitimate ruler dethroned either by palace intrigue or military revolt The fact that all the plots and there were many in the period failed hopelessly is on the whole a proof that if there was much treachery there was much loyalty among the East Romans There have certainly been periods in more recent times which show a much worse record nineteen A single instance may suffice Mediaeval Italy from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century could produce far more shocking examples of conscienceless and unjustifiable plotting than the Byzantine Empire in the whole thousand years of its existence XII THE COMING OF THE SARACENS After the peace of six hundred twenty eight the Roman and the Persian Empires drained of men and money and ravaged from end to end by each other s marauding armies sank down in exhaustion to heal them of their deadly wounds Never before had either power dealt its neighbour such fearful blows as in this last struggle in previous wars the contest had been waged around border fortresses and the prize had been the conquest of some small slice of marchland But Chosroes and Heraclius had struck deadly blows at the heart of each other s empire and harried the inmost provinces up to the gates of each other s capitals The Persian had turned the wild hordes of the Avars loose on Thrace and the Roman had guided the yet wilder Chazars up to the walls of Ctesiphon Hence it came to pass that at the end of the war the two powers were each weaker than they had ever been before They were bleeding at every pore utterly wearied and exhausted and desirous of nothing but a long interval of peace to recover their lost strength Precisely at this moment a new and terrible enemy fell upon the two war worn combatants and delivered an attack so vehement that it was destined to destroy the ancient kingdom of Persia and to shear away half the provinces of the Roman Empire The politics of Arabia had up to this time been of little moment either to Roman or Persian Each of them had allies among the Arab tribes and had sometimes sent an expedition or an embassy southward into the land beyond the Syrian desert But neither of them dreamed that the scattered and disunited tribes of Arabia would ever combine or become a serious danger But while Heraclius and Chosroes were harrying each other s realms events of world wide importance had been taking place in the Arabian peninsula For the first and last time in history there had arisen among the Arabs one of those world compelling minds that are destined to turn aside the current of events into new channels and change the face of whole continents Mahomet that strangest of moral enigmas prophet and seer fanatic and impostor was developing his career all through the years of the Persian war By an extraordinary mixture of genuine enthusiasm and vulgar cunning of self deception and deliberate imposture of benevolence and cruelty of austerity and licence he had worked himself and his creed to the front The turbulent polytheists of Arabia had by him been converted into a compact band of fanatics burning to carry all over the world by the force of their swords their new war cry that God was God and Mahomet His prophet In six hundred twenty eight the last year of the great war the Arab sent his summons to Heraclius and Chosroes bidding them embrace Islam 
7859_102518_000006_000001	train-clean-100	The Persian replied with the threat that he would put the Prophet in chains when he had leisure 
none	none	The Roman made no direct reply but sent Mahomet some small presents neglecting the theological bent of his message and only thinking of enlisting a possible political ally Both answers were regarded as equally unsatisfactory by the Prophet and he doomed the two empires to a similar destruction Next year six hundred twenty nine the first collision between the East Romans and the Arabs took place a band of Moslems having pushed a raid up to Muta near the Dead Sea But it was not till three years later when Mahomet himself was already dead that the storm fell on the Roman Empire In obedience to the injunctions of his deceased master the Caliph Abu Bekr prepared two armies and launched the one against Palestine and the other against Persia Till the last seven or eight years English writers have been inclined to underrate the force and fury of an army of Mahometan fanatics in the first flush of their enthusiasm Now that we have witnessed in our own day the scenes of Tamaai and Abu Klea we do so no longer The rush that can break into a British square bristling with Martini Henry rifles is not a thing to be despised For the future we shall not treat lightly the armies of the early Caliphs nor scoff with Gibbon at the feebleness of the troops who were routed by them If the soldiers of Queen Victoria armed with modern rifles and artillery found the fanatical Arab a formidable foe let us not blame the soldiers of Heraclius who faced the same enemy with pike and sword alone In the early engagements between the East Romans and the Saracens the superior discipline and more regular arms of the one were not a sufficient counterpoise to put against the mad recklessness of the other The Moslem wanted to get killed that he might reap the fruits of martyrdom in the other world and cared not how he died if he had first slain an enemy The Roman fought well enough but he did not like his adversary yearn to become a martyr and the odds were on the man who held his life the cheapest The moment of the Saracen invasion was chosen most unhappily for Heraclius He had just paid off the enormous debt that he had contracted to the Church and to do so had not only drained the treasury but imposed some new and unwise taxes on the harassed provincials and disbanded many of his veterans for the sake of economy Syria and Egypt after spending twelve and ten years respectively under the Persian yoke had not yet got back into their old organization Both countries were much distracted with religious troubles the heretical sects of the Monophysites and Jacobites who swarmed within their boundaries had lifted up their heads under the Persian rule being relieved from the governmental repression that had hitherto been their lot They seem to have constituted an actual majority of the population and bitterly resented the endeavours of Heraclius to enforce orthodoxy in the reconquered provinces Their discontent was so bitter that during the Saracen invasion they stood aside and refused to help the imperial armies or even on occasion aided the alien enemy The details of the Arab conquest of Syria have not been preserved by the East Roman historians who seem to have hated the idea of recording the disasters of Christendom The Moslems on the other hand had not yet commenced to write and ere historians arose among them the tale of the invasion had been intertwined with a whole cycle of romantic legends fitter for the Arabian Nights than the sober pages of a chronicle But the main lines of the war can be reconstructed with accuracy The Saracen horde under Abu Obeida emerged from the desert in the spring of six hundred thirty four and captured Bostra the frontier city of Syria to the east by the aid of treachery from within The Romans collected an army to drive them off but in July it was defeated at Aijnadin Gabatha in Ituraea Thoroughly roused by this disaster Heraclius set all the legions of the East marching and sixty thousand men crossed the Jordan and advanced to recover Bostra The Arabs met them at the fords of the Hieromax an Eastern tributary of the Jordan and a fierce battle raged all day 
7859_102518_000010_000004	train-clean-100	The Romans drove the enemy back to the very gates of their camp but a last charge headed by the fierce warrior Khaled broke their firm array when a victory seemed almost assured

none	none	Hardly had he reached it when the news arrived that his discontented and demoralized troops had proclaimed a rebel emperor though the enemy was before them The rebel his name was Baanes was put down but meanwhile Antioch Chalcis and all Northern Syria fell into the hands of the Arabs Worse yet was to follow In the next year six hundred thirty seven Jerusalem fell after a desperate resistance protracted for more than twelve months The inhabitants refused to surrender except to the Caliph in person and the aged Omar came over the desert proud to take possession of the city which Mahomet had reckoned the holiest site on earth save Mecca alone The Patriarch Sophronius was commanded to guide the conqueror around the city and when he saw the rude Arab standing by the altar of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre cried aloud Now is the Abomination of Desolation which was spoken of by Daniel the prophet truly in the Holy Place The Caliph did not confiscate any of the great Christian sanctuaries but he took the site of Solomon s Temple and erected on it a magnificent Mosque known ever since as the Mosque of Omar The tale of the last years of Heraclius is most melancholy The Emperor lay at Constantinople slowly dying of dropsy and his eldest son Constantine had to take the field in his stead But the young prince received a crushing defeat in six hundred thirty eight when he attempted to recover North Syria and next year the Arabs under Amrou pressed eastward across the Isthmus of Suez and threw themselves upon Egypt Two years more of fighting sufficed to conquer the granary of the Roman Empire and in February six hundred forty one when Heraclius died the single port of Alexandria was the sole remaining possession of the Romans in Egypt The ten years war which had torn Syria and Egypt from the hands of the unfortunate Heraclius had been even more fatal to his Eastern neighbour The Arabs had attacked the Persian kingdom at the same moment that they fell on Syria two great battles at Kadesia six hundred thirty six and Yalulah six hundred thirty seven sufficed to place all Western Persia in the hands of the Moslems King Isdigerd the last of the Sassanian line raised his last army in six hundred forty one and saw it cut to pieces at the decisive field of Nehauend He fled away to dwell as an exile among the Turks and all his kingdom as far as the borders of India became the prey of the conquerors Heraclius had married twice by his first wife Eudocia he left a single son Constantine who should have been his sole heir But he had taken a second wife and this wife was his own niece Martina The incestuous choice had provoked much scandal and was the one grave offence which could be brought against Heraclius whose life was in other respects blameless Martina an ambitious and intriguing woman prevailed on her aged husband to make her eldest son Heracleonas joint heir with his half brother Constantine This arrangement as might have been expected worked very badly The court and army was at once split up between the adherents of the two young Emperors and while the defence of the empire against the Saracens should have been the sole care of the East Romans they found themselves distracted by fierce Court intrigues Armed strife between the Emperors seemed destined to break out but after reigning only a few months Constantine III died It was rumoured far and wide that his step mother had poisoned him to make the way clear for her own son Heracleonas who immediately proclaimed himself sole emperor The senate and the Byzantine populace were both highly indignant at this usurpation for the deceased Constantine left a young son named Constans who was thus excluded from the throne to which he was the natural heir Heracleonas had reigned alone no more than a few weeks when the army of the East and the mob of Constantinople were heard demanding in angry tones that Constans should be crowned as his uncle s colleague Heracleonas was frightened into compliance but his submission only saved him for a year In the summer of six hundred forty two the senate decreed his deposition and he was seized by the adherents of Constans and sent into exile along with his mother Martina The victorious faction very cruelly ordered the tongue of the mother and the nose of the son to be slit the first instance of that hateful Oriental practice being applied to members of the royal house but not the last Constans II was sole emperor from six hundred forty two to six hundred sixty eight and his son and successor Constantine IV reigned from six hundred sixty eight to six hundred eighty five They were both strong hard headed warrior princes fit descendants of the gallant Heraclius Their main credit lies in the fact that they fought unceasingly against the Saracen and preserved as a permanent possession of the empire nearly every province that they had still remained Roman at the death of Heraclius During the minority indeed of Constans II Alexandria twenty and Aradus the two last ports preserved by the Romans in Egypt and Syria were lost But the Saracens advanced no further by land the sands of the African desert and the passes of Taurus were destined to hold them back for many years The times however were still dangerous till the murder of the Caliph Othman in six hundred fifty six after which the outbreak of the first civil war among the Moslems the contest of Ali and Moawiah for the Caliphate gave the empire a respite Moawiah who held the lands on the Roman frontier his rival s power lying further to the east secured a free hand against Ali by making peace with Constans He even consented to pay him a small annual subsidy so long as the truce should last This agreement was invaluable to the empire After twenty seven years of incessant war the mangled realm at last obtained an interval of repose It was something too that the Saracens were induced to pause and saw that the extension of their conquests was not destined to spread at once over the whole world When they realized that their victories were not to go on for ever they lost the first keenness of the fanatical courage which had made them so terrible Freed from the Saracen war which had threatened not merely to curtail but to extinguish the empire Constans was at liberty to turn his attention to other matters It seems probable that it was at this moment that the reorganization of the provinces of the empire took place which we find in existence in the second half of the seventh century The old Roman names and boundaries which had endured since Diocletian s time now disappear and the empire is found divided into new provinces with strange denominations They were military in their origin and each consisted of the district covered by a large unit of soldiery what we should call an army corps

seventeen Theodosius retired unharmed to Ephesus where he lived for many years When he died the single word Health was inscribed on his tomb according to his last directions XIV THE SARACENS TURNED BACK By dethroning Theodosius III on the very eve of the great Saracen invasion Leo the Isaurian took upon himself the gravest of responsibilities With a demoralized army which of late had been more accustomed to revolt than to fight a depleted treasury and a disorganized civil service he had to face an attack even more dangerous than that which Constantine IV had beaten off thirty years before Constantine too the fourth of a race of hereditary rulers had a secure throne and a loyal army while Leo was a mere adventurer who had seized the crown only a few months before he was put to the test of the sword The reigning Caliph was now Suleiman the seventh of the house of the Ommeyades He had strained all the resources of his wide empire to provide a fleet and army adequate to the great enterprise which he had taken in hand The chief command of the expedition was given to his brother Moslemah who led an army of eighty thousand men from Tarsus across the centre of Asia Minor and marched on the Hellespont taking the strong city of Pergamus on his way Meanwhile a fleet of eighteen hundred sail under the vizier Suleiman namesake of his master the Caliph sailed from Syria for the Aegean carrying a force no less than that which marched by land Fleet and army met at Abydos on the Hellespont without mishap for Leo had drawn back all his resources naval and military to guard his capital In August seven hundred seventeen only five months after his coronation the Isaurian saw the vessels of the Saracens sailing up the Propontis while their army had crossed into Thrace and was approaching the city from the western side Moslemah caused his troops to build a line of circumvallation from the sea to the Golden Horn cutting Constantinople off from all communication with Thrace while Suleiman blocked the southern exit of the Bosphorus and tried to close it on the northern side also so as to prevent any supplies coming by water from the Euxine Leo however sallied forth from the Golden Horn with his galleys and fire vessels bearing the dreaded Greek fire and did so much harm to the detachment of Saracen ships which had gone northward up the strait that the blockade was never properly established on that side The Saracens relied more on starving out the city than on taking it by storm they had come provided with everything necessary for a blockade of many months and sat down as if intending to remain before the walls for an indefinite time But Constantinople had been provisioned on an even more lavish scale each family had been bidden to lay in a stock of corn for no less a period than two years and famine appeared in the camp of the besiegers long ere it was felt in the houses of the besieged Nor had Moslemah and Suleiman reckoned with the climate Hard winters occasionally occur by the Black Sea as our own army learnt to its cost in the Crimean War But the Saracens were served even worse by the winter of seven hundred seventeen eighteen when the frost never ceased for twelve weeks Leo might have boasted like Czar Nicholas that December January and February were his best generals for these months wrought fearful havoc in the Saracen host The lightly clad Orientals could not stand the weather and died off like flies of dysentery and cold The vizier Suleiman was among those who perished Meanwhile the Byzantines suffered little being covered by roofs all the winter When next spring came round Moslemah would have had to raise the siege if he had not been heavily reinforced both by sea and land A fleet of reserve arrived from Egypt and a large army came up from Tarsus and occupied the Asiatic shores of the Bosphorus But Leo did not despair and took the offensive in the summer His fire ships stole out and burnt the Egyptian squadron as it lay at anchor A body of troops landing on the Bithynian coast surprised and cut to pieces the Saracen army which watched the other side of the strait Soon too famine began to assail the enemy their stores of provisions were now giving out and they had harried the neighbourhood so fiercely that no more food could be got from near at hand while if they sent foraging parties too far from their lines they were cut off by the peasantry At last Moslemah suffered a disaster which compelled him to abandon his task The Bulgarians came down over the Balkans and routed the covering army which observed Adrianople and protected the siege on the western side No less than twenty thousand Saracens fell by the testimony of the Arab historians themselves and the survivors were so cowed that Moslemah gave the order to retire The fleet ferried the land army back into Asia and both forces started homeward Moslemah got back to Tarsus with only thirty thousand men at his back out of more than a hundred thousand who had started with him or come to him as reinforcements The fleet fared even worse it was caught by a tempest in the Aegean and so fearfully shattered that it is said that only five vessels out of the whole Armada got back to Syria unharmed Thus ended the last great endeavour of the Saracen to destroy Constantinople The task was never essayed again though for three hundred and fifty years more wars were constantly breaking out between the Emperor and the Caliph In the future they were always to be border struggles not desperate attempts to strike at the heart of the empire and conquer Europe for Islam To Leo far more than to his contemporary the Frank Charles Martel is the delivery of Christendom from the Moslem danger to be attributed Charles turned back a plundering horde sent out from an outlying province of the Caliphate Leo repulsed the grand army of the Saracens raised from the whole of their eastern realms and commanded by the brother of their monarch Such a defeat was well calculated to impress on their fatalistic minds the idea that Constantinople was not destined by providence to fall into their hands They were by this time far removed from the frantic fanaticism which had inspired their grandfathers and the crushing disaster they had now sustained deterred them from any repetition of the attempt Life and power had grown so pleasant to them that martyrdom was no longer an end in itself they preferred if checked to live and fight another day Leo was however by no means entirely freed from the Saracens by his victory of seven hundred eighteen At several epochs in the latter part of his reign he was troubled by invasions of his border provinces None of them however were really dangerous and after a victory won over the main army of the raiders in seven hundred thirty nine at Acroinon in Phrygia Asia Minor was finally freed from their presence XV THE ICONOCLASTS A D seven hundred twenty eight hundred two If Leo the Isaurian had died on the day on which the army of the Caliph raised the siege of Constantinople it would have been well for his reputation in history Unhappily for himself though happily enough for the East Roman realm he survived yet twenty years to carry through a series of measures which were in his eyes not less important than the repulse of the Moslems from his capital Historians have given to the scheme of reform which he took in hand the name of the Iconoclastic movement because of the opposition to the worship of images which formed one of the most prominent features of his action For the last hundred years the empire had been declining in culture and civilization literature and art seemed likely to perish in the never ending clash of arms the old Roman jurisprudence was being forgotten the race of educated civil servants was showing signs of extinction the governors of provinces were now without exception rough soldiers not members of that old bureaucracy whose Roman traditions had so long kept the empire together Not least among the signs of a decaying civilization were the gross superstitions which had grown up of late in the religious world Christianity had begun to be permeated by those strange mediaeval fancies which would have been as inexplicable to the old Roman mind of four centuries before as they are to the mind of the nineteenth century A rich crop of puerile legends rites and observances had grown up of late around the central truths of religion unnoticed and unguarded against by theologians who devoted all their energies to the barren Monothelite and Monophysite controversies Image worship and relic worship in particular had developed with strange rapidity and assumed the shape of mere Fetishism Every ancient picture or statue was now announced as both miraculously produced and endued with miraculous powers These wonder working pictures and statues were now adored as things in themselves divine the possession of one of them made the fortune of a church or monastery and the tangible object of worship seems to have been regarded with quite as much respect as the saint whose memory it recalled The freaks to which image worship led were in some cases purely grotesque it was for example not unusual to select a picture as the godfather of a child in baptism and to scrape off a little of its paint and produce it at the ceremony to represent the saint Even patriarchs and bishops ventured to assert that the hand of a celebrated representation of the Virgin distilled fragrant balsam The success of the Emperor Heraclius in his Persian campaign was ascribed by the vulgar not so much to his military talent as to the fact that he carried with him a small picture of the Virgin which had fallen from heaven Illustration Bishops Monks Kings Laymen And Women Adoring The Madonna From a Byzantine MS From L Art Byzantin Par Charles Bayet Paris Quantin eighteen eighty three All these vain beliefs inculcated by the clergy and eagerly believed by the mob were repulsive to the educated laymen of the higher classes Their dislike for vain superstitions was emphasized by the influence of Mahometanism on their minds For a hundred years the inhabitants of the Asiatic provinces of the empire had been in touch with a religion of which the noblest feature was its emphatic denunciation of idolatry under every shape and form An East Roman when taunted by his Moslem neighbour for clinging to a faith which had grown corrupt and idolatrous could not but confess that there was too much ground for the accusation when he looked round on the daily practice of his countrymen Hence there had grown up among the stronger minds of the day a vigorous reaction against the prevailing superstitions It was more visible among the laity than among the clergy and far more widespread in Asia than in Europe In Leo the Isaurian this tendency stood incarnate in its most militant form and he left the legacy of his enthusiasm to his descendants Seven years after the relief of Constantinople he commenced his crusade against superstition The chief practices which he attacked were the worship of images and the ascription of divine honours to saints more especially in the form of Mariolatry His son Constantine more bold and drastic than his father endeavoured to suppress monasticism also because he found the monks the most ardent defenders of images but Leo s own measures went no further than a determined attempt to put down image worship The struggle which he inaugurated began in A D seven hundred twenty five when he ordered the removal of all the images in the capital Rioting broke out at once and the officials who were taking down the great figure of Christ Crucified over the palace gate were torn to pieces by a mob The Emperor replied by a series of executions and carried out his policy all over the empire by the aid of armed force The populace headed by the monks opposed a bitter resistance to the Emperor s doings more especially in the European provinces They set the wildest rumours afloat concerning his intentions it was currently reported that the Jews had bought his consent to image breaking and that the Caliph Yezid had secretly converted him to Mahometanism Though Leo s orthodoxy in matters doctrinal was unquestioned and though he had no objection to the representation of the cross as distinguished from the crucifix he was accused of a design to undermine the foundations of Christianity Arianism was the least offensive fault laid to his account The Emperor s enemies did not confine themselves to passive resistance to his crusade against images

convenient for many purposes to use the adjective Byzantine instead of the adjective Roman when we are dealing with the remaining history of the realm that centred at Constantinople XVI THE END OF THE ICONOCLASTS A D eight hundred two eight hundred eighty six The Iconoclastic controversy was far from being extinguished with the fall of the house of Leo the Isaurian It was destined to continue in a milder form for more than half a century after the dethronement of Constantine VI The lines on which it was fought out were still the same the official hierarchy and the Asiatic provinces favoured Iconoclasm the clergy and the European provinces were Iconodules twenty two Hence it is interesting to note that through the greater part of the ninth century while emperors of Eastern birth sat on the throne the views of Leo the Isaurian were still in vogue and that the eventual triumph of the image worshippers only came about when a royal house sprung from one of the European themes the family of Basil the Macedonian gained possession of the crown The treasurer Nicephorus who overthrew Irene and so easily obtained possession of the empire was of Oriental extraction His ancestor had been a Christian Arab prince expelled from his country at the time of the rise of Mahomet and his family had always dwelt in Asia Minor Hence we are not surprised to find that Nicephorus was an Iconoclast and refused to follow in the steps of Irene in the direction of restoring image worship He did not persecute the Iconodules as the Isaurians had done but he gave them no personal encouragement This being so it is natural that we should find his character described in the blackest terms by the monkish chroniclers of the succeeding century He was we are told a hypocrite an oppresser and a miser but we cannot find any very distinct traces of the operation of such vices in his conduct during the nine years of his reign He was not however a very fortunate ruler though he put down with ease several insurrections of discontented generals he was unlucky with his foreign wars The Caliph Haroun al Raschid did much harm to the Asiatic provinces ravaging the whole country as far as Ancyra nor could Nicephorus get rid of him without signing a rather ignominious peace and paying a large war indemnity A yet greater disaster concluded another war Nicephorus invaded Bulgaria in eight hundred eleven to punish King Crumn for ravaging Thrace The Byzantine army won a battle and sacked the palace and capital of the Bulgarian king but a few days later Nicephorus allowed himself to be surprised by a night attack on his camp In the panic and confusion the emperor fell and his son and heir Stauracius was desperately wounded The routed army did not stay its flight till Adrianople and left the body of the Emperor in the hands of the Bulgarians who cut off his head and made the skull into a drinking cup just as the Lombards had dealt with the skull of King Cunimund three hundred years before twenty three Stauracius the only son of Nicephorus was proclaimed emperor but it soon became evident that his wound was mortal and Michael Rhangabe his brother in law who had married the eldest daughter of Nicephorus took his place on the throne before the breath was out of the dying emperor s body Michael I was a weak good natured man who owed his elevation to the mere chance of his marriage He was a devoted servant and admirer of monks and began to undo the work of his father in law and remove all Iconoclasts from office This provoked the wrath of that powerful party and led to conspiracies against Michael but he might have held his own if it had not been for the disgracefully incompetent way in which he conducted the Bulgarian war He allowed an enemy whom the East Romans had hitherto despised not only to ravage the open country in Thrace but to storm the fortresses of Mesembria and Anchialus and to push their invasions up to the gates of Constantinople The discontent of the army found vent in a mutiny and Leo the Armenian an officer of merit and capacity was proclaimed emperor in the camp Michael I made no resistance and retired into a monastery after only two years of reign eight hundred eleven thirteen Leo the Armenian proved himself worthy of the confidence of the army When the Bulgarians appeared in front of the walls of Constantinople they were repulsed but Leo tarnished the glory of his success by a treacherous attempt to assassinate King Crumn at a conference a crime as unnecessary as it was unsuccessful for the Emperor might as the event proved have trusted to the sword instead of the dagger In the next spring he took the offensive himself marched out to Mesembria and inflicted on the enemy such a sanguinary defeat that hardly a man escaped his sword and Bulgaria was so weakened that it gave no further trouble for more than fifty years Almost the moment that he was freed from the Bulgarian war Leo became involved in the fatal Iconoclastic controversy Being a native of an Oriental theme he was naturally imbued with the views of his great namesake the Isaurian and inclined to reverse the policy of the monk loving Michael I But being moderate and wary he tried to introduce without the use of force a middle policy between image breaking and image worship a fruitless attempt which only brought him the nickname of the Chameleon Leo s idea was the quaint device of permitting the use of images but of hanging them so high from the ground that the public should not be able to touch or kiss them This pleased nobody on the one side the patriarch and his monks inveighed against the moving of the images while on the other tumultuous companies of Asiatic soldiery broke into churches and mutilated all the pictures and figures they could find The seven years of Leo s reign were full of ecclesiastical bickerings but it should be remembered to his credit that no single person suffered death for his conscience sake in the whole period The most violent of the opponents of the Emperor were merely interned in remote monasteries when they ventured to set their will against his Long ere the end of his reign Leo had been compelled to leave his half measures and prohibit all use of images Like Constantine Copronymus he called a council to endorse his action and a majority of the Eastern bishops resolved that Iconolatry was a dangerous heresy and anathematized the patriarch Nicephorus and all other defenders of the images Leo s reign was prosperous in all save the matter of his religious troubles But he was not destined to die in peace in his bed Michael the Amorian the best general in the empire was detected in a conspiracy against his master Leo cast him into prison but delayed his punishment and left his accomplices at large Michael had many friends in the palace who determined to strike a blow ere the Emperor should have discovered their guilt They resolved to slay Leo in his private chapel as he attended matins on Christmas Day for he was accustomed to come unarmed and unguarded to the early communion Accordingly the conspirators attended the service and attacked the Emperor in the midst of the Eucharistic hymn Leo snatched the heavy metal cross off the altar and struck down some of his assailants but numbers were too many for him and he was cut down and slain at the very foot of the holy table Christmas Day eight hundred twenty Michael the Amorian was dragged out of his dungeon saluted as emperor and crowned even before the fetters were off his feet It was not till the ceremony had been performed that time was found to send for a smith to strike away the rings Michael was by birth a mere peasant but had raised himself to high rank in the army by his courage and ability He is sometimes styled the Amorian from his birth place Amorium in Phrygia but more often mentioned by his nickname of the Stammerer He had been the friend and adviser of Leo the Armenian at the time of the latter s elevation to the throne and his conspiracy must be reckoned a gross piece of ingratitude even though we acknowledge that he was not personally responsible for his master s murder Though rough and uncultured Michael was a man of very considerable ability He strengthened his title to the crown by a marriage with the last scion of the Isaurian house the princess Euphrosyne daughter of the blind Constantine VI The religious difficulties of the day he endeavoured to treat in an absolutely impartial way so as to offend neither Iconoclasts nor Iconodules He recalled from exile the image worshipping monks whom Leo the Armenian had sent to distant monasteries and proclaimed that for the future every subject of the empire should enjoy complete liberty of conscience on the disputed question This was far from satisfying the image worshippers who wished Michael to restore their idols to their ancient places but the Amorian would not consent to this and obtained but a very qualified measure of approval from the monastic party It was not to be expected that the reign of a military usurper with no title to the throne whatever would be untroubled by revolts Michael had his share of such afflictions and though he finally slew Thomas and Euphemius the two pretenders who laid claim to his crown yet by their means he lost two not inconsiderable provinces of his empire While the rebellion of Thomas was in progress an army of Saracens from Alexandria threw themselves on the island of Crete and conquered it from end to end When Michael s hands were free he sent two great armaments to expel the intruders but both failed and Crete was destined to remain for a whole century in Moslem hands Its hundred harbours became the haunts of innumerable Corsairs who grew to be the bane of commerce in the Levant and were a serious danger to the empire whenever its fleet fell into bad hands and failed to keep the police of the seas A similar rising in Sicily under a rebel named Euphemius led to the invasion of that island by an army of Moors from Africa who landed in eight hundred twenty seven and maintained a foothold in spite of all efforts to expel them At first their gains were not rapid but in the time of Michael s successors they gradually won for themselves the whole of the island Illustration Byzantine Metal Work Our Lord and the Twelve Apostles From L Art Byzantin Par Charles Bayet Paris Quantin eighteen eighty three After nine years of reign the Amorian died a natural death still wearing the crown he had won It was just fifty years since any ruler of the empire had met such a peaceful end He was succeeded by his son Theophilus a vehement Iconoclast whose persecuting tendencies had been with difficulty restrained in his father s life time His accession was the signal for a new campaign against image worship he induced the patriarch John the Grammarian a strong Iconoclast like himself to excommunicate as idolaters all who differed from him and began to flog banish and imprison their leading men His persecution would have been almost as vehement as that of Constantine Copronymus but for the fact that he did not ever inflict the punishment of death branding and mutilation however he did not disdain The Iconodules saw the vengeance of heaven for the misdeeds of Theophilus in the disasters which he suffered in war from the Saracens He fell out with the Caliph Motassem and in the first campaign took and burnt the town of Zapetra for which the Commander of the Faithful had great regard twenty four This roused Motassem to furious wrath he swore that he would destroy in revenge the town which Theophilus held most dear he collected the largest Saracen army that had been seen since Moslemah beleaguered Constantinople in seven hundred seventeen and marched out of Tarsus with one hundred thirty thousand men each of whom if legend speaks true had the word Amorium painted on his shield For it was Amorium the birth place of the Emperor and the home of his ancestors that Motassem had sworn to sack While one division of the Caliph s army defeated Theophilus who had taken the field in person another headed by Motassem himself marched straight on Amorium and took it after a brave defence of fifty five days Thirty thousand of its inhabitants were massacred and the town was burnt but the Caliph then turned home satisfied with his revenge and the empire suffered nothing more from this most dangerous invasion The Saracen war dragged on in an indecisive way but no further disaster was encountered There are other things to be recorded of Theophilus beside his persecution of image worshippers and his war with the Caliph He was long remembered for his taste for gorgeous display of all the East Roman emperors he seems to have delighted the most in gold and silver work gems and embroidery His golden plane tree was the talk of the East and the golden lions at the foot of his throne which rose and roared by the means of ingenious machinery within were remembered for generations Nor should the curious tale of his second marriage be left untold When left a widower he bade the Empress dowager Euphrosyne assemble at her levee all the most beautiful of the daughters of the East Roman aristocracy and came among them to choose a wife carrying like Paris a golden apple in his hand His glance was first fixed on the fair Eikasia but approaching her he found no better topic to commence a conversation than the awkward statement that most of the evil had come into the world by means of women The lady retorted that surely most of the good had also come into the world by their means a reply which apparently discomposed Theophilus for he walked on and without a further word gave the golden apple to Theodora a rival beauty The choice was hasty and unhappy for Theodora was a devoted Iconodule and used all her influence against her husband s religious opinions Theophilus died in eight hundred forty two while still a young man leaving the throne to his only son Michael a child of three years and the regency to the young empress The moment that her husband s grave was closed Theodora set to work to undo his policy Amid the applause of the monks and the populace of Constantinople she proclaimed the end of the persecution sent for the banished image worshippers from their places of exile and deposed John the Grammarian the Iconoclastic patriarch who had served Theophilus Within thirty days of the commencement of the new reign the images had appeared once more on the walls of all the churches of Constantinople The Iconoclasts seem to have been taken by surprise and made no resistance to the revolution however the empress did not take any measures to persecute them it was only power and not security for life and limb that they lost The sole permanent result of the long struggle which they had kept up was a curious compromise in the Eastern Church on the subject of representation of the human figure Statues were never again erected in places of worship but only paintings and mosaics It was apparently believed that the actual image savoured too much of the heathen idol but that no offence could possibly be given by the picture which served as a pious remembrance of the holy personage it represented but could be nothing more Nevertheless the veneration of the Byzantines for their holy Eikons became almost as grotesque as idol worship and led to many quaint and curious forms of superstition Theodora engrossed in things religious handed over the education of her young son to her brother Bardas who became her company regent and was afterwards made Caesar He brought up the young Michael in the most reckless and unconscientious manner teaching him his own vices of drunkenness and debauchery Michael was an apt pupil and ere he reached the age of twenty one had become a confirmed dipsomaniac History knows him by the dishonourable nickname of Michael the Drunkard Some years after his majority he grew discontented with his uncle and slew him in order that he might reign alone His profligacy and intemperance became still more unbearable after Bardas was dead and had it not been for the splendid organization of the Byzantine civil service the administration of the empire must have gone to pieces Presently Michael grew tired of spending on state affairs any time that he could spare from his orgies and appointed as Caesar and colleague his boon companion Basil the Macedonian Basil had reached the position of grand chamberlain purely by the Emperor s favour he rose from the lowest ranks and is said to have first entered Michael s service in the humble position of a groom His practical ability combined with a head hard enough to withstand the effect of even the longest debauch won Michael s admiration and so he came to be first chamberlain and then Caesar Under the mask of a roisterer Basil concealed the most devouring ambition and when he knew that his drunken benefactor had won the contempt of all the East Roman world had the impudence and ingratitude to plan his murder Michael was stabbed while sleeping off the effects of one of his orgies and his low born colleague seized the palace and proclaimed himself emperor It might have been expected that the East Roman world would have refused to receive as its lord a man who owed his elevation to the freak of a drunkard and had then become the assassin of his benefactor But strangely enough Basil was destined to found the longest dynasty that ever sat upon the Constantinopolitan throne He turned out a far better ruler than might have been expected from his disgraceful antecedents being one of those fortunate men who are able to utilize the work of others when their own powers and knowledge fall short Basil is mainly remembered for his codification of the laws of the empire which superseded the Ecloga of Leo the Isaurian even as Leo s compilation had superseded the more solid and thorough work of Justinian The Basilika of Basil with the additions made by his son Leo VI formed the code of the Byzantine Empire down to its last days no further rearrangement being ever made Basil being of European birth and not an Asiatic like the preceding emperors was naturally an orthodox image worshipper He showed his bigotry by a fierce persecution of the Paulicians an Asiatic sect of heretics accused of Manicheanism whom the Iconoclast emperors had been wont to tolerate Basil s oppression drove many of them over the Saracen frontier where they took refuge with the Moslems and maintained themselves by plundering the borders of the empire Among the other transactions of his nineteen years of reign eight hundred sixty seven eight hundred eighty six the only one deserving notice is the final loss of Sicily The Saracens of Africa who had held a footing in the island ever since the time of Michael II now finished their work by storming Syracuse in eight hundred seventy eight XVII THE LITERARY EMPERORS AND THEIR TIME A D eight hundred eighty six nine hundred sixty three The eighty years which followed the death of Basil the Macedonian were the most uneventful and monotonous in the whole history of the empire They are entirely taken up by the two long reigns of Leo the Wise and Constantine Porphyrogenitus twenty five the son and grandson of the founder of the dynasty Basil had been a mere adventurer an ignorant and uneducated but capable upstart His successors strange issue from such a stock were a pair of mild easy going and inoffensive men of literature They wrote no annals with their sword though the times were not unpropitious for military enterprise but devoted themselves to the pen and have left behind them some of the most useful and interesting works in Byzantine literature If the times had been harder it is doubtful whether Leo VI and Constantine VII would have been strong enough to protect their throne But the period eight hundred eighty nine hundred sixty was less troubled by foreign wars than any other corresponding period in the history of the East Roman state The empire of the Caliphs was breaking up in the East the empire of Charles the Great had already broken up in the West the Bulgarians and other neighbours of the realm on the north were being converted to Christianity and settling down into quiet The only troubles to which the East Roman realm was exposed were piratical raids of the Russians on the north and the Saracens of Africa on the south These were vexatious but not dangerous An active and warlike emperor would probably have found the time propitious for conquest from his neighbours but Leo and Constantine were quiet unenterprising men who dwelt contentedly in the palace and seldom or never took the field Leo s reign of twenty six years was only diversified by an unfortunate invasion of Bulgaria which failed through the mismanagement of the generals and for a great raid of Saracen pirates on Thessalonica in nine hundred four The capture of the second city of the empire by a fleet of African adventurers was an incident disgraceful to the administration of Leo and caused much outcry and sensation But it is fair to say that it was taken almost by surprise and stormed from the side of the sea where no attack had been expected The armies and fleet of the empire would have availed to rescue the town if only its fall had been delayed a few weeks When they had taken it the Saracens fled with their booty and made no attempt to hold its walls Constantine Porphyrogenitus the offspring of the fourth wife of Leo the Wise and the child of his old age was only seven when his heritage fell to him For many years he was under the tutelage of guardians first his father s brother Alexander ruled as his colleague and became emperor regent Some years after Alexander had died an ambitious admiral named Romanus Lecapenus usurped the same position declared himself emperor and administered the realm The life of Romanus was protracted into extreme old age long after Constantine had reached his majority but the ambitious veteran held tight to the sceptre and kept the rightful heir in the background Constantine consoled himself by writing books and painting pictures it was not till he was nearly forty that he came to his own Even then his success was not owing to his own energy the sons of the aged Romanus had resolved to succeed their parent on the throne in despite of the rights of Constantine But when they declared themselves emperors and made their old father abdicate an outburst of popular wrath was provoked The mob and the guards joined to sweep away the presumptuous Stephen Lecapenus and his brother They were immured in monasteries and Constantine emerged from his seclusion to administer the empire for twenty years He was somewhat weak and ineffective but neither obstinate nor tyrannical many abler men made worse rulers The chief achievements of both Leo and Constantine were their books Those of Leo consist of a manual on the Art of War some theological treatises and a book of prophecies a collection of political enigmas which were long the puzzle and admiration of the East twenty six The first named work is most valuable and interesting bringing down the history of military organization tactics and strategy to Leo s own time and giving us a perfect picture of the Byzantine army and its tactics as well as incidental sketches of all the enemies with which it had to contend The backbone of the force was still the themes or turmae of heavy cavalry of which every province had one The number of the provinces had been much increased since the days of the emperors of the house of Heraclius and this implied a corresponding increase in the troops They were raised from subjects of the empire and officered by the Byzantine nobility for as Leo observed There was no difficulty in obtaining officers of good birth and private means whose origin made them respected by the soldiery while their money enabled them to win the good graces of their men by many gifts of small creature comforts over and above their pay The names of some of the great noble houses are found for generation after generation in the imperial muster rolls such as those of Ducas Phocas Comnenus Bryennius Kerkuas Diogenes and many more The pages of Leo s work breathe an entire confidence in the power of the army to deal with any foe against Saracen Turk Hungarian and Slav instant and decisive action is advised when caught they should be fought and beaten It is only when dealing with the men of the West the Franks and Lombards that Leo recommends caution and deprecates any rash engagement in a general action preferring to wear the enemy down by cutting off his supplies and harassing his marches We gather a very favourable impression of the Byzantine army from Leo s book it was organized armed and supplied in a manner that has no parallel till modern times Each regiment possessed its special uniform and was equipped with regularity There was none of that variety in arms and organizations which was the bane of mediaeval armies The regiments had each attached to them an elaborate military train a small body of engineers and a provision of surgeons and ambulances To encourage the saving of wounded men Leo tells us that the bearer company was given a gold piece for every disabled soldier whom it brought off the field after a lost battle It would be hard to find any similar care shown for the wounded till the days of our own century The Byzantine fleet as Leo describes it had for its chief object the maintenance of the police of the seas in the Aegean Levant and South Italian waters Its enemies were the Saracens of the Syrian and African coasts and more especially the troublesome Corsairs of Crete who were often beaten but never subdued till Nicephorus Phocas exterminated them in nine hundred sixty one The empire maintained three fleets small ones in the Black Sea and in Western waters but the largest in the Aegean This was composed of sixty dromonds or war vessels of the largest rating their great depot was in the arsenal at Constantinople but they could also be refitted at Samos Thessalonica and several other ports Owing to their superior size and still more to their employment of the celebrated Greek fire the imperial fleets generally had the better of the Saracen but though they checked his larger squadrons they could never suppress the petty piracy by isolated sea robbers which rendered all mediaeval commerce so dangerous The works of Constantine Porphyrogenitus are even more interesting than those of his father His treatise called On the Themes is invaluable to the historian as it gives a complete list of the Themes their boundaries inhabitants characteristics and resources with some other incidental notices of value Still more important is the book On the Administration of the Empire which contains directions for the foreign policy of the realm and sketches the condition and resources of the various nations with whom the Constantinopolitan government had dealings Constantine also wrote a biography of his grandfather Basil the Macedonian couched in terms of respect which that hardy usurper was far from deserving But his longest and most ambitious work was on Court Ceremonies a manual of etiquette and precedence describing the official hierarchy of the empire its duties and privileges and containing elaborate directions for the conduct of state ceremonials and the interior economy of the royal household On this comparatively trifling topic Constantine spent far more pains than on the works of larger interest which he composed His books show him to have been a man of no great originative faculty but gifted with the powers of a careful and methodical compiler who loved details and never shirked trouble His care for court pageants was very characteristic of the peaceful emperor who had long been kept at home by his guardian and forced to compensate himself by ceremonial for the want of real power The fact that two successive emperors devoted themselves to literary work is a sufficient sign that by the end of the ninth century the times of intellectual dearth and destitution which had so long prevailed were now at an end From the death of Justinian to the end of the Heraclian dynasty matters grew gradually worse from the rise of Leo the Isaurian onward they began slowly to improve The darkest age in Byzantine literary history was from about six hundred to seven hundred fifty a period in which we have hardly any contemporary annalists no poetry save the lost Heracliad of George of Pisidia and very little even of theology Literature seemed absolutely dead at the accession of the Isaurians but the quickening influence of the reforms of the great Leo seems to have been felt in that province as in every other By the end of the eighth century writers were far more numerous though many of them were only anti Iconoclastic controversialists like Theodore Studita By the ninth century we can trace the existence of a much larger literary class and find a few really first rate authors such as the patriarch Photius eight hundred fifty seven sixty nine whose learning and width of culture was astonishing and whose library catalogue is the envy of modern scholars Perhaps the most interesting development of Byzantine literature were the epics or Romances of Chivalry as we feel more inclined to call them which were written toward the end of the times of the Macedonian dynasty The epic of Digenes Akritas a work of the end of the tenth century celebrating the praises of a hero who lived in the reigns of Nicephorus Phocas and John Zimisces nine hundred sixty three eighty may serve as a type of the class It tells of the adventures in love and war of Basil Digenes Akritas warden of the Cilician Marches or Clissurarch of Taurus as his official title would have run He was a mighty hunter both of bears and of Saracens put down the Apelates or moss troopers to use a modern analogy who infested the border and led many a foray into Syria He is even credited with the slaying of an occasional dragon by his admiring bard But perhaps the most interesting episode is the story of his elopement with the fair Eudocia Ducas daughter of the general of the Cappadocian theme whom he carried off in despite of her father and seven brethren Pursued by the irate family he rode them down one by one at vantage points in the passes but spared their lives and was reconciled to them at the intercession of his bride Digenes Akritas is the best as well as the earliest of the class which it represents Illustration A Warrior Saint saint Leontius From a Byzantine Fresco From L Art Byzantin Par Charles Bayet Paris Quantin eighteen eighty three Art followed much the same course as literature in the period six hundred nine hundred It was in a state of decay for the first century and a half and the surviving works of that time are often grotesquely rude For sheer bad drawing and bad execution nothing can be worse than a coin of Constans II or Constantine V a Frankish or Visigoth piece could not be much more unsightly The few manuscripts which survive from that period display a corresponding though not an equally great decline in art Mosaic work perhaps showed less decline than other branches of the decoration but even here seventh and eighth century work is very rare In the ninth century everything improves wonderfully It is most astonishing to see how the old classical tradition of painting revive in the best manuscript illumination of the period many of them might have been executed in the fifth or even the fourth century so closely do they reproduce the old Roman style It seems that the Iconoclastic controversy stimulated painting persecuted by the emperors the art of sacred portraiture became respected above all others by the multitude Several of the most prominent Iconodule martyrs were painters of whom it is recorded that their works were no less beautiful than edifying those of Lazarus whom the Emperor Theophilus tortured are especially cited as triumphs of art as well as sanctity Though a persecutor of painters Theophilus deserves a word of mention as the first great builder since Justinian and as a patron of the minor arts of jewellery silver work and mosaic There is good evidence that these were all in a very flourishing condition in his time eight hundred twenty nine forty two There is one more point in the history of the empire in the ninth century to which attention must be called This is the unique commercial importance of Constantinople during this and the two succeeding centuries All other commerce than that of the empire had been swept off the seas by the Saracen pirates in the preceding hundred years and the only touch between Eastern and Western Christendom was kept up under the protection of the imperial navy The Eastern products which found their way to Italy or France were all passed through the warehouses of the Bosphorus It was East Roman ships that carried all the trade save a few Italian ports such as Amalphi and the new city of Venice no place seems even to have possessed merchant ships This monopoly of the commerce of Europe was one of the greatest elements in the strength of the empire So much money and goods passed through it that a rather harsh and unwise system of taxation did no permanent harm XVIII MILITARY GLORY While Constantine Porphyrogenitus had been dragging out the monotonous years of his long reign events which completely changed the aspect of affairs in the Moslem East had been following each other in quick succession on the Asiatic frontier of his realm Ever since it first came into existence the Byzantine Empire had been faced in Asia by a single powerful enemy first by the Sassanian kingdom of Persia then by the Caliphate under the two dynasties of the Ommeyades and the Abbasides Now however the Caliphate had at last broken up and the descendants of Abdallah es Saffah and Haroun al Raschid had become the vassals of a rebellious subject and preserved a mere nominal sovereignty which did not extend beyond the walls of their palace in Bagdad The crisis had come in nine hundred fifty one A D when the armies of the Buhawid prince Imad ud din who had seized on the sovereignty of Persia broke into Bagdad and made the Caliph a prisoner in his own royal residence For the future the Caliphs were no more than puppets and the Buhawid rulers used their names as a mere form and pretence But the conquerors did not gain possession of the whole of the Caliphate only Persia and the Lower Euphrates Valley obeyed them Other dynasties rose and fought for the more western provinces of the old Moslem realm The Emirs of Aleppo and Mosul who ruled respectively in North Syria and in Mesopotamia became the immediate neighbours of the East Roman Empire while the lands beyond them Egypt and South Syria formed the dominions of the house of the Ikshides Thus the Byzantines found on their eastern frontier no longer one great centralized power but the comparatively weak Emirates of Aleppo and Mosul with the Buhawid and Ikshidite kingdoms in their rear The four Moslem states were all new and precarious creations of the sword and were generally at war with each other An unparalleled opportunity had arrived for the empire to take its revenge on its ancient enemies and to move back the Mahometan boundaries from the line along the Taurus where they had so long been fixed Fortunately it was not only the hour that had arrived but also the man The empire had at its disposal at this moment the best soldier that it had possessed since the death of Leo the Isaurian Nicephorus Phocas was the head of one of those great landholding families of Asia Minor who formed the flower of the Byzantine aristocracy he owned broad lands in Cappadocia along the Mahometan frontier His father and grandfather before him had been distinguished officers for the whole race lived by the sword but Nicephorus far surpassed them He was not only a practical soldier but a military author his book dealing with the organization of armies still survives to testify to his capacity It was on Nicephorus then that Romanus II the son and heir of Constantine VII fixed his choice when he resolved to commence an attack on the Mahometan powers The point selected for assault was the island of Crete the dangerous haunt of Corsairs which lay across the mouth of the Aegean and sheltered the pestilent galleys that preyed on the trade of the empire with the West Several expeditions against it had failed during the last half century but this one was fitted out on the largest scale The vessels are said to have been numbered by the thousand and the land force was chosen from the flower of the Asiatic themes Complete success followed the arms of Nicephorus He drove the Saracens into their chief town Chandax Candia stormed that city and took an enormous booty the hoarded wealth of a century of piracy The whole island then submitted and Nicephorus sailed back to Constantinople to present to his sovereign in bonds Kurup the captive Emir of Crete and all the best of the booty of the island nine hundred sixty one A D Nicephorus was duly honoured for his feat of arms and given command of an army destined to open a campaign in the next year against the great frontier strongholds of the Saracens in Asia Minor Descending by the passes of the Central Taurus into Cilicia Phocas stormed Anazarbus and then forced Mount Amanus and marched into Northern Syria There he took the great town of Hierapolis and laid siege to Aleppo the capital of the Emir Seyf ud dowleh who ruled from Mount Lebanon to the Euphrates The Emir was routed the walls of his capital were stormed and Aleppo with all its wealth fell into the hands of the Byzantine general But the citadel still held out and its protracted resistance gave time for the Moslems of South Syria and Mesopotamia to combine for the relief of their northern compatriots So great an army appeared before the walls of Aleppo that Phocas determined not to risk a battle and retreated with his booty and his numerous prisoners into the defiles of Taurus nine hundred sixty two A D Sixty captured forts and castles in Cilicia and North Syria were the permanent fruits of his campaign The next year the emperor Romanus II died very unexpectedly ere he had reached his twenty sixth year He left a young wife and two little boys Basil aged seven and Constantine who was only two There followed the form of regency that custom had made usual Nicephorus the most powerful and popular subject of the empire claimed the guardianship of the two young Caesars and had himself crowned as their colleague To secure his place he married their mother the young and beautiful empress dowager Theophano The joint reign of Nicephorus Phocas and his wards Basil II and Constantine VIII lasted six years nine hundred sixty three nine hundred sixty nine The regent behaved with scrupulous loyalty to the young princes and made no attempt to encroach on their rights or to supplant them by any of his numerous nephews who had looked forward to his accession as likely to lead to their own promotion to imperial power Nicephorus was an indefatigable soldier and spent more of his reign in the field than in the palace His end in life was to complete as emperor the conquest of Cilicia and North Syria which he had commenced as general The years nine hundred sixty four and nine hundred sixty five were spent in achieving the former object three long sieges made him master of the great Cilician frontier fortresses Adana Mopsuestia and Tarsus Their rich bronze gates were sent as trophies to Constantinople and set up again in the archways of the imperial palace A few months later the tale of victories was completed by the news that Cyprus also had fallen back into Byzantine hands after having passed seventy seven years in the power of the Saracens For two years after this Phocas was employed at home where his administration was less popular than in the camp The stern old soldier was not a friend of either priests or courtiers He had several quarrels with the patriarch Polyeuctus which made him detested by the clergy and in his public life he displayed a dislike for pomp and ceremony which led the Byzantine populace to style him a niggard and an extortioner He suppressed shows and sports and turned all the public revenues into the war budget which lay nearest his heart When he left the city in nine hundred sixty eight for a new campaign against the Saracens he was a much less popular ruler than when he had entered it in triumph in nine hundred sixty six after the conquest of Cilicia In the camp however Nicephorus was as well loved and as successful as ever His last Syrian expedition was no less glorious than his earlier campaign in the same quarter six years before All the North Syrian cities fell into his hands Emesa Hierapolis Laodicea and with them Aleppo the residence of the Emir Damascus bought off the invader by a great tribute Only Antioch the ancient capital of the land held out and Antioch also was taken in the winter by escalade through the daring of an officer named Burtzes The story of its fall is curious The Emperor had left a blockading army before it under a general named Peter with orders not to risk an assault Burtzes the second in command disobeyed orders and stormed a corner tower on a snowy night at the head of a small band of three hundred men Peter in fear of the Emperor s orders refused to send him aid and for more than two days Burtzes maintained himself unaided in the tower he had won At last however the main body entered and the Saracens fled from the town Nicephorus dismissed both his generals from the service Burtzes for having acted against orders Peter for having obeyed them too slavishly and allowing an important advantage to be imperilled Nicephorus returned to Constantinople in the following year to meet his death at the hands of those who should have been his nearest and dearest His wife Theophano had learnt to hate her grim and stern husband who though he possessed all the virtues displayed none of the graces She had cast her eyes in love on the Emperor s favourite nephew John Zimisces a young cavalry officer who had greatly distinguished himself in the Syrian war Zimisces listened to her tempting but he was not swayed by lust but by ambition he had hoped that his uncle would make him heir to the throne to the detriment of the young emperor Basil The loyal old soldier had no idea of wronging his wards and his nephew resolved to gain by murder what he could not gain by favour Illustration Return Of A Victorious Emperor From an Embroidered Robe From L art Byzantin Par Charles Bayet Paris Quantin eighteen eighty three So John and Theophano conspired against their best friend and basely murdered him in the palace one December night in nine hundred sixty nine The Emperor was awakened from sleep to find a dozen of the assassins forcing his door John threw him to the ground and the others stabbed him while he cried in his death agony Oh God grant me Thy mercy Thus ended the brave and virtuous Nicephorus Phocas His murderers succeeded in their end for John Zimisces was able to seduce the guards overawe the ministers and force the patriarch to crown him emperor He showed some contrition for the base slaughter of his uncle giving away half his private fortune to found hospitals for lepers and the other half to be distributed among the poor of the city He did not wed the partner of his guilt the empress Theophano but refused to see her face and ultimately sent her to a monastery If the manner of his accession could but be forgiven John might pass for a favourable specimen of an emperor He respected the rights of the young emperors Basil and Constantine as scrupulously as his uncle had done and proved that as an administrator and a soldier he was not unworthy to sit in the seat of Phocas But the Nemesis of the murder of his uncle rested upon him in the shape of a long civil war His cousin Bardas Phocas took arms to revenge the death of the old Nicephorus and stirred up troubles among his Cappadocian countrymen for several years till at last he was captured and immured in a monastery The chief feat for which John Zimisces is remembered is his splendid victory over the Russians whose great invasion of the Balkan Peninsula falls within the limits of his reign We have not yet had much occasion to mention the Russian tribes who for many centuries had been dwelling in obscurity and barbarism by the waters of the Dnieper and the Duna in a land of forest and marsh far remote from the boundaries of the empire Nor should we hear of them now but for the fact that their scattered tribes had been of late unified into a single horde by a power from without and urged forward into a career of conquest by a race of ambitious princes Into the land of the Russians there had come some hundred years before the reign of John Zimisces eight hundred sixty two A D a Viking band from Sweden headed by Rurik the ancestor of all the princes and Tzars of Russia The descendants of these adventurers from the north had gradually conquered and subdued all the Slavonic tribes of the great forest land and formed them into a single powerful kingdom Its capital lay at Kief on the Dnieper and it had proved a formidable neighbour to all the barbarous tribes around The Viking blood of the new Russian princes drove them seaward and ere many generations had passed they had forced their way down the Dnieper into the Euxine and begun to vex the northern borders of the Byzantine Empire with raids and ravages like those which the Danes inflicted on Western Europe Twice already within the tenth century had large fleets of light Russia row boats they were copies on a smaller scale of the Viking ships of the North stolen down from the Dnieper mouth to the shores of Thrace and landed their plundering crews within a few miles of the Bosphorus for a hurried raid on the rich suburban provinces On the first occasion in nine hundred seven the Russians had returned home laden with plunder but on the second which fell in nine hundred forty one the Byzantine fleet had caught them at sea and revenged the harrying of Thrace by sinking scores of their light boats which could not resist for a moment the impact of the heavy war galley urged by its hundred oars Illustration Arabesque Design From A Byzantine MS From L Art Byzantin Par Charles Bayet Paris Quantin eighteen eighty three But the attack which John Zimisces had to meet in nine hundred seventy was far more formidable than either of those which had preceded it Swiatoslaf king of the Russians had come down the Dnieper with no less than sixty thousand men and had thrown himself on to the kingdom of Bulgaria which was at the moment distracted by civil war He conquered the whole country and soon his marauders were crossing the Balkans and showing themselves in the plain of Thrace They even sacked the considerable town of Philippopolis before the imperial troops came to its aid This roused Zimisces who had been absent in Asia Minor and in the early spring of nine hundred seventy one an imperial army of thirty thousand men set out to cross the Balkans and drive the Russians into the Danube The struggle which ensued was one of the most desperate which East Roman history records The Russians all fought on foot in great square columns armed with spear and axe they wore mail shirts and peaked helmets just like the Normans of Western Europe to whom their princes were akin The shock of their columns was terrible and their constancy in standing firm almost incredible Against these warriors of the North Zimisces led the mailed horsemen of the Asiatic themes and the bowmen and slingers who were the flower of the Byzantine infantry The tale of John s two great battles with the Russians at Presthlava and Silistria reads much like the tale of the battle of Hastings In Bulgaria as in Sussex the sturdy axeman long beat off the desperate cavalry charges of their opponents But they could not resist the hail of arrows to which they had no missile weapons to oppose and when once the archers had thinned their ranks the Byzantine cavalry burst in and made a fearful slaughter in the broken phalanx More fortunate than Harold Godwineson at the field of Senlac King Swiatoslaf escaped with his life and the relics of his army But he was beleaguered within the walls of Silistria and forced to yield himself on the terms that he and his men might take their way homeward on swearing never to molest the empire again The Russian swore the oath and took a solemn farewell of Zimisces The contrast between the two monarchs struck Leo the Deacon a chronicler who seems to have been present at the scene and caused him to describe the meeting with some vigour We learn how the Emperor a small alert fair haired man sat on his great war horse by the river bank in his golden armour with his guards about him while the burly Viking rowed to meet him in a boat clad in nothing but a white shirt and with his long moustache floating in the wind They bade each other adieu and the Russian departed only to fall in battle ere the year was out at the hands of the Patzinak Tartars of the Southern Steppes Soon after Swiatoslaf s death the majority of the Russians became Christians and ere long ceased to trouble the empire by their raids They became faithful adherents of the Eastern Church and drew their learning their civilization even their names and titles from Constantinople The Tzars are but Caesars misspelt and the list of their names Michael Alexander Nicholas John Peter Alexis sufficiently witnesses to their Byzantine godparents Russian mercenaries were ere long enlisted in the imperial army and formed the nucleus of the Varangian guard in which at a later day Danes English and Norsemen of all sorts were incorporated Illustration Russian Architecture From Byzantine Model Church at Vladimir From L Art Byzantin Par Charles Bayet Paris Quantin eighteen eighty three John Zimisces survived his great victory at Silistria for five years and won ere he died more territory in Northern Syria from the Saracens The border which his uncle Nicephorus had pushed forward to Antioch and Aleppo was advanced by him as far as Amida and Edessa in Mesopotamia But in the midst of his conquests Zimisces was cut off by death while still in the flower of his age Report whispered that he had been poisoned by one of his ministers whom he had threatened to displace But the tale cannot be verified and all that is certain is that John died after a short illness leaving the throne to his young ward Basil II who had now attained the age of twenty years nine hundred seventy six A D XIX THE END OF THE MACEDONIAN DYNASTY Basil II who now sat in his own right on the throne which his warlike guardians Nicephorus and John had so long protected was by no means unworthy to succeed them Unlike his ancestors of the Macedonian house he showed from the first a love for war and adventure Probably the deeds of John and Nicephorus excited him to emulation at any rate his long reign from nine hundred seventy six till ten twenty five is one continuous record of wars and almost entirely of wars brought to a successful termination Basil seemed to have modelled himself on the elder of his two guardians the stern Nicephorus Phocas His earliest years on the throne indeed were spent in the pursuit of pleasure but ere he reached the age of thirty a sudden transformation was visible in him He gave himself up entirely to war and religion he took a vow of chastity and always wore the garb of a monk under his armour and his imperial robes His piety was exaggerated into bigotry and fanaticism but it was undoubtedly real though it did not keep him from the commission of many deeds of shocking cruelty in the course of his wars His justice was equally renowned but it often degenerated into mere harshness and indifference to suffering No one could have been more unlike his gay pleasure loving father or his mild literary grandfather than the grim emperor who won from posterity the title of Bulgaroktonos the Slayer of the Bulgarians Basil s life work was the moving back of the East Roman border in the Balkan Peninsula as far as the Danube a line which it had not touched since the Slavonic immigration in the days of Heraclius three hundred and fifty years before In the first years of his reign indeed he accomplished little being much harassed by two rebellions of great Asiatic nobles Bardas Phocas the nephew of Nicephorus II and Bardas Skleros the general of the Armeniac theme But after Phocas had died and Skleros had surrendered Basil reserved all his energies for war in Europe paying comparatively little attention to the Eastern conquests which had engrossed Nicephorus Phocas and John Zimisces The whole interior of the Balkan Peninsula formed at this period part of the dominions of Samuel King of the Bulgarians who reigned over Bulgaria Servia inland Macedonia and other districts around them It was a strong and compact kingdom administered by an able man who had won his way to the throne by sheer strength and ability for the old royal house had ceased out of the land during Swiatoslaf s invasion of Bulgaria ten years before The main power of Samuel lay not in the land between Balkan and Danube which gave his kingdom its name but in the Slavonic districts further West and South The centre of his realm was the fortress of Ochrida which he had chosen as his capital a strong town situated on a lake among the Macedonian hills There Samuel mustered his armies and from thence he started forth to attach either Thessalonica or Adrianople as the opportunity might come to him The duel between Basil and Samuel lasted no less than thirty four years till the Bulgarian king died a beaten man in ten fourteen This long and unremitting struggle taxed all the energies of the empire for Samuel was not a foe to be despised he was no mere barbarian but had learnt the art of war from his Byzantine neighbours and had specially studied fortification It was the desperate defences of his numerous hill castles that made Basil s task such a long one The details of the struggle are too long to follow out suffice it to say that after some defeats in his earlier years Basil accomplished the conquest of Bulgaria proper as far as the Danube in ten oh two the year in which Widdin the last of Samuel s strongholds in the North surrendered to him For twelve years more the enemy held out in the Central Balkans in his Macedonian strongholds about Ochrida and Uskup But at last Basil s constant victories in the field and his relentless slaughter of captives after the day was won broke the force of the Bulgarian king In ten fourteen the Emperor gained a crowning victory after which he took fifteen thousand prisoners he put out the eyes of all save one man in each hundred and sent the poor wretches with their guides to seek King Samuel in his capital The old Bulgarian was so overcome at the horrible sight that he was seized with a fit and died on the spot of rage and grief His successors Gabriel and Ladislas could make no head against the stern and relentless emperor and in ten eighteen the last fortress of the kingdom of Ochrida surrendered at discretion Contrary to his habit Basil treated the vanquished foe with mildness indulged in no massacres and contented himself with repairing the old Roman roads and fortresses of the Central Balkans without attempting to exterminate the Slavonic tribes that had so often defied him His conquests rounded off the empire on its northern frontier and made it touch the Magyar kingdom of Hungary for Servia no less than Bulgaria and Macedonia formed part of his conquests The Byzantine border now ran from Belgrade to the Danube mouth a line which it was destined to preserve for nearly two hundred years till the great rebellion of Bulgaria against Isaac Angelus in the year ten eighty six Having justly earned his grim title of the Slayer of the Bulgarians by his long series of victories in Europe Basil turned in his old age to continue the work of John Zimisces on the Eastern frontier There the Moslem states were still weak and divided though a new power the Fatimite dynasty in Egypt had come to the front and acquired an ascendency over its neighbours Basil s last campaigns in ten twenty one two were directed against the princes of Armenia and the Iberians and Abasgians who dwelt beyond them to the north His arms were entirely successful and he added many Armenian districts to his Eastern provinces but it may be questioned whether these conquests were beneficial to the empire A strong Armenian kingdom was a useful neighbour to the Byzantine realm being a Christian state it was usually friendly to the empire and acted as a barrier against Moslem attacks from Persia Basil broke up the Armenian power but did not annex the whole country or establish in it any adequate provision against the ultimate danger of attacks from the East by the Mahometan powers Basil died in ten twenty five at the age of sixty eight just as he was preparing to send forth an expedition to rescue Sicily from the hands of the Saracens He had won more provinces for the empire than any general since the days of the great Belisarius and at his death the Byzantine borders had reached the furthest extension which they ever knew His successors were to be unworthy of his throne and were destined to lose provinces with as constant regularity as he himself had shown in gaining them There was to be no one after him who could boast that he had fought thirty campaigns in the open field with harness on his back and had never turned aside from any enterprise that he had ever taken in hand Basil s brother Constantine had been his colleague in name all through the half century of his reign No one could have been more unlike the ascetic and indefatigable Slayer of the Bulgarians Constantine was a mere worldling a man of pleasure a votary of the table and the wine cup whose only redeeming tastes were a devotion to music and literature He had dwelt in his corner of the palace surrounded by a little court of eunuchs and flatterers and excluded by the stern Basil from all share and lot in the administration of the empire Now Constantine found himself the heir of his childless brother and was forced at the age of sixty to take up the responsibilities of empire He proved an idle and incompetent but not an actively mischievous sovereign His worst act was to hand over the administration of the chief offices of state to six of his old courtiers all eunuchs whose elevation was a cause of wild anger to the great noble families and whose inexperience led to much weak and futile government during his short reign Constantine died in ten twenty eight after a very brief taste of empire He was the last male of the Macedonian house and left no heirs save his elderly unmarried daughters whose education and moral training he had grossly neglected Zoe the eldest was more than forty years of age but her father had never found her a husband On his death bed however he sent for a middle aged noble named Romanus Argyrus and forced him at an hour s notice to wed the princess Only two days later Romanus found himself left by his father in law s death titular head of the empire But Zoe a clever obstinate and unscrupulous woman kept the reins of authority in her own hands and gave her unwilling spouse many an evil hour She was inordinately vain and pretended like Queen Elizabeth of England to be the mistress of all hearts long after she was well advanced in middle age Her husband let her go her own way and devoted himself to such affairs of state as he was allowed to manage His interference with warlike matters was most unhappy Venturing a campaign in Syria he led his army to defeat and saw several towns on the border fall into the hands of the Emir of Aleppo After a reign of six years Romanus died of a lingering disease and Zoe was left a widow Almost before the breath was out of her husband s body the volatile empress she was now over fifty had chosen and wedded another partner The new emperor was Michael the Paphlagonian a young courtier who had been Gentleman of the Bedchamber to Romanus he was twenty eight years of age and noted as the most handsome man in Constantinople His good looks had won Zoe s fancy and to his own surprise he found himself seated on the throne by his elderly admirer ten thirty four The object of Zoe s anile affection was a capable man and justified his rather humiliating elevation by good service to the empire He beat back the Saracens from Syria and put down a Bulgarian rebellion with success But in his last years he saw Servia one of the conquests of Basil II burst out into revolt and could not quell it He also failed in a project to reconquer Sicily from the Moors though he sent against the island George Maniakes the best general of the day who won many towns and defeated the Moslems in two pitched battles The attempt to subdue the whole island failed and the conquests of Maniakes were lost one after the other Michael IV though still a young man was fearfully afflicted with epileptic fits which sapped his health and so enfeebled him that he died a hopeless invalid ere he reached the age of thirty six The irrepressible Zoe now again a widow took a few days to decide whether she would adopt a son or marry a third husband She first tried the former alternative and crowned as her colleague her late spouse s nephew and namesake Michael V But the young man proved ungrateful and strove to deprive the aged empress of the control of affairs When he announced his intention of removing her from the capital the city mob who loved the Macedonian house and laughed at rather than reprobated the foibles of Zoe took arms to defend their mistress In a fierce fight between the rioters and the guards of Michael V three thousand lives were lost but the insurgents had the upper hand routed the soldiery and caught and blinded Michael Zoe once more at the head of the state now made her third marriage at the age of sixty two She chose as her partner Constantine Monomachus an old debauchee who had been her lover thirty years ago Their joint reign was unhappy both at home and abroad Frequent rebellions broke out both in Asia Minor and in the Balkan Peninsula The Patzinaks sent forays across the Danube while a new enemy the Normans of South Italy conquered the theme of Langobardia the last Byzantine possession to the West of the Adriatic and established in its stead the duchy of Apulia ten fifty five A still more dangerous foe began also to be heard of along the Eastern frontier The Seljouk Turks were now commencing a career of conquest in Persia and the lands on the Oxus In ten forty eight the advance guard of their hordes began to ravage the Armenian frontier of the empire But this danger was not yet a pressing one When Zoe and Constantine IX were dead the sole remaining scion of the Macedonian house was saluted as ruler of the empire This was Theodora the younger sister of Zoe an old woman of seventy who had spent the best part of her days in a nunnery She was as sour and ascetic as her sister had been vain and amorous but she does not seem to have been the worst of the rulers of Byzantium and her two years of power were not troubled by rebellions or vexed by foreign war Her austere virtues won her some respect from the people and the fact that she was the last of her house and that with its extinction the troubles of a disputed succession were doomed to come upon the empire seems to have sobered her subjects and led them to let the last days of the Basilian dynasty pass away in peace Theodora died on the thirtieth of August ten fifty seven having on her death bed declared that she adopted Michael Stratioticus as her successor Then commenced the reign of trouble the third

himself in ten eighty one placed in a position almost as difficult and perilous as that which Leo the Isaurian faced in seven hundred sixteen Like Leo he was a usurper without prestige or hereditary claims seated on an unsteady throne and forced to face imminent danger from the Moslem enemy without and from rival adventurers within It may be added that the Isaurian grievously threatened as he was by the enemy from the East had no peril impending from the West Alexius had to face at one and the same time the assault of the Seljouks on Asia Minor and the attack of a new and formidable foe in his western provinces We have already mentioned the manner in which the Byzantine dominion in Italy had come to an end Now the same Norman adventurers who had stripped the empire of Calabria and Apulia were preparing to cross the straits of Otranto and seek out the Emperor in the central provinces of his realm The forces of the Italian and Sicilian Normans were united under their great chief Robert Guiscard the hardy and unscrupulous Duke of Apulia Just ten years before he had captured Bari the last Byzantine fortress on his own side of the straits now he was resolved to take advantage of the anarchy which had prevailed in the empire ever since the day of Manzikert and to build up new Norman principalities to the east of the Adriatic There seemed to be nothing presumptuous in the scheme to those who remembered how a few hundred Norman adventurers had conquered all Southern Italy and Sicily and swelled into a victorious army fifty thousand strong Nor could the invaders fail to remember how but fifteen years before another Norman duke had crossed another strait in the far West and won by his strong right hand the great kingdom of England Alexius Comnenus sat like Harold Godwinson on a lately acquired and unsteady throne and Duke Robert thought to deal with him much as Duke William had dealt with the Englishman In June ten eighty one the Normans landed thirty thousand strong and laid siege to Durazzo the maritime fortress that guarded the Epirot coast The Emperor at once flew to its succour Always active hopeful and versatile he trusted that he might be able to beat off the new invaders whose military worth he was far from appreciating at its true value He patched up a hasty pacification with Suleiman Sultan of the Seljouks by surrendering to him all the territory of which the Turk was in actual possession a tract which now extended as far as the waters of the Propontis and actually included the city of Nicaea close to the Bithynian shore and only seventy miles from Constantinople The army with which Alexius had to face the Normans was the mere wreck and shadow of that which Romanus IV had led against the Turks ten years before The military organization of the empire had gone to pieces and we no longer hear of the old Themes of heavy cavalry which had formed its backbone The new army contained quite a small proportion of national troops Its core was the imperial guard of Varangians the Russian Danish and English mercenaries whose courage had won the confidence of so many emperors With them marched many Turkish Frankish Servian and South Slavonic auxiliaries the native element comprised the regulars of the three provinces of Thrace Macedonia and Thessaly all that now remained in Alexius hands of the ancient East Roman realm Alexius brought Robert Guiscard to battle in front of Durazzo and suffered a crushing defeat at his hands The Emperor s bad tactics were the main cause of his failure his army came upon the ground in successive detachments and the van was cut to pieces before the main body had reached the field The brunt of the battle was borne by the Varangians carried away by their fiery courage they charged the Normans before the rest of Alexius s troops had formed their line of battle Rushing on the wing of Robert s army commanded by the Count of Bari they drove it horse and foot into the sea Their success however disordered their ranks and the Norman duke was able to turn his whole force against them ere the Emperor was near enough to give them aid A fierce cavalry charge cut off the greater part of the Varangians the rest collected on a mound by the sea shore and for some time beat off the Normans with their axes as King Harold s men had done at Senlac on the last occasion when English and Norman had met But Robert shot them down with his archers and then sent more cavalry against them They fell save a small remnant who defended themselves in a ruined chapel which Guiscard had finally to burn before he could make an end of its obstinate defenders The rest of Alexius s army only came into action when the Varangians had been destroyed It was cowed by the loss of its best corps fought badly and fled in haste Alexius himself who lingered last upon the field was surrounded and only escaped by the speed of his horse and the strength of his sword arm Durazzo fell and in the next year the Normans overran all Epirus and descended into Thessaly Alexius risked two more engagements with them but his inexperienced troops were defeated in both Disaster taught him to avoid pitched battles and at last in ten eighty three after a more cautious campaign his patience was rewarded by the dispersion of the Norman army Catching it while divided the Emperor inflicted on it a severe defeat at Larissa and forced it back into Epirus After this the war slackened and when Robert Guiscard died in ten eighty five the Norman danger passed away Thus one foe was removed but Alexius was not destined to win peace Constant rebellions at home and wars with the Patzinaks the Slavs and the Seljouks filled the next ten years Alexius however was never discouraged eking out the lion s skin with the fox s hide he fought and intrigued lied and negotiated and at the end of the time had held his own and lost no more territory while his throne was growing more secure But in the fifteenth year of his reign a new cloud began to arise in the west which was destined to exercise unsuspected influence both for good and evil on the empire The Crusades were on the eve of their commencement Ever since the Seljouks had taken Jerusalem in ten seventy five four years after Manzikert the western pilgrims to the Holy Land had been suffering grievous things at the hands of the barbarians But all the wrath that their ill treatment provoked would have been fruitless if the way to Syria had not been opened of late to the nations of Western Christendom Two series of events had made free communication between East and West possible in the end of the eleventh century in a measure which had never before been seen The first of these was the conversion of Hungary begun by saint Stephen in one thousand and completed about ten fifty For the future there lay between the Byzantine Empire and Germany not a barbarous pagan state but a semi civilized Christian kingdom which had taken its place among the other nations of the Roman Catholic faith Communication down the Danube between Vienna and the Byzantine outposts in Bulgaria became for the first time possible and ere long the route grew popular The second phenomenon which made the Crusades possible was the destruction of the Saracen naval power in the Central Mediterranean This was carried out first by the Pisans and Genoese whose fleets conquered Corsica and Sardinia from the Moslems and then by the Normans whose occupation of Sicily made the voyage from Marseilles and Genoa to the East safe and sure Four new maritime powers the Genoese Pisans and Normans in the open sea and the Venetians in the Adriatic had developed themselves into importance and now their fleets swept the waters where no Christian war galleys save those of Byzantium had ever been seen before It was the fact that free access to the East was now to be gained both by land and sea as it had never been before that made the Crusades feasible Of the preaching of Peter the Hermit and the efforts of Pope Urban we need not speak Suffice it to say that in ten ninety five news came to the Emperor Alexius that the nations of the West were mustering by myriads and directing their march towards his frontiers with the expressed intention of driving the Moslems from Palestine The Emperor had little confidence in the purity of the zeal of the Crusaders his wily mind could not comprehend their enthusiasm and he dreaded that some unforeseen circumstance might turn their arms against himself When the hordes of armed Frankish pilgrims began to arrive his fears were justified the new comers pillaged his country right and left upon their way and were drawn into many bloody fights with the peasantry and the imperial garrisons which might have ended in open war But Alexius set himself to work to smooth matters down all his tact and patience were needed and there was ample scope for his talent for intrigue and insincere diplomacy He had resolved to induce the crusading chiefs to do him homage and to swear to restore to him all the old dominions of the empire which they might reconquer from the Turks After long and tedious negotiations he had his way the leaders of the Crusade from Godfrey of Bouillon and Hugh of Vermandois down to the smallest barons were induced to swear him allegiance Some he flattered others he bribed others he strove to frighten into compliance The pages of the history written by his daughter Anna Comnena who regarded his powers of cajolery with greater respect than any other part of his character are full of tales of the ingenious shifts by which he brought the stupid and arrogant Franks to reason At length they went on their way with Alexius s gold in their pockets and encouraged by his promise that he would aid them with his troops continue to supply them with provisions and never abandon them till the Holy City was reconquered In the spring of ten ninety seven the Crusaders began to cross the Bosphorus and in two marches found themselves within Turkish territory They at once laid siege to Nicaea the frontier fortress of the Seljouk Sultan Encompassed by so great a host the Turkish garrison soon lost heart and surrendered not to the Franks but to Alexius whose troops they secretly admitted within the walls This nearly led to strife between the Emperor and the Crusaders who had been reckoning on the plunder of the town but Alexius appeased them with further stores of money and the pilgrim host rolled forward once more into the interior of Asia Minor Illustration Byzantine Ivory Carving Of The Twelfth Century From the British Museum From L Art Byzantin Par Charles Bayet Paris Quantin eighteen eighty three In ten ninety seven the Crusaders forced their way through Phrygia and Cappadocia beating back the Seljouks at every encounter till they reached North Syria where they laid siege to Antioch Alexius had undertaken to help them in their campaign but he was set on playing an easier game When they were crushing the Turks he followed in their rear at a safe distance like the jackal behind the lion picking up the spoil which they left While the Sultan was engaged with them Alexius despoiled him of Smyrna Ephesus and Sardis reconquering Western Asia Minor almost without a blow since the Seljouk hordes were drawn away eastward It was the same in the next year when the Crusaders were fighting hard round Antioch against the princes of Mesopotamia and sent to ask for instant help Alexius despatched no troops to Syria but gathered in a number of Lydian and Phrygian fortresses which lay nearer to his hand Hence there resulted a bitter quarrel between the Emperor and the Franks for since he gave them no help they refused to hand over to him Antioch and their other Syrian conquests Each party in fact broke the compact signed at Constantinople and accused the other of treachery Hence it resulted that the Crusade ended not in the re establishment of the Byzantine power in Syria but in the foundation of new Frankish states the principalities of Edessa Antioch and Tripoli and the more important kingdom of Jerusalem That he did not recover Syria was no real loss to Alexius he would not have been strong enough to hold it had it been handed over to him The actual profit which he made by the Crusade was enough to content him the Franks had rolled back the Turkish frontier in Asia not less than two hundred miles instead of the Seljouk lying at Nicaea he was now chased back behind the Bithynian hills and the empire had recovered all Lydia and Caria with much of the Phrygian inland The Seljouks were hard hit and for well nigh a century were reduced to fight on the defensive Owing then to the fearful blow inflicted by the Crusades on the Moslem powers of Asia Minor and Syria the later years of Alexius were free from the danger which had overshadowed the beginning of his reign He was able between eleven hundred and eleven eighteen to strengthen his position at home and abroad the constant rebellions which had vexed his early years ceased and when the Normans under Bohemund of Tarentum tried to repeat in eleven oh seven the feats which Robert Guiscard had accomplished in ten eighty two they were beaten off with ease and forced to conclude a disadvantageous peace The reign of Alexius might have been counted a period of success and prosperity if it had not been for two considerations The first was the rapid decline of Constantinople as a commercial centre which was brought about by the Crusades When the Genoese and Venetians succeeded in establishing themselves in the seaports of Syria they began to visit Constantinople far less than before It paid them much better to conduct their business at Acre or Tyre than on the Bosphorus The king of Jerusalem the weakest of feudal sovereigns could be more easily bullied and defrauded than the powerful ruler of Constantinople In his own seaports he possessed hardly a shadow of authority the Italians traded there on such conditions as they chose Hence the commerce of the West with Persia Egypt Syria and India ceased to pass through the Bosphorus Genoa and Venice became the marts at which France Italy and Germany sought their Eastern goods It is probable that the trade of Constantinople fell off by a third or even a half in the fifty years that followed the first Crusade The effect of this decline on the coffers of the state was deplorable for it was ultimately on its commercial wealth that the Byzantine state based its prosperity All through the reigns of Alexius and his two successors the complaints about the rapid fall in the imperial revenue grew more and more noticeable This dangerous decay in the finances of the empire was rendered still more fatal by the political devices of Alexius who began to bestow excessive commercial privileges to the Italian republics in return for their aid in war This system commenced in ten eighty one when the Emperor then in the full stress of his first Norman war granted the Venetians the free access to most of the ports of his empire without the payment of any customs dues To give to foreigners a boon denied to his own subjects was the height of economic lunacy the native merchants complained that the Venetians were enabled to undersell them in every market owing to this exemption from import and export duties Matters were made yet worse in eleven eleven when Alexius bestowed a similar though less extensive grant of immunities on the Pisans When John II the son of Alexius succeeded in eleven eighteen to the empire which his father had saved the fabric was less strong than it appeared to the outward eye Territorial extension seemed to imply increased strength and the rapid falling off in the financial resources of the realm attracted little attention John however was one of those prudent and economical princes who stave off for years the inevitable day of distress Of all the rulers who ever sat upon the Byzantine throne he is the only one of whom no detractor has ever said an evil word When we remember that he was his father s son it is astonishing to find that his honesty and good faith were no less notable than his courage and generosity His subjects named him John the Good and their appreciation of his virtues was sufficiently marked by the fact that no single rebellion twenty seven marred the internal peace of his long reign eleven eighteen eleven forty three John was a good soldier and during his rule the frontier of the empire in Asia continued to advance at the expense of the Turks But his strategy would seem to have been at fault since he preferred to reconquer the coast districts of Northern and Southern Asia Minor rather than to strike at the heart of the Seljouk power on the central table land When he had reduced all Cilicia Pisidia and Pontus his dominions became a narrow fringe of coast surrounding on three sides the realm of the Sultan who still retained all the Cappadocian and Lycaonian plateau It should then have been John s task to finish the reconquest of Asia Minor but he preferred to plunge into Syria where he forced the Frank prince of Antioch and the Turkish Emir of Aleppo to pay him tribute but left no permanent monument of his conquests He was preparing a formidable expedition against the Franks of the kingdom of Jerusalem when he perished by accident while on a hunting expedition twenty eight John the Good was succeeded by his son Manuel whose strength and weakness combined to give a deathblow to the empire Manuel was a mere knight errant who loved fighting for fighting s sake and allowed his passion for excitement and adventure to be his only guide His whole reign was one long series of wars entered into and abandoned with equal levity Yet for the most part they were successful wars for Manuel was a good cavalry officer if he was but a reckless statesman and his fiery courage and untiring energy made him the idol of his troops At the head of the veteran squadrons of mercenary horsemen that formed the backbone of his army he swept off the field every enemy that ever dared to face him He overran Servia invaded Hungary to whose king he dictated terms of peace and beat off with success an invasion of Greece by the Normans of Sicily His most desperate struggle however was a naval war with Venice in which his fleet was successful enough and drove the Doge and his galleys out of the AEgean But the damage done to the trade of Constantinople by the Venetian privateers who swarmed in the Levant after their main fleet had been chased away was so appalling that the Emperor concluded peace in eleven seventy four restoring to the enemy all the disastrous commercial privileges which his grandfather Alexius had granted them eight years before Illustration Hunters From a Byzantine MS From L Art Byzantin Par Charles Bayet Paris Quantin eighteen eighty three The main fault of Manuel s wars was that they were conducted in the most reckless disregard of all financial considerations With a realm which was slowly growing poorer and with a constantly dwindling revenue he persisted in piling war on war and on devoting every bezant that could be screwed out of his subjects to the support of the army alone The civil service fell into grave disorder the administration of justice was impaired roads and bridges went to decay docks and harbours were neglected while the money which should have supported them was wasted on unprofitable expeditions to Egypt Syria or Italy So long as the ranks of his mercenaries were full and their pay forthcoming the Emperor cared not how his realm might fare Of all Manuel s wars only one went ill but that was the most important of them all the one necessary struggle to which he should have devoted all his energies This was the contest with the Seljouks which ended in eleven seventy six by a disastrous defeat at Myriokephalon in Phrygia brought about by the inexcusable carelessness of Manuel himself who allowed his army to be caught in a defile from which there was no exit and routed piecemeal by an enemy who could have made no stand on the open plains Manuel then made peace and left the Seljouks alone for the rest of his reign In eleven eighty Manuel died and with him died the good fortune of the House of Comnenus His son and heir Alexius was a boy of thirteen and the inevitable contest for the regency which always accompanied a minority ensued After two troubled years Andronicus Comnenus a first cousin of the Emperor Manuel was proclaimed Caesar and took over the guardianship of the young Alexius Andronicus was an unscrupulous ruffian whose past life should have been sufficient warning against putting any trust in his professions He had once attempted to assassinate Manuel and twice deserted to the Turks But he was a consummate hypocrite and won his way to the throne by professions of piety and austere virtue No sooner was he seated by the side of Alexius II and felt himself secure than he seized and strangled his young relative eleven eighty three But like our own Richard III Andronicus found that the moment of his accession to sole power was the moment of the commencement of his troubles Rebels rose in arms all over the empire to avenge the murdered Alexius and the Normans of Sicily seized the opportunity of invading Macedonia Conspiracies were rife in the capital and the executions which followed their detection were so numerous and bloody that a perfect reign of terror set in The Emperor plunged into the most reckless cruelty till men almost began to believe that his mind was affected Ere long the end came An inoffensive nobleman named Isaac Angelus being accused of treason was arrested at his own door by the emissaries of the tyrant Instead of surrendering himself Isaac drew his sword and cut down the official who laid hands on him A mob came to his aid and met no immediate opposition for Andronicus was absent from the capital The mob swelled into a multitude the guards would not fight and when the Emperor returned in haste he was seized and torn to pieces without a sword being drawn in his cause Isaac Angelus reigned in his stead XXII THE LATIN CONQUEST OF CONSTANTINOPLE The state which had been drained of its resources by the energetic but wasteful Manuel and disorganized by the rash and wicked Andronicus now passed into the hands of the two most feeble and despicable creatures who ever sat upon the imperial throne the brothers Isaac and Alexius Angelus whose reigns cover the years eleven eighty five twelve oh four Among all the periods which we have hitherto described in the tale of the East Roman Empire that covered by the reign of the two wretched Angeli may be pronounced the most shameful The peculiar disgrace of the period lies in the fact that the condition of the empire was not hopeless at the time With ordinary courage and prudence it might have been held together for the attacks directed against it were not more formidable than others which had been beaten off with ease If the blow had fallen when a hero like Leo III or even a statesman like Alexius I was on the throne there is no reason to doubt that it would have been parried But it fell in the times of two incompetent triflers who conducted the state on the principle of Let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die Isaac and Alexius felt in themselves no power of redeeming the empire from the evil day and resignedly fell back on personal enjoyment Isaac s taste lay in the direction of gorgeous raiment and the collecting of miraculous eikons Alexius preferred the pleasures of the table Considered as sovereigns there was little to choose between them Each was competent to ruin an empire already verging on its decline The disaster which the Angeli brought on their realm was rendered possible only by its complete military and financial disorganization As a military power the empire had never recovered the effects of the Seljouk invasions which had robbed it of its great recruiting ground for its native troops in Asia Minor After that loss the use of mercenaries had become more and more prevalent The brilliant campaigns of Manuel Comnenus had been made at the head of a soldiery of whom two thirds were not born subjects of the empire He it is true had kept them within the bounds of strict discipline and contrived at all costs to provide their pay But the weak and thriftless Angeli were able neither to find money nor to maintain discipline A state which relies for its defence on foreign mercenaries is ruined if it allows them to grow disorderly and inefficient In times of stress they mutiny instead of fighting The civil administration was in almost as deplorable a condition while those two Earthly Angels as a contemporary chronicler called them were charged with its care Isaac Angelus put the finishing touch to administrative abuses which had already been rife enough under the Comneni by exposing offices and posts to auction Instead of paying his officials he sent them forth without purse or scrip like the apostles of old to make what profit they could by extortion from the provincials twenty nine His brother Alexius promised on his accession to make all appointments on the ground of merit but proved in reality as bad as Isaac He was surrounded by a ring of rapacious favourites who managed all patronage and dispensed it in return for bribes When high posts were not sold they were given as douceurs to men of local influence whose rebellion was dreaded The history of the twenty years covered by the reigns of the two Angeli is cut into two equal halves at the deposition of Isaac by his brother in eleven ninety five It is only necessary to point out how the responsibility for the disasters of the period is to be divided between them Isaac s share consists in the loss of Bulgaria and Cyprus The former country had now been in the hands of the Byzantines for nearly two hundred years since its conquest by Basil II But the Bulgarians had not merged in the general body of the subjects of the empire They preserved their national language and customs and never forgot their ancient independence In eleven eighty seven three brothers named Peter John and Azan stirred up rebellion among them If firmly treated it might have been crushed with ease by the regular troops of the empire But Isaac first appointed incompetent generals who let the rebellion grow to a head and when at last he placed an able officer Alexis Branas in command his lieutenant took the opportunity of using his army for revolt Branas marched against Constantinople and would have taken it had not Isaac committed the charge of the troops that remained faithful to him to stronger hands than his own He bribed an able adventurer from the West Conrad Marquis of Montferrat by the offer of his sister s hand and a great sum of money to become his saviour The gallant Lombard routed the forces of Branas slew the usurper and preserved the throne for his brother in law But while the civil war was going on the Bulgarians were left unchecked and made such head that there was no longer much apparent chance of subduing them Isaac took the field against them in person only to see the great towns of Naissus Sophia and Varna taken before his eyes While a national revolt deprived the Emperor of Bulgaria Cyprus was lost to a meaner force Isaac Comnenus a distant relative of the Emperor Manuel II raised rebellion among the Cypriots and defeated the fleet and army which his namesake of Constantinople sent against him He held out for six years and appeared likely to establish a permanent kingdom in the island This revolt was of the worst augury to the empire It had often lost provinces by the invasion of barbarian hordes or the rebellion of subject nationalities But that a native rebel should sever a civilized Greek province from the empire and reign as Emperor of Cyprus was a new phenomenon By the imperial theory the idea of an independent Empire of Cyprus was wholly monstrous and abnormal The successful rebellion of Isaac Comnenus pointed to the possibility of a general breaking up of the Byzantine dominion into fragments a danger that had never appeared before Till now the provinces had always obeyed the capital and no instance had been known of a rebel maintaining himself by any other way than the capture of Constantinople Isaac Comnenus might however have founded a dynasty in Cyprus if he had not quarrelled with Richard Coeur de Lion the crusading King of England When he maltreated some shipwrecked English crews Richard punished him by landing his army in Cyprus and seizing the whole island Isaac was thrown into a dungeon and the English king gave his dominions to Guy of Lusignan who called in Frank adventurers to settle up the land and made it into a feudal kingdom of the usual Western type While Isaac II was in the midst of his Bulgarian war and misconducting it with his usual fatuity he was suddenly dethroned by a palace intrigue His own brother Alexius Angelus had hatched a plot against him which worked so successfully that Isaac was caught blinded and immured in a monastery long before his adherents knew that he was in danger Alexius III never showed any other proof of energy save this skilful coup d etat aimed against his brother He continued the Bulgarian war with the same ill success that had attended Isaac s dealings with it He plunged into a disastrous struggle with the Seljouk Sultan of Iconium and he quarrelled with the Emperor Henry VI who would certainly have invaded his dominions if death had not intervened to prevent it But as long as Alexius was permitted to enjoy the pleasures of the table in his villas on the Bosphorus the ill success abroad of his arms and his diplomacy vexed him but little But in twelve oh three a new and unexpected danger arose to scare him from his feasting His blind brother Isaac had a young son named Alexius who escaped from Constantinople to Italy and took refuge with Philip of Suabia the new Emperor of the West Philip had married a daughter of Isaac Angelus and determined to do something to help his young brother in law The opportunity was not hard to seek Just at this moment a large body of French Flemish and Italian Crusaders who had taken arms at the command of the Pope were lying idle at Venice They had marched down to the great Italian seaport with the intention of directing a blow against Malek Adel Sultan of Egypt The Venetians had contracted to supply them with vessels for the Crusade but for reasons of their own had determined that the attack should not fall on the shore for which it had been destined They were on very good terms with the Egyptian sovereign who had granted them valuable commercial privileges at Alexandria which threw the whole trade with the distant realms of India into Venetian hands Accordingly they had determined to avert the blow from Egypt and turn it against some other enemy of Christendom The leaders of the Fourth Crusade proved unable to pay the full sum which they had contracted to give the Venetians as ship hire and this was made an excuse for keeping them camped on the unhealthy islands in the Lagoons till their patience and their stores were alike exhausted Henry Dandolo the aged but wily doge then proposed to the Crusaders that they should pay their way by doing something in aid of Venice The Dalmatian town of Zara had lately revolted and done homage to the King of Hungary if the Crusaders would recover it the Venetian state would wipe out their debts and transport them whither they wished to go The Crusaders had taken arms for a holy war against the Moslems They were now invited to turn aside against a Christian town and interest themselves in Venetian politics Conscientious men would have refused to join in such an unholy bargain and would have insisted in carrying out their original purpose against Egypt But conscientious men had been growing more and more rare among the Crusaders for the last hundred years There were as many greedy military adventurers among them as single hearted pilgrims The more scrupulous chiefs were over persuaded by their designing companions and the expedition against Zara was undertaken Zara fell but another and a more important enterprise was then placed before the Crusaders While they wintered on the Dalmatian coast the young Alexius Angelus appeared in their camp escorted by the ambassadors of his brother in law the Emperor Philip of Suabia The exiled prince besought them to turn aside once more before they sailed to the East and to rescue his blind father from the dungeon into which he had been cast by his cruel brother Alexius III If they would drive out the usurper and restore the rightful ruler to his throne they should have anything that the Byzantine Empire could afford to help them for their Crusade money in plenty stores a war fleet a force of mercenary troops and his own presence as a helper in the war with Egypt Pope Innocent III had already been storming at the adventurers for shedding Christian blood at Zara and tampering with their Crusader s oath But the prospect of Byzantine gold seduced the needy Western barons and the desire of keeping the war away from Egypt ruled the minds of the Venetians They hesitated and began to treat with Alexius though they knew that thereby they were calling down on themselves the terrors of a Papal excommunication All now depended on the leaders and among them the abler minds were set on the acceptance of the proposal of the young Byzantine exile The three chiefs of the Crusade were the Doge Henry Dandolo Boniface Marquis of Montferrat and Baldwin Count of Flanders In Dandolo the ruthless energy of the Italian Republics stood incarnate he was the one man in the crusading army who knew exactly what he wanted Old and blind but clear headed and inflexible he was set on revenging an ancient grudge against the Greeks and on furthering by any means good or evil the fortunes of his native city Baldwin and Boniface the two secondary figures in the camp of the Franks are perfect representations of the two types of crusader The Fleming gallant and generous pious and debonnair worthy of a more righteous enterprise and a more honourable death was a true successor of Godfrey of Bouillon and the heroes of the First Crusade The Lombard a deep and hardy schemer to whom force and fraud seemed equally good was simply seeking for wealth and fame in the realms of the East He cared little for the Holy Sepulchre and much for his own private advancement Behind these three leaders we descry the motley crowd of the feudal world relic hunting abbots in coats of mail wrangling barons and penniless knights the half piratical seamen of Venice and the brutal soldiery of the West Illustration View Of Constantinople From The Side Of The Harbour Boniface of Montferrat and Doge Dandolo gradually talked over the more scrupulous Baldwin and his friends and the crusading fleet was launched against Constantinople after a treaty had been signed which bound Alexius Angelus and his blind father Isaac II to pay the Crusaders two hundred thousand marks of silver send ten thousand men to Palestine and acknowledge the supremacy of the Pope over the Eastern Church In these conditions lay the germs of much future trouble The Crusading armament reached the Dardanelles without having to strike a blow The slothful and luxurious emperor let things slide and had not even a fleet ready to send against them in the Aegean He shut himself up in Constantinople and trusted to the strength of its walls to deliver him as Heraclius and Leo III and many more of his predecessors had been delivered If the siege had been conducted from the land side only his hopes might have been justified for the Danes and English of the Varangian Guard beat back the assault of the Franks on the land wall But Alexius III unlike earlier emperors was attacked by a fleet to which he could oppose no adequate naval resistance Though the Crusaders were driven off on shore the Venetians stormed the sea wall by the expedient of building light towers on the decks and throwing flying bridges from the towers on to the top of the Byzantine ramparts The blind Doge pushed his galley close under the wall and urged on his men again and again till they had won a lodgment in some towers on the port side of the sea wall The Venetians then fired the city and a fearful conflagration followed Hearing that the enemy was within the ramparts the cowardly Alexius III mounted his horse and fled away into the inland of Thrace leaving his troops who were not yet half beaten without a leader or a cause to fight for The garrison bowed to necessity and the chief officers of the army drew the aged Isaac II out of his cloister prison and proclaimed his restoration to the throne They sent to the Crusading camp to announce that hostilities had ceased and to beg Prince Alexius to enter the city and join his father in the palace The end of the expedition of the Crusaders had now been attained but it may safely be asserted that the chief feeling in their ranks was a bitter disappointment at being cheated out of the sack of Constantinople a prospect over which they had been gloating ever since they left Zara They spent the next three months in endeavouring to wring out of their triumphant proteges Isaac and Alexius every bezant that could be scraped together The old emperor already blind and gout ridden was driven to imbecility by their demands his son was a raw inexperienced youth who could neither be firm nor frank nor dignified in dealing with any one He angered the Franks by insincere diplomacy and the Greeks by his reckless schemes for extracting money from them The winter of twelve oh three four was spent in ceaseless wrangling about the subsidy due to the Crusaders till Alexius growing seriously frightened began exactions on his subjects which drove them to revolt When he seized and melted down the golden lamps and silver candelabra which formed the pride of saint Sophia stripped its eikonostasis of its rich metal plating and requisitioned the jewelled eikons and reliquaries of every church in the city the populace would stand his proceedings no longer They would not serve an emperor who had sold himself to the Franks and only reigned in order to subject the Eastern Church to Rome and to pour the hoarded wealth of the ancient empire into the coffers of the upstart Italian republics In January twelve oh four the storm burst The populace and troops shut the gates of the city and fell on the isolated Latins who were within the walls They were not long without a leader a fierce and unscrupulous officer named Alexius Ducas put himself at their head and determined to seize the throne Isaac II died of fright in the midst of the tumult his son Alexius was caught and strangled by the usurper Thus the Angeli ceased out of the land and Alexius V reigned in their stead He is less frequently named by chroniclers under his family name of Ducas than under his nickname of Murtzuphlus drawn from the bushy overhanging eyebrows which formed the most prominent feature of his countenance Alexius Ducas had everything against him He was a mere usurper whose authority was hardly recognized beyond the walls of Constantinople The Angeli had so drained the treasury that nothing remained in it Twenty years of indiscipline and disaster had spoilt the army the fleet was nonexistent for the admirals of Alexius Angelus had laid up the vessels in ordinary and sold the stores to fill their own pockets Nevertheless Murtzuphlus made a far better fight than his despicable predecessor and namesake He collected a little money by confiscating the properties of the unpopular courtiers and ministers of the Angeli and used it to the best advantage The army received some of the arrears due to them and Alexius spent every spare moment in seeing to their drill and endeavouring to improve their discipline He strengthened the sea wall whose weakness had been proved so fatally four months ago by erecting wooden towers along it and building platforms for all the military engines that could be found in the arsenal He ordered too the enrolment of a national militia and compelled the nobles and burghers of Constantinople to take arms and man the walls To the discredit of the Byzantines this order was received with many murmurs the citizens complained that they paid taxes to support the regular army and that they therefore ought to be excused personal service Little good was got out of these new and raw levies they swelled the numbers of the garrison but hardly added anything appreciable to its strength Alexius Ducas himself with his cavalry scoured the country round the Crusading camp every day to cut off the foraging parties of the Franks and when not in the field rode round the city superintending the works inspecting the guard posts and haranguing the soldiery If courage and energy command success he ought to have held his own But he could not counteract the work of twenty years of decay and disorganization and felt that his throne rested on the most fragile of foundations The Crusaders took two months to prepare for their second assault on Constantinople which they felt would be a far more formidable affair than the attack in the preceding autumn They directed their chief efforts against the sea wall which they had found vulnerable in the previous siege and left the formidable land wall alone The ships were told off into groups each destined to attack a particular section of the wall and covered with as many military engines as they could carry Flying bridges were again prepared and landing parties were directed to leap ashore on the narrow beach between the wall and the water and get to work with rams and scaling ladders The attack was made on April eighth at more than a hundred points along two miles of sea wall but it was beaten off with loss Alexius Ducas had made his arrangements so well that the fire of his engines swept off all who attempted to gain a footing on the ramparts The ships were much damaged and at noon the whole fleet gave back and retired as best it could to the opposite side of the Golden Horn Many of the Crusaders were now for returning they thought their defeat was a judgment for turning their arms against a Christian city and wished to sail for the Holy Land But Dandolo and the Venetians insisted upon repeating the assault Three days were spent in repairing the fleet and on April twelfth a second attack was delivered This time the ships were lashed together in pairs to secure stability and the attack was concentrated on a comparatively small front of wall At last after much fighting the military engines of the fleet and the bolts of its crossbowmen cleared a single tower of its defenders A bridge was successfully lowered on to it and a footing secured by a party of Crusaders who then threw open a postern gate and let the main body in After a short fight within the walls the troops of Alexius Ducas retired back into the streets The Crusaders fired the city to cover their advance and by night were in possession of the north west angle of Constantinople the quarter of the palace of Blachern Illustration Byzantine Reliquary From L Art Byzantin Par C Bayet Paris Quantin eighteen eighty three While the fire was keeping the combatants apart the Emperor tried to rally his troops and to prepare for a street fight next day But the army was cowed many regiments melted away and the Varangian Guard the best corps in the garrison chose this moment to demand that their arrears of pay should be liquidated they would not return to the fight without their money The twenty years of disorganization under the Angeli was now bearing its fruit and deeply was the empire to rue the next day Alexius Ducas in despair at being unable to make his men fight left the city by night He was soon followed by the last Greek officer who kept his head the general Theodore Lascaris who endeavoured to make one final attack on the Crusaders even after his master had departed Next morning the Franks found themselves in full possession of the city though they had been expecting to face a hard day of street fighting before this end could be attained In cold blood twelve hours after all fighting had ended the Crusaders proceeded with great deliberation to sack the place The leaders could not or would not hold back their men and every atrocity that attends the storm of a great city was soon in full swing Though no resistance was made the soldiery and especially the Venetians took life recklessly and three or four thousand unarmed citizens were slain But there was no general massacre it was lust and greed rather than bloodthirstiness that the army displayed All the Western writers no less than the Greeks testify to the horrors of the three days carnival of rape and plunder that now set in Every knight or soldier seized on the house that he liked best and dealt as he chose with its inmates Churches and nunneries fared no better than private dwellings the orgies that were enacted in the holiest places caused even the Pope to exclaim that no good could ever come out of the conquest The drunken soldiery enthroned a harlot in the patriarchal chair in saint Sophia and made her rehearse ribald songs and indecent dances before the high altar There were plenty of clergy with the Crusading army but instead of endeavouring to check the sacrilegious doings of their countrymen they devoted themselves to plundering the treasuries of the churches of all the holy bones and relics that were stored in them The Franks remarked a Greek writer who saw the sack of Constantinople behaved far worse than Saracens the infidels when a town has surrendered at any rate respect churches and women After private plunder had reigned unchecked for three days the leaders of the Crusaders collected such valuables as could be found for public division Though so much had been stolen and concealed they were able to produce no less than Leight hundred thousand in hard gold and silver for distribution The sum was afterwards supplemented by the use of a resource which makes the modern historian add a special curse of his own to the account of the Crusaders Down to twelve oh four Constantinople still contained the monuments of ancient Greek art in enormous numbers In spite of the wear and tear of nine hundred years her squares and palaces were still crowded with the art treasures that Constantine and his sons had stored up Nicetas who was an eyewitness of all has left us the list of the chief statues that suffered The Heracles of Lysippus the great Hera of Samos the brass figures which Augustus set up after Actium the ancient Roman bronze of the Wolf with Romulus and Remus Paris with the Golden Apple Helen of Troy and dozens more all went into the melting pot to be recast into wretched copper money The monuments of Christian art fared no better the tombs of the emperors were carefully stripped of everything in metal the altars and screens of the churches scraped to the stone Everything was left bare and desolate Such was the greatest conquest that was ever seen greater than any made by Alexander or Charlemagne or by any that have lived before or after as a Western chronicler wrote while the Greeks grew hyperbolical in lamentation as they saw the eye of the world the ornament of nations the fairest sight on earth the mother of churches the spring whence flowed the waters of faith the mistress of Orthodox doctrine the seat of the sciences draining the cup mixed for her by the hand of the Almighty and consumed by fires as devouring as those which ruined the five Cities of the Plain At last the Crusaders sat down to divide up their conquests They elected Baldwin of Flanders Emperor of the East and handed over to him the ruined city of Constantinople half of it devoured by the flames of the conflagrations that attended the two sieges and all of it plundered from cellar to attic Four fifths of the population had fled and no one had remained save beggars who had nothing to save by flight With the capital Baldwin was given Thrace and the Asiatic provinces Bithynia Mysia and Lydia all of which had still to be conquered His colleague Boniface of Montferrat was made King of Thessalonica and did homage to Baldwin for a fief consisting of Macedonia Thessaly and inland Epirus The Venetians claimed a quarter and half a quarter of the empire and took out their share by receiving Crete the Ionian Islands the ports along the west coast of Greece and Albania nearly the whole of the islands of the Aegean and the land about the entrance of the Dardanelles They seized on every good harbour and strong sea fortress but left the inland alone commerce rather than annexation was their end The rest of the empire was parcelled out among the minor leaders of the Crusade they had first to conquer their fiefs and were then to do homage for them to the Emperor Baldwin Most of them never lived to accomplish the scheme Meanwhile a Venetian prelate was appointed patriarch of Constantinople and news was sent to the Pope that the union of the Eastern and Western Churches was accomplished by the forcible extinction of the Greek patriarchate It only remains to speak of Alexius Ducas the fugitive Greek emperor He fell into the hands of the Crusaders was tried for the murder of the young Alexius Angelus and suffered death by being taken to the top of a lofty pillar and hurled from it The Greeks saw in this strange end the fulfilment of an obscure prophecy about the last of the Caesars which had long puzzled the brains of the oracle mongers XXIII THE LATIN EMPIRE AND THE EMPIRE OF NICAEA twelve oh four twelve sixty one Seldom has any state dragged out fifty seven years in such constant misery and danger as the Latin Empire experienced in the course of its inglorious existence The whole period was one protracted death agony and at no date within it did there appear any reasonable prospect of recovery Thirty thousand men can take a city but they cannot subdue a realm eight hundred miles long and four hundred broad Far more than any government which has since held sway on the same spot did the Latin Empire of Romania deserve the name of the Sick Man It is not too much to say that but for the unequalled strength of the walls of Constantinople the new power must have ceased to exist within ten years of its establishment But once fortified within the ramparts of Byzantium the Franks enjoyed the inestimable advantage which their Greek predecessors had possessed they were masters of a fortress which as military science then stood was practically impregnable if only it was defended with ordinary skill and adequately guarded on the front facing the sea As long as the Venetians kept up their naval supremacy in Eastern waters the city was safe on that side and even the very limited force which the Latin emperor could put into the field sufficed when joined to the armed burghers of the Italian quarters to defend the tremendous land wall From the first year of its existence the Latin Empire was marked out by unfailing signs as a power not destined to continue The intention of its founders had been to replace the centralized despotism which they had overthrown by a great feudal state corresponding in territorial extent to its predecessor But within a few months it became evident that the conquest of the broad provinces which the Crusaders had distributed among themselves by anticipation was not to be carried out The new emperor himself was the first to discover this He set out with his chivalry to drive from Northern Thrace the Bulgarian hordes who had flocked down into the plains to profit by the plunder of the dismembered realm But near Adrianople he met Joannicios the Bulgarian king with a vast army at his back The Franks charged gallantly enough but they were simply overwhelmed by numbers The larger part of the army was cut to pieces and Baldwin himself was taken prisoner The Bulgarian kept him in chains for some months and then put him to death after he had worn the imperial crown only one year twelve oh five Henry of Flanders the brother of Baldwin became his successor He was an honest and able man but he could do nothing towards conquering the provinces of Asia pushing the Bulgarians back over the Balkans or conciliating the subject Greek population All his reign he had to fight on the defensive against his neighbours to the north and south By the time that he died the empire was practically confined to a narrow slip of land along the Propontis reaching from Gallipoli to Constantinople Nor was the chief of the minor Latin states any better off Boniface of Montferrat had fallen in twelve oh seven slain in battle by the same Bulgarian hordes which had cut off the army of his suzerain Baldwin With his death it became evident that the kingdom of Thessalonica was no more able to conquer all the old Byzantine provinces in its neighbourhood than was the empire of Constantinople Boniface s son and heir was a mere infant during his minority the lands of his kingdom were lopped away one after another by the Greek despot of Epirus the able Theodore Angelus At last the capital itself was retaken by the Greeks in twelve twenty two and the kingdom of Thessalonica came to an end The Latin states in the southern parts of the Balkan Peninsula fared somewhat better William of Champlitte had contrived to hew out for himself a principality in the western parts of the Peloponnesus and had organized there a small state with twelve baronies and one hundred thirty six knights fees The resistance of the natives in this district was particularly weak and one battle sufficed to give William all the coast plain of Elis and Messenia Yet he did not succeed in subduing the mountaineers of the peninsula of Maina or the coast towns of Argolis and Laconia so that the Greeks still had some foothold in the peninsula Another small Latin state was set up by Otho de la Roche in Central Greece where as Duke of Athens he ruled Attica and Boeotia He treated his Greek subjects with more consideration than any of his fellow Crusaders and was rewarded by obtaining a degree of respect and deference which was not found in any other Latin state Though the smallest the duchy of Athens was undoubtedly the most prosperous of the new creations of the conquest of twelve oh four Meanwhile it is time to speak of the fortunes of those parts of the Eastern Empire which the Franks did not succeed in seizing when Constantinople fell The provinces had hitherto been accustomed to accept without a murmur the ruler whom the capital obeyed But in twelve oh four it was found that the centralization of the Byzantine Empire great as it was had not so thoroughly crushed the individuality of the provinces as to make them submit without resistance to the Latin yoke Wherever the provincials found a leader whether a member of one of the ex imperial houses or an energetic governor or a landholder of local influence they stood up to defend themselves The Byzantine Empire like some creature of low organism showed every sign of life in its limbs though its head had been shorn off Wherever a centre of resistance could be found the people refused to submit to the piratical Frank and to his yet more hated companions the priests of the Roman Church Of the nine or ten leaders who put themselves at the head of provincial risings three were destined to carve out kingdoms for themselves Of these the most important was Theodore Lascaris the last officer who had attempted to strike a blow against the Franks when Constantinople fell thirty He might claim some shadow of hereditary right to the imperial crown as he had married the daughter of the imbecile Alexius III but his true title was his well approved courage and energy The wrecks of the old Byzantine army rallied around him the cities of Bithynia opened their gates and when the Latins crossed into Asia to divide up the land into baronies and knights fees they found Theodore waiting to receive them with the sword His defence of the strong town of Prusa which successfully repelled Henry of Flanders put a limit to the extension of the Frank Empire beyond a few castles on the Bithynian coast they made no conquests Having thus checked the invaders Theodore had himself solemnly crowned at Nicaea and assumed imperial state twelve oh six Illustration Finial From A Byzantine MS From L Art Byzantin Par C Bayet Paris Quantin eighteen eighty three Having beaten off the Latins Theodore had to cope with another who aspired like himself to pose as the rightful heir to the imperial throne Alexius Comnenus a grandson of the wicked emperor Andronicus I had betaken himself to the Eastern frontiers of the empire when Constantinople fell and obtained possession of Trebizond and the long slip of coast land at the south east corner of the Black Sea from the mouth of the Phasis to Sinope He aspired to conquer the whole of Byzantine Asia and sent his brother David Comnenus to attack Bithynia But Theodore defended his newly won realm with success Comnenus gained no territory from him and was constrained to content himself with the narrow bounds of his Pontic realm where his descendants reigned in obscurity for three hundred years as emperors of Trebizond A greater danger beset the empire of Nicaea when the warlike sultan of the Seljouks came down from his plateau to ravage its borders But the valour of Theodore Lascaris triumphed over this enemy also In the battle of Antioch on Maeander he slew Sultan Kaikhosru with his own hand in single combat and the Turks were beaten back with such slaughter that they left the empire alone for a generation Meanwhile a third Greek state had sprung into existence in the far West Michael Angelus a cousin of Alexius III and Isaac II put in a claim to their heritage though he was disqualified by his illegitimate birth He was recognized as ruler by the cities of Epirus and proclaimed himself despot of that land Raising an army among the warlike tribes of Albania he maintained his position with success and discomfited the Franks of Athens and Thessalonica when they took arms against him He died early but left a compact heritage to his brother Theodore who succeeded him on the throne and within a few years conquered the whole of the Frank kingdom of Thessalonica It was soon evident that there would be a trial of strength between the two Greek emperors who claimed to succeed to the rights of the dispossessed Angeli The Latin Empire was obviously destined to fall before one of them The only doubt was whether the Epirot or the Nicene was to be its conqueror This question was not settled till twelve forty one when the two powers met in decisive conflict By this time Theodore Lascaris had been succeeded in Asia by his son in law John Ducas thirty one and Theodore of Thessalonica by his son John Angelus At Constantinople the succession of Latin emperors had been much more rapid Henry of Flanders had died in twelve sixteen he was followed by Peter of Courtenay who was slain by the Epirots in less than a year To him succeeded Robert his son and when Robert died in twelve twenty eight his brother Baldwin II reigned in his stead The young Courtenays were both thoroughly incapable and saw their empire melt away from them till nothing was left beyond the walls of Constantinople itself John III of Nicaea was an excellent sovereign a very worthy heir to his gallant father in law Not only was he a good soldier and an able administrator but by constant supervision and strict frugality he had got the financial condition of his empire into a more hopeful condition a state of things which had never been seen in Romania since the time of John Comnenus a hundred years before In twelve thirty the troops of Nicaea crossed into Europe and drove the Franks out of Southern Thrace while in twelve thirty five John Ducas laid siege to Constantinople itself But the time of its fall was not yet arrived and when a Venetian fleet approached to succour it the Emperor was constrained to raise the siege Illustration Fountain In The Court Of saint Sophia Recognizing that Constantinople was not yet ripe for its fall John Ducas resolved to measure himself with his rivals the Angeli of Thessalonica He beat their forces out of the field and laid siege to their capital in thirteen forty one Then John Angelus engaged to resign the title of emperor call himself no more than despot of Epirus and to acknowledge himself as the vassal of the ruler of Nicaea This satisfied Ducas for a time but when Angelus died four years later he seized Thessalonica and united it to the imperial crown The heir of the Angeli escaped to Albania and succeeded in retaining a small fraction only of his ancestral dominions twelve forty six John Ducas died in twelve fifty four leaving the throne of Nicaea to his son Theodore II who bid fair to continue the prosperous career of his father and grandfather He drove the Bulgarians out of Macedonia and penned the Albanians into their hills But he became subject to epileptic fits and died after a reign of only four years before he had reached the age of thirty eight twelve fifty eight This was a dreadful misfortune for the empire for John Ducas the son and heir of Theodore was a child of eight years and minorities were always disastrous to the state We have seen in the history of previous centuries how frequently the infancy of a prince led to a violent contest for the place of regent or even to a usurpation of the throne The case of John IV was no exception to the rule the ministers of his father fought and intrigued to gain possession of the helm of affairs till at last an able and unprincipled general named Michael Paleologus thrusting himself to the front was named tutor to the Emperor and given the title of Despot Michael was as ambitious as he was unscrupulous The place of regent was far from satisfying his ambition and he determined to seize the throne though he had steeped himself to the lips in oaths of loyalty to his young master He played much the same game that Richard III was destined to repeat in England two centuries later He cleared away from the capital the relatives and adherents of the little prince placed creatures of his own in their places and conciliated the clergy by large gifts and hypocritical piety Presently the partisans of Michael began to declaim against the dangers of a minority and the necessity for a strong hand at the helm After much persuasion and mock reluctance the regent was induced to allow himself to be crowned From that moment the boy John Ducas was thrust aside and ignored ere he had reached the age of ten his wicked guardian put out his eyes and plunged him into a dungeon where he spent thirty years in darkness and misery The usurpation of Michael tempted all the enemies of the Greek Empire to take arms The Epirot despot allied himself with the Frankish lords of Greece and their united armies aided by auxiliaries from Italy invaded Macedonia moreover the Latin emperor of Constantinople stirred up the Venetians to ravage his neighbours borders But in twelve sixty the troops of Michael won over the allied armies of the Franks and Epirots the last great victory that a Byzantine army was ever destined to achieve The field of Pelagonia decided the lot of the house of Paleologus for Michael s enemies were so crushed that they could never afterwards make head against him Freed from all danger from the West Michael was now able to turn against Constantinople and complete the reconstruction of the empire The city was ripe for its fall and Baldwin of Courtenay had long been awaiting his doom The long reign of the last Latin sovereign of Constantinople is sufficiently characterized by the fact that Baldwin spent nearly half the years of his rule outside the bounds of Romania as he wandered from court to court in the West striving to stir up some champion who would deliver him from the inevitable destruction impending over his realm He gained little by his tours his greatest success being that in twelve forty four he got from saint Louis a considerable sum of ready money in acknowledgment of the liberality with which he had presented the holy king with a choice selection of relics including the rod of Moses the jawbone of John the Baptist and our Lord s crown of thorns In twelve sixty one Baldwin was in worse straits than ever He was stripping off the lead of his own palace roof to sell it for a few zecchins to the Venetians and burning the beams of his outhouses in default of money to buy fuel His son and heir was in pawn to the Venetian banking firm of the Capelli who had taken him as the only tangible security that could be found for a modest loan which they had advanced to the imperial exchequer With the government in such a desperate condition there was no longer any power of resistance left in Constantinople When the Venetian fleet the sole remaining defence of the empire was away at sea the city fell before a sudden and unpremeditated attack made by Alexius Strategopulus commander in Thrace under the emperor Michael Alexius with eight hundred regular troops and a few scores of half armed volunteers was admitted by treachery within the walls Before this formidable array the heirs of the Crusaders fled in base dismay and the Empire of Romania came to an inglorious and a well deserved end Its monarch resumed his habitual mendicant tours in Western Europe and never ceased to besiege the ears of popes and kings with demands for aid to recover his lost realm At last Baldwin passed away his sole memorial is the fact that he made a distressed and itinerant emperor in search of a champion one of the stock figures in the Romances of his day No one in Western Europe was ignorant of his tale and he survives as the prototype of the dispossessed sovereigns of fifty legends of chivalry XXIV DECLINE AND DECAY twelve sixty one thirteen twenty eight There was now once more a Byzantine empire and to an unobservant reader the history of the reigns of the Paleologi looks like the natural continuation and sequel of the history of the reigns of Isaac Angelus and his brother If the annals of Michael VIII and his son were written on to the end of that of Alexius Angelus the intervening gap of the Latin Conquest might almost pass unperceived and the reader might imagine that he was investigating a single continuous course of events The Frank dominion at Constantinople and the heroic episode of the Empire of Nicaea would pass equally unnoticed We need not insist on the perniciousness of such a view Great as may seem the similarity of the Byzantine Empire of twelve oh four and that of twelve seventy it had really suffered an entire transformation in that period To commence by the most obvious and external sign of change it will be observed that the lands subject to Michael Paleologus were far more limited in extent than those which had obeyed Alexius Angelus The loss in Asia was less than might have been expected Theodore Lascaris and John Ducas had kept back the Turk and only two districts of no great extent had fallen into Moslem hands the Pisidian coast with the seaport of Adalia on the south and the Paphlagonian coast with the seaport of Sinope on the north Besides these the distant Pontic province had now become the empire of Trebizond In Europe the loss was far more serious four great blocks of territory had been lost for ever The first was a slip along the southern slope of the Balkans in Northern Thrace and Macedonia which had fallen into the hands of the Bulgarians and become completely Slavonized The second was the district which is represented by the modern land of Albania When the Angeli of Thessalonica fell before John Ducas a younger member of the house retired to the original mountain house of the dynasty and preserved the independence of the Despotate of Epirus Here the Angeli survived for some generations maintaining themselves against the Emperors of Constantinople by a strict alliance with the Latin princes of Southern Greece Next in the list of Old Byzantine territories which Michael never recovered we must place Greece proper now divided between the Princes of Achaia of the house of Villehardouin and the Briennes who had succeeded to the Duchy of Athens But the Paleologi still retained a considerable slice of the Peloponnesus and were destined to encroach ere long on their Frankish neighbours Lastly we must mention the islands of the Aegean of which the large majority were held either by the Venetian government or by Venetian adventurers who ruled as independent lords but subordinated their policy to that of their native state But the territorial difference between the empire of twelve oh four and the empire of twelve sixty one was only one of the causes which crippled the realm of the Paleologi Bad though the internal government of the dominions of Alexius III had been there was still then some hope of recovery The old traditions of East Roman administrative economy though neglected were not lost and might have been revived by an emperor who had a keen eye to discover ability and a ready hand to reward merit New blood in the personnel of the ministry and a keen supervision of details by the master s eye would have produced an improvement in the state of the empire though any permanent restoration of strength was probably made impossible by the deep seated decay of society But by the time of Michael Paleologus even amelioration had become impossible The three able emperors who reigned at Nicaea though they had preserved their independence against Turk and Frank had utterly failed in restoring administrative efficiency in their provinces John Vatatzes himself a thrifty monarch who could even condescend to poultry farming to fill his modest exchequer found that all his efforts to protect native industry could not cause the dried up springs of prosperity to flow again The whole fiscal and administrative machinery of government had been thrown hopelessly out of gear It was the commercial decline of the empire that made a reform of the administration so hopeless The Paleologi were never able to reassert the old dominion over the seas which had made their predecessors the arbiters of the trade of Christendom The wealth of the elder Byzantine Empire had arisen from the fact that Constantinople was the central emporium of the trade of the civilized world All the caravan routes from Syria and Persia converged thither Thither too had come by sea the commodities of Egypt and the Euxine All the Eastern products which Europe might require had to be sought in the storehouses of Constantinople and for centuries the nations of the West had been contented to go thither for them But the Crusades had shaken this monopoly when they taught the Italians to seek the hitherto unknown parts of Syria and Egypt and buy their Eastern merchandize from the producer and not from the middleman Acre and Alexandria had already profited very largely at the expense of Constantinople ere the Byzantine Empire was upset in twelve oh four But the Latin conquest was the fatal blow It threw the control of the trade of the Bosphorus into the hands of the Venetians and the Venetians had no desire to make Constantinople their one central mart they were just as ready to trade through the Syrian and Egyptian ports To them the city was no more than an important half way house for the Black Sea trade and an emporium for the local produce of the countries round the Sea of Marmora From twelve oh four onward Italy rather than Constantinople became the centre and starting place for all European trade and the great Italian republics employed all their vigilance to prevent the Greek fleet from recovering its old strength Henceforth the Byzantine war navy was insignificant and without a war navy the Paleologi could not drive away the intruders and restore the free navigation of the Levant to their own mercantile marine The emperors who succeeded each other on the restored throne of Constantinople were without exception men more fitted to lose than to hold together an exhausted and impoverished empire Their lot was cast it is true in hard times but hardly one of them showed a spark of ability or courage in endeavouring to face the evil day The three monarchs of the house of Lascaris who ruled at Nicaea had been keen soldiers and competent administrators but with the return of the emperors to Constantinople the springs of energy began to dry up and the gloom and decay of the ruined capital seemed to affect the spirit and brain of its rulers Illustration Byzantine Chapel At Ani The Old Capital Of Armenia From L Art Byzantin Par Charles Bayet Paris Quantin eighteen eighty three Michael Paleologus though it was his fortune to recover the city which his abler predecessors had failed to take was a mere wily intriguer not a statesman or general Having usurped the throne by the basest treachery towards his infant sovereign he always feared for himself a similar fate Suspicion and cruelty were his main characteristics and in his care for his own person he quite forgot the interests of the State Even contemporary chroniclers saw that he was deliberately setting himself to weaken the empire because he dreaded the resentment of his subjects He disbanded nearly all the native Greek troops and refrained as far as possible from employing Greek generals One of his minor acts in this direction may be said to have been the original circumstance which set the Ottoman Turks the future bane of the empire on their career of conquest The borders of the empire in Asia were defended by a native militia who held their lands under condition of defending the castles and passes of the Bithynian and Phrygian mountains The institution which somewhat resembled a simple form of European feudalism had worked so well that the Byzantine Empire had for a century and a half kept its Asiatic frontier practically intact in spite of all the pressure of the Seljouk Turks of the Sultanate of Iconium But the Bithynian militia were known to be attached to the house of Ducas which Michael had dethroned and he therefore resolved to disarm them The measure was carried out not without bloodshed but the disbanded levy were not replaced by any adequate number of regular troops Michael s financial straits did not permit him to keep under arms a very large force such as was required to garrison his eastern line of forts after the abolition of the previous machinery of defence Ten years only before Othman the father of the Ottoman Turks succeeded to the petty principality which was destined to be the nucleus of the Turkish Empire the way for him had been thrown open by Michael s suspicious disarmament of the guards of his own frontier Michael lived for twenty one years after the recovery of Constantinople but he did not win a single important advantage in all the rest of his reign In Europe he barely held his own against the Bulgarians the Franks and the fleets of Genoa and Venice The troubles which befell him at the hands of the two naval powers were largely of his own creation for he shifted his alliance from one to the other with such levity and suddenness that both regarded him as unfriendly Though all through his reign he was at war either with Genoa or Venice yet such was the distrust felt for him that when at war with one of the rivals he could not always secure the help of the other Venice had been the mainstay of the Frank emperors of Constantinople and Michael might therefore have been expected to remain staunch to the Genoese On the other hand the Genoese had designs on the Black Sea trade which touched the Emperor s pocket very closely while the Venetians were more connected with the distant commerce of Syria and Egypt which did not concern him Balancing one consideration with the other Michael played false to both the powers and often saw his coast ravaged and his small fleet compelled to take refuge in the Golden Horn while the enemy s vessels swept the seas On land he was less unlucky and the Duke of Athens and the despot of Epirus were both kept in check though neither of them were subdued But it was in Asia that Michael s rule was most unfortunate In the second half of his reign the Seljouks though split into several principalities owing to the break up of the Sultanate of Iconium united to assail the borders of the empire They conquered the Carian and Lydian inland though Tralles and several other towns made a vigorous resistance and reduced Michael s dominion in South western Asia Minor to a mere strip along the coast A similar fate befell Eastern Bithynia where the Turks forced their way as far as the river Sangarius But the ruin of Byzantine Asia was reserved to fall into the times of Michael s son and successor Andronicus II This prince had all the faults of his father levity perfidy and cruelty with others added from which Michael had been free cowardice and superstition The main interest which Andronicus took in life was concerned with things ecclesiastical it would be wrong to say things religious and he spent his life in making and unmaking patriarchs of Constantinople No prelate could bear with him long and in the course of his reign he deposed no less than nine of them While Andronicus was quarrelling with his patriarchs the empire was going to ruin The Seljouk chiefs from the plateau of Asia Minor were pressing down more and more towards the coast and making their way to the very gates of Ephesus and Smyrna At last the emperor growing seriously alarmed when the Turks appeared on the shores of the Propontis itself and threatened the walls of Nicaea and Prusa resolved to make an unwonted effort to beat them back Illustration Adronicus Paleologus Adoring Our Lord From L Art Byzantin Par Charles Bayet Paris Quantin eighteen eighty three In thirteen oh two the long war of the Sicilian Vespers between the houses of Anjou and Aragon came to an end and the hordes of mercenaries of all nations which the two pretenders to the crown of Sicily had maintained were turned loose on the world It occurred to Andronicus that he might hire enough of the veterans of the Sicilian war to enable him to beat back the Turks into their hills All Europe acknowledged that they were the hardiest and best disciplined troops in Christendom though they were also the most cruel and lawless Accordingly the emperor applied to Roger de Flor a renegade Templar the commander of the mercenaries who had served Frederic of Aragon and offered to take him into his service with as many of his followers as could be induced to accompany him Roger accepted with alacrity and came to Constantinople in thirteen oh three with six thousand men at his back other bodies were soon to follow Andronicus loaded the Grand Company as Roger de Flor styled his men with unlimited promises and a certain amount of ready money Roger himself was given the title of Grand Duke and married to a lady of the imperial house After clearing the Turks out of the Bithynian coast land the Grand Company spent the winter of thirteen oh three four in free quarters along the southern coast of Propontis Their plundering habits and their arrogance soon brought them into ill odour with the inhabitants who complained that they were well nigh as great a curse as the Turks In the next year Roger moved south with his host and drove the Turks out of Lydia and Caria but instead of putting the emperor into possession of the reconquered land he garrisoned every fortress with his own men and raised and appropriated the imperial taxes There can be little doubt that he was plotting to seize on the provinces he had regained and to reign at Ephesus as an independent prince At last Roger went so far as to lay formal siege to Philadelphia because its inhabitants preferred to obey orders from Constantinople and would not admit him within their gates Andronicus then lured him to an interview at Adrianople and in his very presence the great condottiere was assassinated by George the Alan an officer whose son had been slain in a brawl by Roger s soldiers The Emperor had probably arranged the murder and certainly refused to arrest its perpetrator thirteen oh seven He was promptly punished The Grand Company was not disorganized by the loss of its leader and thought of nothing but revenge Assembling themselves in haste and abandoning Asia Minor to the Turks they marched on Constantinople harrying the land far and wide with fiendish cruelty The Emperor sent his son Michael against them but the young prince was disgracefully beaten in two fights at Gallipoli and Apros and the mercenaries spread themselves all over Thrace and plundered it up to the gates of the capital It almost looked as if a second Latin Conquest of Constantinople was about to take place for the leaders of the Grand Company got succour from Europe raised a corps of Turkish auxiliaries and occupied Thrace for two years But they could not storm the walls of Constantinople or Adrianople and at last after two years of plundering they had stripped the country so bare that they were driven away by famine Drifting southward and westward they ravaged Macedon and Thessaly and at last reached Greece Here they fell into a quarrel with Walter de Brienne Duke of Athens slew him in battle and took his capital Then at last did the wandering horde settle down they seized the duchy divided its fiefs among themselves and established a new dynasty on the Athenian throne The empire was at last quit of them for when once they ceased to wander the Grand Company ceased to be dangerous This disastrous war with the mercenaries not only ruined Thrace and Macedonia but was the cause of the final loss of the Byzantine provinces of Asia Minor While Andronicus was feebly attempting to cope with the Grand Company the Seljouk chiefs had conquered Lydia and Phrygia once more and then advanced yet further north to siege Mysia and Bithynia By thirteen twenty five they had reduced the Emperor s dominions on the east of the straits to a narrow strip reaching from the Dardanelles to the northern exit of the Bosphorus and bounded by the Bithynian hills to the south Five Seljouk leaders had carved out for themselves principalities in the conquered districts Menteshe in the south Aidin and Saroukhan in Lydia Karasi in Mysia and in the Bithynian borderland Othman destined to a fame very different from that of his long forgotten compeers While Othman and the rest were turning the once thickly peopled countries of Western Asia Minor into a desert sparsely inhabited by wandering nomads Andronicus II was busied in a war even more uncalled for than that with the mercenaries He wished to exclude from the succession to the throne his grandson and heir who bore the same name as himself But the younger Andronicus took measures to defend his rights and raised armed bands Grandfather and grandson were ere long engaged in a long but feebly conducted war which was only terminated in thirteen twenty eight when the old man acknowledged Andronicus the younger as his heir and made him his colleague on the throne But his grandson not contented with this measure of success made him retire from the conduct of affairs and assumed control over every function of government The name of Andronicus II was still associated with that of Andronicus III on the coinage and in the public prayers but he took no further part in the rule of the empire In thirteen thirty two he died at a good old age lamented by no single individual in the realm which he had ruled for fifty years At his death the empire was only two thirds of the size that it had been at his accession XXV THE TURKS IN EUROPE Andronicus III was a shade better than the incapable old man whom he supplanted Though he was given like all his house to treachery and deceit and though his life was loose and luxurious he was at any rate active and energetic He may be described as a weak reflection or copy of Manuel Comnenus being a mighty hunter a bold spear both in the tournament and on the battle field and a great spender of money If he had not the brains to keep his empire together he at any rate fought his best and did not sit apathetically at home like his grandfather while everything was going to rack and ruin Nevertheless Andronicus III was destined to see the termination of the process which had begun under Andronicus II the entire loss of the Asiatic provinces of the empire to the Turks It was now with the Ottomans almost exclusively that he had to deal the other Seljouk hordes had no longer any marchland along the shrunken frontier of his dominions These new foes of the empire deserve a word of description Othman the son of Ertogrul was a vassal of the Seljouk Sultan of Roum who had been granted a tract in the Phrygian highlands under the condition of military service against the Greeks His fief lay in the north west angle of the great central plateau of Asia Minor Behind it lay the rolling country of hills and uplands already occupied by the Seljouks Before it were the Bithynian mountains with their passes protected by forts and garrisoned by local militia till the day when they were so perversely stripped of their defenders by the action of Michael Paleologus Othman and his father Ertogrul before him owned nothing in the hills nor could they have pushed on if Michael had not made the way easy for them But after twelve seventy the native militia was gone and the followers of Othman instead of having to face an armed population fighting to protect its own fields found to oppose them only inadequate garrisons of regular troops at long intervals Othman s life covered two series of great events the disastrous reign of Andronicus II at Constantinople and in Asia Minor the no less disastrous break up of the power of his own suzerain the Sultan of Roum In twelve ninety four Gaiaseddin the last undisputed sovereign of the Seljouk line fell in battle against rebels and in thirteen oh seven Alaeddin III the last prince who claimed to be supreme Sultan died in exile This made Othman an independent prince but he did not take the title of Sultan contenting himself with the humbler name of Emir Othman s field of operation from twelve eighty one to thirteen twenty six was the Byzantine borderland of Bithynia and Mysia He was by no means the strongest of the Seljouk chiefs who made a lodgement within the borders of the empire and it took him twenty years before he conquered one large town His wild horsemen harried the open sea coast plain of Bithynia again and again till at last the wretched inhabitants emigrated or acknowledged him as their sovereign But the towns within their strong Roman walls were unassailable by the light cavalry which formed his only armed strength The siege of Prusa Broussa the capital and key of the region lasted ten years The Turks built a chain of forts around it and gradually made the introduction of provisions more and more difficult till at last a large force was required to march out every time that a convoy was expected At length the inhabitants could find no advantage in spending their whole lives in a beleaguered town undergoing slow starvation Prusa surrendered in thirteen twenty six and Othman heard of the news on his death bed The Turkish frontier now once again touched the Sea of Marmora which it had not reached since the Crusaders thrust it back inland in ten ninety seven The reign of Othman s son Orkhan the second Emir of the Ottomans almost coincided with that of Andronicus III All that the one lost the other gained Orkhan s life work was the completion of the conquest of Bithynia which his father had begun He took Nicomedia in thirteen twenty seven and Nicaea in thirteen thirty three with all the surrounding territory so that Andronicus retained nothing but Chalcedon and the district immediately facing Constantinople beyond the Bosphorus Only once did he have to meet the Emperor in pitched battle this was at the fight of Pelekanon in thirteen twenty nine Andronicus was wounded early in the day and his army deprived of its leader went to pieces and was severely beaten After his recovery from his wounds the Emperor never faced the Ottomans again After conquering Bithynia Orkhan subdued his nearest neighbours among the other Seljouk Emirs and then turned to organizing his state This was the date of the institution of his famous corps of the Janissaries the first steady infantry that any Eastern power had ever possessed He imposed on his Christian subjects in Mysia and Bithynia a tribute not of money but of male children The boys were taken over while very young placed in barracks educated in the strictest and most fanatical Moslem code and trained to the profession of arms Having light horse enough and to spare Orkhan taught the Janissaries to fight on foot with bow and sabre They were well drilled and moved in compact masses which for many ages no foe proved competent to sunder and disperse So thorough was the physical and moral discipline to which the Janissaries were subjected that it was almost unknown for one of them to turn back from his career and relapse into Christianity To keep them firm in their allegiance there acted not only the military and conventual discipline to which they were subject but the dazzling prospect of future greatness The Ottoman sovereigns made it their rule to select their generals and governors their courtiers and personal attendants from the ranks of the tribute children It was calculated that more than two thirds of the Grand Viziers of Turkey in the fourteenth fifteenth and sixteenth centuries had begun their career as Janissaries The first generation of the New Soldiery for such is the meaning of the word Janissary grew up to the military age during the latter half of the reign of Orkhan and it was he who first utilized them on the European shore of the Bosphorus Andronicus III died in twelve forty one and left his shrunken dominions to the risks of a minority for his son and heir John III was only nine years of age If anything had been wanting to aid in the destruction of the empire it was the arrival of such a contingency The usual troubles soon set in and the inevitable civil war was not far off Illustration John Cantacuzenus Sitting In State From a Contemporary MS From L Art Byzantin Par C Bayet Paris Quantin eighteen eighty three The evil spirit of the time was John Cantacuzenus the prime minister of the deceased emperor He was a clever shifty intriguing courtier with a turn for literature but had the abilities neither of a general nor of a statesman However he had read the tale of the rise of the Paleologi to some purpose and had resolved to imitate the career of Michael VIII Now as in twelve fifty eight there was the best of chances for an unscrupulous minister to make himself first the colleague and then the supplanter of his young master Cantacuzenus did his best to repeat the doings of Michael on Michael s great great grandson He bribed and intrigued made himself a party in the state and prepared for a coup d etat when the time should be ripe Unfortunately for himself Cantacuzenus was not of the stuff of which successful usurpers are made He had his scruples and superstitions and showed a fatal habit of procrastination which always led him to act a day too late The Empress Dowager Anne of Savoy succeeded in raising a party against him and when he threw off the mask and declared himself emperor he found himself unable to seize the capital though he mustered an army under its walls Finding that he was playing a losing game Cantacuzenus took the usual step of calling in the national enemy to aid him It was for the last time that this was done in Byzantine history but never before had the result been so fatal The usurper summoned to his aid first Stephen Dushan the king of the Servians and a little later the Turkish princes from across the Aegean Orkhan the son of Othman and his rival Amour Emir of Aidin These allies kept the cause of John Cantacuzenus from destruction but it was by destroying the empire that John had coveted King Stephen entered Macedonia and Thrace and occupied the whole countryside except Thessalonica and a few other towns He then pushed further south conquered Thessaly and made the despot of Epirus do him homage The Byzantine government retained little more than the capital and the districts round Adrianople and Thessalonica Most of this country was lost for ever to the imperial crown and it seemed as if a Servian domination in the Balkan Peninsula was about to begin for Stephen moved south from Servia made Uscup in Macedonia his capital and proclaimed himself Emperor of the Servians and Romans It would perhaps have been well for Christendom if Stephen had actually conquered Constantinople and made an end of the empire In that case there would have been a single great power in the Balkan Peninsula ready to meet the oncoming assault of the Turks But Dushan was not strong enough to take the great city and to the misfortune of Europe he died in thirteen fifty five leaving a realm extending from the Danube to the pass of Thermopylae But his young son Urosh was soon assassinated and the Servian Empire broke up as rapidly as it had grown together A dozen princes were soon scrambling for the remnants of Stephen s heritage The other allies whom John Cantacuzenus called in were the Turks Amour and Orkhan and on them he depended far more than on the Servian He took over into Thrace a large body of Turkish horse and allowed them to harry the country side and carry away his subjects by thousands to be sold in the slave markets of Smyrna and Broussa But the depth of John s degradation was reached when he gave his daughter Theodora to Orkhan to be immured in the Turk s harem Thrace was rapidly assuming the aspect of a desert under the incursions of the Ottoman mercenaries of Cantacuzenus when after six years of war the party of the Empress Anne consented to recognize the usurper as the colleague and guardian of the rightful heir A hollow peace was patched up and the two Johns could take stock of their dilapidated realm thirteen forty seven The net result of their civil war had been that Macedonia and Thessaly were in Servian hands and that Thrace was utterly ruined by the Turks There was nothing left that could be called an empire all that remained was Constantinople and Adrianople the town of Thessalonica and the Byzantine province in the Peloponnesus Cantacuzenus certainly deserves a notable place by the side of Isaac and Alexius Angelus as the third of the great destroyers of the Eastern Empire But his evil work was not yet done For seven years he ruled in conjunction with John Paleologus waging an unsuccessful war against Servia in the hopes of winning back Dushan s conquests But in thirteen fifty four the young emperor having attained the age of twenty four resolved to assert himself and took arms to dethrone his guardian Cantacuzenus resisted and sent over to Asia for the troops of his son in law Orkhan who crossed into Thrace and drove the adherents of the Paleologi out of several fortresses But a night surprise from the side of the sea put John Paleologus in possession of Constantinople and by a fortunate chance he got Cantacuzenus himself into his hands The usurper was in accordance with the usual practice tonsured and placed in a monastery by exceptional good fortune he was spared the loss of his eyes and was able to spend the remainder of his life in writing a history of his own time But it was of little use to sweep away Cantacuzenus while Orkhan s Turks were in Thrace The Ottomans had come as auxiliaries in the war but they were resolved to stop as principals Suleiman the son of Orkhan seized Gallipoli for himself filled it with Turkish families and made it a permanent settlement This was the first Ottoman foothold in Europe but it was not long to remain isolated In thirteen fifty nine Orkhan died and his successor Murad I determined to cross over into Europe and try the fortune of his arms John Paleologus was not a worse man than his immediate predecessors on the throne but thanks to Cantacuzenus he had far less resources than even they had possessed Two years of fighting sufficed to put Thrace in the hands of Murad from sea to sea A decisive battle in front of Adrianople in thirteen sixty one was the finishing stroke and the empire became a mere head without a body its last home province had been lopped away and beyond the walls of Constantinople no land acknowledged John V as sovereign save the district of Thessalonica and the Peloponnesus Why Murad I did not finish the task he had begun and take Constantinople itself it is hard to discern Its walls were still formidable and the Genoese and Venetians could still protect it on the side of the sea But a siege pressed firmly to an end must at last have triumphed over the mere inert resistance of stone and mortar unsupported by an adequate garrison within However Murad preferred to press on against worthier adversaries than the weak Paleologus and spent his life in incessant and successful wars with the Servians the Bulgarians and the Seljouk Emirs of Southern Asia Minor In a reign of thirty years he extended his borders to the Balkans on the north and annexed large tracts of Seljouk territory from his brother Emirs in Asia Minor John Paleologus was his humble vassal and slave After a vain attempt to get help from the Pope this emperor without an empire resolved to make what terms he could and rejoiced when he found that Murad was prepared to grant him peace The Turk was a hard master and rejoiced in giving his vassal unpalatable tasks Best remembered among the tribulations of John is the siege of Philadelphia That place had preserved a precarious independence after all the other cities of Byzantine Asia fell into the hands of the Turkish Emirs Being far away in the Lydian hills it lost touch with Constantinople and had become a free town Murad wishing to subdue it compelled John V and his son Manuel to march in person against the last Christian stronghold in Asia The Emperor submitted to the degradation and Philadelphia surrendered when it saw the imperial banner hoisted among the horse tails of the Turkish pashas above the camp of the besiegers The humiliation of the empire could go no further than when the heir of Justinian and Basil Bulgaroktonos took the field at the behest of an upstart Turkish Emir in order to extinguish the last relics of freedom among his own compatriots XXVI THE END OF A LONG TALE thirteen seventy fourteen fifty three The tale of the last seventy five years of the Byzantine Empire is a mere piece of local history and no longer forms an important thread in the web of the history of Christendom Murad the Turk might have taken Constantinople in thirteen seventy without altering in any very great measure the course of events in Eastern Europe during the next century For after thirteen seventy the empire ceased to exercise its old function of bulwark of Christendom against the Ottomite That duty now fell to the Servians and Hungarians who continued to discharge it for the next hundred and fifty years The Paleologi by their base subservience to the Turk protracted the life of the empire long after all justification for its existence had disappeared If Constantinople had fallen in thirteen seventy instead of fourteen fifty three there are only two ways in which European history would have been somewhat modified The commercial resources of Genoa and Venice would have been straitened before the appointed time and ere the Cape route to India enabled Europe to dispense with the use of Constantinople as half way house to the East And we may add the Renaissance would have been shorn of some of its brilliance in the next century if the dispersion of the Greeks had taken place before Italy was quite fitted to receive them and turn their learning to account But in other respects it is hard to see that much harm would have resulted from the fall of Constantinople in the end of the fourteenth rather than the middle of the fifteenth century While Murad I was conquering the Servians and Bulgarians John Paleologus was dragging out a long and unhonoured old age His reign was protracted for over half a century but his later years were much vexed by the undutiful behaviour of his children His son Andronicus twice rebelled against him and once succeeded in seizing the throne for a short space Andronicus allied himself unto Saoudji a son of Murad I who plotted a similar treason against his father the Emir But Murad easily quelled the rebellion put out the eyes of his own son and sent Andronicus in chains to John II bidding him to follow his example The Emperor did not dare to disobey and ordered his son to be blinded But the operation was so ineffectually performed that Andronicus retained a measure of sight and was even able to venture on a second rebellion against his father In consequence of his heir s unnatural conduct the aged John determined to deprive him of his succession and when he died in thirteen ninety one he left the throne to his second son Manuel and not to his eldest born Manuel II was above the average of the Paleologi and showed some signs of capacity but of what use was it to a prince whose sole dominions were Constantinople Thessalonica and the Peloponnesus He had neither military strength nor money to justify rebellion against the Turk and could only wait on the course of events There was however one moment in Manuel s life at which the liberation of the empire from the Ottoman suzerainty appeared possible and even probable In fourteen oh two there burst into Asia Minor a great horde of Tartars under the celebrated conqueror Timour Tamerlane Sultan Bayezid the successor of Murad I went forth to withstand the invader But at Angora in Galatia he suffered a crushing defeat and the Ottoman Empire seemed likely to perish by the sword Bayezid was captured his trusty Janissaries were cut to pieces his light horsemen scattered to the winds The Tartars swarmed all over Asia Minor occupied Broussa the Ottoman capital and restored to their thrones all the Seljouk Emirs whose dominions Murad I had annexed Bayezid died in captivity and his sons began to fight over the remains of his empire Prince Suleiman seized Adrianople Prince Eesa Nicaea and each declared himself Sultan Illustration Manuel Paleologus And His Family From a Contemporary MS From L Art Byzantin Par C Bayet Paris Quantin eighteen eighty three This was a rare opportunity for Manuel Paleologus the thieves had fallen out and the rightful owner might perchance come again to his own if he played his cards well The control of the Straits was of great importance to each of the Turkish pretenders so much so that Manuel was able to sell his aid to Suleiman for a heavy price In order to keep Eesa from crossing the water the holder of the European half of the Ottoman realm ceded to the Emperor Thessalonica the lower valley of the Strymon the coast of Thessaly and all the seaports of the Black Sea from the mouth of the Bosphorus up to Varna For a moment Manuel once more ruled what might in courtesy be called an empire and so long as the Ottomans were occupied in civil war he contrived to retain his gains The strife of the sons of Bayezid lasted ten years Suleiman was slain by his brother Musa Eesa by his brother Mohammed and the two supplanters continued the war By all Oriental analogies their empire ought to have fallen to pieces for it is very much easier to build up a new state in the East than to keep together an old one which is breaking asunder But Mohammed the youngest of the sons of Bayezid was a man of genius he triumphed over the last of his brothers and united all the remnants of the Ottoman realm that remained Much had been lost to the Seljouk Emirs in Asia Minor and to the Servians and Manuel Paleologus in Europe but the rest was back in Mohammed s hands by A D fourteen twenty one Manuel had very luckily cast in his lot with Mohammed during the later years of the Turkish civil war and his ally let him enjoy the dominions he had recovered by his original treaty with Suleiman in fourteen oh three Between fourteen oh two and fourteen twenty one Europe had an unparalleled opportunity to rid herself of the Ottomans Unfortunately it was not taken Sigismund king of Hungary and at the same time Emperor was the sovereign on whom the duty of leading the attack ought to have fallen But Sigismund was now engaged in his great struggle with the Hussites in Bohemia This wretched religious war directed the strength of Hungary northward when it was wanted in the south Without such a power to back them the Servians though they recovered their own liberty as a result of the battle of Angora could do nothing towards driving the Turks from the Balkans There was never any sympathy between Serb and Magyar and save under the direct pressure of fear of a Moslem invasion they would not act together The Hungarian kings had always laid claim to a suzerainty over the crown of Servia and from time to time tried to convert their neighbours to Roman Catholicism by force of arms Hence there was no love lost between them and a crusade to expel the Turks was never concerted Illustration Arabesque Design From A Byzantine MS From L Art Byzantin Par Charles Bayet Paris Quantin eighteen eighty three Mahomet the Unifier died in fourteen twenty one and evil days at once set in for Constantinople and for Christendom when his ambitious son Murad II came to the throne Manuel Paleologus was one of the first to feel the change in the times He tried to make trouble for Murad by supporting against him two claimants to the Ottoman Sultanate each named Mustapha one the uncle the other the brother of the new ruler This drew down on the empire the fate which had been delayed since thirteen seventy the Sultan declared war on Manuel took one after another all the fortresses which had been recovered by the peace of fourteen oh three and finally laid siege to Constantinople For the last time the walls of the city proved strong enough to repulse an assault Though Murad levelled against them cannon then seen for the first time in the East built movable towers to shelter his troops and launched his terrible Janissaries to the assault he could not succeed The report of a miraculous vision of the Virgin who vouchsafed to reveal herself as the defender of the city encouraged the Greeks to resist with a better spirit than might have been expected At last the pretender Mustapha whom Manuel had supplied with money to cause a revolt against his brother began to stir up such trouble in Asia Minor that the Sultan determined to raise the siege and march against him He granted Manuel peace on the condition that he ceded all his dominions save the cities of Constantinople and Thessalonica and the Peloponnesian province Thus the empire once more sank back into a state of vassalage to the Ottomans fourteen twenty two Manuel II died three years after at the age of seventy seven He was the last sovereign of Constantinople who won even a transient smile from fortune The tale of the last thirty years of the empire is one of unredeemed gloom To Manuel succeeded his son John VI whose whole reign was passed in peace without an attempt to shake off the Turkish yoke such an attempt indeed would have been hopeless unless backed by aid from without As Manuel II once observed the empire now requires a bailiff not a statesman to rule it Treaties wars and alliances were not for him all that he could do was to try to save a little money and to keep his walls in good repair and even these humble tasks were not always feasible All the descriptions of Constantinople in the fifteenth century whether written by Greek natives or by Western travellers bear witness to a state of exhaustion and debility which make us wonder that the empire did not collapse sooner The country outside the walls was a desert Within them more than half the ground was unoccupied and covered only by ruins which testified to ancient magnificence The great palace by the Augustaeum which sheltered so many generations of emperors had grown so dilapidated that the Paleologi dwelt in a mere corner of it Part of the porticoes of saint Sophia had fallen down and the Greeks could not afford to repair even the greatest sanctuary of their faith The population of the city had shrunk to about a hundred thousand souls most of them dwelling in great poverty Such commerce and wealth as still survived in Constantinople had passed almost entirely into the hands of the Italians of Genoa and Venice whose fortified factories at Galata and Pera now contained the bulk of the wares that passed through the city The military strength of the empire was composed of about four thousand mercenary troops of whom many were Franks and hardly any were born subjects of the empire The splendid court which had once been the wonder of East and West had shrunk to such modest dimensions that a Burgundian traveller noted with surprise that no more than eight attendants accompanied the empress when she went in state to worship in saint Sophia thirty two John VI in spite of the caution with which he avoided all action was destined to see the empire lose its most important possession beyond the walls of Constantinople His brother Andronicus governor of Thessalonica traitorously sold that city to the Venetians for fifty thousand zecchins The Sultan incensed at a transfer of Greek territory having taken place without his permission pounced down on the place expelled the Venetians and annexed Thessalonica to the Ottoman Empire fourteen thirty The chief feature of the reign of the last John Paleologus was his attempt to win aid for the empire by enlisting sympathy in Western Europe He determined to conform to Roman Catholicism and to throw himself on the generosity of the Pope Accordingly he betook himself to Italy in fourteen thirty eight with the Patriarch of Constantinople and many bishops in his train He appeared at the Councils of Ferrara and Florence and was solemnly received into the Roman Church in the Florentine Duomo on July six fourteen thirty nine It had apparently escaped John s notice that Eugenius IV the pope of his own day was a very different personage from the great pontiffs of the eleventh and twelfth centuries who were able to depose sovereigns and send forth Crusades at their good pleasure Since the Great Schism the papacy had been hopelessly discredited in Christendom Eugenius IV was engaged in waging a defensive war against the Council of Basle which was attempting to depose him and had little thought or power to spend on aiding the Eastern Christians All that John could get from him was a sum of money and a body of three hundred mercenary troops This was a poor return for his journey and conversion Only one thing of importance was accomplished by the apostasy of the Emperor the outbreak of a venomous ecclesiastical struggle at Constantinople between the conformists who had taken the oath at Florence and the bulk of the clergy who disowned the treaty of union John was practically boycotted by the majority of his subjects the Orthodox priests ceased to pray for him and the populace refused to enter saint Sophia again when it had been profaned by the celebration of the Roman Mass The opinion of the majority of the Greeks was summed up in the exclamation of the Grand Duke John Notaras Better the turban of the Turk in Constantinople than the Pope s Tiara The last years of the reign of John VI coincided with the great campaigns of Huniades and Ladislas of Poland against the Turks For a moment it seemed as if the gallant king of Poland and Hungary backed by his great Warden of the Marches might restore the Balkan lands to Christendom They thrust Murad II back over the Balkans and appeared in triumph at Sophia But the fatal battle of Varna fourteen forty four ended the career of King Ladislas in an untimely death and after that fight the Ottomans were obviously fated to accomplish their destiny without a check John Paleologus watched the struggle without movement if not without concern He was too cautious to stir a finger to aid the Hungarians for he knew that if he once offended the Sultan his days would be numbered John VI passed away in fourteen forty eight and Sultan Murad in fourteen fifty one The one was succeeded by his brother Constantine the last Christian sovereign of Byzantium the other by his young son Mohammed the Conqueror Constantine was a Romanist like his elder brother and was therefore treated with great suspicion and coolness by his handful of subjects He was the best man that the house of Paleologus had ever reared brave pious generous and forgiving Like King Hosea of Israel he did not evil as the kings that were before him yet was destined to bear the penalty for all the sins and follies of his long line of predecessors Mohammed II the most commanding personality among the whole race of Ottoman Sultans set his heart from the first on seizing Constantinople the natural centre of his empire and making it his capital Some excuse had to be found for falling on his vassal the one that he chose was a rather unwise request which Constantine had made There dwelt at Constantinople a Turkish prince of the royal house named Orkhan for whom Mohammed paid a considerable subsidy on condition that he was kept out of the way of mischief and plotting Some unhappy inspiration impelled Constantine to ask for an increase in the subsidy and to hint that Orkhan had claims to the Sultanate This was excuse enough for Mohammed without taking the trouble to declare war he sent out troops and engineers and began to erect forts on Greek soil only four miles away from Constantinople at the narrowest point of the Bosphorus so as to block the approach to the city from the Black Sea The Emperor did not dare to remonstrate but when the Turks began to pull down a much venerated church in order to utilize its stones in the new fort a few Greeks took arms and drove the masons away They were at once cut down by the Turkish guards Constantine demanded redress and then Mohammed having fairly picked his wolf and lamb quarrel with his unfortunate vassal commenced open hostilities Autumn fourteen fifty two Turkish light troops at once appeared to blockade the city while the Sultan began to collect a great train of cannon at Adrianople and to build a large fleet of war galleys in the ports of Asia the siege was to begin in the ensuing spring The empire was now in its death agony and Constantine recognized the fact He spent the winter in making frantic appeals to the Pope and the Italian naval powers to save him from destruction Nicholas V was willing enough to help now that the Emperor was a convert to Catholicism something must be done to aid him But all that the Pope could send was a cardinal a moderate sum of money and a few hundred soldiers of fortune hastily hired in Italy Venice and Genoa could have done much more but they had so often heard the cry of Wolf raised that they did not realize the danger to their Eastern trade at its true extent From Genoa Giovanni Giustiniani brought no more than two galleys and three hundred men Venice did even less only commissioning the bailiff of its factory at Galata to arm such able bodied Venetians as were with him for the protection of the city Altogether the Franks counting both trained mercenaries and armed burghers who company operated in the defence of Constantinople were not more than three thousand strong Yet either Genoa or Venice could have thrown a hundred galleys and twenty thousand men into the scale if they had chosen Illustration Details Of saint Sophia Constantine s own troops were about four thousand strong but he hoped to recruit them by a general levy of the male population of the city He issued a passionate appeal to his subjects to join in saving the holy city the centre of Eastern Christendom But the Greeks only remembered that he was an apostate who had foresworn the faith of his fathers and done homage to the Pope They stood aside in sullen apathy and from the whole population of the city only two thousand volunteers were enlisted Theological bitterness led the blind multitude to cry with Notaras that it preferred the Turk to the Roman In April fourteen fifty three the young Sultan with seventy thousand picked troops at his back laid formal siege to the city on the land side while a fleet of several hundred war galleys beset the Bosphorus The end could not be for a moment doubtful nine thousand men could not hope to defend the vast circuit of the land and sea wall against a veteran army urged on by a young and fiery general Mohammed set his cannon to play on the walls and it was soon seen that the tough old Roman mortar and stone that had blunted the siege engines of so many foes could not resist the force of gunpowder The Sultan s artillery was rude but it was heavy and numerous ere long the walls began to come down in flakes and breaches commenced to show themselves in several places Constantine XIII and his second in command the Genoese Giustiniani did all that brave and skilful men might in protracting the siege They led sorties organized attacks by water on the Turkish fleet and endeavoured to drive off the siege artillery of the enemy by a counter fire of cannon But it was found that the old walls were too narrow to bear the guns and where any were hoisted up and brought to bear their recoil shook the fabric in such a dangerous way that the fire was soon obliged to cease At sea the Christians won one great success when four galleys from the Aegean forced their way in through the whole Turkish fleet and reached the Golden Horn in safety after sinking many of their assailants But the Turks had as great a numerical superiority on the water as on land and the inevitable could only be delayed Mohammed even succeeded in getting control of the harbour of the city above its mouth by dragging light galleys on rollers over the neck of land between the Bosphorus and the Golden Horn and launching them in the inland waters just above Galata Thus the inner as well as the outer sea face of the city was beset by enemies The end came on May twenty nine fourteen fifty three The Sultan had opened several practicable breaches of which the chief lay in the north west angle of the city by the gate of saint Romanus where two whole towers and the curtain between them had been battered down and choked the ditch The storm was obviously at hand and the doomed Emperor was obliged to face his fate Greek historians dwelt with loving sorrow on the last hours of the unfortunate prince He left the breach at midnight partook of the sacrament according to the Latin rite in saint Sophia and snatched a few hours of troubled sleep in his half ruined palace Next morning with the dawn he rose to ride back to the post of danger His ministers and attendants crowded round his horse as he started on what all knew to be his last journey Looking steadfastly on them he prayed one and all to pardon him for any offence that he might wittingly or unwittingly have committed against any man The crowd answered with sobs and wails and with the sounds of woe ringing in his ears Constantine rode slowly off to meet his death The assault commenced at dawn three main attacks and several secondary ones were directed against weak spots in the wall But the chief stress was on the great breach by the gate of saint Romanus There the Emperor himself and Giustiniani at his side stood in the midst of the yawning gap with their best men around them and opposed a barrier of steel to the oncoming assailants Twelve thousand Janissaries sabre in hand formed successive columns of attack as soon as one was beaten off another delivered its assault They fell by hundreds before the swords of the mailed men in the breach for their felt caps and unarmoured bodies were easy marks for the ponderous weapons of the fifteenth century But the ranks of the defenders grew thin and weary Giustiniani was wounded in the face by an arrow and taken on board his galley to die Constantine at last stood almost alone in the breach and a forlorn hope of Janissaries headed by one Hassan of Ulubad whom Turkish chroniclers delight to honour at last forced their way over the wall The Emperor and his companions were trodden under foot and the victorious army rushed into the desolate streets of Constantinople seeking in vain for foes to fight The Greeks half expecting that God would interfere to save the queen of Christian cities by a miracle had crowded into the churches and were passing the fatal hour in frantic prayer The shouts of the victorious enemy soon showed them how the day had gone and the worshippers were dragged out in crowds to be claimed as slaves and divided among the conquerors Mohammed II rode through the breach after his men and descended into the city scanning from within the streets that so many Eastern conquerors had in vain desired to see He bade his men search for the Emperor and the corpse of Constantine was found at last beneath a heap of slain so gashed and mauled that it was only identified by the golden eagles on his mail shoes The Turk struck off his head and sent it round their chief cities as a token of triumph Riding through the hippodrome towards saint Sophia Mohammed noted the Delphic tripod with its three snakes thirty three standing where Constantine the Great had placed it eleven hundred years before Either because the menacing heads of the serpents provoked him or merely because he wished to try the strength of his arm the Sultan rose in his stirrups and smote away the jaws of the nearest snake with one blow of his mace There was something typical in the deed though Mohammed knew it not He had defaced the monument of the first great victory of the West over the East He the successor in spirit not only of Xerxes but of Chosroes and Moslemah and many another Oriental potentate who had failed where he succeeded could not better signalize the end of Greek freedom than by dealing a scornful blow at that ancient memorial erected in the first days of Grecian greatness to celebrate the turning back of the Persians on the field of Plataea At last the Sultan came to saint Sophia where the crowd of wailing captives was being divided among his soldiery He rode in at the eastern door and bade a mollah ascend the pulpit and repeat there the formula of the Moslem faith So the cry that God was great and Mohammed his prophet rang through the dome where thirty generations of patriarchs had celebrated the Holy Mysteries and all Europe and Asia knew the end was come of the longest tale of Empire that Christendom has yet seen Finis TABLE OF EMPERORS Arcadius three hundred

the old file and take over the old filename and etext number The replaced older file is renamed Versions based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers
