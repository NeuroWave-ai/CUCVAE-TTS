none	none	I AM BUOYED UP BY ONE GREAT HOPE one hundred seventy eight missus Raffles I THE ADVENTURE OF THE HERALD PERSONAL That I was in a hard case is best attested by the fact that when I had paid for my Sunday Herald there was left in my purse just one tuppence ha penny stamp and two copper cents one dated eighteen seventy three the other eighteen ninety four The mere incident that at this hour eighteen months later I can recall the dates of these coins should be proof if any were needed of the importance of the coppers in my eyes and therefore of the relative scarcity of funds in my possession Raffles was dead killed as you may remember at the battle of Spion Kop and I his companion who had never known want while his deft fingers were able to carry out the plans of that insinuating and marvellous mind of his was now in the vernacular of the American up against it I had come to the United States not because I had any liking for that country or its people who to tell the truth are too sharp for an ordinary burglar like myself but because with the war at an end I had to go somewhere and English soil was not safely to be trod by one who was required for professional reasons to evade the eagle eye of Scotland Yard until the Statute of Limitations began to have some bearing upon his case That last affair of Raffles and mine wherein we had successfully got away with the diamond stomacher of the duchess of Herringdale was still a live matter in British detective circles and the very audacity of the crime had definitely fastened the responsibility for it upon our shoulders Hence it was America for me where one could be as English as one pleased without being subject to the laws of his Majesty King Edward VII of Great Britain and Ireland and sundry other possessions upon which the sun rarely if ever sets For two years I had led a precarious existence not finding in the land of silk and money quite as many of those opportunities to add to the sum of my prosperity as the American War Correspondent I had met in the Transvaal led me to expect Indeed after six months of successful lecturing on the subject of the Boers before various lyceums in the country I was reduced to a state of penury which actually drove me to thievery of the pettiest and most vulgar sort There was little in the way of mean theft that I did not commit During the coal famine for instance every day passing the coal yards to and fro I would appropriate a single piece of the precious anthracite until I had come into possession of a scuttleful and this I would sell to the suffering poor at prices varying from three shillings to two dollars and a half a precarious living indeed The only respite I received for six months was in the rape of the hansom cab which I successfully carried through one bitter cold night in January I hired the vehicle at Madison Square and drove to a small tavern on the Boston Post Road where the icy cold of the day gave me an excuse for getting my cabby drunk in the guise of kindness Him safely disposed of in a drunken stupor I drove his jaded steed back to town earned fifteen dollars with him before daybreak and then leaving the cab in the Central Park sold the horse for eighteen dollars to a snow removal contractor over on the East Side It was humiliating to me a gentleman born and a partner of so illustrious a person as the late A J Raffles to have to stoop to such miserable doings to keep body and soul together but I was forced to confess that whatever Raffles had left to me in the way of example I was not his equal either in the conception of crime or in the nerve to carry a great enterprise through My biggest coups had a way of failing at their very beginning which was about the only blessing I enjoyed since none of them progressed far enough to imperil my freedom and lacking confederates I was of course unable to carry through the profitable series of abductions in the world of High Finance that I had contemplated Hence my misfortunes and now on this beautiful Sunday morning penniless but for the coppers and the postage stamp with no breakfast in sight and fortunately enough not even an appetite I turned to my morning paper for my solace Illustration THIS I WOULD SELL TO THE SUFFERING POOR Running my eye up and down the personal column which has for years been my favorite reading of Sunday mornings I found the usual assortment of matrimonial enterprises recorded pathetic appeals from P D to meet Q on the corner of Twenty third Street at three imploring requests from J A K to return at once to His Only Mother who promises to ask no questions and finally could I believe my eyes now riveted upon the word my own sobriquet printed as boldly and as plainly as though I were some patent cure for all known human ailments It seemed incredible but there it was beyond all peradventure WANTED A Butler BUNNY preferred Apply to missus A J Van Raffles Bolivar Lodge Newport R I To whom could that refer if not to myself and what could it mean Who was this missus A J Van Raffles a name so like that of my dead friend that it seemed almost identical My curiosity was roused to concert pitch If this strange advertiser should be But no she would not send for me after that stormy interview in which she cast me over to take the hand of Raffles the brilliant fascinating Raffles who would have won his Isabella from Ferdinand Chloe from her Corydon Pierrette from Pierrot ay even Heloise from Abelard I never could find it in my heart to blame Henriette for losing her heart to him even though she had already promised it to me for I myself could not resist the fascination of the man at whose side I faithfully worked even after he had stolen from me this dearest treasure of my heart And yet who else could it be if not the lovely Henriette Surely the combination of Raffles with or without the Van and Bunny was not so usual as to permit of so remarkable a coincidence I will go to Newport at once I cried rising and pacing the floor excitedly for I had many times in cursing my loneliness dreamed of Henriette and had oftener and oftener of late found myself wondering what had become of her and then the helplessness of my position burst upon me with full force How should I the penniless wanderer in New York get to Bolivar Lodge at Newport It takes money in this sordid country to get about even as it does in Britain in sorry truth things in detail differ little whether one lives under a king or a president poverty is quite as hard to bear and free passes on the railroad are just as scarce Curses on these plutocrats I muttered as I thought of the railway directors rolling in wealth running trains filled with empty seats to and from the spot that might contain my fortune and I unable to avail myself of them for the lack of a paltry dollar or two But suddenly the thought flashed over me telegraph collect If it is she she will respond at once And so it was that an hour later the following message was ticked over the wires Personal to day s Herald received Telegraph railway fare and I will go to you instantly Signed BUNNY For three mortal hours I paced the streets feverishly awaiting the reply and at two thirty it came disconcerting enough in all conscience If you are not a bogus Bunny you will know how to raise the cash If you are a bogus Bunny I don t want you It was simple direct and convincing and my heart fluttered like the drum beat s morning call to action the moment I read it By Jove I cried The woman is right of course It must be Henriette and I ll go to her if I have to rob a nickel in the slot machine It was as of old Faint hearted I always was until some one gave me a bit of encouragement A word of praise or cheer from Raffles in the old days and I was ready to batter down Gibraltar a bit of discouragement and a rag was armor plate beside me If you are not a bogus Bunny you will know I read spreading the message out before me That is to say she believes that if I am really myself I can surmount the insurmountable Gad I ll do it And I set off hot foot up Fifth Avenue hoping to discover or by cogitation in the balmy air of the spring time afternoon to conceive of some plan to relieve my necessities But somehow or other it wouldn t come There were no pockets about to be picked in the ordinary way I hadn t the fare for a ride on the surface or elevated cars where I might have found an opportunity to relieve some traveller of his purse and as for snatching such a thing from some shopper it was Sunday and the women who would have been an easy prey on a bargain day carried neither purse nor side bag with them I was in despair and then the pealing bells of saint Jondy s the spiritual home of the multi millionaires of New York rang out the call to afternoon service It was like an invitation the way was clear My plan was laid in an instant and it worked beyond my most hopeful anticipations Entering the church I was ushered to a pew about halfway up the centre aisle despite my poverty I had managed to keep myself always well groomed and no one would have guessed to look at my faultless frock coat and neatly creased trousers at my finely gloved hand and polished top hat that my pockets held scarcely a brass farthing The service proceeded A good sermon on the Vanity of Riches found lodgment in my ears and then the supreme moment came The collection plate was passed and gripping my two pennies in my hand I made as if to place them in the salver but with studied awkwardness I knocked the alms platter from the hands of the gentleman who passed it The whole contents and the platter as well fell at my feet and from my lips in reverent whispers poured forth no end of most abject apologies Of course I assisted in recovering the fallen bills and coins and in less time than it takes to tell it the vestryman was proceeding on his way up the aisle gathering in the contributions from other generously disposed persons as he went as unconsciously as though the contretemps had never occurred and happily unaware that out of the moneys cast to the floor by my awkward act two yellow backed fifty dollar bills five half dollars and a dime remained behind under the hassock at my feet whither I had managed to push them with my toe while offering my apologies Illustration THE WHOLE CONTENTS AND THE PLATTER AS WELL FELL AT MY FEET An hour later having dined heartily at Delsherrico s I was comfortably napping in a Pullman car on my way to the Social Capital of the United States II THE ADVENTURE OF THE NEWPORT VILLA There is little need for me to describe in detail the story of my railway journey from New York to Newport It was uneventful and unproductive save as to the latter end of it when on the arrival of the train at Wickford observing that the prosperous looking gentleman bound for Boston who occupied the seat next mine in the Pullman car was sleeping soundly I exchanged my well worn covert coat for his richly made sable lined surtout and made off as well with his suit case on the chance of its holding something that might later serve some one of my many purposes I mention this in passing only because the suit case containing as it did all the essential features of a gentleman s evening attire even to three superb pearl studs in the bosom of an immaculately white shirt all of them marvellously enough as perfectly fitting as though they had been made for me with a hundred unregistered first mortgage bonds of the United States Steel Company of which securities there will be more anon enabled me later to appear before missus Van Raffles in a guise so prosperous as to win an immediate renewal of her favor We shall be almost as great a combination as the original Bunny she cried enthusiastically when I told her of this coup With my brains and your blind luck nothing can stop us My own feelings as I drove up to Bolivar Lodge were mixed I still loved Henriette madly but the contrast between her present luxury and my recent misery grated harshly upon me I could not rid myself of the notion that Raffles had told her of the secret hiding place of the diamond stomacher of the duchess of Herringdale and that she had appropriated to her own use all the proceeds of its sale leaving me who had risked my liberty to obtain it without a penny s worth of dividend for my pains It did not seem quite a level thing to do and I must confess that I greeted the lady in a reproachful spirit It was indeed she and more radiantly beautiful than ever a trifle thinner perhaps and her eyes more coldly piercing than seductively winning as of yore but still Henriette whom I had once so madly loved and who had jilted me for a

none	none	man Dear old Bunny she murmured holding out both hands in welcome Just to think that after all these years and in a strange land and under such circumstances we should meet again It is strange said I my eye roving about the drawing room which from the point of view of its appointments and decoration was about the richest thing I had ever seen either by light of day or in the mysterious glimpses one gets with a dark lantern of the houses of the moneyed classes It seems more than strange I added significantly to see you surrounded by such luxury A so called lodge built of the finest grade of Italian marble gardens fit for the palace of a king a retinue of servants such as one scarcely finds on the ducal estates of the proudest families of England and a mansion that is furnished with treasures of art any one of which is worth a queen s ransom I do not wonder you are surprised she replied looking about the room with a smile of satisfaction that did little to soothe my growing wrath It certainly leaves room for explanation I retorted coldly Of course if Raffles told you where the Herringdale jewels were hid and you have disposed of them some of all this could be accounted for but what of me Did it ever occur to you that I was entitled to some part of the swag Oh you poor suspicious old Bunny she rippled Haven t I sent for you to give you some share of this although truly you don t deserve it for this is all mine I haven t any more notion what became of the Herringdale jewels than the duchess of Herringdale herself What I cried Then these surroundings Are self furnishing she said with a merry little laugh and all through a plan of my own Bunny This house as you may not be aware is the late residence of mister and missus Constant Scrappe Who are suing each other for divorce I put in for I knew of the Constant Scrappes in social life as who did not since a good third of the society items of the day concerned themselves with the matrimonial difficulties of this notable couple Precisely said Henriette Now missus Scrappe is in South Dakota establishing a residence and Colonel Scrappe is at Monte Carlo circulating his money with the aid of a wheel and a small ball Bolivar Lodge with its fine collection of old furniture its splendid jades its marvellous Oriental potteries paintings and innumerable small silver articles is left here at Newport and for rent What more natural dear than that I needing a residence whose occupancy would in itself be an assurance of my social position should snap it up with an eagerness which in this Newport atmosphere amounted nearly to a betrayal of plebeian origin But it must cost a fortune I cried gazing about me at the splendors of the room which even to a cursory inspection revealed themselves as of priceless value That cloisonne jar over by the fireplace is worth two hundred pounds alone That is just the reason why I wanted this particular house Bunny It is also why I need your assistance in maintaining it missus Raffles returned Woman is ever a mystery I responded with a harsh laugh Why in Heaven s name you think I can help you to pay your rent It is only twenty five hundred dollars a month Bunny she said My answer was a roar of derisive laughter Hear her I cried addressing the empty air Only twenty five hundred dollars a month Why my dear Henriette if it were twenty five hundred clam shells a century I couldn t help you pay a day s rental I am that strapped Until this afternoon I hadn t seen thirty cents all at once for nigh on to six months I have been so poor that I ve had to take my morning coffee at midnight from the coffee wagons of the New York Boston and Chicago sporting papers In eight months I have not tasted a table d hote dinner that an expert would value at fifteen cents net and yet you ask me to help you pay twenty five hundred dollars a month rent for a Newport palace You must be mad You are the same loquacious old Bunny that you used to be said missus Raffles sharply yet with a touch of affection in her voice You can t keep your trap shut for a second can you Do you know Bunny what dear old A J said to me just before he went to South Africa It was that if you were as devoted to business as you were to words you d be a wonder His exact remark was that we would both have to look out for you for fear you would queer the whole business Raffles estimated that your habit of writing up full accounts of his various burglaries for the London magazines had made the risks one hundred per cent bigger and the available swag a thousand per cent harder to get hold of Harry said he the night before he sailed if I die over in the Transvaal and you decide to continue the business get along as long as you can without a press agent If you go on the stage surround yourself with em but in the burglary trade they are a nuisance My answer was a sulky shrug of the shoulders You haven t given me a chance to explain how you are to help me I don t ask you for money Bunny Four dollars worth of obedience is all I want she continued The portable property in this mansion is worth about half a million dollars my lad and I want you to be well my official porter I took immediate possession of this house and my first month s rent was paid with the proceeds of a sale of three old bedsteads I found on the top floor six pieces of Sevres china from the southeast bedroom on the floor above this and a Satsuma vase which I discovered in a hall closet on the third floor A light began to dawn on me Before coming here I eked out a miserable existence in New York as buyer for an antique dealer on Fourth Avenue she explained He thinks I am still working for him travelling about the country in search of bargains in high boys mahogany desks antique tables wardrobes bedsteads in short valuable junk generally

none	none	As missus Raffles or Van Raffles as you have it now I demanded Oh Bunny Bunny Bunny What a stupid you are Never As Miss Pratt Robinson she replied From this I earn fifteen dollars a week The sources of the material I send him well do you see now Bunny It is growing clearer said I You contemplate paying the rent of this house with its contents is that it What beautiful intelligence you have Bunny she laughed airily You know a hawk from a hand saw Nobody can pass a motor car off on you for a horse can they Bunny dear Not while you have that eagle eye of yours wide open Yes sir That is the scheme I am going to pay the rental of this mansion with its contents Half a million dollars worth of contents means how long at twenty five hundred dollars a month Eh Gad Henriette I cried You are worthy of Raffles I swear it You can be easy about your rent for sixteen years That is about the size of it as these Newport people have it said missus Raffles beaming upon me I m still in the dark as to where I come in said I Promise to obey my directions implicitly said Henriette and you will receive your share of the booty Henriette I cried passionately seizing her hand No Bunny not now she remonstrated gently This is no time for sentiment Just promise to obey the love and honor business may come later I will said I Well then she resumed her color mounting high and speaking rapidly you are to return at once to New York taking with you three trunks which I have already packed containing one of the most beautiful collections of jade ornaments that has ever been gathered together You will rent a furnished apartment in some aristocratic quarter Spread these articles throughout your rooms as though you were a connoisseur and on Thursday next when mister Harold Van Gilt calls upon you to see your collection you will sell it to him for not less than eight thousand dollars Aha said I I see the scheme This you will immediately remit to me here she continued excitedly mister Van Gilt will pay cash I laughed Why eight thousand I demanded Are you living beyond your ah income No she answered but next month s rent is due Tuesday and I owe my servants and tradesmen twenty five hundred dollars more Even then there will be three thousand dollars over I put in True Bunny true But I shall need it all dear I am invited to the P J D Gasters on Sunday afternoon to play bridge Henriette explained We must prepare for emergencies I returned to New York on the boat that night and by Wednesday was safely ensconced in very beautifully furnished bachelor quarters near Gramercy Square where on Thursday mister Harold Van Gilt called to see my collection of jades which I was selling because of a contemplated five year journey into the East On Friday mister Van Gilt took possession of the collection and that night a check for eight thousand dollars went to missus Van Raffles at Newport Incidentally I passed two thousand dollars to my own credit As I figured it out if Van Gilt was willing to pay ten thousand dollars for the stuff and Henriette was willing to take eight thousand dollars for it nobody was the loser by my pocketing two thousand dollars unless perhaps it was mister and missus Constant Scrappe who owned the goods But that was none of my affair I played straight with the others and that was all there was to it as far as I was concerned III THE ADVENTURE OF missus GASTER S MAID 
479_107479_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Two days after my bargain with mister Harold Van Gilt in which he acquired possession of the Scrappe jades and missus Van Raffles and I shared the proceeds of the ten thousand dollars check I was installed at Bolivar Lodge as head butler and steward my salary to consist of what I could make out of it on the side plus ten per cent of the winnings of my mistress 
none	none	It was not long before I discovered that the job was a lucrative one From various tradesmen of the town I received presents of no little value in the form sometimes of diamond scarf pins gold link sleeve buttons cases of fine wines for my own use and in one or two instances checks of substantial value There was also what was called a steward s rebate on the monthly bills which in circles where lavish entertainment is the order of the day amounted to a tidy little income in itself My only embarrassment lay in the contact into which I was necessarily brought with other butlers with whom I was perforce required to associate 
479_107479_000002_000005	train-clean-360	This went very much against the grain at first for although I am scarcely more than a thief after all I am an artistic one and still retain the prejudice against inferior associations which an English gentleman whatever the vicissitudes of his career can never quite rid himself of 
479_107479_000002_000006	train-clean-360	I had to join their club an exclusive organization of butlers and gentlemen s gentlemen otherwise valets and in order to quiet all suspicion of my real status in the Van Raffles household I was compelled to act the part in a fashion which revolted me 
479_107479_000002_000007	train-clean-360	Otherwise the position was pleasant and as I have intimated more than lucrative 
479_107479_000003_000000	train-clean-360	It did not take me many days to discover that Henriette was a worthy successor to her late husband 
479_107479_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Few opportunities for personal profit escaped her eye and I was able to observe as time went on and I noted the accumulation of spoons forks nutcrackers and gimcracks generally that she brought home with her after her calls upon or dinners with ladies of fashion that she had that quality of true genius which never overlooks the smallest details 
none	none	The first big coup after my arrival as the result of her genius was in the affair of missus Gaster s maid 
479_107479_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Henriette had been to a bridge afternoon at missus Gaster s and upon her return manifested an extraordinary degree of excitement 
479_107479_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Her color was high and when she spoke her voice was tremulous 
none	none	Her disturbed condition was so evident that my heart sank into my boots for in our business nerve is a sine qua non of success and it looked to me as if Henriette was losing hers She has probably lost at cards to day I thought and it has affected her usual calmness 
479_107479_000004_000005	train-clean-360	I must do something to warn her against this momentary weakness 
none	none	With this idea in mind when the opportunity presented itself later I spoke You lost at bridge to day Henriette I said
479_107479_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes she replied 
none	none	Twenty five hundred dollars in two hours 
479_107479_000006_000002	train-clean-360	How did you guess 
none	none	By your manner said I You are as nervous as a young girl at a commencement celebration 
479_107479_000007_000001	train-clean-360	This won t do Henriette 
none	none	Nerves will prove your ruin and if you can t stand your losses at bridge what will you do in the face of the greater crisis which in our profession is likely to confront us in the shape of an unexpected visit of police at any moment Her answer was a ringing laugh You absurd old rabbit she murmured
479_107479_000009_000001	train-clean-360	 As if I cared about my losses at bridge 
none	none	Why my dear Bunny I lost that money on purpose 
479_107479_000009_000003	train-clean-360	You don t suppose that I am going to risk my popularity with these Newport ladies by winning do you 
none	none	Not I my boy I plan too far ahead for that 
479_107479_000009_000006	train-clean-360	For the good of our cause it is my task to lose steadily and with good grace 
479_107479_000009_000007	train-clean-360	This establishes my credit proves my amiability and confirms my popularity 
479_107479_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 But you are very much excited by something Henriette said I You cannot deny that 
479_107479_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t but it is the prospect of future gain not the reality of present losses that has taken me off my poise she said 
none	none	Whom do you suppose I saw at missus Gaster s to day No detectives I hope I replied paling at the thought No sir she laughed missus Gaster s maid 
479_107479_000013_000002	train-clean-360	We must get her Bunny 
none	none	Oh tush I ejaculated
479_107479_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 All this powwow over another woman s maid 
479_107479_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 You don t understand said Henriette 
7739_107483_000026_000004	train-clean-360	understand 
none	none	said Henriette It wasn t the maid so much as the woman that startled me Bunny 
479_107479_000015_000002	train-clean-360	You can t guess who she was 
479_107479_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 How should I I demanded 
479_107479_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 She was Fiametta de Belleville one of the most expert hands in our business 
479_107479_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Poor old Raffles used to say that she diminished his income a good ten thousand pounds a year by getting in her fine work ahead of his explained Henriette 
479_107479_000017_000002	train-clean-360	 He pointed her out to me in Piccadilly once and I have never forgotten her face 
none	none	I hope she did not recognize you I observed
479_107479_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 No indeed she never saw me before so how could she 
479_107479_000019_000001	train-clean-360	But I knew her the minute she took my cloak said Henriette 
none	none	She s dyed her hair but her eyes were the same as ever and that peculiar twist of the lip that Raffles had spoken of as constituting one of her fascinations remained unchanged Moreover just to prove myself right I left my lace handkerchief and a five hundred dollar bill in the cloak pocket 
479_107479_000019_000004	train-clean-360	When I got the cloak back both were gone 
none	none	Oh she s Fiametta de Belleville all right and we must get her
479_107479_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 What for to rob you 
479_107479_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 No returned Henrietta rather that we but there there Bunny I ll manage this little thing myself 
479_107479_000021_000001	train-clean-360	It s a trifle too subtle for a man s intellect especially when that man is you 
479_107479_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 What do you suppose she is doing here I asked 
none	none	You silly boy laughed Henriette Doing Why missus Gaster of course She is after the Gaster jewels Humph I said gloomily
479_107479_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 That cuts us out doesn t it 
479_107479_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Does it asked Henriette enigmatically 
none	none	It was about ten weeks later that the newspapers of the whole country were ringing with the startling news of the mysterious disappearance of missus Gaster s jewels The lady had been robbed of three hundred and sixty eight thousand dollars worth of gems and there was apparently no clew even to the thief 
479_107479_000027_000002	train-clean-360	Henriette and I of course knew that Fiametta de Belleville had accomplished her mission but apparently no one else knew it 
none	none	True she had been accused and had been subjected to a most rigid examination by the Newport police and the New York Central Office but no proof of any kind establishing her guilt could be adduced and after a week of suspicion she was to all intents and purposes relieved of all odium
479_107479_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 She ll skip now said I 
none	none	Not she said Henriette
479_107479_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 To disappear now would be a confession of guilt 
none	none	If Fiametta de Belleville is the woman I take her for she ll stay right here as if nothing had happened but of course not at missus Gaster s
479_107479_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Where then I asked 
none	none	With missus A J Van Raffles replied Henriette
479_107479_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 The fact is she added I have already engaged her 
none	none	She has acted her part well and has seemed so prostrated by the unjust suspicion of the world that even missus Gaster is disturbed over her condition She has asked her to remain but Fiametta has refused I couldn t madam she said when missus Gaster asked her to stay You have accused me of a fearful crime a crime of which I am innocent and I d rather work in a factory or become a shop girl in a department store than stay longer in a house where such painful things have happened Result next Tuesday Fiametta de Belleville comes to me as my maid Well Henriette said I I presume you know your own business but why you lay yourself open to being robbed yourself and to having the profits of your own business diminished I can t see Please remember that I warned you against this foolish act
479_107479_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 All right Bunny I ll remember smiled missus Van Raffles and there the matter was dropped for the moment 
none	none	The following Tuesday Fiametta de Belleville was installed in the Van Raffles household as the maid of missus A J Van Raffles To her eagle eye it was another promising field for profit for Henriette had spared neither pains nor money to impress Fiametta with the idea that next to missus Gaster she was about as lavish and financially capable a householder as could be found in the Social Capital of the United States As for me I was the picture of gloom 
479_107479_000034_000003	train-clean-360	The woman s presence in our household could not be but a source of danger to our peace of mind as well as to our profits and for the life of me I could not see why Henriette should want her there 
none	none	But I was not long in finding out 
479_107479_000035_000000	train-clean-360	A week after Fiametta s arrival missus Raffles rang hurriedly for me 
479_107479_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes madam I said responding immediately to her call 
none	none	Bunny she said her hand trembling a little the hour for action has arrived 
479_107479_000037_000001	train-clean-360	I have just sent Fiametta on an errand to Providence 
none	none	She will be gone three hours
479_107479_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said I What of it 
479_107479_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 I want you during her absence to go with me to her room 
none	none	The situation began to dawn on me
479_107479_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I cried breathlessly 
479_107479_000041_000001	train-clean-360	 And search her trunks 
479_107479_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 No Bunny no the eaves whispered Henriette 
none	none	I gave her that room in the wing because it has so many odd cubby holes where she could conceal things 
479_107479_000042_000002	train-clean-360	I am inclined to think well the moment she leaves the city let me know 
none	none	Follow her to the station and don t return till you know she is safely out of town and on her way to Providence Then our turn will come 
479_107479_000043_000000	train-clean-360	Oh that woman 
479_107479_000043_000001	train-clean-360	If I had not adored her before I but enough 
479_107479_000043_000002	train-clean-360	This is no place for sentiment 
none	none	The story is the thing and I must tell it briefly 
479_107479_000044_000000	train-clean-360	I followed out Henriette s instructions to the letter and an hour later returned with the information that Fiametta was indeed safely on her way 
none	none	Good said missus Raffles
479_107479_000045_000001	train-clean-360	 And now Bunny for the Gaster jewels 
none	none	Mounting the stairs rapidly taking care of course that there were none of the other servants about to spy upon us we came to the maid s room Everything in it betokened a high mind and a good character 
479_107479_000046_000002	train-clean-360	There were religious pictures upon the bureau prayer books and some volumes of essays of a spiritual nature were scattered about nothing was there to indicate that the occupant was anything but a simple sweet child of innocence except 
479_107479_000047_000000	train-clean-360	Well Henriette was right except the Gaster jewels 
none	none	Even as my mistress had suspected they were cached under the eaves snuggled close against the huge dormer window looking out upon the gardens laid by for a convenient moment to get them out of Newport and then back to England for Fiametta And what a gorgeous collection they were Dog collars of diamonds yards of pearl rope necklaces of rubies of the most lustrous color and of the size of pigeons eggs rings brooches tiaras everything in the way of jewelled ornament the soul of woman could desire all packed closely away in a tin box that I now remembered Fiametta had brought with her in her hand the day of her arrival And now all these things were ours Henriette s and mine without our having had to stir out of doors to get them An hour later they were in the safety deposit vault of missus A J Van Raffles in the sturdy cellars of the Tiverton Trust Company as secure against intrusion as though they were locked in the heart of Gibraltar itself Illustration HER SLIGHT LITTLE FIGURE CONVULSED WITH GRIEF And Fiametta Well a week later she left Newport suddenly her eyes red with weeping and her slight little figure convulsed with grief Her favorite aunt had just died she said and she was going back to England to bury her IV THE PEARL ROPE OF missus GUSHINGTON ANDREWS Bunny said Henrietta one morning shortly after we had come into possession of the Gaster jewels how is your nerve 
479_107480_000000_000001	train-clean-360	Are you ready for a coup requiring a lot of it 
479_107480_000001_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I replied pluming myself a bit I don t wish to boast Henriette but I think it is pretty good 
479_107480_000001_000001	train-clean-360	I managed to raise twenty seven hundred dollars on my own account by the use of it last night 
479_107480_000002_000000	train-clean-360	 Indeed said Henriette with a slight frown 
479_107480_000002_000001	train-clean-360	 How Bunny 
479_107480_000002_000002	train-clean-360	You know you are likely to complicate matters for all of us if you work on the side What pray did you do last night 
none	none	And then I unfolded to her the incidents of the night before when by assuming at a moment s notice the position of valet to young Robertson de Pelt the frisky young favorite of the inner set I had relieved that high flying young bachelor of fifteen hundred dollars in cash and some twelve hundred dollars worth of jewels as well
479_107480_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 I was spending the evening at the Gentlemen s Gentlemen s Club I explained when word came over the telephone to Digby mister de Pelt s valet that mister de Pelt was at the Rockerbilts and in no condition to go home alone 
479_107480_000004_000001	train-clean-360	It happened that it was I who took the message and observing that Digby was engaged in a game of billiards and likely to remain so for some time to come I decided to go after the gentleman myself without saying anything to Digby about it 
479_107480_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Muffling myself up so that no one could recognize me I hired a cab and drove out to the Rockerbilt mansion sent in word that mister de Pelt s man was waiting for him and in ten minutes had the young gentleman in my possession 
479_107480_000004_000003	train-clean-360	I took him to his apartment dismissed the cab and letting ourselves into his room with his own latch key put him to bed 
479_107480_000004_000004	train-clean-360	His clothes I took as a well ordered valet should from his bed chamber into an adjoining room where after removing the contents of his pockets I hung them neatly over a chair and departed taking with me of course everything of value the young gentleman had about him even down to the two brilliant rubies he wore in his garter buckles 
479_107480_000004_000005	train-clean-360	This consisted of two handfuls of crumpled twenty dollar bills from his trousers three rolls of one hundred dollar bills from his waistcoat and sundry other lots of currency both paper and specie that I found stowed away in his overcoat and dinner coat pockets 
none	none	There were also ten twenty dollar gold pieces in a little silver chain bag he carried on his wrist As I say there was about fifteen hundred dollars of this loose change and I reckon up the value of his studs garter rubies and finger rings at about twelve hundred dollars more or a twenty seven hundred dollars pull in all Eh
479_107480_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 Mercy Bunny that was a terribly risky thing 
479_107480_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Suppose he had recognized you cried Henriette 
479_107480_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh he did or at least he thought he did I replied smiling broadly at the recollection 
none	none	On the way home in the cab he wept on my shoulder and said I was the best friend he ever had and told me he loved me like a brother There wasn t anything he wouldn t do for me and if ever I wanted an automobile or a grand piano all I had to do was to ask him for it 
479_107480_000006_000003	train-clean-360	He was very genial 
479_107480_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Well Bunny said Henriette you are very clever at times but do be careful 
7783_107487_000008_000001	train-clean-360	 do be careful 
479_107480_000007_000001	train-clean-360	I am delighted to have you show your nerve now and then but please don t take any serious chances 
none	none	If mister de Pelt ever recognizes you and he dines here next Wednesday you ll get us both into awful trouble 
479_107480_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Again I laughed 
none	none	He won t said I with a conviction born of experience His geniality was of the kind that leaves the mind a blank the following morning I don t believe mister de Pelt remembers now that he was at the Rockerbilts last night and even if he does you know that I was in this house at eleven o clock
479_107480_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 I Bunny 
479_107480_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Why I haven t seen you since dinner she demurred 
none	none	Nevertheless Henriette you know that I was in the house at eleven o clock last night or rather you will know it if you are ever questioned on the subject which you won t be said I So now that I have shown you in just what shape my nerve is what is the demand you are going to put upon it You will have to bring to the enterprise all that ability which used to characterize your efforts as an amateur actor Bunny she replied Summon all your sang froid to your aid act with deliberation courtesy and above all without the slightest manifestation of nervousness and we should win not a petty little twenty seven hundred dollars but as many thousands 
479_107480_000011_000001	train-clean-360	You know missus Gushington Andrews 
479_107480_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said I She is the lady who asked me for the olives at your last dinner 
none	none	Precisely observed Henriette
479_107480_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 You possibly observed also that wherever she goes she wears about sixty nine yards of pearl rope upon her person 
479_107480_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Rope I laughed 
479_107480_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 I shouldn t call that rope 
479_107480_000014_000002	train-clean-360	Cable yes frankly when she came into the dining room the other night I thought it was a feather boa she had on 
479_107480_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 All pearls Bunny of the finest water said Henriette enthusiastically 
479_107480_000015_000001	train-clean-360	 There isn t one of the thousands that isn t worth anywhere from five hundred to twenty five hundred 
none	none	And I am to land a yard or two of the stuff for you in some mysterious way I demanded How is it to be by kidnapping the lady the snatch and run game or how
479_107480_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Sarcasm does not suit your complexion Bunny retorted Henriette Your best method is to follow implicitly the directions of wiser brains 
479_107480_000017_000001	train-clean-360	You are a first class tool but as a principal well well never mind 
479_107480_000017_000002	train-clean-360	You do what I tell you and some of those pearls will be ours 
none	none	missus Gushington Andrews as you may have noticed is one of those exceedingly effusive ladies who go into ecstasies over everything and everybody She is what Raffles used to call a palaverer 
479_107480_000017_000005	train-clean-360	Where most people nod she describes a complete circle with her head 
479_107480_000017_000006	train-clean-360	When a cold formal handshake is necessary she perpetrates an embrace and that is where we come in 
479_107480_000017_000007	train-clean-360	At my next Tuesday tea she will be present 
479_107480_000017_000008	train-clean-360	She will wear her pearls she ll be strung with them from head to foot 
479_107480_000017_000009	train-clean-360	A rope walk won t be in it with her and every single little jewel will be worth a small fortune 
479_107480_000017_000010	train-clean-360	You Bunny will be in the room to announce her when she arrives 
none	none	She will rush to my arms throw her own about my neck the ornaments of my corsage will catch the rope at two or more points sever the thread in several places pearls will rain down upon the floor by dozens and then I m to snatch em and dive through the window eh I interrupted
479_107480_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 No Bunny you will behave like a gentleman that is all she responded haughtily or rather like a butler with the instincts of a gentleman 
479_107480_000019_000001	train-clean-360	At my cry of dismay over the accident 
479_107480_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Better call it the incident I put in 
479_107480_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Hush 
479_107480_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Hush 
none	none	At my cry of dismay over the accident Henriette repeated you will spring forward go down upon your knees and gather up the jewels by the handful You will pour them back into missus Gushington Andrews s hands and retire Now do you see H m yes said I But how do you get the pearls if I pour them back into her hands Am I to slide some of them under the rugs or flick them with my thumb nail under the piano or what
479_107480_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothing of the sort Bunny just do as I tell you only bring your gloves to me just before the guests arrive that is all said Henriette 
479_107480_000023_000001	train-clean-360	 Instinct will carry you through the rest of it 
479_107480_000024_000000	train-clean-360	And then the conspiracy stopped for the moment 
479_107480_000025_000000	train-clean-360	The following Tuesday at five the second of missus Van Raffles s Tuesday afternoons began 
479_107480_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Fortune favored us in that it was a beautiful day and the number of guests was large 
479_107480_000025_000002	train-clean-360	Henriette was charming in her new gown specially imported from Paris a gown of Oriental design with row upon row of brilliantly shining crescent shaped ornaments firmly affixed to the front of it and every one of them as sharp as a steel knife 
479_107480_000025_000003	train-clean-360	I could see at a glance that even if so little as one of these fastened its talons upon the pearl rope of missus Gushington Andrews nothing under heaven could save it from laceration 
479_107480_000026_000000	train-clean-360	What a marvellous mind there lay behind those exquisite childlike eyes of the wonderful Henriette 
479_107480_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Remember Bunny calm deliberation your gloves now were her last words to me 
none	none	Count on me Henriette but I still don t see I began Hush 
479_107480_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Just watch me she replied 
none	none	Whereupon this wonderful creature taking my white gloves deliberately smeared their palms and inner sides of the fingers with a milk hued paste of her own making composed of talcum powder and liquid honey Nothing more innocent appearing yet more villainously sticky have I ever before encountered
479_107480_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 There she said and at last I understood 
479_107480_000032_000000	train-clean-360	An hour later our victim arrived and scarce an inch of her but shone like a snow clad hill with the pearls she wore 
none	none	I stood at the portiere and announced missus Gushington Andrews in my most blase but butlerian tones The lady fairly rushed by me and in a moment her arms were about Henriette s neck
479_107480_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 You dear sweet thing cried missus Gushington Andrews 
none	none	And you look so exquisitely charming to day Illustration AND THEN THERE CAME A RIPPING SOUND And then there came a ripping sound The two women started to draw away from each other five of the crescents catching in the rope in the impulsive jerking back of missus Gushington Andrews in order that she might gaze into Henrietta s eyes cut through the marvellous cords of the exquisite jewels 
479_107480_000035_000002	train-clean-360	There was a cry of dismay both from Henriette and her guest and the rug beneath their feet was simply white with riches In a moment I was upon my knees scooping them up by the handful 
none	none	Oh dear how very unfortunate cried Henriette
479_107480_000036_000001	train-clean-360	 Here dear she added holding out a pair of teacups 
none	none	Let James pour them into this and James otherwise myself did so to the extent of five teacups full of them and then he discreetly retired Well Bunny said Henriette breathlessly two hours later when her last guest had gone
479_107480_000037_000001	train-clean-360	 Tell me quickly what was the result 
479_107480_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 These madam said I handing her a small plush bag into which I had poured the salvage taken from my sticky palms 
none	none	A good afternoon s work I added 
479_107480_000039_000000	train-clean-360	And egad it was seventeen pearls of a value of twelve hundred dollars each fifteen worth scarcely less than nine hundred dollars apiece and some twenty seven or eight smaller ones that we held to be worth in the neighborhood of five hundred dollars each 
479_107480_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Splendid cried Henrietta Roughly speaking Bunny we ve pulled in between forty and fifty thousand dollars to day 
none	none	Illustration I OF COURSE DID NOT TELL HENRIETTE OF EIGHT BEAUTIES I HAD KEPT OUT
479_107480_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 About that said I with an inward chuckle for I of course did not tell Henriette of eight beauties I had kept out of the returns for myself 
none	none	But what are we going to do when missus Gushington Andrews finds out that they are gone
479_107480_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 I shall provide for that said this wonderful woman 
none	none	I shall throw her off the scent by sending you over to her at once with sixteen of these assorted I hate to give them up but I think it advisable to pay that much as a sort of insurance against suspicion 
479_107480_000043_000003	train-clean-360	Even then we ll be thirty five thousand dollars to the good 
none	none	And by the way Bunny I want to congratulate you on one thing Ah What s that my sang froid my nerve I asked airily No the size of your hands said Henriette The superficial area of those palms of yours has been worth ten thousand dollars to us to day V THE ADVENTURE OF THE STEEL BONDS Excuse me Henriette said I one morning after I had been in missus Van Raffles s employ for about three months and had begun to calculate as to my share of the profits What are you doing with all this money we are gradually accumulating There must be pretty near a million in hand by this time eh One million two hundred and eighty seven thousand five hundred and twenty eight dollars and thirty six cents replied Henriette instantly It s a tidy little sum Almost enough to retire on I suggested Now Bunny stop that retorted Henriette Either stop it or else retire yourself I am not what they call a quitter in this country and I do not propose at the very height of my career to give up a business which I have struggled for years to establish That is all very well Henriette said I But the pitcher that goes to the bat too often strikes out at last I had become a baseball fiend during my sojourn in the States A million dollars is a pot of money and it s my advice to you to get away with it as soon as you can Excuse me Bunny but when did I ever employ you to give advice demanded Henriette It is quite evident that you don t understand me Do you suppose for an instant that I am robbing these people here in Newport merely for the vulgar purpose of acquiring money If you do you have a woful misconception of the purposes which actuate an artist You certainly are an artist Henriette I answered desirous of placating her Then you should know better than to intimate that I am in this business for the sordid dollars and cents there are to be got out of it pouted my mistress mister Vauxhall Bean doesn t chase the aniseseed bag because he loves to shed the aniseseed or hungers for bags as an article of food He does it for the excitement of the hunt because he loves to feel the movement of the hunter that he sits so well between his knees because he is enamoured of the baying of the hounds the winding of the horn and welcomes the element of personal danger that enters into the sport when he and his charger have to take an unusual fence or an extra broad watercourse So with me In separating these people here from their money and their jewels it is not the money and the jewels that I care for so much as the delicious risks I incur in getting them What the high fence is to the hunter the barriers separating me from missus Gaster s jewel case are to me what the watchful farmer armed with a shot gun for the protection of his crops is to the master of the hounds the police are to me The game of circumventing the latter and surmounting the former are the joy of my life and while my eyes flash and sparkle with appetite every time I see a necklace or a tiara or a roll of hundred dollar bills in the course of my social duties it is not avarice that makes them glitter but the call to action which they sound I felt like saying that if that were the case I should esteem it a privilege to be made permanent custodian of the balance in hand but it was quite evident from Henriette s manner that she was in no mood for badinage so I held my peace To prove to you that I am not out for the money Bunny I ll give you a check this morning for two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to pay you for those steel bonds you picked up on the train when you came up here from New York That s two and a half times what they are worth said Henriette Is it a bargain Certainly ma am I replied delighted with the proposition But what are you going to do with the bonds Borrow a million and a half on em said Henriette What I cried A million and a half on a hundred thousand security Certainly replied Henriette only it will require a little manipulation For the past six months I have been depositing the moneys I have received in seventeen national banks in Ohio each account being opened in a different name The balances in each bank have averaged about three hundred thousand dollars thanks to a circular system of checks in an endless chain that I have devised Naturally the size of these accounts has hugely interested the bank officials and they all regard me as a most desirable customer and I think I can manage matters so that two or three of them anyhow will lend me all the money I want on those bonds and this certificate of trust which I shall ask you to sign Me I laughed Surely you are joking What value will my signature have It will be good as gold after you have deposited that check for two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in your New York bank said Henriette I shall go to the president of the Ohoolihan National Bank at Oshkosh Ohio where I have at present three hundred and sixty eight thousand three hundred and forty three dollars and eighteen cents on deposit and tell him that the honorable John Warrington Bunny of New York is my trustee for an estate of thirteen million dollars in funds set apart for me by a famous relative of mine who is not proud of the connection He will communicate with you and ask you if this is true You will respond by sending him a certified copy of the trust certificate and refer him as to your own responsibility to the New York bank where our two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is on deposit I will then swap checks with you for three hundred thousand dollars mine to you going into your New York account and yours to me as trustee going into my account with the Ohoolihan National The New York bank will naturally speak well of your balance and the Ohoolihan people finding the three hundred thousand dollar check good will never think of questioning your credit This arranged we will start in to wash those steel bonds up to the limit That s a very simple little plan of yours Henriette said I and the first part of it will work easily I have no doubt but how the deuce are you going to wash those bonds up to fifteen times their value Easiest thing in the world Bunny laughed Henriette There will be two million dollars of the bonds before I get through Heavens no counterfeiting I hope I cried Nothing so vulgar said Henriette Just a little management that s all And by the way Bunny when you get a chance please hire twenty safe deposit boxes for me in as many different trust companies here and in New York and don t have em too near together That s all for the present Three weeks later having followed out Henriette s instructions to the letter I received at my New York office a communication from the president of the Ohoolihan National Bank of Oshkosh Ohio inquiring as to the Van Raffles trust fund I replied with a certified copy of the original which Henriette had already placed in the president s hands I incidentally referred the inquirer as to my own standing to the Delancy Trust Company of New York The three hundred thousand dollar checks were exchanged by Henriette and myself hers by the way was on the Seventy Sixth National Bank of Brookline Massachusetts and was signed by a fictitious male name which shows how carefully she had covered her tracks Both went through without question and then the steel bonds came into play Henriette applied for a loan of one million five hundred thousand dollars offering the trust certificate for security The president of the Ohoolihan National wished to see some of her other securities if she had any to which Henriette cordially replied that if he would come to New York she would gladly show them to him and intimated that if the loan went through she wouldn t mind paying the bank a bonus of one hundred thousand dollars for the accommodation The response was immediate mister Bolivar would come on at once and he did Illustration AFTER WHICH HE WILL COME TO NEWPORT Now Bunny said missus Van Raffles on the morning of his arrival all you have to do is to put the one hundred bonds first in the vault of the Amalgamated Trust Company of West Virginia on Wall Street mister Bolivar and I will go there and I will show them to him We will then depart Immediately after our departure you will get the bonds and take them to the vaults of the Trans Missouri and Continental Trust Company of New Jersey on Broadway You will go on foot we in a hansom so that you will get there first I will take mister Bolivar in and show him the bonds again Then you will take them to the vaults of the Riverside Coal Trust Company of Pennsylvania on Broad Street where five minutes later I will show them for the third time to mister Bolivar and so on We will repeat this operation eighteen times in New York so that our visitor will fancy he has seen one million eight hundred thousand dollars worth of bonds in all after which he will come to Newport where I will show them to him twice more making a two million dollar show down See I toppled back into a chair in sheer amazement By Jingo but you are a wonder I cried If it only works Illustration mister BOLIVAR WAS DULY IMPRESSED WITH THE EXTENT OF HENRIETTE S FORTUNE It worked mister Bolivar was duly impressed with the extent of Henriette s fortune in tangible assets not to mention her evident standing in the community of her residence He was charmingly entertained and never for an instant guessed when at dinner where Henriette had no less personages than the Rockerbilts missus Gaster missus Gushington Andrews Tommy Dare and various other social lights to meet him that the butler who passed him his soup and helped him liberally to wine was the honorable John Warrington Bunny trustee Well said Henriette as she gazed delightedly at the president s certified check for one million four hundred thousand dollars the amount of the loan less the bonus that was the best sport yet Even aside from the size of the check Bunny it was great chasing the old man to cover What do you think he said to me when he left the poor dear old innocent Give it up what He said that I ought to be very careful in my dealings with men who might impose upon my simplicity laughed Henriette Simplicity I roared What ever gave him the idea that you were simple Oh I don t know said Henriette demurely I guess it was because I told him I kept those bonds in twenty safe deposit vaults instead of in one to protect myself in case of loss by fire I didn t want to have too many eggs in one basket H m said I What did he say to that Henriette laughed long and loud at the recollection of the aged bank president s reply He squeezed my hand and answered What a child it is indeed said Henriette VI THE ADVENTURE OF THE FRESH AIR FUND It was a bright sunny morning in the early summer when Henriette gazing out of the dining room windows across the lawns adjoining the Rockerbilt place caught sight of a number of ragamuffins at play there Who are those little tatterdemalions Bunny she asked with a suggestion of a frown upon her brow 
6754-107482-0000	train-other-500	They have been playing on the lawns since seven o clock this morning
none	none	 and I ve lost quite two hours sleep because of their chatter They are children from missus Rockerbilt s Fresh Air Society I explained for I too had been annoyed by the loud pranks of the youngsters and had made inquiries as to their identity Every summer Digby mister de Pelt s valet tells me 
6754-107482-0001	train-other-500	missus Rockerbilt gives a tea for the benefit of the Fresh Air Fund
none	none	 and she always has a dozen of the children from town for a week beforehand 
6754-107482-0002	train-other-500	so as to get them in shape for the function Get them in shape for the function Bunny asked Henriette Yes one of the features of the tea is the presence of the youngsters
none	none	 and they have to be pretty well rehearsed before missus Rockerbilt dares let them loose among her guests 
6754-107482-0003	train-other-500	said I for Digby had explained the scheme in detail to me You see their ideas of fun are rather primitive and if they were suddenly introduced into polite society without any previous training
none	none	 the results might prove unpleasant Ah said Henriette gazing abstractedly out of the window in the manner of one suddenly seized with an idea Yes I went on You see the street gamin loves nothing better in the way of diversion than throwing things at somebody particularly if that somebody is what is known to his vernacular as a Willie boy 
6754-107482-0004	train-other-500	As between eating an over ripe peach and throwing it at the pot hat of a Willie boy the ragamuffin would deny even the cravings of his stomach for that tender morsel It is his delight too to heave tin cans wash boilers flat irons pies anything he can lay his hands on
6754-107482-0005	train-other-500	at the automobilly boys if I may use the term of all of which before he is turned loose in the highest social circles of the land it is desirable that he shall be cured I see said Henriette And so missus Rockerbilt has them here on a ten days probation
6754-107482-0006	train-other-500	during which time they acquire that degree of savoir faire and veneer of etiquette which alone makes it possible for her to exhibit them at her tea Precisely said I She lets them sleep in the big box stalls of her stable where the extra coach horses were kept before the motor car craze came in
none	none	 They receive four square meals a day are rubbed down and curry combed before each meal and are bathed night and morning in violet water until the fateful occasion after which they are returned to New York cleaner if not wiser children It is a great charity said Henrietta dreamily Does missus Rockerbilt make any charge for admission to these teas you say they are for the benefit of the Fresh Air Fund Oh no indeed said I It is purely a private charity The youngsters get their ten days in the country learn good manners and Newport society has a pleasant afternoon 
6754-107482-0007	train-other-500	all at missus Rockerbilt s expense
none	none	 H m said Henriette pensively H m 
6754-107482-0008	train-other-500	I think there is a better method Ah I want you to run down to New York for a few days shortly Bunny I have a letter I wish you to mail Nothing more was said on the subject until the following Tuesday
6754-107482-0009	train-other-500	when I was despatched to New York with instructions to organize myself into a Winter Fresh Air Society to have letter heads printed with the names of some of the most prominent ladies in society as patronesses Henriette had secured permission from missus Gaster missus Sloyd Jinks missus Rockerbilt
6754-107482-0010	train-other-500	missus Gushington Andrews missus R U Innitt the duchess of Snarleyow missus Willie K Van Pelt and numerous others to use their names in connection with the new enterprise and to write her a letter asking if she would not interest herself and her friends in the needs of the new society
6754-107482-0011	train-other-500	It is quite as important the letter ran that there should be a fund to take the little sufferers of our dreadful winters away from the sleet and snow burdened streets of the freezing city as it is to give them their summer outing
6754-107482-0012	train-other-500	This society is in great need of twenty five thousand dollars properly to prosecute its work during the coming winter and we appeal to you for aid Henriette s personal response to this request was a check for ten thousand dollars
6754-107482-0013	train-other-500	which as secretary and treasurer of the fund I acknowledged and then of course returned to her whereupon her campaign began in earnest Her own enthusiasm for the project backed up by her most generous contribution proved contagious and inside of two weeks not counting Henriette s check
6754-107482-0014	train-other-500	we were in possession of over seventeen thousand dollars one lady going so far as to give us all her bridge winnings for a week And now for the grand coup Bunny said missus Van Raffles when I had returned with the spoil Great Scot I cried Haven t you got enough
6754-107482-0015	train-other-500	No Bunny Not a quarter enough she replied These winter resorts are very expensive places and while seventeen thousand dollars would do very nicely for running a farm in summer we shall need quite a hundred thousand to send our beneficiaries to Palm Beach in proper style
none	none	 Phe e w I whistled in amazement 
6754-107482-0016	train-other-500	Palm Beach eh Yes said Henriette Palm Beach I have always wanted to go there And the one hundred thousand dollars
none	none	 how do you propose to get that I demanded 
6754-107482-0017	train-other-500	I shall give a lawn fete and bazaar for the benefit of the fund It will differ from missus Rockerbilt s tea in that I shall charge ten dollars admission ten dollars to get out and we shall sell things besides
6754-107482-0018	train-other-500	I have already spoken to missus Gaster about it and she is delighted with the idea She has promised to stock the flower table with the cream of her conservatories missus Rockerbilt has volunteered to take charge of the refreshments
none	none	 The duchess of Snarleyow is dressing a doll that is to be named by Senator Defew 
6754-107482-0019	train-other-500	and raffled at five dollars a guess
none	none	 missus Gushington Andrews is to take entire control of the fancy knick knack table 
6754-107482-0020	train-other-500	where we shall sell gold match boxes solid silver automobile head lights cigar cutters cocktail shakers and other necessities of life among the select I don t see how the thing can fail do you Not so far said I
6754-107482-0021	train-other-500	Each of the twelve lady patronesses has promised to be responsible for the sale of a hundred tickets of admission at ten dollars apiece that makes twelve thousand dollars in admissions It will cost each person ten dollars more to get out which if only half of the tickets are used will be six thousand dollars or
none	none	 eighteen thousand dollars in entrance and exit fees alone Henriette I cried enthusiastically Madam Humbert was an amateur alongside of you missus Van Raffles smiled Thank you Bunny said she If I d only been a man 
6754-107482-0022	train-other-500	Gad I ejaculated Wall Street would have been an infant in your hands Well the fateful day came Henriette to do her justice had herself spared no pains or expense to make the thing a success I doubt if the gardens of the Constant Scrappes ever looked so beautiful
6754-107482-0023	train-other-500	There were flowers everywhere and hanging from tree to tree from one end of their twenty acres to the other were long and graceful garlands of multicolored electric lights that when night came down upon the fete made the scene appear like a veritable glimpse of fairyland
none	none	 Everybody that is anybody was there with a multitude of others 
6754-107482-0024	train-other-500	who may always be counted upon to pay well to see their names in print or to get a view of society at close range Of course there was music of an entrancing sort the numbers being especially designed to touch the flintiest of hearts and Henriette was everywhere No one great or small
6754-107482-0025	train-other-500	in that vast gathering but received one of her gracious smiles and it is no exaggeration to say that half of the flowers purchased at rates that would make a Fifth Avenue tailor hang his head in shame were bought by the gallant gentlemen of Newport
none	none	 for presentation to the hostess of the day 
6754-107482-0026	train-other-500	These were immediately placed on sale again so that on the flower account the receipts were perceptibly swelled A more festal occasion has never been known even in this festal environment The richest of the land vied with one another in making the affair a vast financial success
6754-107482-0027	train-other-500	The ever gallant Tommy Dare left the scene twenty times for the mere privilege of paying his way in and out that many times over at ten dollars each way The doll which Senator Defew had named was also the cause of much merriment
6754-107482-0028	train-other-500	since when all was over and some thirteen thousand five hundred dollars had been taken in for guesses it was found that the senator had forgotten the name he had given it When the laughter over this incident had subsided
none	none	 Henriette suggested that it be put up at auction 
6754-107482-0029	train-other-500	which plan was immediately followed out with the result that the handiwork of the duchess of Snarleyow was knocked down for eight thousand six hundred and seventy five dollars to a Cincinnati brewer who had been trying for eight years to get his name
none	none	 into the Social Register 
6754-107482-0030	train-other-500	Thank goodness that s over said Henriette when the last guest had gone and the lights were out It has been a very delightful affair but towards the end it began to get on my nerves I am really appalled Bunny at the amount of money we have taken in
6754-107482-0031	train-other-500	Did you get the full one hundred thousand dollars I asked Full hundred thousand she cried hysterically Listen to this And she read the following memorandum of the day s receipts Flower Table thirty six thousand dollars Doll
none	none	 twenty two thousand one hundred seventy five point zero Admissions nineteen thousand two hundred sixty point zero Exits seventeen thousand five hundred point zero Candy Table twelve thousand three hundred fifty point zero Supper Table forty three thousand sixty point zero Knick Knacks seventeen thousand three hundred eighty point zero Book Table one hundred twenty three point thirty Coat Checks three thousand three hundred forty point zero Total one hundred seventy one thousand one hundred eighty eight dollars thirty cents 
6754-107482-0032	train-other-500	Great Heavens what a haul I cried But how much did you spend yourself Oh about twenty thousand dollars Bunny I really felt I could afford it We ll net not less than one hundred and fifty thousand I was suddenly seized with a chill
6754-107482-0033	train-other-500	The thing scares me Henriette I murmured
none	none	 Suppose these people ask you next winter for a report 
6754-107482-0034	train-other-500	Oh laughed Henriette I shall immediately turn the money over to the fund You can send me a receipt and that will let us out
none	none	 Later on you can return the money to me 
6754-107482-0035	train-other-500	Even then I began Tush Bunny said she There isn t going to be any even then Six months from now these people will have forgotten all about
none	none	 it It s a little way they have 
6754-107482-0036	train-other-500	Their memory for faces and the money they spend is shorter than the purse of a bankrupt Have no fear And as usual Henriette was right for the next February when the beneficiaries of the Winter Fresh Air Fund spent a month at Palm Beach
6754-107482-0037	train-other-500	enjoying the best that favored spot afforded in the way of entertainment and diversion not a word of criticism was advanced by anybody although the party consisted solely of missus Van Raffles her maid and Bunny her butler In fact the contrary was the truth
6754-107482-0038	train-other-500	The people we met while there many of whom had contributed most largely to the fund welcomed us with open arms little suspecting how intimately connected they were with our sources of supply missus Gaster it is true
none	none	 did ask Henriette how the Winter Fresh Air Fund was doing and was told the truth 
6754-107482-0039	train-other-500	that it was doing very well The beneficiaries did very well here said Henriette I have seen nothing of them observed missus Gaster Well no said Henriette The managers thought it was better to send them here before the season was at its height
7739_107483_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 no said Henriette 
none	none	The managers thought it was better to send them here before the season was at its height 
6754-107482-0040	train-other-500	The moral influences of Palm Beach at the top of the season are well a trifle strong for the young don t you think she explained The tin type I hand you will give you some idea of how much one of the beneficiaries enjoyed himself
none	none	 There is nothing finer in the world than surf bathing in winter VII THE ADVENTURE OF missus ROCKERBILT S TIARA 
7739_107483_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Henriette had been unwontedly reserved for a whole week a fact which was beginning to get sadly on my nerves when she broke an almost Sphinxlike silence with the extraordinary remark 
none	none	Bunny I am sorry but I don t see any other way out of it 
7739_107483_000004_000001	train-clean-360	You must get married 
7739_107483_000005_000000	train-clean-360	To say that I was shocked by the observation is putting it mildly 
7739_107483_000005_000001	train-clean-360	As you must by this time have realized yourself there was only one woman in the world that I could possibly bring myself to think fondly of and that woman was none other than Henriette herself 
7739_107483_000005_000002	train-clean-360	I could not believe however that this was at all the notion she had in mind and what little poise I had was completely shattered by the suggestion 
7739_107483_000006_000000	train-clean-360	I drew myself up with dignity however in a moment and answered her 
none	none	Very well dear I said Whenever you are ready I am 
7739_107483_000007_000002	train-clean-360	You must have banked enough by this time to be able to support me in the style to which I am accustomed 
7739_107483_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 That is not what I meant Bunny she retorted coldly frowning at me 
none	none	Well it s what I mean said I You are the only woman I ever loved But Bunny dear that can come later said she with a charming little blush
7739_107483_000010_000001	train-clean-360	 What I meant my dear boy was not a permanent affair but one of these Newport marriages 
7739_107483_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Not necessarily for publication but as a guarantee of good faith she explained 
7739_107483_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t understand said I affecting denseness for I understood only too well 
7739_107483_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Stupid cried Henriette 
none	none	I need a confidential maid Bunny to help us in our business and I don t want to take a third party in at random If you had a wife I could trust her You could stay married as long as we needed her and then following the Newport plan you could get rid of her and marry me later that is er provided I was willing to marry you at all and I am not so sure that I shall not be some day when I am old and toothless
7739_107483_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 I fail to see the necessity for a maid of that kind said I 
7739_107483_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 That s because you are a man Bunny said Henriette 
7739_107483_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 There are splendid opportunities for acquiring the gems these Newport ladies wear by one who may be stationed in the dressing room 
7739_107483_000014_000002	train-clean-360	There is missus Rockerbilt s tiara for instance 
7739_107483_000014_000003	train-clean-360	It is at present the finest thing of its kind in existence and of priceless value 
none	none	When she isn t wearing it it is kept in the vaults of the Tiverton Trust Company and how on earth we are to get it without the assistance of a maid we can trust I don t see except in the vulgar commonplace way of sandbagging the lady and brutally stealing it and Newport society hasn t quite got to the point where you can do a thing like that to a woman without causing talk unless you are married to her
7739_107483_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I ll tell you one thing Henriette I returned with more positiveness than I commonly show I will not marry a lady s maid and that s all there is about it 
7739_107483_000015_000001	train-clean-360	You forget that I am a gentleman 
7739_107483_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 It s only a temporary arrangement Bunny she pleaded 
7739_107483_000016_000001	train-clean-360	 It s done all the time in the smart set 
7739_107483_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Well the morals of the smart set are not my morals I retorted 
none	none	My father was a clergyman Henriette and I m something of a churchman myself and I won t stoop to such baseness 
7739_107483_000017_000002	train-clean-360	Besides what s to prevent my wife from blabbing when we try to ship her 
none	none	H m mused Henriette
7739_107483_000018_000001	train-clean-360	 I hadn t thought of that it would be dangerous wouldn t it 
7739_107483_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Very said I The only safe way out of it would be to kill the young woman and my religious scruples are strongly against anything of the sort 
none	none	You must remember Henriette that there are one or two of the commandments that I hold in too high esteem to break them
7739_107483_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Then what shall we do Bunny demanded missus Van Raffles 
none	none	I must have that tiara Well there s the old amateur theatrical method said I Have a little play here reproduce missus Rockerbilt s tiara in paste for one of the characters to wear substitute the spurious for the real and there you are
7739_107483_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 That is a good idea said Henriette only I hate amateur theatricals I ll think it over 
none	none	A few days later my mistress summoned me again Bunny you used to make fairly good sketches didn t you she asked
7739_107483_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Pretty good said I Chiefly architectural drawings however details of facades and ornamental designs 
7739_107483_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Just the thing cried Henriette 
none	none	To night missus Rockerbilt gives a moonlight reception on her lawns 
7739_107483_000026_000002	train-clean-360	They adjoin ours 
7739_107483_000026_000003	train-clean-360	She will wear her tiara and I want you when she is in the gardens to hide behind some convenient bit of shrubbery and make an exact detail sketch of the tiara 
none	none	Understand
7739_107483_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 I do said I 
none	none	Don t you miss a ruby or a diamond or the teeniest bit of filigree Bunny 
7739_107483_000028_000001	train-clean-360	Get the whole thing to a carat she commanded 
7739_107483_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 And then I asked excitedly 
7739_107483_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Bring it to me I ll attend to the rest said she 
none	none	Illustration IT WAS NOT ALWAYS EASY TO GET THE RIGHT LIGHT You may be sure that when night came I went at the work in hand with alacrity It was not always easy to get the right light on the lady s tiara but in several different quarters of the garden I got her sufficiently well though unconsciously posed to accomplish my purpose Once I nearly yielded to the temptation to reach my hand through the shrubbery and snatch the superb ornament from missus Rockerbilt s head for she was quite close enough to make this possible but the vulgarity of such an operation was so very evident that I put it aside almost as soon as thought of 
7739_107483_000032_000002	train-clean-360	And I have always remembered dear old Raffles s remark Take everything in sight Bunny he used to say but damn it do it like a gentleman not a professional 
none	none	The sketch made I took it to my room and colored it so that that night when Henriette returned I had ready for her a perfect pictorial representation of the much coveted bauble
7739_107483_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 It is simply perfect Bunny she cried delightedly as she looked at it 
7739_107483_000034_000001	train-clean-360	 You have even got the sparkle of that incomparable ruby in the front 
7739_107483_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Next morning we went to New York and Henriette taking my design to a theatrical property man we knew on Union Square left an order for its exact reproduction in gilt and paste 
7739_107483_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 I am going to a little fancy dress dance mister Sikes she explained as Queen Catharine of Russia and this tiara is a copy of the very famous lost negligee crown of that unhappy queen 
7739_107483_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Do you think you can let me have it by Tuesday next 
7739_107483_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Easily madam said Sikes 
7739_107483_000037_000001	train-clean-360	 It is a beautiful thing and it will give me real pleasure to reproduce it 
none	none	I ll guarantee it will be so like the original that the queen herself couldn t tell em apart 
7739_107483_000037_000003	train-clean-360	It will cost you forty eight dollars 
7739_107483_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Agreed said Henriette 
7739_107483_000039_000000	train-clean-360	And Sikes was true to his word 
7739_107483_000039_000001	train-clean-360	The following Tuesday afternoon brought to my New York apartment for of course missus Raffles did not give Sikes her right name an absolutely faultless copy of missus Rockerbilt s chiefest glory 
7739_107483_000039_000002	train-clean-360	It was so like that none but an expert in gems could have told the copy from the original and when I bore the package back to Newport and displayed its contents to my mistress she flew into an ecstasy of delight 
7739_107483_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 We ll have the original in a week if you keep your nerve Bunny she cried 
7739_107483_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Theatricals said I 
7739_107483_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 No indeed said Henriette 
none	none	If missus Rockerbilt knew this copy was in existence she d never wear the other in public again as long as she lived without bringing a dozen detectives along with her 
7739_107483_000042_000002	train-clean-360	No indeed a dinner 
none	none	I want you to connect the electric lights of the dining room with the push button at my foot so that at any moment I can throw the dining room into darkness 
7739_107483_000042_000004	train-clean-360	missus Rockerbilt will sit at my left Tommy Dare to the right 
none	none	She will wear her famous coiffure surmounted by the tiara 
7739_107483_000042_000006	train-clean-360	At the moment you are passing the poisson I will throw the room into darkness and you 
none	none	I positively decline Henriette to substitute one tiara for another in the dark 
7739_107483_000043_000001	train-clean-360	Why darn it all she d scream the minute I tried it I protested 
none	none	Of course she would said she impatiently And that is why I don t propose any such idiotic performance You will merely stumble in the dark and manage your elbow so awkwardly that missus Rockerbilt s coiffure will be entirely disarranged by it She will scream of course and I will instantly restore the light after which I will attend to the substitution Now don t fail me and the tiara will be ours Illustration ALL WAS AS HENRIETTE HAD FORETOLD I stand ready with affidavits to prove that that dinner was the most exciting affair of my life At one time it seemed to me that I could not possibly perform my share of the conspiracy without detection but a glance at Henriette sitting calmly and coolly and beautiful too by gad at the head of the table chatting as affably with the duke of Snarleyow and Tommy Dare as though there was nothing in the wind nerved me to action The moment came and instantly as I leaned over missus Rockerbilt s side with the fish platter in my hand out went the light crash went my elbow into the lady s stunning coiffure her little well modulated scream of surprise rent the air and flash back came the lights again 
7739_107483_000046_000003	train-clean-360	All was as Henriette had foretold missus Rockerbilt s lovely blond locks were frightfully demoralized and the famous tiara with it had slid aslant athwart her cheek 
7739_107483_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Dear me cried Henriette rising hurriedly and full of warm sympathy How very awkward 
7739_107483_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh don t speak of it laughed missus Rockerbilt amiably 
7739_107483_000048_000001	train-clean-360	 It is nothing dear missus Van Raffles 
7739_107483_000048_000002	train-clean-360	These electric lights are so very uncertain these days and I am sure James is not at all to blame for hitting me as he has done it s the most natural thing in the world only may I please run up stairs and fix my hair again 
none	none	You most certainly shall said Henriette And I will go with you my dear Emily I am so mortified that if you will let me do penance in that way I will myself restore order out of this lovely chaos The little speech was received with the usual hilarious appreciation which follows anything out of the usual course of events in high social circles 
7739_107483_000050_000001	train-clean-360	Tommy Dare gave three cheers for missus Van Raffles and missus Gramercy Van Pelt clad in a gorgeous red costume stood up on a chair and toasted me in a bumper of champagne 
7739_107483_000050_000002	train-clean-360	Meanwhile Henriette and missus Rockerbilt had gone above 
7739_107483_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Isn t it a beauty Bunny said Henriette the next morning as she held up the tiara to my admiring gaze a flashing coruscating bit of the jeweler s art that I verily believe would have tempted the soul of honor itself into rascally ways 
7739_107483_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Magnificent I asserted 
7739_107483_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 But which is this the forty eight dollar one or the original 
7739_107483_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 The original said Henriette caressing the bauble 
none	none	You see when we got to my room last night and I had missus Rockerbilt sitting before the mirror and despite her protestations was fixing her dishevelled locks with my own fair hands I arranged to have the lights go out again just as the tiara was laid on the dressing table 
7739_107483_000053_000002	train-clean-360	The copy was in the table drawer and while my right hand was apparently engaged in manipulating the refractory light and my voice was laughingly calling down maledictions upon the electric lighting company for its wretched service my left hand was occupied with the busiest effort of its career in substituting the spurious tiara for the other 
7739_107483_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 And missus Rockerbilt never even suspected 
none	none	No said Henriette
7739_107483_000055_000001	train-clean-360	 In fact she placed the bogus affair in her hair herself 
none	none	As far as her knowledge goes I never even touched the original
7739_107483_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Well you re a wonder Henriette said I with a sigh 
none	none	Still if missus Rockerbilt should ever discover
7739_107483_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 She won t Bunny said Henriette 
7739_107483_000057_000001	train-clean-360	 She ll never have occasion to test the genuineness of her tiara 
none	none	These Newport people have other sources of income than the vulgar pawnshops 
7739_107483_000058_000000	train-clean-360	But alas later on Henriette made a discovery herself that for the time being turned her eyes red with weeping 
7739_107483_000058_000001	train-clean-360	The Rockerbilt tiara itself was as bogus as our own copy 
7739_107483_000058_000002	train-clean-360	There wasn t a real stone in the whole outfit and the worst part of it was that under the circumstances Henriette could not tell anybody over the teacups that missus Rockerbilt was in vulgar parlance putting up a shine on high society 
none	none	VIII THE ADVENTURE OF THE CARNEGIE LIBRARY 
6754-107484-0000	train-other-500	Merciful Midas Bunny said Henriette one morning as I was removing the breakfast tray from her apartment Did you see the extent of mister Carnegie s benefactions in the published list this morning I have not received my paper yet said I Moreover
6754-107484-0001	train-other-500	I doubt if it will contain any reference to such matters when it does come
none	none	 You know I read only the London Times missus Van Raffles I haven t been able to go the American newspapers More fool you then Bunny laughed my mistress Any man who wants to pursue crime as a polite diversion and does not read the American newspapers fails to avail himself of one of the most potent instruments for the attainment of the highest artistic results 
6754-107484-0002	train-other-500	You cannot pick up a newspaper in any part of the land without discovering somewhere in its columns some reference to a new variety of house breaking some new and highly artistic method of writing another man s autograph so that when appended to a check and presented at his bank it will bear the closest scrutiny to which the paying teller will subject it
6754-107484-0003	train-other-500	some truly Napoleonic method of entirely novel design for the sudden parting of the rich from their possessions
none	none	 Any university which attempted to add a School of Peculation to its curriculum and ignored the daily papers as a positive source of inspiration to the highest artistry in the profession 
6754-107484-0004	train-other-500	would fail as ignobly as though it should forget to teach the fundamental principles of high finance I was not aware of their proficiency in that direction said I
none	none	 You never will get on Bunny sighed Henriette 
6754-107484-0005	train-other-500	because you are not quick to seize opportunities that lie directly under your nose How do you suppose I first learned of all this graft at Newport Why by reading the newspaper accounts of their jewels in the Sunday and daily newspapers
none	none	 How do I know that if I want to sand bag mister Rockerbilt and rifle his pockets all I have to do is to station myself outside the Crackerbaker Club any dark opera night after twelve and catch him on his way home with his fortune sticking out all over him Because the newspapers tell me that he is a regular habitue of the Crackerbaker 
6754-107484-0006	train-other-500	and plays bridge there every night after the opera How do I know just how to walk from my hall bedroom in my little East Side tenement up Fifth Avenue into missus Gaster s dining room
none	none	 where she has a million in plate on her buffet with my eyes shut without fear of stumbling over a step or a chair or even a footstool Because the newspapers have so repeatedly printed diagrams of the interior of the lady s residence that its halls passages doorways exits twists turns and culs de sac are indelibly engraved upon my mind How did I acquire my wonderful knowledge of the exact number of pearls rubies diamonds opals tiaras bracelets necklaces stomachers and other gorgeous jewels now in the possession of the smart set 
6754-107484-0007	train-other-500	Only by an assiduous devotion to the contents of the daily newspapers in their reports of the doings of the socially elect I have a scrap book Bunny
none	none	 that has been two years in the making and there hasn t been a novel burglary reported in all that time that is not recorded in my book 
6754-107484-0008	train-other-500	not a gem that has appeared at the opera the theatre the Charity Ball the Horse Show
none	none	 or a monkey dinner that has not been duly noted in this vademecum of mine 
6754-107484-0009	train-other-500	fully described and in a sense located If it wasn t for that knowledge I could not hope for success any more than you could if you went hunting mountain lions in the Desert of Sahara or tried to lure speckled trout from the depths of an empty goldfish globe I see said I meekly
6754-107484-0010	train-other-500	I have missed a great opportunity I will subscribe to the Tribune and Evening Post right away
none	none	 I have never understood why Henriette greeted this observation 
6754-107484-0011	train-other-500	with a peal of silvery laughter that fairly made the welkin ring
none	none	 All I know is that it so irritated me that I left the room to keep from making a retort that might seriously have disturbed our friendship Later in the day missus Van Raffles rang for me and I attended upon her orders Bunny said she I ve made up my mind to it 
6754-107484-0012	train-other-500	I must have a Carnegie library that is all there is about it and you must help The iron master has already spent thirty nine million dollars on that sort of thing and I don t see why if other people can get em we can t
6754-107484-0013	train-other-500	Possibly because we are not a city town or hamlet I suggested for I had been looking over the daily papers since my morning s talk with the lady and had observed just who had been the beneficiaries of mister Carnegie s benefactions He don t give em to individuals but to communities
6754-107484-0014	train-other-500	Of course not she responded quickly But what is to prevent our becoming a municipality My answer was an amazed silence for frankly I could not for the life of me guess how we were to do any such thing It s the easiest thing in the world she continued
none	none	 All you have to do is to buy an abandoned farm on Long Island with a bleak sea front divide it up into corner lots 
6754-107484-0015	train-other-500	advertise the lots for sale on the instalment plan elect your mayor and Raffleshurst by the Sea swept by ocean breezes fifteen cents from the Battery is a living breathing reality By the jumping Disraeli Henriette but you are a marvel I cried with enthusiasm
6754-107484-0016	train-other-500	But I added my ardor cooling a little won t it cost money About fifteen hundred dollars said Henriette I can win that at bridge in an hour Well said I you know you can command my services Henriette What shall I do
6754-107484-0017	train-other-500	Organize the city she replied Here is fifty dollars
none	none	 That will do for a starter 
6754-107484-0018	train-other-500	Go down to Long Island buy the farm put up a few signs calling on people to own their own homes advertise the place in big capital letters in the Sunday papers as likely to be the port of the future consider yourself duly elected mayor
6754-107484-0019	train-other-500	stop in at some photograph shop in New York on your way back and get a few dozen pictures of street scenes in Binghamton Oberlin Kalamazoo and other well populated cities and then come back here for further instructions Meanwhile I will work out the other details of the scheme According to my habit
none	none	 I followed Henriette s instructions to the letter A farm of five hundred acres was secured within a week the bleakest coldest spot ever swept by ocean breezes anywhere It cost six hundred dollars in cash with immediate possession Three days later with the use of a ruler 
6754-107484-0020	train-other-500	I had mapped out about twelve thousand corner lots on the thing and thanks to my knack at draughtsmanship
none	none	 had all ready for anybody s inspection as fine a ground plan of Raffleshurst by the Sea as ever was got up by a land booming company 
6754-107484-0021	train-other-500	in this or any other country I then secured the photographs desired by my mistress
none	none	 advertised Raffleshurst in three Sunday newspapers to the tune of a half page each and returned to Newport I flattered myself that the thing was well done for on reading the advertisement 
6754-107484-0022	train-other-500	nothing would do but that Henriette should visit the place in person The ads were so phrased she said as to be irresistible
none	none	 It s fine Bunny she cried with an enthusiastic laugh as she gazed out over the broad acres of Raffleshurst 
6754-107484-0023	train-other-500	and noted how well I had fulfilled her orders Under proper direction you are a most able workman Nothing could be better Nothing absolutely nothing And now for mister Carnegie I still did not see how the thing was coming out
6754-107484-0024	train-other-500	but such was my confidence in my leader that I had no misgivings Here is a letter from missus Gaster
none	none	 introducing the honorable Henry Higginbotham 
6754-107484-0025	train-other-500	mayor of Raffleshurst to mister Carnegie said Henriette You will call at once on the iron master
none	none	 Present this letter keeping in mind of course that you are yourself the honorable Henry Higginbotham 
6754-107484-0026	train-other-500	Show him these photographs of the City Hall at Binghamton
none	none	 of the public park at Oberlin the high school at Oswego the battery walk at Charleston and other public improvements of various other cities when he asks you what sort of a place Raffleshurst is 
6754-107484-0027	train-other-500	then frankly and fearlessly put in your application for a one hundred and fifty thousand dollar library One picture this beautiful photograph of the music hall at the saint Louis Exhibition you must seem to overlook always
none	none	 only contrive matters so that he will inquire what it is You must then modestly remark that it is nothing but a little two hundred thousand dollar art gallery you have yourself presented to the town See H m yes I see said I But it is pretty risky business Henriette 
6754-107484-0028	train-other-500	Suppose missus Gaster asks for further information about Mayor Higginbotham
none	none	 I think it was unwise of you to connect her with the enterprise Don t bother about that Bunny I wrote that letter of introduction 
6754-107484-0029	train-other-500	I haven t studied penmanship for nothing you know missus Gaster will never know So just put on your boldest front remember your name and don t forget to be modest about your own two hundred thousand dollar art gallery
none	none	 That will inspire him I think It took me a week to get at the iron master but finally thanks to missus Gaster s letter of introduction I succeeded mister Carnegie was as always in a most amiable frame of mind and received me cordially even when he discovered my real business with him Illustration IF YOU WANTED A LAKE mister HIGGINBOTHAM I I hadn t intended to give any more libraries this year he said as he glanced over the pictures I am giving away lakes now he added If you wanted a lake mister Higginbotham I We have such a large water front already mister Carnegie said I and most of our residents are young married couples with children not over three and five I am afraid they would regard a lake as a source of danger That s a pretty playground he suggested glancing at the Oberlin Park Somehow or other it reminds me of something I thought it quite likely but of course I didn t say so I may be a fool but I have some tact It s at the far corner of the park that we propose to put the library if you are good enough to let us have it was all I ventured H m he mused Well do you know I like to help people who help themselves that s my system I assured him that we of Raffleshurst 
6754-107484-0030	train-other-500	were accustomed to helping ourselves to everything we could lay our hands on
none	none	 a jest which even though it was only too true 
6754-107484-0031	train-other-500	seemed to strike him pleasantly What is that handsome structure you always pass over he asked as I contrived to push the music hall photograph aside for the fifth time I laughed deprecatingly Oh that I said modestly
none	none	 that s only a little two hundred thousand dollar music hall and art gallery I have built for the town myself Oh that wonderful Henriette How did she know that generosity even among the overgenerous was infectious Indeed said mister Carnegie 
6754-107484-0032	train-other-500	his face lighting up with real pleasure Well mister Higginbotham I guess I guess I ll do it I can t be outdone in generosity by you sir and er
none	none	 I guess you can count on the library Do you think one hundred and fifty thousand dollars will be enough 
6754-107484-0033	train-other-500	Well of course I began
none	none	 Why not make my contribution equal to 
6754-107484-0034	train-other-500	yours and call it an even two hundred thousand dollars he interrupted You overwhelm me said I Of course if you wish to And the Raffleshurst common council will appropriate five per cent of that amount annually for its maintenance he inquired
6754-107484-0035	train-other-500	Such a resolution has already been passed said I taking a paper from my pocket Here is the ordinance
none	none	 duly signed by myself as mayor and by the secretary of the council 
6754-107484-0036	train-other-500	Again that extraordinary woman to provide me with so necessary a document The millionaire rose with alacrity and with his own hand drew me the required check mister Mayor said he I like the quick business like way in which you do things
6754-107484-0037	train-other-500	Pray present my compliments to the citizens of Raffleshurst by the Sea and tell them I am only too glad to help them If you ever want a lake sir don t fail to call upon me With which gracious words the millionaire bowed me out
6754-107484-0038	train-other-500	Two hundred thousand dollars Bunny cried Henriette when I handed her the check Yep said I Well that is a good day s sport she said gazing at the slip Twice as much as I expected Yes said I
6754-107484-0039	train-other-500	But see here Henrietta suppose mister Carnegie should go down to Raffleshurst to see the new building
none	none	 and find out what a bunco game we have played on him He s not likely to do that for two reasons Bunny she replied 
6754-107484-0040	train-other-500	In the first place he suffers acutely from lumbago in winter and can t travel and in the second place he d have to find Raffleshurst by the Sea before he could make the discovery that somebody d put up a game on him I think by the time he is ready to start we can arrange matters to have Raffleshurst taken off the map
6754-107484-0041	train-other-500	Well I think this is the cleverest trick you ve turned yet Henriette said I
none	none	 Nonsense Bunny nonsense she replied Any idiot can get a Carnegie library these days That s why I put you on the job dear she added affectionately IX THE ADVENTURE OF THE HOLD UP 
6754-107485-0000	train-other-500	Now that it is all over I do not know whether she was really worn out
none	none	 or by the expert use of powder gave to her cheeks the pallid look which bore out missus Van Raffles s statement to me that she needed a rest 
6754-107485-0001	train-other-500	At any rate one morning in mid August when the Newport season was in full feather
none	none	 Henriette looking very pale and wan tearfully confessed to me that business had got on her nerves and that she was going away to a rest cure on the Hudson for ten days 
6754-107485-0002	train-other-500	I just can t stand it for another minute Bunny she faltered real tears coursing down her cheeks I haven t slept a wink of natural sleep for five days and yet when night comes it is all I can do to keep my eyes open
6754-107485-0003	train-other-500	At the Rockerbilt ball last night I dozed off four times while talking with the Duchess of Snarleyow and when the Chinese Ambassador asked me to sit out the gavotte with him I m told I actually snored in his face A woman who can t keep awake all night and sleep properly by day is not fit for Newport society
none	none	 and I ve simply got to go away and get my nerve back again You are very wise I replied and I wholly approve of your course 
6754-107485-0004	train-other-500	There is no use of trying to do too much and you have begun to show the strain to which you have been subjecting yourself Your failure last Friday night to land missus Gollet s ruby dog collar
none	none	 when her French poodle sat in your lap all through the Gaster musicale is evidence to me that your mind is not as alert as usual 
6754-107485-0005	train-other-500	By all means go away and rest up I ll take care of things around here Thank you dear said she with a grateful smile You need a change too Bunny What would you say if I sent all the servants away too
6754-107485-0006	train-other-500	so that you could have a week of absolute tranquillity It must be awful for a man of your refined sensibilities to have to associate so constantly with the housemaids the under butlers and the footmen Nothing would please me better
none	none	 I returned with alacrity 
6754-107485-0007	train-other-500	for to tell the truth society below stairs was rapidly becoming caviar to my taste The housemaids were all right
none	none	 and the under butlers being properly subject to my control 
6754-107485-0008	train-other-500	I could wither when they grew too familiar but the footmen were intolerable guyers On more than one occasion their quick Irish wit had put me to my trumps to maintain my dignity and I had noticed of late that their alleged fun at my expense had made even the parlormaid giggle in a most irritating fashion
none	none	 Henriette s suggestion promised at least a week s immunity from this sort of thing and as far as remaining alone in the beautiful Bolivar Lodge was concerned to a man of my literary and artistic tastes nothing could be more desirable I can put in a week of solitude here very comfortably said I 
6754-107485-0009	train-other-500	The Constant Scrappes have a very excellent library and a line of reading in Abstract Morals in full calf that I should very much like to get at So be it then said Henriette with a sigh of relief I will take my departure next Saturday after the Innitt s clam bake on Honk Island
none	none	 The servants can go Saturday afternoon after the house has been put in order You can order a fresh supply of champagne and cigars for yourself and as for your meals Don t you bother about that said I with a laugh 
6754-107485-0010	train-other-500	I lived for months on the chafing dish before I found you again
none	none	 And I rather think the change from game birds and pate de foie gras to simple eggs and bread and butter will do me good 
6754-107485-0011	train-other-500	And so the matter was arranged The servants were notified that owing to missus Van Raffles s illness they might take a vacation on full pay for ten days and Henriette herself prepared society for her departure by fainting twice at the Innit s clam bake on Honk Island
6754-107485-0012	train-other-500	No less a person than missus Gaster herself brought her home at four o clock in the morning
none	none	 and her last words were an exhortation to her dear missus Van Raffles to be careful of herself 
6754-107485-0013	train-other-500	for all our sakes Saturday morning Henriette departed Saturday afternoon the servants followed suit
none	none	 and I was alone in my glory 
6754-107485-0014	train-other-500	and oh how I revelled in it The beauties of Bolivar Lodge had never so revealed themselves to me as then the house as dark as the tomb without
none	none	 thanks to the closing of the shutters and the drawing to of all the heavy portieres before the windows 
6754-107485-0015	train-other-500	but a blaze of light within from cellar to roof
none	none	 I spent whole hours gloating over the treasures of that Monte Cristan treasure house and all day Sunday and Monday I spent poring over the books in the library 
6754-107485-0016	train-other-500	a marvellous collection though for the most part wholly uncut Everything moved along serenely until Wednesday afternoon when I thought I heard a noise in the cellar
none	none	 but investigation revealed the presence of no one but a stray cat which miaowed up the cellar steps to me in response to my call of Who s there 
6754-107485-0017	train-other-500	True I did not go down to see if any one were there
none	none	 not caring to involve myself in a personal encounter with a chance tramp who might have wandered in in search of food The sudden materialization of the cat satisfactorily explained the noises and I returned to the library to resume my reading of The Origin of the Decalogue 
6754-107485-0018	train-other-500	where I had left off at the moment of the interruption That evening I cooked myself a welsh rabbit
none	none	 and at eight o clock arrayed in my pajamas I returned to the library with a book 
6754-107485-0019	train-other-500	a bottle of champagne and a box of Vencedoras prepared for a quiet evening of absolute luxury I read in the waning light of the dying midsummer day for a little while and then as darkness came on
none	none	 I turned to the switch board to light the electric lamp 
6754-107485-0020	train-other-500	The lamp would not light I pressed and pressed every button in the room but with no better results and then going through the house I tried every other button I could find but everywhere conditions were the same
none	none	 Apparently there was something the matter with the electrical service a fact which I cursed but not deeply for it was a beautiful moonlight night and while of course I was disappointed in my reading 
6754-107485-0021	train-other-500	I realized that after all nothing could be pleasanter than to sit in the moonlight and smoke and quaff bumpers of champagne until the crack of doom
none	none	 This I immediately proceeded to do 
6754-107485-0022	train-other-500	and kept at it pretty steadily until I should say about eleven o clock when I heard unmistakable signs of a large automobile coming up the drive
none	none	 It chugged as far as the front door 
6754-107485-0023	train-other-500	and then stood panting like an impatient steam engine while the chauffeur a person of medium height well muffled in his automobile coat his features concealed behind his goggles and his mouth covered by his collar rapped loudly on the front door once then a second time
none	none	 Who the devil can this be at this hour of the night I wonder I muttered as I responded to the summons 
6754-107485-0024	train-other-500	If I sought the name I was not to be gratified
none	none	 for the moment I opened the door I found two pistols levelled upon me and two very determined eyes peering at me from behind the goggles Not a word or I shoot said the intruder in a gruff voice evidently assumed 
6754-107485-0025	train-other-500	before I could get a word from my already somewhat champagne twisted tongue Lead me to the dining room Well there I was Defenceless taken by surprise unarmed not too wide awake comfortably filled with champagne and in no particularly fighting mood What could I do but yield
none	none	 To call for help would have brought at least two bullets crashing into my brain even if any one could have heard my cries To assault a scoundrel so well armed would have been the height of folly 
6754-107485-0026	train-other-500	and to tell the truth so imbued was I with the politer spirit of the gentle art of house breaking that this sudden confrontation with the ruder rough house methods of the highwayman left me entirely unable to cope with the situation Certainly said I turning and ushering him down the hall
none	none	 to the great dining room where the marvellous plate of the Constant Scrappes shone effulgently upon the sideboard or at least such of it as there was no room for in the massive safe Get me some rope commanded the intruder Still under the range of those dreadful pistols I obeyed Sit down in that chair and by the leaping Gladstone if you move an inch I ll blow your face off feature by feature growled the intruder Who s moving I retorted angrily Well see that whoever else is you are not he retorted winding the rope three times around my waist and fastening me securely to the back of the chair Now hold out your hands I obeyed and he bound them as tightly as though they were fastened together with rods of iron A moment later my feet and knees were similarly bound and I was as fast in the toils as Gulliver when the Liliputians fell upon him in his sleep and bound him to the earth Illustration AS KEEN AND HIGH HANDED A PERFORMANCE AS I EVER WITNESSED And then I was a mute witness to as keen and high handed a performance as I ever witnessed One by one every item of the Constant Scrappe s silver service valued at ninety thousand dollars was removed from the sideboard and taken along the hall and placed in the tonneau of the automobile Next the safe in which lay not only the famous gold service used only at the very swellest functions said to have cost one hundred and seventy five thousand dollars for the gold alone to say nothing of the exquisite workmanship but it made me gnash my teeth in impotent rage to see it Henriette s own jewel box containing a hundred thousand dollars worth of her own gems and some thirty thousand dollars in cash was rifled of its contents and disposed of similarly to the silver in the gaping maw of that damned automobile tonneau Now said the intruder loosening my feet and releasing me from the chair 
6754-107485-0027	train-other-500	take me to my lady s boudoir There is room in the car for a few more objects of virtu I obeyed on the instant
none	none	 and a few moments later the scene of below stairs was repeated with me powerless to resist 
6754-107485-0028	train-other-500	Pictures bric a brac and other things to the tune of twenty thousand dollars more were removed
none	none	 as calmly and as coolly as though there were no law against that sort of thing in the world There cried the highwayman as he returned after the last item of his loot had been stowed away in the vehicle That ll make an interesting tale for Friday morning s papers It s the biggest haul I ve made in forty eight years 
6754-107485-0029	train-other-500	Good night sir When I am safely out of town I ll telegraph the police to come and rescue you from your present awkward position And let me tell you if you give them the slightest hint of my personal appearance by the hopping Harcourt I ll come back and kill you See And with that he made off
none	none	 closing the door behind him and a moment later I heard his infernal automobile chugging down the drive at full speed Twelve hours later in response to a long distance telephone message from New York the police came bounding around to the house and found me tied up and unconscious 
6754-107485-0030	train-other-500	The highwayman had at least been true to his word
none	none	 and as he had prophesied the morning papers on Friday were full of the story of the most daring robbery of the century 
6754-107485-0031	train-other-500	Accurate stories in detail under huge scare type headlines appeared in all the papers
none	none	 narrating the losses of the Constant Scrappes as well as the rape of the jewels and money of missus Van Raffles 
6754-107485-0032	train-other-500	The whole country rang with it and the afternoon train brought not only detectives by the score but the representative of the Constant Scrappes and Henriette herself She was highly hysterical over the loss not only of her own property but that of her landlord as well but nobody blamed me The testimony of the police
6754-107485-0033	train-other-500	as to my condition when found fully substantiated my story and was accepted as ample evidence that I had no criminal connection with the robbery This was a great relief to me but it was greater when Henriette stroked my hand and called me poor old Bunny for I must say
6754-107485-0034	train-other-500	I was worried as to what she would think of me for having proven so poor a guardian of her property Since then months have passed and not a vestige of the stolen property has been recovered The Constant Scrappes bore their loss with equanimity as became them
6754-107485-0035	train-other-500	since no one could have foreseen such a misfortune as overtook them and as for missus Van Raffles she never mentioned the matter again to me save once
none	none	 and that set me to thinking 
6754-107485-0036	train-other-500	He was a clever rascal you say Bunny she asked one morning
none	none	 Yes said I One of the best in the business I fancy 
6754-107485-0037	train-other-500	A big fellow She grinned with a queer smile Oh about your height said I Well
none	none	 by the hopping Harcourt she retorted quizzically 
6754-107485-0038	train-other-500	if you give them the slightest hint of my personal appearance I ll come back and kill you See The man s very words And then she laughed What I cried It was you Was it she returned airily
none	none	 Why the devil you should go to all that trouble 
6754-107485-0039	train-other-500	when you had the stuff right here is what puzzles me said I Oh it wasn t any trouble she replied Just sport you looked so funny sitting up there in your pajamas and besides a material fact such as that hold up is apt to be more convincing to the police
6754-107485-0040	train-other-500	to say nothing of the Constant Scrappes than any mere story we could invent Well you d better be careful Henriette I said with a shiver The detectives are clever True Bunny she answered gravely But you see the highwayman was a man and well I m a woman dear I can prove an alibi
6754-107485-0041	train-other-500	By the way you left the cellar door unlocked that Wednesday
none	none	 I found it open when I sneaked in to cut off the electric lights You mustn t be so careless dear or we may have to divvy up our spoil with others Marvellous woman that Henriette X THE ADVENTURE OF missus SHADD S MUSICALE 
7783_107486_000001_000000	train-clean-360	Henriette was visibly angry the other morning when I took to her the early mail and she discovered that missus Van Varick Shadd had got ahead of her in the matter of Jockobinski the monkey virtuoso 
none	none	Society had been very much interested in the reported arrival in America of this wonderfully talented simian who could play the violin as well as Ysaye and who as a performer on the piano was vastly the superior of Paderewski because taken in his infancy and specially trained for the purpose he could play with his feet and tail as well as with his hands It had been reported by Tommy Dare the leading Newport authority on monkeys that he had heard him play Brahm s Variations on Paganini with his paws on a piano Hiawatha on a xylophone with his feet and Home Sweet Home with his tail on a harp simultaneously in Paris a year ago and that alongside of Jockobinski all other musical prodigies of the age became mere strummers
7783_107486_000002_000000	train-clean-360	 He s a whole orchestra in himself said Tommy enthusiastically and is the only living creature that I know of who can tackle a whole symphony without the aid of a hired man 
none	none	Of course society was on the qui vive for a genius of so riotous an order as this and all the wealthy families of Newport vied with one another for the privilege of being first to welcome him to our shores not because he was a freak mind you but for art s sweet sake missus Gushington Andrews offered twenty five hundred dollars for him as a week end guest and missus Gaster immediately went her bid a hundred per cent better Henriette in order to outdo every one else promptly put in a bid of ten thousand dollars for a single evening and had supposed the bargain closed when along came missus Shadd s cards announcing that she would be pleased to have missus Van Raffles at Onyx House on Friday evening August twenty seventh to meet Herr Jockobinski the eminent virtuoso It s very annoying said Henriette as she opened and read the invitation
7783_107486_000004_000001	train-clean-360	 I had quite set my heart on having Jockobinski here 
7783_107486_000004_000002	train-clean-360	Not that I care particularly about the music end of it but because there is nothing that gives a woman so assured a social position as being the hostess of an animal of his particular kind 
none	none	You remember Bunny how completely missus Shadd wrested the leadership from missus Gaster two seasons ago with her orang outang dinner don t you 
7783_107486_000005_000000	train-clean-360	I confessed to having read something about such an incident in high society 
none	none	Well said Henriette this would have thrown that little episode wholly in the shade 
7783_107486_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Of course missus Shadd is doing this to retain her grip but it irritates me more than I can say to have her get it just the same 
7783_107486_000006_000002	train-clean-360	Heaven knows I was willing to pay for it if I had to abscond with a national bank to get the money 
7783_107486_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 It isn t too late is it I queried 
7783_107486_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Not too late echoed Henriette 
7783_107486_000008_000001	train-clean-360	 Not too late with missus Shadd s cards out and the whole thing published in the papers 
7783_107486_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 It s never too late for a woman of your resources to do anything she has a mind to do said I It seems to me that a person who could swipe a Carnegie library the way you did should have little difficulty in lifting a musicale 
none	none	Of course I don t know how you could do it but with your mind well I should be surprised and disappointed if you couldn t devise some plan to accomplish your desires 
7783_107486_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Henriette was silent for a moment and then her face lit up with one of her most charming smiles 
7783_107486_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Bunny do you know that at times in spite of your supreme stupidity you are a source of positive inspiration to me she said looking at me fondly I ventured to think 
none	none	I am glad if it is so said I Sometimes dear Henriette you will find the most beautiful flowers growing out of the blackest mud 
7783_107486_000012_000001	train-clean-360	Perhaps hid in the dull residuum of my poor but honest gray matter lies the seed of real genius that will sprout the loveliest blossoms of achievement 
7783_107486_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Well anyhow dear you have started me thinking and maybe we ll have Jockobinski at Bolivar Lodge yet she murmured 
7783_107486_000013_000001	train-clean-360	 I want to have him first of course or not at all 
7783_107486_000013_000002	train-clean-360	To be second in doing a thing of that kind is worse than never doing it at all 
none	none	Days went by and not another word was spoken on the subject of Jockobinski and the musicale and I began to feel that at last Henriette had reached the end of her ingenuity though for my own part I could not blame her if she failed to find some plausible way out of her disappointment 
7783_107486_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Wednesday night came and consumed by curiosity to learn just how the matter stood I attempted to sound Henriette on the subject 
none	none	I should like Friday evening off missus Van Raffles said I If you are going to missus Shadd s musicale you will have no use for me
7783_107486_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Shut up Bunny she returned abruptly 
none	none	I shall need you Friday night more than ever before 
7783_107486_000016_000002	train-clean-360	Just take this note over to missus Shadd this evening and leave it mind you don t wait for an answer but just leave it that s all 
7783_107486_000017_000000	train-clean-360	She arose from the table and handed me a daintily scented missive addressed to missus Shadd and I faithfully executed her errand 
7783_107486_000060_000001	train-clean-360	 Bunderby 
none	none	the Shadd s butler endeavored to persuade me to wait for an answer but assuring him that I wasn t aware that an answer was expected I returned to Bolivar Lodge 
7783_107486_000017_000002	train-clean-360	An hour later Bunderby appeared at the back door and handed me a note addressed to my mistress which I immediately delivered 
7783_107486_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Is Bunderby waiting asked Henriette as she read the note 
none	none	Yes I answered Tell him to hand this to missus Shadd the very first thing upon her return to morrow evening she said hastily scribbling off a note and putting it in an envelope which by chance she left unsealed so that on my way back below stairs I was able to read it 
7783_107486_000020_000001	train-clean-360	What it said was that she would be only too happy to oblige missus Shadd and was very sorry indeed to hear that her son had been injured in an automobile accident while running into Boston from Bar Harbor 
7783_107486_000020_000002	train-clean-360	It closed with the line you must know my dear Pauline that there isn t anything I wouldn t do for you come weal or come woe 
7783_107486_000021_000000	train-clean-360	This I handed to Bunderby and he made off 
7783_107486_000021_000001	train-clean-360	On my return Henriette was dressed for travel 
none	none	I must take the first train for New York she said excitedly
7783_107486_000022_000001	train-clean-360	 You will have the music room prepared at once Bunny 
7783_107486_000022_000002	train-clean-360	missus Shadd s musicale will be given here 
none	none	I am going myself to make all the necessary arrangements at the New York end All you have to do is to get things ready and rely on your ignorance for everything else See I could only reflect that if a successful issue were dependent upon my ignorance I had a plentiful supply of it to fall back on 
7783_107486_000023_000001	train-clean-360	Henriette made off at once for Providence by motor car and got the midnight train out of Boston for the city where from what I learned afterwards she must have put in a strenuous day on Thursday 
7783_107486_000023_000002	train-clean-360	At any rate a great sensation was sprung on Newport on Friday morning 
7783_107486_000023_000003	train-clean-360	Every member of the smart set in the ten o clock mail received a little engraved card stating that owing to sudden illness in the Shadd family the Shadd musicale for that evening would be held at Bolivar Lodge instead of in the Onyx House ballroom 
7783_107486_000023_000004	train-clean-360	Friday afternoon Jockobinski s private and particular piano arrived at the Lodge and was set up promptly in the music room and later when the caterers arrived with the supper for the four hundred odd guests bidden to the feast all was in readiness for them 
7783_107486_000023_000005	train-clean-360	Everything was running smoothly and although Henriette had not yet arrived I felt easy and secure of mind until nearing five thirty o clock when missus Shadd herself drove up to the front door 
none	none	Her color was unusually high and had she been any but a lady of the grande monde I should have said that she was flustered 
7783_107486_000024_000000	train-clean-360	She demanded rather than asked to see my mistress with a hauteur born of the arctic snow 
7783_107486_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 missus Van Raffles went to New York Wednesday evening said I and has not yet returned 
7783_107486_000025_000001	train-clean-360	I am expecting her every minute madame 
none	none	She must be here for the musicale 
7783_107486_000025_000003	train-clean-360	Won t you wait 
none	none	Indeed I will said she abruptly
7783_107486_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 The musicale indeed 
none	none	Humph And she plumped herself down in one of the drawing room chairs so hard that it was as much as I could do to keep from showing some very unbutlerian concern for the safety of the furniture 
7783_107486_000027_000000	train-clean-360	I must say I did not envy Henriette the meeting that was in prospect for it was quite evident that missus Shadd was mad all through 
7783_107486_000027_000001	train-clean-360	In spite of my stupidity I rather thought I could divine the cause too 
7783_107486_000027_000002	train-clean-360	She was not kept long in waiting for ten minutes later the automobile with Henriette in it came thundering up the drive 
7783_107486_000027_000003	train-clean-360	I tried as I let her in to give her a hint of what awaited her but missus Shadd forestalled me only however to be forestalled herself 
none	none	Oh my dear Pauline Henriette cried as she espied her waiting visitor It is so good of you to come over I m pretty well fagged out with all the arrangements for the night and I do hope your son is better
7783_107486_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 My son is not ill missus Van Raffles said missus Shadd coldly 
7783_107486_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 I have come to ask you what 
7783_107486_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Not ill cried Henriette interrupting her 
none	none	Not ill Pauline Why breathlessly that s the most extraordinary thing I ever heard of Why am I giving the musicale to night then instead of you
7783_107486_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 That is precisely what I have come to find out said missus Shadd 
none	none	Why well of all queer things said Henriette flopping down in a chair
7783_107486_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 Surely you got my note saying that I would let Jockobinski play here to night instead of 
7783_107486_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 I did receive a very peculiar note from you saying that you would gladly do as I wished said missus Shadd beginning herself to look less angry and more puzzled 
7783_107486_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 In reply to your note of Wednesday evening said Henriette 
none	none	Certainly you wrote to me Wednesday evening It was delivered by your own man Blunderby I think his name is 
7783_107486_000034_000003	train-clean-360	About half past seven o clock it was Wednesday 
7783_107486_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes Bunderby did carry a note to you from me on Wednesday said missus Shadd 
none	none	But And in it you said that you were called to Boston by an accident to your son Willie in his automobile that you might not be able to get back in time for to night s affair and wouldn t I take it over protested missus Van Raffles vehemently
7783_107486_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 I said missus Shadd showing more surprise than was compatible with her high social position 
7783_107486_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 And attend to all the details your very words my dear Pauline said Henriette with an admirably timed break in her voice 
none	none	And I did and I told you I would I immediately put on my travelling gown motored to Providence had an all night ride to New York on a very uncomfortable sleeper went at once to Herr Jockobinski s agent and arranged the change notified Sherry to send the supper to my house instead of yours drove to Tiffany s and had the cards rushed through and mailed to everybody on your list you know you kindly gave me your list when I first came to Newport and attended to the whole thing and now I come back to find it all a er a mistake Why Pauline it s positively awful What can we do 
7783_107486_000039_000000	train-clean-360	Henriette was a perfect picture of despair 
7783_107486_000039_000001	train-clean-360	 I don t suppose we can do anything now said missus Shadd ruefully 
7783_107486_000039_000002	train-clean-360	 It s too late 
7783_107486_000039_000003	train-clean-360	The cards have gone to everybody 
7783_107486_000039_000004	train-clean-360	You have all the supper not a sandwich has come to my house and I presume all of mister Jockobinski s instruments as well have come here 
7783_107486_000040_000000	train-clean-360	Henriette turned to me 
7783_107486_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 All madame said I briefly 
none	none	Well said missus Shadd tapping the floor nervously with her toe
7783_107486_000042_000001	train-clean-360	 I don t understand it 
none	none	I never wrote that note Oh but missus Shadd I have it here said Henriette opening her purse and extracting the paper
7783_107486_000043_000001	train-clean-360	 You can read it for yourself 
7783_107486_000043_000002	train-clean-360	What else could I do after that 
7783_107486_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Innocence on a monument could have appeared no freer of guile than Henriette at that moment 
none	none	She handed the note to missus Shadd who perused it with growing amazement Isn t that your handwriting and your crest and your paper asked Henriette appealingly
7783_107486_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 It certainly looks like it said missus Shadd 
none	none	If I didn t know I hadn t written it I would have sworn I had 
7783_107486_000046_000002	train-clean-360	Where could it have come from 
7783_107486_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 I supposed it came from Onyx House said Henriette simply glancing at the envelope 
7783_107486_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Well it s a very mysterious affair said missus Shadd rising and I oh well my dear woman I I can t blame you indeed after all you have done I ought to be and really am very much obliged to you Only 
7783_107486_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Whom did you have at dinner Wednesday night dear asked Henriette 
7783_107486_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Only the Duke and Duchess of Snarleyow and mercy 
7783_107486_000050_000001	train-clean-360	I wonder if he could have done it 
none	none	Who asked Henriette Tommy Dare ejaculated missus Shadd her eyes beginning to twinkle Do you suppose this is one of Tommy Dare s jokes H m mused Henriette and then she laughed
7783_107486_000053_000001	train-clean-360	 It wouldn t be unlike him would it 
7783_107486_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Not a bit the naughty boy cried missus Shadd 
7783_107486_000054_000001	train-clean-360	 That s it missus Van Raffles as certainly as we stand here 
none	none	Suppose just to worry him we never let on that anything out of the ordinary has happened eh
7783_107486_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 Splendid said Henriette with enthusiasm 
none	none	Let s act as if all turned out just as we expected and best of all never even mention it to him or to Bunderby his confederate neither of us eh
7783_107486_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Never said missus Shadd rising and kissing Henriette good bye 
7783_107486_000056_000001	train-clean-360	 That s the best way out of it 
7783_107486_000056_000002	train-clean-360	If we did we d be the laughing stock of all Newport 
none	none	But some day in the distant future Tommy Dare would better look out for Pauline Shadd missus Van Raffles 
7783_107486_000057_000000	train-clean-360	And so it was agreed and Henriette successfully landed missus Shadd s musicale 
7783_107486_000058_000000	train-clean-360	Incidentally Jockobinski was very affable and the function went off well 
none	none	Everybody was there and no one would for a moment have thought that there was anything strange in the transfer of the scene from Onyx House to Bolivar Lodge
7783_107486_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Who wrote that letter Henriette I asked late in the evening when the last guest had gone 
7783_107486_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Who do you suppose Bunny my boy she asked with a grin 
none	none	Bunderby
7783_107486_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 No said I 
7783_107486_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 You ve guessed right said Henriette 
none	none	As a postscript let me say that until he reads this I don t believe Tommy Dare ever guessed what a successful joke he perpetrated upon missus Shadd and the fair Henriette 
7783_107486_000063_000001	train-clean-360	Even then I doubt if he realizes what a good one it was on everybody 
none	none	XI THE ADVENTURE OF missus INNITT S COOK
7783_107487_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 It is curious Bunny said Henriette the other morning after an unusually late breakfast to observe by what qualities certain of these Newport families have arrived as the saying is 
7783_107487_000006_000001	train-clean-360	The Gasters of course belong at the top by patent right 
7783_107487_000006_000002	train-clean-360	Having invented American society or at least the machine that at present controls it they are entitled to all the royalties it brings in 
7783_107487_000006_000003	train-clean-360	The Rockerbilts got there all of a sudden by the sheer lavishness of their entertainment and their ability to give bonds to keep it up 
none	none	The Van Varick Shadds flowed in through their unquestioned affiliation with the ever popular Delaware Shadds and the Roe Shadds of the Hudson two of the oldest and most respected families of the United States reinforced by the Napoleonic qualities of the present missus Shadd in the doing of unexpected things The Gullets thanks to the fact that missus Gullet is the acknowledged mother in law of three British dukes two Italian counts and a French marquis are safely anchored in the social haven where they would be and the rumor that missus Gushington Andrews has written a book that is a trifle risque fixes her firmly in the social constellation but the Innitts with only eighty thousand dollars per annum the Dedbroke Hickses with nothing a year the Oliver Sloshingtons with an income of judgments the study of their arrival is mighty interesting It doesn t interest me much quoth I Indeed this American smart set don t appeal to me either for its smartness or its setness
7783_107487_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 Bunny cried Henriette with a silvery ripple of laughter 
none	none	Do be careful 
7783_107487_000008_000002	train-clean-360	An epigram from you 
7783_107487_000008_000003	train-clean-360	My dear boy you ll be down with brain fever if you don t watch out 
none	none	Humph said I with a shrug of my shoulders
7783_107487_000009_000001	train-clean-360	 Neither you nor my dear old friend Raffles ever gave me credit for any brains 
none	none	I have a few however which I use when occasion demands I drawled
7783_107487_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Well don t waste them here Bunny laughed Henriette 
none	none	Save em for some place where they ll be appreciated Maybe in your old age you ll be back in dear old London contributing to Punch if you are careful of your wits 
7783_107487_000010_000003	train-clean-360	But how do you suppose the Oliver Sloshingtons ever got in here 
7783_107487_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 He holds the divorce record I believe said I He s been married to four social leaders already hasn t he 
none	none	Yes
7783_107487_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Well he got into the swim with each marriage so he s got a four ply grip said I 
7783_107487_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 And the Dedbroke Hickses asked Henriette 
7783_107487_000014_000001	train-clean-360	 How do you account for them 
none	none	Most attractive diners and weekenders said I They got all the laughs at your dinner to the Archbishop of Decanterbury and their man Smathers tells me they re the swellest things going at week end parties because of his ingenuity at cotillion leading and her undeniable charms as a flirt 
7783_107487_000015_000001	train-clean-360	By Jove she s that easy with men that even I tremble with anxiety whenever she comes into the house 
7783_107487_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 But how do they live they haven t a cent to their names said Henriette 
7783_107487_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Simplicity itself said I He is dressed by his tailors and she by her dressmaker and as for food they take home a suit case full of it from every house party they attend 
none	none	They re so gracious to the servants that they don t have to think of tips and as for Smathers and missus Dedbroke Hicks s maid they re paid reporters on the staff of The Town Tattler and are willing to serve for nothing for the opportunities for items the connection gives them
7783_107487_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I don t envy them in the least said Henriette 
none	none	Poor things to be always taking and never giving must be an awful strain though to be sure their little trolley party out to Tiverton and back was delightful
7783_107487_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Exactly and with car fare and sandwiches and the champagne supplied free by the importers for the advertisement it cost them exactly twelve dollars and was set down as the jolliest affair of the season said I 
7783_107487_000019_000001	train-clean-360	 I call that genius of a pretty high order 
7783_107487_000019_000002	train-clean-360	I wouldn t pity them if I were you 
7783_107487_000019_000003	train-clean-360	They re happy 
7783_107487_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 missus Innitt though I envy her said Henriette that is in a way She has no conversation at all but her little dinners are the swellest things of the season 
7783_107487_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Never more than ten people at a time and everything cooked to a turn 
7783_107487_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 That s just it said I 
none	none	I hear enough at the club to know just what cinches missus Innitt s position 
7783_107487_000021_000002	train-clean-360	It s her cook that s what does it 
7783_107487_000021_000003	train-clean-360	If she lost her cook she d be missus Outofit 
7783_107487_000021_000004	train-clean-360	There never were such pancakes such purees such made dishes as that woman gets up 
7783_107487_000021_000005	train-clean-360	She turns hash into a confection and liver and bacon into a delicacy 
none	none	Corned beef in her hands is a discovery and her sauces are such that a bit of roast rhinoceros hide tastes like the tenderest of squab when served by her No wonder missus Innitt holds her own 
7783_107487_000021_000007	train-clean-360	A woman with a cook like Norah Sullivan could rule an empire 
none	none	A moment later I was sorry I had spoken for my words electrified her I must have her cried Henriette
7783_107487_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 What missus Innitt I asked 
7783_107487_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 No her cook said Henriette 
7783_107487_000026_000000	train-clean-360	I stood aghast 
7783_107487_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Full of sympathy as I had always been with the projects of missus Van Raffles and never in the least objecting on moral grounds to any of her schemes of acquisition I could not but think that this time she proposed to go too far 
none	none	To rob a millionaire of his bonds a national bank of its surplus a philanthropist of a library or a Metropolitan Boxholder of a diamond stomacher all that seemed reasonable to me and proper according to my way of looking at it but to rob a neighbor of her cook if there is any worse social crime than that I don t know what it is
7783_107487_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 You d better think twice on that proposition Henriette I advised with a gloomy shake of the head 
7783_107487_000027_000001	train-clean-360	 It is not only a mean crime but a dangerous one to boot 
none	none	Success would in itself bring ruin 
7783_107487_000027_000003	train-clean-360	missus Innitt would never forgive you and society at large 
7783_107487_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Society at large would dine with me instead of with missus Innitt that s all said Henriette 
none	none	I mean to have her before the season s over
7783_107487_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Well I draw the line at stealing a cook said I coldly 
7783_107487_000029_000001	train-clean-360	 I ve robbed churches and I ve made way with fresh air funds and I ve helped you in many another legitimate scheme but in this missus Van Raffles you ll have to go it alone 
7783_107487_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh don t you be afraid Bunny she answered 
none	none	I m not going to use your charms as a bait to lure this culinary Phyllis into the Arcadia in which you with your Strephonlike form disport yourself You oughtn t to do it at all said I gruffly
7783_107487_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 It s worse than murder for it is prohibited twice in the decalogue while murder is only mentioned once 
7783_107487_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 What cried Henrietta What pray does the decalogue say about cooks I d like to know 
7783_107487_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 First thou shalt not steal 
7783_107487_000033_000001	train-clean-360	You propose to steal this woman 
7783_107487_000033_000002	train-clean-360	Second thou shalt not covet thy neighbor s maid servant 
7783_107487_000033_000003	train-clean-360	How many times does that make I asked 
none	none	Dear me Bunny said Henriette but you are a little tuppenny Puritan aren t you 
7783_107487_000034_000001	train-clean-360	Anybody d know you were the son of a clergyman Well let me tell you I sha n t steal the woman and I sha n t covet her 
7783_107487_000034_000002	train-clean-360	I m just going to get her that s all 
none	none	It was two weeks later that Norah Sullivan left the employ of missus Innitt and was installed in our kitchen and strange to relate she came as a matter of charity on Henriette s part having been discharged by missus Innitt 
7783_107487_000036_000000	train-clean-360	The Friday before Norah s arrival Henriette requested me to get her a rusty nail a piece of gravel from the drive two hair pins and a steel nut from the automobile 
7783_107487_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 What on earth I began but she shut me off with an imperious gesture 
7783_107487_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Do as I tell you she commanded 
7783_107487_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 You are not in on this venture And then apparently she relented 
7783_107487_000038_000002	train-clean-360	 But I m willing to tell you just one thing Bunny here her eyes began to twinkle joyously I m going to missus Innitt s to dinner to morrow night so look out for Norah by Monday 
7783_107487_000039_000000	train-clean-360	I turned sulkily away 
7783_107487_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 You know how I feel on that subject said I This business of going into another person s house as a guest and inducing their servants to leave is an infraction of the laws of hospitality 
7783_107487_000040_000001	train-clean-360	How would you like it if missus Gaster stole me away from you 
7783_107487_000041_000000	train-clean-360	Henriette s answer was a puzzling smile 
7783_107487_000041_000001	train-clean-360	 You are free to better your condition Bunny she said 
7783_107487_000041_000002	train-clean-360	 But I am not going to rob missus Innitt as I told you once before 
none	none	She will discharge Norah and I will take her that s all so do be a good boy and bring me the nail and gravel and the hair pins and the automobile nut I secured the desired articles for my mistress and the next evening she went to missus Innitt s little dinner to Miss Gullet and her fiance Lord Dullpate eldest son of the Duke of Lackshingles who had come over to America to avoid the scrutiny of the Bankruptcy Court taking the absurd objects with her Upon her return at two A M she was radiant and triumphant
7783_107487_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 I won out Bunny I won out she cried 
none	none	How I inquired
7783_107487_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 missus Innitt has discharged Norah though I begged her not to she fairly sang 
7783_107487_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 On what grounds 
7783_107487_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Several said Henriette unfastening her glove 
7783_107487_000047_000001	train-clean-360	 To begin with there was a rusty nail in my clam cocktail and it nearly choked me to death I tried hard to keep missus Innitt from seeing what had happened but she is watchful if not brainy and all my efforts went for naught 
7783_107487_000047_000002	train-clean-360	She was much mortified of course and apologized profusely 
7783_107487_000047_000003	train-clean-360	All went well until the fish when one of the two hair pins turned up in the pompano to the supreme disgust of my hostess who was now beginning to look worried Hair pin number two made its debut in my timbale 
7783_107487_000047_000004	train-clean-360	This was too much for the watchful missus Innitt self poised though she always is and despite my remonstrances she excused herself from the table for a moment and I judge from the flushed appearance of her cheeks when she returned five minutes later that somebody had had the riot act read to her somewhere 
7783_107487_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t understand it at all missus Van Raffles she said with a sheepish smile 
7783_107487_000048_000001	train-clean-360	 Cook s perfectly sober 
7783_107487_000048_000002	train-clean-360	If anything of the kind ever happens again she shall go 
7783_107487_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Even as missus Innitt spoke I conveyed a luscious morsel of filet mignon with mushrooms to my mouth and nearly broke my tooth on a piece of gravel that went with it and Norah was doomed for although we all laughed heartily the thing had come to be such a joke it was plain from the expression of missus Innitt s countenance that she was very very angry 
none	none	Forgive her this time for my sake missus Innitt I pleaded
7783_107487_000050_000001	train-clean-360	 After all it is the little surprises that give zest to life 
7783_107487_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 And you didn t have to use the automobile nut I asked deeply impressed with the woman s ingenuity 
7783_107487_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes said Henriette 
none	none	As dinner progressed I thought it wise to use it to keep missus Innitt from weakening so when the salad was passed I managed without anybody s observing it to drop the automobile nut into the bowl 
7783_107487_000052_000002	train-clean-360	The Duke of Snarleyow got it and the climax was capped missus Innitt burst into a flood of tears and well to morrow Bunny Norah leaves 
none	none	You will take her this ten dollar bill from me and tell her that I am sorry she got into so much trouble on my account Say that if I can be of any assistance to her all she has to do is to call here and I will do what I can to get her another place Illustration ON HER WAY TO BARLY CHURCH I WAYLAID NORAH 
7783_107487_000054_000000	train-clean-360	With this Henriette retired and the next morning on her way to early church I waylaid Norah 
none	none	Her eyes were red with weeping but a more indignant woman never lived 
7783_107487_000054_000002	train-clean-360	Her discharge was unrighteous missus Innitt was no lady the butler was in a conspiracy to ruin her and all that indeed her mood was most receptive to the furtherance of Henriette s plans 
none	none	The ten dollar bill was soothing and indicated that my mistress was a foine woman and surely Norah would come round in the evening to ask her aid
7783_107487_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 It s ruined I am unless somebody ll be good to me and give me a riference which missus Innitt bad cess to her won t do at all at all she wailed and then I left her 
7783_107487_000056_000000	train-clean-360	She called that night and two days later was installed in the Van Raffles s kitchen 
7783_107487_000057_000000	train-clean-360	A new treasure was added to the stores of our loot but somehow or other I have never been happy over the successful issue of the enterprise 
none	none	I can t quite make up my mind that it was a lady like thing for Henriette to do even in Newport XII THE LAST ADVENTURE I am bathed in tears I have tried to write of my sensations to tell the story of the Last Adventure of missus Van Raffles in lucid terms but though my pen runs fast over the paper the ink makes no record of the facts My woe is so great and so deep that my tears falling into the ink pot turn it into a fluid so thin it will not mark the paper and when I try the pencil the words are scarce put down before they re blotted out And yet with all this woe I find myself a multi millionaire possessed of sums so far beyond my wildest dreams of fortune that my eye can scarce take in the breadth of all the figures My dollars coined into silver placed on top of one another would form a bullion tower that would reach higher into the air than fifteen superimposed domes of saint Peter s placed on top of seventeen spires of Trinity on the summit of Mont Blanc In five pound notes laid side by side they d suffice to paper every scrap of bedroom wall in all the Astor houses in the world and invested in Amalgamated Copper they would turn the system green with envy and yet I am not happy My well beloved Henriette s last adventure has turned my fortune into bitterest gall and plain unvarnished wormwood forms the finish of my interior for she is gone I amid the splendor of my new found possessions able to keep not one but a hundred motor cars and to pay the chauffeur s fines to endow chairs in universities to build libraries in every hamlet in the land from Podunk to Richard Mansfield to eat three meals a day and lodge at the saint Regicide and to evade my taxes without exciting suspicion am desolate and forlorn for I repeat Henriette has gone The very nature of her last adventure by a successful issue has blown out the light of my life She has stolen Constant Scrappe If I could be light of heart in this tragic hour I would call this story the Adventure of the Lifted Fiance but that would be so out of key with my emotions that I cannot bring myself to do it I must content myself with a narration of the simple facts of the lengths to which my beloved s ambition led her without frivolity and with a heavy heart Of course you know what all Newport has known for months that the Constant Scrappes were seeking divorce not that they loved one another less but that both parties to the South Dakota suit loved some one else more Colonel Scrappe had long been the most ardent admirer of missus Gushington Andrews and missus Constant Scrappe s devotion to young Harry de Lakwitz had been at least for two seasons evident to any observer with half an eye Gushington Andrews had considerately taken himself out of the way by eloping to South Africa with Tottie Dimpleton of the Frivolity Burlesquers and Harry de Lakwitz s only recorded marriage had been annulled by the courts because at the time of his wedding to the forty year old housemaid of the Belleville Boarding School for Boys at Skidgeway Rhode Island he was only fifteen years of age Consequently they both were eligible and provided the Constant Scrappes could be so operated on by the laws of South Dakota as to free them from one another there were no valid reasons why the yearnings of these ardent souls should not all be gratified Indeed both engagements had been announced tentatively and only the signing of the decree releasing the Constant Scrappes from their obligations to one another now stood in the way of two nuptial ceremonies which would make four hearts beat as one missus Gushington Andrews s trousseau was ready and that of the future missus de Lakwitz had been ordered both ladies had received their engagement rings when that inscrutable Henriette marked Constant Scrappe for her own Colonel Scrappe had returned from Monte Carlo having broken the bank twice and Henriette had met him at a little dinner given in his honor by missus Gushington Andrews He turned out to be a most charming man and it didn t require a much more keen perception than my own to take in the fact that he had made a great impression upon Henriette though she never mentioned it to me until the final blow came I merely noticed a growing preoccupation in her manner and in her attitude towards me which changed perceptibly I think Bunny she said to me one morning as I brought her marmalade and toast that considering our relations to each other you should not call me Henrietta After all you know you are here primarily as my butler and there are some proprieties that should be observed even in this Newport atmosphere But I protested am I no more than that I am your partner am I not You are my business partner not my social Bunny she said We must not mix society and business In this house I am mistress of the situation you are the butler that is the precise condition and I think it well that hereafter you should recognize the real truth and avoid over familiarity by addressing me as missus Van Raffles If we should ever open an office for our Burglary Company in New York or elsewhere you may call me anything you please there Here however you must be governed by the etiquette of your environment Let it be Mrs Van Raffles hereafter And is it to be mister Bunny I inquired sarcastically Her response was a cold glance of the eye and a majestic sweep from the room Illustration HENRIETTE WAS TESTING THE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR PIANO That evening Colonel Scrappe called ostensibly to look over the house and as landlord to see if there was anything he could do to make it more comfortable and I blind fool that I was for the moment believed that that was his real errand and ventured to remind Henriette of the leak in the roof at which they both I thought exchanged amused glances and he gravely mounted the stairs to the top of the house to look at it On our return Henriette dismissed me and told me that she would not require my services again during the evening Even then my suspicions were not aroused although there was a dull disturbed feeling about my heart whose precise causes I could not define I went to the club and put in a miserable evening returning home about midnight to discover that Colonel Scrappe was still there He was apparently giving the house and its contents a thorough inspection for when I arrived Henriette was testing the fifty thousand dollar piano in the drawing room for him with a brilliant rendering of O Promise Me What decision they reached as to its tone and quality I never knew for in spite of my hints on the subject Henriette never spoke of the matter to me I suppose I should have begun to guess what was happening under my very nose then but thank Heaven I am not of a suspicious nature and although I didn t like the looks of things the inevitable meaning of their strange behavior never even dawned upon my mind Even when two nights later Colonel Scrappe escorted Henriette home at midnight from a lecture on the Inscrutability of Sartor Resartus at missus Gushington Andrews s it did not strike me as unusual although instead of going home immediately as most escorts do under the circumstances he remained about two hours testing that infernal piano again and with the same old tune Then the automobile rides began and pretty nearly every morning long before polite society was awake Colonel Scrappe and Henriette took long runs together through the country in her Mercedes machine for what purpose I snever knew for whatever interest the colonel might have had in our welfare as a landlord I could not for the life of me guess how it could be extended to our automobiles One thing I did notice however was a growing coldness between Henriette and missus Gushington Andrews The latter came to a card party at Bolivar Lodge one afternoon about two weeks after Colonel Scrappe s return and her greeting to her hostess instead of having the old time effusiveness was frigid to a degree In fact when they clasped hands I doubt if more than the tips of their fingers touched Moreover missus Gushington Andrews hitherto considered one of the best fists at bridge or hearts in the four hundred actually won the booby prize which I saw her throw into the street when she departed It was evident something had happened to disturb her equanimity My eyes were finally opened by a remark made at the club by Digby Reggie de Pelt s valet who asked me how I liked my new boss and whose explanation of the question led to a complete revelation of the true facts in the case Everybody knew he said that from the moment she had met him missus Van Raffles had set her cap for Colonel Scrappe and that meeting her for the first time he had fallen head over heels in love with her even in the presence of his fiancee Of course I hotly denied Digby s insinuations and we got so warm over the discussion that when I returned home that night I had two badly discolored eyes and Digby well Digby didn t go home at all Both of us were suspended from the Gentleman s Gentleman s Club for four weeks for ungentleman s ungentlemanly behavior in consequence Black as my eyes were however I was on hand at the breakfast table the following morning and of course Henriette observed my injuries Why Bunny she cried What is the meaning of this Have you been fighting Oh no missus Van Raffles I returned sarcastically I ve just strained my eyes reading the divorce news from South Dakota She gave a sudden start What do you mean she demanded her face flushing hotly You know well enough what I mean I retorted angrily Your goings on with Colonel Scrappe are the talk of the town and I got these eyes in a little discussion of your matrimonial intentions That s all Leave the room instantly she cried rising and haughtily pointing to the door You are insufferable But the color in her cheeks showed that I had hit home far harder than she was willing to admit There was nothing for me to do but to obey meekly but my blood was up and instead of moping in my room I started out to see if I could find Constant Scrappe My love for Henriette was too deep to permit of my sitting quietly by and seeing another walk away with the one truly coveted prize of my life and I was ready on sight to take the colonel by the collar he was only a governor s staff colonel anyhow and consequently no great shakes as a fighter and throw him into the harbor but my quest was a vain one He was to be found in none of his familiar haunts and I returned to Bolivar Lodge And then came the shock As I approached the house I saw the colonel assisting Henriette into the motor car and in response to the chauffeur s Where to sir I heard Scrappe reply in an excited undertone To New York and damn the speed laws In a moment they had rushed by me like the flash of a lightning express and Henriette was gone You must know the rest The papers the next day were full of the elopement in high life They told how the Scrappe divorce had been granted at five o clock in the afternoon the day before how Colonel Scrappe and missus Van Raffles had sped to New York in the automobile and been quietly married at the Little Church Around the Corner and were now sailing down the bay on the Hydrostatic bound for foreign climes They likewise intimated that a very attractive lady of more than usual effusiveness of manner whose nuptials were expected soon to be published for the second time had gone to a sanitarium in Philadelphia to be treated for a sudden and overwhelming attack of nervous hysteria It was all too true that tale Henriette s final coup had been successful and she had at one stroke stolen her landlord her landlady s husband and her neighbor s fiance To console me she left this note written on board of the steamer and mailed by the pilot ON BOARD THE HYDROSTATIC OFF SANDY HOOK September ten nineteen oh four DEAR BUNNY I couldn t help it The minute I saw him I felt that I must have him It s the most successful haul yet and is the last adventure I shall ever have He s worth forty million dollars I m sorry for you dear but it s all in the line of business To console you I have left in your name all that we have won together in our partnership at Newport fourteen millions five hundred and sixty three thousand nine hundred and seventy seven dollars in cash and about three million dollars

England and renew your studies for the ministry The Church is a noble profession Sincerely yours HENRIETTE VAN RAFFLES SCRAPPE I have gathered together these meagre possessions rich in bullion value but meagre in happiness considering all that might have been and to morrow I sail for London There following Henriette s advice I shall enter the study of the ministry and when I am ordained shall buy a living somewhere and settle down to the serene existence of the preacher the pastor of a flock of human sheep Illustration MY MISERY IS DEEP BUT I AM BUOYED UP BY ONE GREAT HOPE My misery is deep but I am buoyed up by one great hope in every thought These Newport marriages are so seldom for life that I yet have hope that some day Henriette will be restored to me without its necessarily
