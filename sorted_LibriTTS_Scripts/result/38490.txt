FLORENCE MORSE KINGSLEY CHAPTER I doctor North s wife attired in her dressing gown and slippers noiselessly tilted the shutter of the old fashioned inside blind and peered cautiously out The moon was shining splendidly in the dark sky and the empty street seemed almost as light as day It had been snowing earlier in the evening missus North observed absent mindedly and the clinging drifts weighed the dark evergreens on either side of the gate almost to the ground A dog barked noisily from his kennel in a neighbouring yard and a chorus of answering barks acknowledged the signal some one was coming along the moonlit street There were two figures as missus North had expected she craned her plump neck anxiously forward as the gate clicked and a light girlish laugh floated up on the frosty air Dear dear she murmured I do hope Bessie will come right into the house It is too cold to stand outside talking Apparently the young persons below did not think so They stood in the bright moonlight in full view of the anxious watcher behind the shutter the man s tall figure bent eagerly toward the girl whose delicate profile missus North could see distinctly under the coquettish sweep of the broad hat brim The child ought to have worn her high overshoes she was thinking when she was startled by the vision of the tall broad figure stooping over the short slight one Then the key clicked in the lock and the front door opened softly the sound was echoed by the closing gate as the tall figure tramped briskly away over the creaking snow The neighbour s dog barked again perfunctorily this time as if acknowledging the entire respectability of the passer by all the other dogs in town responded in kind and again there was silence broken only by the sound of a light foot on the carpeted stair missus North opened her door softly Is that you Bessie Yes mother Isn t it very late child It is only half past eleven Did Louise go with you No mother she had a sore throat and it was snowing so her aunt wouldn t allow her to go Oh missus North s voice expressed a faint disapproval Of course we couldn t help it besides all the other girls were there just with their escorts You and grandma are so old fashioned I m sure I don t see why I always have to have some other girl along and Louise Glenny of all persons I couldn t help being just a little bit glad that she couldn t go Did you have a nice time dear The girl turned a radiant face upon her mother Oh we had a lovely time she murmured I I ll tell you about it to morrow Is father home Yes he came in early to night and went right to bed I hope the telephone bell won t ring again before morning The girl laughed softly You might take off the receiver she suggested Poor daddy Oh no I couldn t do that Your father would never forgive me But I told him not to have it on his mind I ll watch out for it and answer it and if it s missus Salter again with one of her imaginary sinking spells I m going to tell her the doctor won t be in before six in the morning I do hope it isn t wrong to deceive that much but your father isn t made of iron whatever some people may think The girl laughed again a low murmur of joy Good night dear little mother she said caressingly You are always watching and waiting for some one aren t you But you needn t have worried about me She stooped and kissed her mother her eyes shining like stars then hurried away to hide the blush which swept her face and neck Dear dear sighed missus North as she crept back to her couch drawn close to the muffled telephone I suppose I ought to have spoken to her father before this but he is always so busy I hardly have time to say two words to him Besides he thinks Bessie is only a child and he would have laughed at me The girl was taking off her hat and cloak in her own room How long ago it seemed since she had put them on She smoothed out her white gloves with caressing fingers I shall always keep them she thought She was still conscious of his first kisses and looked in her glass as if half expecting to see some visible token of them I am so happy so happy she murmured to the radiant reflection which smiled back at her from out its shadowy depths She leaned forward and touched the cold smooth surface with her lips in a sudden passion of gratitude for the fair richly tinted skin the large bright eyes with their long curling lashes the masses of brown waving hair and the pliant beauty of the strong young figure in the mirror If I had been freckled and stoop shouldered and awkward like Louise Glenny he couldn t have loved me she was thinking She sank to her knees after awhile and buried her face in the coverlid of her little bed But she could think only of the look in his eyes when he had said I love you and of the thrilling touch of his lips on hers She crept into bed and lay there in a wide eyed rapture while the village clock struck one and after a long blissful hour two Then she fell asleep and did not hear the telephone bell which called her tired father from his bed in the dim cold hour between three and four She was still rosily asleep and dreaming when missus North came softly into the room in the broad sunlight of the winter morning Isn t Lizzie awake yet inquired a brisk voice from the hall My my but girls are idle creatures nowadays The owner of the voice followed this dictum with a quick patter of softly shod feet I didn t like to call her mother apologised missus North She came in late and Grandmother Carroll pursed up her small wise mouth I heard her she said and that young man with her I don t know daughter but what we ought to inquire into his prospects and character a little more carefully if he s to be allowed to come here so constant Lizzie s very young and Oh grandma protested a drowsy voice from the pillows I m twenty Twenty yes I know you re twenty my dear quite old enough I should say to be out of bed before nine in the morning It wasn t her fault mother I didn t call her The girl was gazing at the two round matronly figures at the foot of the bed her laughing eyes grown suddenly serious I ll get up at once she said with decision and I ll eat bread and milk for breakfast I sha n t mind She s got something on her mind whispered missus North to her mother as the two pattered softly downstairs I shouldn t wonder responded Grandmother Carroll briskly Girls of her age are pretty likely to have and I mistrust but what that young Bowser may have been putting notions into her head I hope you ll be firm with her daughter she s much too young for anything of that sort You were married when you were eighteen mother and I was barely twenty you know I was a very different girl at eighteen from what Lizzie is missus Carroll said warmly She s been brought up differently In my time healthy girls didn t lie in bed till ten o clock Many and many s the time I ve danced till twelve o clock and been up in the morning at five tending to my work You indulge Lizzie too much and if that young Bixler His name is Brewster mother don t you remember and they say he comes of a fine old Boston family Well Brewster or Bixler it will make no difference to Lizzie you ll find I ve been watching her for more than a month back and I ll tell you daughter when a girl like Lizzie offers to eat bread and milk for breakfast you can expect almost anything Her mind is on other things I ll never forget the way you ate a boiled egg for breakfast every morning for a week and you couldn t bear eggs about the time the doctor was getting serious I mistrusted there was something to pay and I wasn t mistaken missus North sighed vaguely Then her tired brown eyes lighted up with a smile I had letters from both the boys this morning she said don t you want to read them mother Frank has passed all his mid year examinations and Elliot says he has just made the varsity gym team Made the what I don t quite understand myself acknowledged missus North but that s what he said He said he d have his numerals to show us when he came home Easter Hum murmured missus Carroll dubiously I m sure I hope he won t break his neck in any foolish way Did he say anything about his lessons Not much he never was such a student as Frank but he ll do well mother Elizabeth North fresh as a dewy rose and radiant with her new happiness came into the room just as missus Carroll folded the last sheet of the college letters I ll ask Lizzie she said Lizzie what is a g y m team Oh grandma protested the girl please don t call me Lizzie Bessie is bad enough but Lizzie I always think of that absurd old Mother Goose rhyme Elizabeth Lizzie Betsey and Bess all went hunting to find a bird s nest and besides you promised me you wouldn t Lizzie was a good enough name for your mother said grandma briskly Your father courted and married her under that name and he didn t mind Her keen old eyes behind their shining glasses dwelt triumphantly on the girl s changing colour You needn t tell me she finished irrelevantly But Elizabeth had possessed herself of the letters and was already deep in a laughing perusal of Elliot s scrawl Oh how splendid she cried he s made the Varsity on his ring work too I don t pretend to understand what particular work Elliot is referring to observed grandma with studied mildness Is it some sort of mathematics Elizabeth sprang up and flung both arms about the smiling old lady You dear little hypocritical grandma she said you know perfectly well that it isn t any study at all but just gymnastic work all sorts of stunts swinging on rings and doing back and front levers and shoulder stands and all that sort of thing Elliot has such magnificent muscles he can do anything and better than any one else and that s why he s on the varsity you see Thank you Elizabeth said grandma tranquilly I d entirely forgotten that young men don t go to college now to study their lessons My memory is certainly getting poor No grandma dear it isn t You remember everything a thousand times better than any one else and what is more you know it But of course Elliot studies he has to mister Brewster says he thinks Elliot is one of the finest boys he knows He thinks he would make a splendid engineer He admires Frank too immensely and What does the young man think of Elizabeth asked missus Carroll with a wise smile He oh grandma I didn t mean to tell just yet but he I There there child Better go and find your mother I mistrust she s getting you a hot breakfast She drew the girl into her soft old arms and kissed her twice Elizabeth sprang up all in a lovely flame of blushes and ran out of the room CHAPTER II 
7026-86941-0000	train-other-500	When Samuel Herrick Brewster B S and Civil Engineer late of the Massachusetts School of Technology came to Innisfield for the purpose of joining the corps of engineers already at work on a new and improved system of water works
7026-86941-0001	train-other-500	he had not the slightest intention of falling seriously in love By seriously Sam Brewster himself might have told you
none	none	 as he told his married sister living in Saginaw Mich 
7026-86941-0002	train-other-500	and anxiously solicitous of the young man s general well being that he meant that sort and quality of affection which would naturally and inevitably lead a man into matrimony He had always been fond of the society of pretty and amiable women and well used to it too
7026-86941-0003	train-other-500	His further ideas with regard to matrimony though delightfully vague in their general character
none	none	 were sufficiently clear cut and decided in one important particular 
7026-86941-0004	train-other-500	which he had been careful to expound at length to those impetuous undergraduates of his fraternity who had appeared to need friendly counsel from their elders A man said young Brewster conclusively has no business to marry
7026-86941-0005	train-other-500	till he can feel solid ground under his feet He should be thoroughly established in his profession and well able to pay the shot
7026-86941-0006	train-other-500	When this sapient young gentleman first met Elizabeth North at a picnic given by the leading citizens of Innisfield to celebrate the completion of the new aqueduct he was disposed to regard her as a very nice intelligent sort of a girl
7026-86941-0007	train-other-500	with remarkably handsome brown eyes On the occasion of his third meeting with the young lady he found himself rather to his surprise telling her about his successful work in the Tech and of how he hoped to get somewhere in his profession some day
7026-86941-0008	train-other-500	Elizabeth in her turn had confided to him her disappointment in not being able to go to Wellesley and her ambitious attempts to keep up with Marian Evans who was in the Sophomore year in literature and music
none	none	 She played Chopin s Fantasia Impromptu for him on missus North s garrulous old piano and as her slender fingers twinkled over the yellow keys he caught himself wondering how much a first class instrument would cost In the course of a month he had fallen into the habit of strolling home with Elizabeth after church and twice missus North in the kindness of her motherly heart had asked him to dinner She was afraid she told Grandma Carroll that the table board at missus Bentwick s was none of the best She spoke of him further as that nice good looking boy and hoped he wouldn t be too lonely in Innisfield away from all his friends As for doctor North that overworked physician was seldom to be seen being apparently in a chronic state of hastily and energetically climbing into his gig and as energetically and hastily climbing out again He had hurriedly shaken hands with young Brewster and made him welcome to his house in one of the brief intervals between office hours and the ever waiting gig with its imperturbable brown horse who appeared to know quite as well as the doctor where the sick were to be found After that it is fair to state the worthy doctor had completely forgotten that such a person as Samuel Herrick Brewster B S C E existed One may judge therefore of his feelings when his wife chose a moment of relaxation between a carefully cooked dinner and an expected summons by telephone to acquaint him with the fact of their daughter s engagement Engaged exclaimed the doctor starting out of his chair Bess engaged Oh I guess not I sha n t allow anything of the sort she s nothing but a child and as for this young fellow what d you say his name was We don t know him You don t you mean papa his wife corrected him gently The rest of us have seen a good deal of mister Brewster and I m sure Bessie Illustration Oh daddy he s the dearest person in the world Now mother what made you I wanted to tell daddy myself Oh daddy he s the dearest person in the world Then as Elizabeth caught the hurt bewildered look in her father s eyes she perched on his knee in the old familiar fashion It seems sudden to you I know she murmured but really it isn t daddy as he will tell you if he can ever find you at home to talk to Why we ve known each other since last summer I m afraid I m very stupid child but I don t believe I understand 
7026-86941-0009	train-other-500	You don t mean to tell me that you have been thinking of of getting married and to a man I don t know even doctor North shook his head decidedly But you do know him daddy he s been here ever so many times Of course she added with a touch of laughing malice
7026-86941-0010	train-other-500	he s perfectly well and you seldom notice well people even when they re in your own family I don t have time Bess admitted the doctor soberly there are too many of the other sort But now about this young man Brewster eh You have him come round in office hours say
7026-86941-0011	train-other-500	and I ll Now daddy please don t straighten out your mouth like that it isn t a bit becoming
none	none	 Naturally you ve got the sweetest kindest look in the world and you mustn t spoil it 
7026-86941-0012	train-other-500	especially when you are talking about Sam The doctor pinched his daughter s pink ear I m sorry to appear such an ogre he said with a touch of grimness but I know too much about the world in general and the business of getting married in particular to allow my one daughter to go into it blindly
7026-86941-0013	train-other-500	I ll be obliged to make the young man s further acquaintance Bess before we talk about an engagement The girl s scarlet lips were set in firm lines which strongly resembled the paternal expression to which she had objected she kissed her father dutifully
7026-86941-0014	train-other-500	I want you to get acquainted with him daddy she said sweetly but we are engaged That same afternoon doctor North looking worried and anxious
none	none	 after a prolonged conference with the village hypochrondriac who had come to the office fully charged with symptoms of a new and distinguished disease lately imported from Europe 
7026-86941-0015	train-other-500	found himself face to face with a tall fresh faced young man This new visitor came into the office bringing with him a breath of the wintry air and a general appearance of breezy health which caused the hypochondriac to look up sourly in the act of putting on her rubbers
7026-86941-0016	train-other-500	If that new medicine doesn t relieve that terrible feelin in my epigastrium doctor an I don t believe it s a goin to I ll let you know she remarked acidly You needn t be surprised to be called most any time between now an mornin for as I told mister Salter
7026-86941-0017	train-other-500	I ain t a goin to suffer as I did last night for nobody Good afternoon missus Salter said the doctor emphatically Now then young man what can I do for you
none	none	 The young man in question coloured boyishly I shouldn t have ventured to call upon you during your office hours doctor North but I understood from Elizabeth that you could be seen at no other time so I m here Elizabeth eh Yes yes I see I er didn t recall your face for the moment Just come into my private office for a minute or two mister Brewster these er other patients will wait a bit I fancy The worthy doctor handed his visitor a chair facing the light which he further increased by impatiently shoving the shades to the top of the windows Then he seated himself and stared keenly at the young engineer who on his part bore the scrutiny with a sturdy self possession which pleased the doctor in spite of himself Elizabeth told you of our engagement I believe sir Illustration I said to her that I couldn t and wouldn t consider an engagement between you at present She told me something of the sort yes admitted the doctor testily I said to her 
7026-86941-0018	train-other-500	that I couldn t and wouldn t consider an engagement between you at present Did she tell you that I was told that you wished to make my further acquaintance I should like if you have the time to tell you something about myself You have the right to know The doctor nodded frowningly
7026-86941-0019	train-other-500	If you expect me at any time in the future you understand to give you my only daughter I certainly am entitled to know everything The young man looked the doctor squarely in the eyes during the longish pause that followed There isn t much to tell he said
none	none	 My father and mother are dead 
7026-86941-0020	train-other-500	I have one sister older than I married to one of the best fellows in the world and living West I made my home with them till I came to the Tech You can ask any of the professors there about me They ll tell you that I worked
7026-86941-0021	train-other-500	I graduated a year ago last June Since then I ve been at work at my profession I m getting twelve hundred a year now but Stop right there Why did you ask my girl to marry you
none	none	 Because I loved her Hum 
7026-86941-0022	train-other-500	And she er fancies that she loves you eh A dark flush swept over Samuel Brewster s ingenuous young face She does love me was all he said But he said it in a tone which suddenly brought back the older man s vanished youth
7026-86941-0023	train-other-500	There was a short silence then the doctor arose so abruptly that he nearly upset his chair Well he said I ve got to go to Boston to morrow on a case and I ll see those professors of yours for one thing I know Collins well
7026-86941-0024	train-other-500	Not that he or anybody else can tell me all about you not by a long shot I know boys and young men well enough for that But you see sir I love my girl too and I I ll say good afternoon sir
none	none	 He threw the door wide with an impatient hand 
7026-86941-0025	train-other-500	Ah missus Tewksbury you re next I believe Walk right in An hour later when the door had finally closed on his last patient doctor North sat still in his chair apparently lost in thought His dinner was waiting he knew and a round of visits must be made immediately thereafter
7026-86941-0026	train-other-500	yet he did not stir He was thinking curiously enough of the time when his daughter Elizabeth was a baby What a round pink little face she had to be sure and what a strong healthy plump little body
7026-86941-0027	train-other-500	He could almost hear the unsteady feet toddling across the breadth of dingy oilcloth which carpeted his office floor Daddy daddy her sweet imperious voice was crying I m tomin to see you daddy
none	none	 His eyes were wet when he finally stumbled to his feet Then suddenly he felt a pair of warm arms about his neck 
7026-86941-0028	train-other-500	and a dozen butterfly kisses dropped on his cheeks his hair his forehead Daddy dear he came didn t he I saw him go away I hope you weren t cruel to him oh daddy
none	none	 No daughter I wasn t exactly cruel to him But didn t the young man stop to talk it over with you 
7026-86941-0029	train-other-500	No daddy I thought he would of course but he just waved his hand for good bye and I was frightened for fear
none	none	 Didn t stop to talk it over eh 
7026-86941-0030	train-other-500	Say I like that To tell you the truth Bess I rather like him Good clear steady eyes good all round constitution I should say and if Oh come come child
none	none	 we d better be getting in to dinner or your mother will be anxious 
7026-86941-0031	train-other-500	But I want you to understand miss that your old daddy has no notion of playing second fiddle to any youngster s first however tall and good looking he may be And singularly enough Elizabeth appeared to be perfectly satisfied with this paternal dictum
none	none	 I knew you d like him she said slipping her small hand into her father s big one in the little girl fashion she had never lost Why daddy he s the best man I ever knew except you of course He told me the girl s voice dropped to an awed whisper that he promised his mother when she was dying that he would never do a mean or dishonest thing And and he says daddy that whenever he has been tempted to do wrong he has felt his mother s eyes looking at him so that he couldn t Anybody would know he was good just from seeing him Hum Well well that may be so I ll talk to Collins and see what he has to say Collins is a man of very good judgment I value his opinion highly Don t you value mine daddy asked Elizabeth with an irresistible dimple appearing and disappearing at the corner of her mouth On some subjects my dear replied the doctor soberly but er on this particular one I fancy you may be slightly prejudiced CHAPTER III The question of wherewithal shall we be clothed which has vexed the world since its beginning in the garden planted eastward in Eden confronts the children of Eve so persistently at every serious crisis of life that one is forced to the conclusion that clothes sustain a very real and vital relation to destiny Even Solomon in all his glory must earnestly have considered the colour and texture of his famous robes of state when he was making ready to dazzle the eyes of the Queen of Sheba and the Jewish Esther s royal apparel and Joseph s coat of many colours played important parts in the history of a nation Elizabeth North had been engaged to be married to Samuel Brewster exactly a fortnight when the age long question presented itself to her attention It was perhaps inevitable that she should have thought speculatively of her wedding gown what girl would not But in the sweet amaze of her new and surprising happiness she might have gone on wearing her simple girlish frocks quite unaware of its relation to her wardrobe She owed her awakening to Miss Evelyn Tripp Elizabeth had known Evelyn Tripp in a distant fashion suited to the great gulf which appeared to exist between the fashionable lady from Boston who was in the habit of paying semi annual visits to Innisfield and the young daughter of the country doctor She had always regarded Miss Tripp as the epitome of all possible elegance and vaguely associated her with undreamed of festivities and privileges peculiar to the remote circles in which she moved when absent from Innisfield Miss Tripp explained her presence in the quiet village after one formula which had grown familiar to every one I was completely worn out my dear I ve just run away from a perfect whirl of receptions teas luncheons and musicales really I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown when my physician simply insisted upon my leaving it all I do find dear quiet Innisfield so relaxing after the social strain Miss Tripp s heavily italicised remarks were invariably accompanied by uplifted eyebrows and a sweetly serious expression alternating with flashing glimpses of very white teeth and further accented by numberless little movements of her hands and shoulders which suggested deeper meanings than her words often conveyed Ill natured people such as missus Buckthorn and Electa Pratt declared that Evelyn Tripp was thirty five if she was a day though she dressed like sixteen and furthermore that her social popularity in Boston was a figment of her own vivid imagination Elizabeth North however had always admired her almost reverently in the shy distant fashion of the young country bred girl Miss Tripp was unquestionably elegant and her smart gowns and the large picture hats she affected had created quite their usual sensation in Innisfield where the slow spreading ripples of fashion were viewed with a certain stern disfavour as being linked in some vague manner with irreligion of a dangerous sort She s too stylish to be good for much being the excellent missus Buckthorn s severe corollary Miss Tripp had been among the first to press friendly congratulations upon young Brewster who on his part received them with the engaging awkwardness of the unaccustomed bachelor You are certainly the most fortunate of men to have won that sweet simple Elizabeth North I ve known her since she was quite a child since we were both children in fact and she was always the same unspoiled unaffected girl so different from the young women one meets in society circles She s all of that quoth the fortunate engineer vaguely aware of a lack of flavour in Miss Tripp s encomium and er more Whereat Miss Tripp laughed archly and playfully shook a daintily gloved finger at him I can see that you think no one is capable of appreciating your prize but I assure you I do You shall see This last was a favourite phrase and conveyed quite an alluring sense of mystery linked with vague promise of unstinted benevolences on the part of Miss Tripp Do you know she added seriously I am told that you are closely related to missus J Mortimer Van Duser She is a wonderful woman so prominent in the best circles and interested in so many important charities Samuel Brewster shook his head The relationship is hardly worth mentioning he said missus Van Duser was a distant relative of my mother s But of course you see a great deal of her when you are in Boston do you not persisted the lady I dined there once acknowledged the young man vaguely uneasy and rather too obviously anxious to make his escape but I dare say she has forgotten my existence by this time missus Van Duser is as you say a very er active woman On the following day Elizabeth North encountered Miss Tripp on the street She was about to pass her after a shy salutation when Miss Tripp held out both hands in a pretty impulsive gesture I was just on my way to see you dear but if you are going out of course I ll wait till another day My dear he s simply perfect and I really couldn t wait to tell you so Do tell me when you are to be married In June I hope for then I shall be here to help Elizabeth blushed prettily her shy gaze taking in the details of Miss Tripp s modish costume She was wondering if a jacket made like the one Miss Tripp was wearing would be becoming I we haven t thought so far ahead as that she said Then with a sudden access of her new dignity mister Brewster expects to return to Boston in the spring The work here will be finished by that time Miss Tripp s eyes brightened with a speculative gleam Oh then you will live in Boston How delighted I am to hear that Did you know your fiance is related to missus Mortimer Van Duser and that he has dined there You didn t But of course you must have heard of missus Van Duser I believe your minister s wife is a relative of hers But missus Van Duser doesn t approve of missus Pettibone I m told her opinions are so odd But I am so glad for you my dear if everything is managed properly you will have an entree to the most exclusive circles Miss Tripp s eyebrows and shoulders expressed such unfeigned interest and delight in her prospects that Elizabeth beamed and smiled in her turn She wished confusedly that Miss Tripp would not talk to her about her engagement it was too sacred too wonderful a thing to discuss on the street with a mere acquaintance like Miss Tripp Yet all the while she was rosily conscious of her new ring which she could feel under her glove and a childish desire to uncover its astonishing brilliancy before such warmly appreciative eyes presently overcame her desire to escape Won t you walk home with me she asked mother will be so glad to see you Oh thank you Indeed I was coming to condole with your dear mother and to wish you all sorts of happiness I ve so often spoken of you to my friends in Boston Elizabeth wondered what Miss Tripp could possibly have said about her to her friends in Boston But she was assured by Miss Tripp s brilliant smile that it had been something agreeable When she came into the room after removing her hat and cloak she found her mother deep in conversation with the visitor who made room for her on the sofa with a smile and a graceful tilt of her plumed head We ve been talking about you every minute dear child You ll see what a sweet wedding you ll have Everything must be of the very latest and it isn t a minute too soon to begin on your trousseau You really ought to have everything hand embroidered you know those flimsy laces and machine made edges are so common you won t think of them and they don t wear a bit well either missus North glanced appealingly at her daughter Oh she said in a bewildered tone I guess Elizabeth isn t intending to be married for a long long time yet I we can t spare her Miss Tripp laughed airily Poor mamma she murmured with a look of deep sympathy it is too bad isn t it But really I m sure you re to be congratulated on your future son in law He belongs to a very aristocratic family missus Mortimer Van Duser is a relative you know and dear Betty must have everything suitable I ll do some pretty things dear I d love to and I ll begin this very day though the doctor has absolutely forbidden me to use my eyes but I simply can t resist the temptation Then she had exclaimed over the sparkle of Elizabeth s modest diamond which caught her eyes at the moment and presently in a perfumed rush of silken skirts and laces and soft furs Miss Tripp swept away chatting to the outermost verge of the frosty air in her sweet toned drawling voice so different from the harsh nasal accents familiar to Innisfield ears Elizabeth drew a deep breath as she watched the slim erect figure move lightly away She felt somehow very ignorant and countrified and totally unfit for her high destiny as a member of Boston s select circles As a result of these unwonted stirrings in her young heart she went up to her room and began to look over her wardrobe with growing dissatisfaction Her mother hearing the sound of opening and shutting drawers came into the room and stood looking on with what appeared to the girl a provokingly indifferent expression on her plump middle aged face It is really too soon to begin worrying about wedding clothes Bessie observed missus North with a show of maternal authority Of course after a doubtful silence we might begin to make up some new underclothes I ve a good firm piece of cotton in the house and we can buy some edges The girl suddenly faced her mother her pink lips thrust forward in an unbecoming pout Why mother she said don t you know people don t wear things made out of common cotton cloth now everything has to be as fine and delicate as a cobweb almost and hand embroidered You can make them or buy them in the stores Marian had some lovely things when she went to college All the girls wear them except me Of course I ve never had anything of the sort but I suppose I ll have to now She shut her bureau drawer with an air of finality and leaned her puckered forehead upon her hand while the new diamond flashed its blue and white fires into her mother s perplexed eyes We ll do the very best we can dear missus North said after a lengthening pause but your father s patients don t pay their bills very promptly and there are the boys college expenses to be met we ll have to think of that This conversation marked the beginning of many interviews gradually increasing in poignant interest to both mother and daughter It appeared that Sam as Elizabeth now called her lover with a pretty hesitancy which the young man found adorable wished to be married in June so as to take his bride with him on a trip West in which business and pleasure might be profitably combined missus North demurred weakly but doctor North was found to be on the side of the young man I don t believe in long engagements myself he had said with a certain suspicious gruffness in his tones I hoped we should have our daughter to ourselves for a while longer but she s chosen otherwise and there is no use and no need to wait We ll have to let her go wife and the sooner the better for both of them The important question being thus finally decided not only Miss Tripp but the Norths whole circle of acquaintances in Innisfield as well as the female relations near and far were found ready and anxious to engage heart and soul in Elizabeth s preparations for her wedding which had now begun in what might be well termed solemn earnest Are we going to keep house Elizabeth asked her lover in the first inrush of this new tide of experience which was soon to bear her far from the old life To keep house dear with you would be pretty close to my idea of heaven the young man had declared with all the fervour of the inexperienced bachelor I ve boarded for nearly six years now with barely a taste of home between whiles and I m tired of it Don t you want to keep house dear And Elizabeth answered quite sweetly and truly that she did I can cook she said proud of her old fashioned accomplishment in the light of her new happiness We will have just a little house to begin with and then I can do everything But a suitable house of any size in Boston was found to be quite out of the question It will have to be an apartment my dear the experienced Miss Tripp declared and I believe I know the very one in a really good neighbourhood I ll write at once You mustn t think of South Boston even if it is more convenient for mister Brewster It is so important to begin right and you know my dear you couldn t expect any one to come to see you in South Boston missus Carroll who chanced to be present was observed to compress her lips firmly Lizzie she said when the fashionable Miss Tripp had finally taken her departure after much voluble advice on the subject of the going away gown coupled with a spirited discussion of the rival merits of a church wedding and just a pretty simple home affair if I were you I shouldn t let that Evelina Kipp decide everything for me You d better make up your mind what you want to do and what you can afford to do and then do it without asking her leave It seems to me her notions are extravagant and foolish Why grandma pouted Elizabeth I think it is perfectly dear of Miss Tripp to take such an interest in my wedding I shouldn t have known what to do about lots of things and I m sure you and mother haven t an idea The girl s pretty lips curled and she moved her slim shoulders gently Your mother and I both managed to get married without Miss Fripp s advice retorted grandma tranquilly I may not have an idea as you call it but I can t see why you should have ruffled silk petticoats to all your dresses One good moreen skirt did me with a quilted alpaca for every day wear and two white ones for best And as for a dozen sets of underclothes that won t wear once they see the washtub they look foolish to me More than all that your father can t afford it and you ought to consider him Elizabeth looked up with a worried pucker between her girlish brows I don t see how I am going to help it grandma she sighed I really must have suitable clothes I agree with you there Lizzie said missus Carroll eyeing her granddaughter keenly over the top of her spectacles but you aren t going to have them if you let that Sipp girl tell you what to buy It isn t Sipp grandma it s Tripp T r i p p said Elizabeth in a long suffering tone and she knows better than any one in Innisfield possibly can what I am going to need in Boston You ll find the people in Boston won t take any particular interest in your petticoats Lizzie her grandmother told her pointedly But the girl had spied her lover coming up the walk toward the house and had flown to meet him What s the matter sweetheart asked the young man examining his treasure with the keen eyes of love You look tired and er worried Anything wrong little girl N no denied Elizabeth evasively Only grandma has such queer old fashioned ideas about clothes And she thinks I ought to have just what she had when she was married to grandfather fifty years ago Of course I want to have everything nice and suitable for Boston you know What you are wearing now is pretty enough for anywhere declared Sam Brewster with masculine obtuseness Don t you bother one minute about clothes darling you d look lovely in anything Then he kissed her faintly smiling lips with the fatuous idea that the final word as to wedding finery had been said CHAPTER IV 
7026-86943-0000	train-other-500	If you can give me just a minute Richard before you go out It was missus North s timidly apologetic voice which broke in upon her husband s hasty preparations for a day s professional engagements doctor North faced about with a laughing twinkle in his eyes
7026-86943-0001	train-other-500	I know your minutes Lizzie he said absent mindedly sniffling at the cork of a half emptied bottle This gentian s no good I ve a mind to ship it back to Avery s
none	none	 and tell them what I think of the firm for selling adulterated drugs 
7026-86943-0002	train-other-500	It s an outrage on suffering humanity
none	none	 I ll write to them anyway And he began to rummage his desk in quest of stationery I wanted to speak to you about Bessie s things persisted missus North 
7026-86943-0003	train-other-500	You know you gave me some money for her wedding clothes last month but it isn t it won t be nearly enough
none	none	 What on earth have you been buying for the child asked her husband 
7026-86943-0004	train-other-500	I should think with what she has already the money I gave you would go quite a ways That s just it sighed missus North Bessie thinks none of the things she has are suitable She hesitated a little over the hard worked word Of course living in Boston and
7026-86943-0005	train-other-500	Pooh Boston s no different from any other town put in the doctor You tell Bess I said so She doesn t need to worry about Boston
none	none	 He plumped down in his office chair and began an indignant protest addressed to the firm of Avery company Wholesale Druggists and Dealers in Surgical Supplies I haven t bought any of her best dresses yet sighed missus North and she wants an all over lace for her wedding dress 
7026-86943-0007	train-other-500	Miss Tripp says they re very much worn now She paused suggestively while the doctor s pen raced busily over his page You didn t hear what I said did you Richard she ventured after a while Yes m dear heard every word you were saying you d bought Bess a lace wedding dress
7026-86943-0008	train-other-500	and that Miss Tripp says they re very much worn replied her husband fixing on a stamp with a sounding thump of his big fist Glad to hear it Well I ll have to be moving now Good bye m dear home to dinner if I can if not
7026-86943-0009	train-other-500	If you could let me have two hundred and fifty dollars Richard said missus North rather faintly we ll try to manage with that for the present Well now Lizzie when it comes to your wanting anything I always get it for you if I can and you know that
7026-86943-0010	train-other-500	but I sent off cheques to Frank and Elliot this morning and I m what you d call strapped Couldn t you collect The doctor kissed his wife cheerfully How can I wifey when folks leave their doctor s bills till the last cent s paid to everybody else
7026-86943-0011	train-other-500	Don t know as I blame em it s hard enough to be sick without having to pay out money for it now isn t it Oh Dick if that isn t just like you But I I ve thought of a way Good What is it We might borrow some money on the house
7026-86943-0012	train-other-500	Other people do and Mortgage our house for wedding finery I guess you re joking Lizzie At any rate I ll call it a joke and let it pass Good bye The quick slam of the office door put a conclusive finish to the doctor s words
7026-86943-0013	train-other-500	and his wife went back to her work on one of Elizabeth s elaborate garments with a heavy heart What did Richard say Grandma Carroll wanted to know when the girl had gone into another room to be fitted He said he couldn t possibly let me have anything more just now said Richard s wife with a shade of reserve in her voice
7026-86943-0014	train-other-500	You know mother people are so slow in paying their bills The doctor has any amount outstanding if he could only get it Such folks had ought to be made to pay before they get ary a pill or a powder
none	none	 same s they do for what made em sick They d find money for the doctor quick enough once they had a right sharp pain from over eating 
7026-86943-0015	train-other-500	was grandma s trenchant opinion But I expected he d say that all along and I wanted to give you this for Lizzie She slipped a little roll of bills into her daughter s lap Don t say anything to the child about it she whispered nodding her kind old head it would worry her
7026-86943-0016	train-other-500	Besides I don t approve of the amount of money she s putting into perishable things
none	none	 I meant to buy her a real good clock or a nice solid piece of furniture 
7026-86943-0017	train-other-500	but if she d rather have lace frills that ll fall to pieces in the washtub
none	none	 I m willing she should learn by experience same s we ve had to do before her 
7026-86943-0018	train-other-500	missus North s eyes were moist and shining It s what you ve been putting by for years mother she whispered for Hush said grandma I guess when it comes right down to it I m full as foolish as Lizzie
7026-86943-0019	train-other-500	Once I set foot in the golden streets I know I sha n t mind whether I leave a marble monument in the cemetery or not and you don t need to either daughter Now remember
7026-86943-0020	train-other-500	Upon this hushed conversation entered Elizabeth in a flutter of excitement and rosy pleasure over a letter which the postman had just handed her
none	none	 It is from Evelyn Tripp she said and she wants me to come to Boston and stay a week with her 
7026-86943-0021	train-other-500	she says she will help me pick out all my dresses and I d better have my wedding dress and my going away gown made there anyway Isn t that lovely Then as she met her mother s dubious gaze You know Malvina Bennett hasn t a particle of style
7026-86943-0022	train-other-500	and we don t know anything about the best places to buy things in Boston or the dressmakers or anything I ve shopped in Boston for years said missus North with a show of firmness and I m sure everything at Cooper s gives perfect satisfaction Oh Cooper s laughed the girl
7026-86943-0023	train-other-500	Why mother dear nobody goes to Cooper s nowadays It s just for country people from out of town What are we I d like to know Grandma Carroll wanted to know with a humorous twinkle in her shrewd eyes I shouldn t wonder if you d better do your shopping with your mother Lizzie
none	none	 her judgment would likely be quite as good as that Tipp girl s 
7026-86943-0024	train-other-500	and more in a line with what you can afford You should remember that Samuel isn t a rich man and you ll need good substantial dresses that ll last I remember I had a blue Russell cord poplin when I was married
7026-86943-0025	train-other-500	that I wore for fifteen years then I made it over for your mother and she looked as pretty as a pink in it for two more then she outgrew it and I gave it away but the cloth in it was as good as new A dress like that pays Elizabeth laughed somewhat impatiently
7026-86943-0026	train-other-500	I ve heard about that wonderful poplin ever since I can remember she said
none	none	 I wonder you didn t save it for me But I don t want to buy any dresses that will last for fifteen years 
7026-86943-0027	train-other-500	I m sure Sam can buy me more dresses when I want them I may go to Boston mayn t I mother missus North looked wistfully at the pretty eager face She had looked forward with pleasure somewhat tempered it is true by the knowledge of her meagre resources yet still with pleasure
none	none	 to the choosing of her daughter s wedding gown with all its dainty accessories of tulle and lace 
7026-86943-0028	train-other-500	I had thought of a silk muslin she said rather faintly or perhaps a cream satin if you d like it better dear and I shouldn t like either of those said the girl decidedly and there s so much to do that it will really save time if you don t have to bother with any of that Evelyn
none	none	 it was Evelyn and Elizabeth now says chiffon over liberty satin would be lovely 
7026-86943-0029	train-other-500	if I can t afford the lace Of course I wouldn t buy a cheap lace That night when doctor North came home he tossed a handful of bills into his daughter s lap For the wedding gown Bess he said worse luck that you want one Oh why do you say that you darling daddy murmured the girl
7026-86943-0030	train-other-500	when I m going to be so happy She was radiantly happy now it appeared and the doctor s keen eyes grew moist as he looked at her Guess I was thinking about myself principally he confessed gruffly and about your mother
none	none	 We re going to be lonesome and I don t like to think of it The girl s bright face clouded 
7026-86943-0031	train-other-500	The boys will be at home summers she said and I ll come back to visit often you know I sha n t be far away daddy She clung to him for a minute without a word a faint realisation of the irrevocable change so near at hand sweeping over her Of course you will Betsey Jane
none	none	 vociferated the doctor affecting a vast jocularity for the purpose of concealing his feelings which threatened to become unmanageable If you don t show up in Innisfield about once in so often I ll come to Boston with my bag and give that young robber a dose that will make his hair curl 
7026-86943-0032	train-other-500	The next day the bride elect journeyed to Boston carrying what appeared to her a small fortune in her little hand bag You ve all been so good she said I can just buy everything I need with all this Evelyn Tripp met Elizabeth in South Station with open arms
none	none	 How well you are looking you darling 
7026-86943-0033	train-other-500	she exclaimed effusively Now if we can only keep those roses through all the shopping and dressmaking It is so exhausting
none	none	 but I ve everything planned for you down to the last frill and Madame Pryse 
7026-86943-0034	train-other-500	has at last consented to make your gowns If you knew what I ve been through with that woman She simply will not take a new customer but when I mentioned the fact that you were to marry a nephew of missus Mortimer Van Duser she finally capitulated
7026-86943-0035	train-other-500	I could have embraced her But
none	none	 Sam isn t missus Van Duser s nephew Evelyn 
7026-86943-0036	train-other-500	I believe his mother was missus Van Duser s second cousin Oh well that doesn t signify I m sure I had to say something convincing
none	none	 and missus Van Duser was my dernier resort Pryse will do anything for you now you ll see my dear And oh Betty dear when I was in at Altford s yesterday I just chanced upon the most wonderful bargain in a lace robe and had it sent up on approval The most exquisite thing and marked down from a hundred and twenty seven dollars to what do you think only eighty nine fifty I was so pleased for I am sure it is just what you want I got samples too of the most bewitching silks for your dinner gown you must have at least one you know a simple pretty crepe de chine or something of the sort and then with a little frock or two for luncheons and card parties your tailor made that must be good and your wedding gown for evening affairs you will do nicely But Evelyn interrupted Elizabeth timidly I m afraid I can t You know I didn t expect to buy but two dresses in Boston Malvina Bennett is making me a black silk and Miss Tripp paused to smile and bow at a passing acquaintance then she turned protesting eyes upon the girl You dear child she murmured you re not to worry about a single thing That s just what I mean to spare you I am determined you shall have just what you are going to need and if you haven t enough money with you I can arrange everything at Altford s without a bit of trouble and of course you will pay Pryse her bill when it is perfectly convenient for you She doesn t expect to be paid promptly Really I don t believe she would have a particle of respect for a patron who insisted upon paying for a gown the minute it was finished First class modistes and milliners too are all that way they know better than to send their bills too soon So that needn t bother you dear and of course Pryse finds everything which will save enormously on your outlay Elizabeth felt very meek and hopelessly countrified as she laid off her wraps in Miss Tripp s rather stuffy but ornate little apartment missus Tripp a faded apologetic person smelling of rice powder and sachet smiled vaguely upon her and murmured something about Evy s wonderful taste One thing at least was clear to Elizabeth as she lay wide eyed in the darkness that night after an evening spent in the confusing examination and comparison of fashion plates and samples and that was the conviction that the fortune with which she had joyfully set forth that morning had dwindled to a pitiful insufficiency before the multiplied necessities imposed upon it by Miss Tripp s undeniable taste and knowledge She almost wished she had chosen to do her shopping with her mother and Grandma Carroll as she realised that she would be obliged to write home for more money But it was too late to change her mind now and after all Evelyn knew best as to what a bride about to move in polite circles in Boston would require She went to sleep at last and dreamed of standing up to be married in a Russell cord poplin whatever that wonderful fabric might be which had already done duty for fifteen years and was as good as new CHAPTER V As the twenty first day of June drew on apace Fate in the slim active personality of Miss Evelyn Tripp appeared to have taken the entire North household firmly in hand Events marched on in orderly if surprising sequence beginning with the issuing of the invitations bearing the name of Boston s most expensive firm of engravers on the flap of the inner envelope Every one looks for that the very first thing Miss Tripp had announced conclusively and one simply couldn t have the name of a department store or a cheap engraver The correct Miss Tripp shuddered at the awful picture But these are so much more expensive than I had expected demurred missus North with a worried sigh I had intended ordering them at Cooper s they do them just as well there Don t they sometimes leave off the name Miss Tripp bestowed a pitying smile upon the questioner Indeed they do dear missus North she replied indulgently but that is merely a subterfuge one always suspects the worst when there is no name It pays to have the best This latter undeniable dictum was found to be entirely applicable to every detail of the forthcoming festivities and involved such a multiplicity of expensive items that Grandma Carroll was openly indignant and her more pliant daughter reduced to a state of bewildered apathy I ve been wanting to say to you for a long time Miss Phipps that our Lizzie isn t a fashionable girl and that her father is a poor man and can t afford such doings missus Carroll protested in no uncertain tones Now I can t for the life of me see why we should have an organist from Boston to play the wedding march when Liddy Green can do it just as well and her feelings is going to be hurt if she doesn t and as for a florist from Newton Centre to decorate the church the young folks in the Sunday school would be glad to go to the woods after greens and they ll put em up for nothing It s going to cost enough the land knows but there s no use of piling up unnecessary expenses Miss Tripp smiled winningly upon the exasperated old lady Nothing is too good for dear Elizabeth now she murmured and you know dear missus Carroll that a number of Boston people will be here missus Van Duser we hope and others Grandma Carroll fixed piercing eyes upon the indefatigable Evelyn Of course you mean well she said crisply but if I was you I d take a rest I m afraid you re getting all tuckered out doing so much And considering that you ain t any relation I guess I d let Lizzie s own folks tend to the wedding from now on There was no mistaking the meaning of this plain speech For an instant Evelyn Tripp s faded cheeks glowed with mortified colour then she recovered herself with a shrug of her elegant shoulders Who after all was missus Carroll to interfere in this unwarranted manner It is so sweet of you to think of poor little me dear missus Carroll she said caressingly And indeed I am worn almost to a fringe but I am promising myself a good long rest after everything is over Nothing would induce me to leave dear Elizabeth now She couldn t possibly get along without me She dropped a forgiving kiss on top of Grandma Carroll s cap and flitted away before that justly indignant lady could reply Miss Tripp was right It would have been impossible for the unsophisticated Norths to have completed the arrangements for the entirely correct wedding which Miss Tripp had planned and was carrying through in the face of unnumbered obstacles As to the motives which upheld her in her altruistic efforts in behalf of Elizabeth North Miss Tripp was not entirely clear It is not always desirable if possible to classify and label one s actual motives and Miss Tripp for one rarely attempted the task A vague emptiness of purpose a vast weariness of the unending routine of her own somewhat disappointing career a real if superficial kindness of heart and back of all an entirely unacknowledged ambition to attain to that sacred inner circle of Boston society wherein revolved the august missus Mortimer Van Duser with other lesser luminaries about the acknowledged hub of the universe toward which Miss Tripp had hitherto gravitated like a humble asteroid small unnoticed yet aspiring One of the irreproachable invitations had been duly sent to missus Van Duser but as yet there had been no visible token that it had been received Won t you ask mister Brewster if he will not add a personal invitation entreated Miss Tripp of the bride elect who had appeared alarmingly indifferent when the importance of this hoped for guest was duly set forth in her hearing You don t seem to realise what it would mean to you both to have missus Van Duser present Let me persuade him to write or perhaps better to call one cannot be too attentive to a person in her position But Sam Brewster had merely laughed and pulled the little curl behind his sweetheart s ear when she spoke of missus Van Duser Really I don t care whether the old lady comes or not he said without meaning any disrespect She s a stiff uncomfortable sort of person you wouldn t like her Betty I went there to dinner once and my word it was enough for me But persisted Elizabeth mindful of Miss Tripp s solemn exhortations if she s a relation of yours oughtn t you to She was mother s second cousin I believe not much of a relation to me you see And seriously little girl we can t travel in her class at all and we don t want to even if we could But why demanded Elizabeth slightly piqued by his tone don t you think I am good enough You re a hundred times too good in my opinion And the young engineer kissed the pouting lips with an earnestness which admitted of no teasing doubts It s only that missus Van D is rich and proud and er queer and that she won t take any notice of us I m glad you sent her an invitation though that was a civil acknowledgment of a slight obligation on my side I hope she won t send us a present and I don t believe she will The two were examining the bewildering array of glittering objects which had been arriving steadily for a week past by mail and express in cases left by Boston firms and in dainty boxes tied with white ribbons from near by friends and neighbours The nebulous reports of Elizabeth s wedding outfit circulated from mouth to mouth and expanding in rainbow tints as they travelled were reflected in the shining cut glass and silver which was spread out before the wondering eyes of the young couple When Aunt Miranda Carroll heard that Elizabeth s trousseau included a dozen of everything all hand embroidered a lace wedding dress that cost over a hundred dollars and a pale blue velvet dinner gown lined with taffeta she instantly abandoned the idea she had in mind of four dozen fine cotton sheets six dozen pillow slips and fifty good substantial huck towels in favour of a cut glass punch bowl of gigantic proportions It would be just the thing for parties in Boston her daughter Marian thought And Uncle Caleb North at the urgent advice of his wife who had heard in the meantime from Aunt Miranda exchanged his cheque for a hundred dollars for a chest of silver knives with mother of pearl handles They looked so much richer than the cheque which would have to be concealed in an inconspicuous envelope Following the shining example of Aunt Miranda and Uncle Caleb other relatives of lesser substance contributed cut glass bowls and dishes of every conceivable design and for every known contingency silver forks and spoons of singular shapes and sizes suggesting elaborate course luncheons and fashionable dinners While of lace trimmed and embroidered centre pieces and doylies there was a plenitude which would have set forth a modest linen draper Fragile vases hand painted fans perfume bottles silver trifles of unimagined uses sofa pillows and gilt clocks crowded the tables and overflowed onto the floor and mantelpiece Elizabeth surveyed the collection with sparkling eyes Aren t they lovely she demanded slipping her hand within her lover s arm and aren t you surprised Sam to see how many friends we have Yes I am awfully surprised acknowledged the young man His brows were drawn over meditative eyes as he examined a shining carving set with impossible ivory handles What are we going to do with them all he propounded at length Do with them Why use them I suppose responded Elizabeth vaguely Do see these darling little cups all gold and roses and these coffee spoons with enamelled handles these make eight dozen coffee spoons Sam Hum mused the unappreciative engineer We might set up a restaurant as far as coffee spoons go Elizabeth was bending rapturously over a lace fan sewn thick with spangles I feel so rich with all these lovely things she murmured I never dreamed of having so many She made such an exquisite picture in her glowing youth amid the sparkle and glitter of the dainty trifles that it is little wonder that Samuel Brewster lost his usually level head for the moment You ought always to have all the pretty things you want darling he whispered for you are the prettiest and sweetest girl alive Later in the day the ubiquitous Miss Tripp was discovered in the act of artfully concealing missus Carroll s gift made by her own faithful hands under a profusion of lace edged doylies lately arrived from a distant cousin There she exclaimed with an air of relief those big gingham aprons and the dish towels and dusters did look so absurd with all the other lovely things they won t show now And she planted a silver fern dish in the midst and surveyed the effect with her head tilted thoughtfully Wasn t it quaint of missus Carroll to make all those useful things You can give them to your maid afterward they always expect to be found in aprons nowadays if not frocks Really I draw the line at frocks with the wages one is obliged to pay and I should advise you to I m not going to have a maid said Elizabeth I can cook and I like to Miss Tripp whirled about and caught the girl in her arms with an amused laugh You dear romantic child she cried Did it have the prettiest dreams about love in a cottage and the young wife with her sleeves rolled up cooking delicious impossibilities for a doting husband That s all very well my dear but seriously it won t do in a Boston apartment house You won t have a minute to yourself after the season once begins and of course after a while you ll be expected to entertain quite simply you know a luncheon or two with cards possibly a dinner you can do it beautifully with all these lovely things for your table I ll help you so don t get frightened at the idea But fancy your doing all that without a maid You mustn t think of it And I am sure dear missus Van Duser will give you the same advice The soft pink in Elizabeth s cheeks deepened to rose missus Van Duser isn t coming to the wedding she said in a faintly defiant tone Oh Did she send you She sent regrets said Elizabeth coldly Miss Tripp s eyebrows expressed the profoundest disappointment I am so sorry she murmured suddenly aware that she was exceedingly weary of the North wedding It will spoil everything I can t see why returned Elizabeth with spirit not realising that Miss Tripp s comment applied solely to her own feelings It won t prevent my being married to Sam and Sam says he is glad she is not coming She must be a stiff pokey sort of a person and I am sure it will be pleasanter without her She isn t hardly any relation to Sam anyway and I don t think I care to know her My dear expostulated Miss Tripp you ll see things very differently some day I hope And I am glad to say that these relationships do count in Boston if not in other parts of the world and you cannot prevent people from knowing that they exist Like a skilful general Miss Tripp was sweeping her field clear of her disappointment preparatory to marshalling her forces for a new campaign Did missus Van Duser send cards or did she She wrote a note a stiff disagreeable note Would you mind showing it to me dear Elizabeth produced a thick white envelope from the little embroidered pocket at her belt You may read it she said then I mean to tear it up Miss Tripp bent almost worshipful eyes upon the large square sheet missus J Mortimer Van Duser she read begs to convey her acknowledgments to doctor and missus North for their invitation to the marriage of their daughter and regrets that she cannot be present missus Van Duser begs to add that she will communicate further with mister and missus Samuel Brewster upon their arrival in Boston upon a matter of moment to them both Isn t that a disagreeable sounding note demanded Elizabeth her pretty chin tilted at an aggressive angle I just know I shouldn t like her from that letter But I m sure I can t think what she wants to say to us upon our arrival in Boston My dear exclaimed Miss Tripp with a horrified stare what can you be thinking of That note is in the most perfect form I am so glad you showed it to me Something of moment to you both what can it mean but a gift perhaps a generous cheque and undoubtedly a reception to introduce you My dear missus Van Duser is said to be worth millions and what is more and far far better she moves in the most exclusive society You dear lucky girl I congratulate you upon the recognition you have received Tear it up indeed you will do nothing of the sort I ll put it here right by this cut glass vase where every one will see it Elizabeth pouted Mother didn t like it she said and grandma laughed over it and Sam told me to forget it I don t see why you Because I know intoned Miss Tripp solemnly I only hope you won t forget poor little me when you re fairly launched in missus Van Duser s set Elizabeth gazed reflectively at her friend Oh I couldn t forget you she said you ve been so good to me But she added with what Miss Tripp mentally termed delicious naivete I don t suppose we shall give many large parties just at first CHAPTER VI I am of the opinion wrote the sapient doctor Johnson that marriages would in general be as happy and often more so if they were all made by the Lord Chancellor upon a due consideration of the circumstances and characters without the parties thereto having any choice in the matter That this radical matrimonial reform did not find favour in the eyes of his own or any succeeding generation brands it as visionary impracticable not to be seriously entertained in short by any one not a philosopher and not himself in love But could the benevolent shade of doctor Johnson be let into the details of a fashionable modern wedding it is safe to predict that he might recommend a new civic function to be administered either by the Lord Chancellor or by some equally responsible person for the purpose of regulating by sumptuary law the bridal trousseau and the wedding presents The renowned Georgian sage could not fail to recognise the relation which these too often unconsidered items bear to the welfare of the private citizen in particular and to the weal of mankind in general And who can deny that all legislation is or should be centred chiefly on these very ends Illustration Never had there been such a wedding in Innisfield Such sober reflections as the above though perhaps forming an unavoidable background in the minds of several of the older persons present did not cloud the rapturous happiness of Elizabeth Carroll North as she paced slowly up the aisle of the Innisfield Presbyterian church on the arm of her father the folds of her Pryse gown as Miss Tripp was careful to designate it sweeping gracefully behind her The bridesmaids in pale rose colour and the maid of honour in white the tiny flower girls bearing baskets of roses the ushers with their boutonnieres of orange buds the waving palms and the sounding music each represented a separate Waterloo fought and won by the Napoleonic Miss Tripp who looked on wan but self satisfied from a modest position in the audience Never had there been such a wedding in Innisfield Everybody said so in loud buzzing whispers Sadie Buckthorn who was engaged to Milton Scrymger informed her mamma that she should be married in church in October and that her bridesmaids should wear yellow And Bob Garrett a clerk in a Boston department store told his sweetheart that he guessed the wedding was about their speed and added that he knew a swell floor walker who would look simply great as best man As for the young couple chiefly concerned they might have walked on air instead of on the roses strewed in their path by the little flower girls and the hundreds of curious eyes fastened upon them were as dim painted eyes upon a tapestried wall They only saw each other and the gate of that ancient Eden of the race opening before them That same evening after all was over and when as the village reporter phrased it with happy originality the young couple had departed upon their wedding journey amid showers of rice and roses doctor North sought his tired wife busy clearing away the tokens of the late festivities Come Lizzie he said kindly we may as well get what rest we can to morrow ll be another day and we ve got to go jogging on about our middle aged business as usual missus North looked up at him with tearful eyes I can t seem to realise that Bessie s gone to stay she said tremulously I just caught myself thinking what I d say to her when she came home and what we d Richard North passed his arm about the wife of his youth I hope he ll be good to her he said his voice shaken with feeling I I believe he s all right If he isn t I ll He shrugged his broad shoulders impatiently Oh I m not a bit worried about Sam said missus North I know enough about men But O Dick I m going to miss my baby He held her close for a minute while she sobbed on his shoulder then the two went slowly up the stairs together leaving the disordered rooms and the fading roses in the luminous dark of the June night The Boston apartment to which young Samuel Brewster brought his bride in the early part of September was of Miss Evelyn Tripp s choosing The engineer had demurred at its distance from his work but Elizabeth had said she preferred to be near Evelyn and Evelyn said that the location if not strictly fashionable was at least near the people they ought to know The rent was thirty eight dollars a month And the rooms were small inconvenient and old fashioned But as Miss Tripp kindly pointed out if one is obliged to choose between a small old fashioned suite in a really good locality and a light airy one in the unfashionable suburbs of South Boston one ought not to hesitate missus North and Grandma Carroll had seen to putting the furnishings in place and when the two arrived at the close of a hot afternoon they found everything in the exquisite order with which Elizabeth had been happily familiar all her life She ran from room to room laughing and crying in the same breath Oh Sam dear do see there is ice in the refrigerator and a cunning little jar of cream and a print of butter and here is a roast chicken and some of grandma s rolls and one of mother s delicious lemon pies How hard they must have worked I ll put on one of these big aprons and we ll have supper in no time And Sam Brewster as he watched his wife s pretty little figure moving lightly about her new kitchen heaved a mighty sigh of content It seems almost too good to be true he murmured And to think it is for always It was not until they had eaten their first blissful meal together and had washed the dishes also together in the dark little kitchen an operation in which the young engineer covered himself with glory in his masterly handling of the dish towel that Elizabeth discovered a large square envelope bearing the Van Duser crest and addressed to herself She opened it in the circle of Sam s arms as the two reposed on their one small sofa in the room bearing the dignified title of reception hall Why what in the name of common sense is she giving us was Sam Brewster s startled exclamation as his quick eye took in the contents of the sheet I I don t understand gasped Elizabeth growing hot and cold and faint I can t think how it could have happened Yet missus Van Duser s words though few were sufficiently succinct They were inspired as she afterward confided to her rector doctor Gallatin by the most altruistic sentiments of which the human heart is capable Truth missus Van Duser had enunciated majestically never finds itself at a loss And in administering so just a rebuke to a young person manifestly appointed to fill a humble station in life I feel that I am in a measure assuming the prerogatives of Providence In this exalted role missus Van Duser had written to Elizabeth North whose miserable shamed eyes avoided those of her husband after she had realised its contents The letter enclosed a bill for one hundred and twenty five dollars from Madame Leonie Pryse for the material making and findings for one blue velvet reception gown There was a pencilled note attached to the effect that as Madame Pryse had been referred to missus Van Duser she begged to present the bill with the hope that it would be settled at an early date missus Van Duser s own majestic hand had added a brief communication over which the young engineer scowled fiercely He read As missus Brewster s personal expenses either before or after her marriage can have no possible interest for missus Van Duser missus Van Duser begs to bring to missus Brewster s attention the enclosed statement missus Van Duser wishes to inform missus Brewster that she has taken the pains to send for the tradeswoman in question and that she has elicited from her facts which seem to show an entire misapprehension of the commoner ethical requirements on the part of the person addressed missus Van Duser begs to add in the interests of society at large and of the person in whom as a distant relative she has interested herself somewhat that she distinctly frowns upon all extravagance missus Van Duser trusts that this communication which she begs to assure missus Brewster is penned in a spirit of Christian charity will effectually prevent further errors on the part of so young and inexperienced a person as missus Brewster appears to be Well Samuel Brewster s blue eyes grown unexpectedly keen and penetrating rested questioningly upon his bride Don t look at me like that please Sam faltered Elizabeth I I didn t mean to buy that dress truly I didn t I had paid for all the others and I had twenty seven dollars left and Evelyn told me that Madame Pryse had a a remnant of blue velvet which she would make up for me for a song And I let her do it I thought she would send the bill to me and I would Did she send it to you Y yes twice But Evelyn said for me not to worry She said Madame Pryse s customers never paid her right away and there was so much else just at the last I didn t like to ask daddy Uncle Caleb always gives me fifty dollars for my birthday and I thought Elizabeth s voice had grown fainter as she proceeded with her halting explanations But she started up with a little cry Oh Sam what are you going to do For her husband was examining the bill with an expression about his mouth which she had never seen there before I don t see that you have been credited with the twenty seven dollars he said quietly Then with a sorry attempt at a smile These mesdames appear to pile up the items sky high when it comes to building a gown better have a cast iron contract with em I should say and pay up when the job s finished Elizabeth s tear stained face was hidden on her husband s shoulder I I spent the twenty seven dollars for for gloves she confessed Evelyn said I didn t have enough long ones Confound Evelyn said the young man strongly Come Betty dear you re not to let this thing bother you it isn t worth it I ll pay this bill to morrow It s lucky I ve the money in the bank and I ll write to missus Van D too He clenched his fist as though he would like to use something more powerful than his pen But Sam you oughtn t to I can t let you pay for Well I guess I can buy my wife a dress if I want to and that blue velvet s a stunner You haven t worn it yet have you dear but when you do you ll look like a posy in it Come sweetheart this was a tough proposition I ll admit but don t you let it bowl you over completely And Betty you won t tell the Tripp lady about it will you I er couldn t stand for that you know Elizabeth stole one look at the strong kind face bent toward her For the first time though happily not for the last she was realising the immense the immeasurable comfort to be found in her husband s love I ll never do such a thing again she quavered I knew all the time I was being extravagant but I didn t expect I never supposed You couldn t very well have foreseen the Pryse woman s astonishing business methods nor missus Van D s Christian forbearance His tone was bitter as he spoke the last words But what I can t seem to understand is how that bill ever found its way to my esteemed sixteenth cousin Elizabeth s eyes overflowed again I m afraid it was Evelyn she stammered She told Madame Pryse that you were missus Van Duser s nephew Sam Brewster whistled Then he fell into a fit of revery so prolonged that Elizabeth nestled uneasily in the strong circle of his arm He was reviewing the events of the immediate past in the cold light of the present and the result was not altogether complimentary to Miss Tripp I say little girl he said at length looking down at the tear stained face against his shoulder I don t want to be disagreeable but er I can t for the life of me see why Miss Tripp should interest herself so intimately in our affairs Don t you think you might er discourage her a bit Elizabeth sighed reminiscently I wouldn t hurt Evelyn s feelings for the world she said but I I ll try CHAPTER VII The very next morning as Elizabeth was engaged in putting the finishing touches upon the arrangements of her new home with all the keen delight of nest building so strong in some women and so utterly lacking in others Miss Evelyn Tripp was announced and a moment later stepped airily from the laborious little elevator Oh here you are at last you darling girl she exclaimed clasping and kissing Elizabeth with empressement I knew you were expected last night indeed I was here all the morning helping 
7026-86946-0000	train-other-500	but as I told your mother and that dear quaint grandmamma of yours
none	none	 I wouldn t have intruded upon your very first evening for the world 
7026-86946-0001	train-other-500	How delightfully well and pretty you are looking and isn t this the sweetest little place and oh I nearly forgot did you find missus Van Duser s note I assure you I pounced upon that
none	none	 and took good care to put it where you would both see it the very first thing I don t mind confessing that I am simply devoured with curiosity Was it a cheque dear 
7026-86946-0002	train-other-500	And is she going to do something nice for you in a social way Elizabeth s cheeks burned uncomfortably It was only a a friendly at least I think I am sure she meant it to be a friendly letter She said so anyway
none	none	 Sam put it in his pocket and took it away with him she made haste to add 
7026-86946-0003	train-other-500	forestalling the urgent appeal in Miss Tripp s luminous gaze Well I am sure that was most sweet and gracious of missus Van Duser Didn t you find it so my dear So dear of her to personally welcome you to Boston You ll call of course as soon as she returns from her country place
7026-86946-0004	train-other-500	She will expect it I am sure
none	none	 such women are most punctilious in their code of social requirements and you can t be too careful not to offend 
7026-86946-0005	train-other-500	You ll forgive me for saying this much won t you dear Elizabeth was conscious of a distinct sense of displeasure as she met Miss Tripp s anxiously solicitous eyes
none	none	 You are very good Evelyn she said 
7026-86946-0006	train-other-500	but Sam mister Brewster thinks it will be best for us not to She paused her candid face suffused with blushes I d prefer not to talk about missus Van Duser if you please We don t ever expect to go and see her
7026-86946-0007	train-other-500	The tactful Miss Tripp looked sadly puzzled but she felt that it would not be the part of wisdom to press the issue for the moment Her face wreathed itself anew in forgiving smiles as she flitted about the little rooms
7026-86946-0008	train-other-500	Isn t this the most convenient cosy little apartment she twittered I am so glad I was able to secure it for you I assure you I was obliged to use all of my diplomacy with the agent And your pretty things do light up the dark corners so nicely
7026-86946-0009	train-other-500	And speaking of corners somehow reminds me I have found you a perfect treasure of a maid but you must take her at once She s a cousin of our Marie and has always been employed by the best people She was with missus Paget Smythe last
none	none	 I believe 
7026-86946-0010	train-other-500	She told Marie last night that she would be willing to come to you for only twenty dollars a month and that s very reasonable considering the fact that she is willing to do part of the laundry work the towels sheets and plain things you know Expensive Indeed it s not dear
7026-86946-0011	train-other-500	for Boston Why I could tell you of plenty of people who are glad to pay twenty five and put all their laundry out I d advise you to engage Annita without delay Really you couldn t do better Elizabeth shook her head
7026-86946-0012	train-other-500	I mean to do my own work she said decidedly I shall want something to do while Sam is away and why not this when I like it But you won t like it after a while my poor child when the shine is once worn off your new pans and things
7026-86946-0013	train-other-500	and think of your hands It s absolutely impossible to keep one s nails in any sort of condition and besides the heat from the gas range is simply ruinous for the complexion Didn t you know that Of course you are all milk and roses now
7026-86946-0014	train-other-500	but how long do you suppose that will last if you are to be cooped up in a hot stuffy little kitchen from morning till night Miss Tripp paused dramatically her eyes wide with sympathy and apprehension But we I am sure we oughtn t to afford to keep a maid
7026-86946-0015	train-other-500	demurred Elizabeth in a small weak voice So please don t Oh of course it is nothing to me my dear
none	none	 and Miss Tripp arose with a justly offended air 
7026-86946-0016	train-other-500	I thought I was doing you a kindness when I asked Annita to call and see you this morning It will be perfectly easy for you to tell her that you don t care to engage her But when it comes to affording I think you can scarcely afford to waste your good looks over a cooking range
7026-86946-0017	train-other-500	It is your duty to your husband to keep yourself young and lovely as long as you possibly can It is only too easy to lose it all and then Miss Tripp concluded her remarks with a shrug of her shapely shoulders
7026-86946-0018	train-other-500	which aroused the too impressionable Elizabeth to vague alarms I am sure faltered the bride of two months that Sam would like me just as well even if I Of course you think so dear every woman does till it is too late observed Miss Tripp plaintively
7026-86946-0019	train-other-500	I m sure I hope it will turn out differently in your case But I could tell you things about some of my married friends that would Well all I have to say is that I never dared try it matrimony I mean and if I were in your place But there I mustn t meddle
7026-86946-0020	train-other-500	I solemnly promised myself years and years ago that I wouldn t The trouble with me is that I love my friends too fondly and I simply cannot endure to see them making mistakes which might so easily have been avoided I m coming to take you out to morrow
7026-86946-0021	train-other-500	and we ll lunch down town in the nicest most inexpensive little place And dear if you finally decide not to engage Annita would you mind telling her that through a slight misunderstanding you had secured some one else
7026-86946-0022	train-other-500	These high class servants are so easily offended you know and on account of our Marie a perfect treasure Oh thank you
none	none	 Au revoir 
7026-86946-0023	train-other-500	till to morrow Perhaps it is not altogether to be wondered at that immediately after Miss Tripp s departure Elizabeth found occasion to glance into her mirror Yes she was undoubtedly prettier than ever she decided but suppose it should be true
7026-86946-0024	train-other-500	about the withering heat of the gas range and then there were the rose tinted polished nails to which Elizabeth had only lately begun to pay particular attention The day s work had already left perceptible blemishes upon their dainty perfection
7026-86946-0025	train-other-500	Elizabeth recalled her mother s hands marred with constant household labour with a kind of terror Her own would look the same before many years had passed and would Sam could he love her just the same when the delicate beauty of which he was so fond and proud had faded
7026-86946-0026	train-other-500	And what after all was twenty dollars a month when one looked upon it as the price of one s happiness Elizabeth sat down soberly with pencil and paper to contemplate the matter arithmetically
none	none	 Thirty eight dollars for rent and twenty dollars for a maid subtracted from one hundred and twenty 
7026-86946-0027	train-other-500	the latter sum representing the young engineer s monthly salary left an undeniable balance of sixty two dollars to be expended in food clothing and other expenses After half an hour of careful calculation
7026-86946-0028	train-other-500	based on what she could remember of Innisfield prices Elizabeth had reached very satisfactory conclusions Clothing would cost next to nothing for the first year at least and food for two came to a ridiculously small sum
7026-86946-0029	train-other-500	There appeared in short to be a very handsome remainder left over for what Sam called contingencies This would include of course the fixed amount which they had prudently resolved to lay by on the arrival of every cheque This much had already been settled between them
7026-86946-0030	train-other-500	Sam had a promising nest egg in a Boston bank and both had dreams of its ultimate hatching into a house and lot or into some comfortable interest bearing bonds Elizabeth was firmly resolved to be prudent
7026-86946-0031	train-other-500	and helpful to her husband in every possible way but was it not her duty to keep herself young and lovely as long as possible The idea so cogently presented to her attention by Miss Tripp not an hour since
none	none	 appeared to have become so much her own that she did not recognise it as borrowed property It was at this psychological instant that a second summons announced the presence of a certain Annita McMurtry in the entrance hall below Did missus Brewster wish to see this person 
7026-86946-0033	train-other-500	Elizabeth hesitated for the fraction of a minute You may tell her to come up was the message that finally found its way
none	none	 to the hall boy s attentive ear Annita McMurtry was a neatly attired young woman 
7026-86946-0034	train-other-500	with a penetrating black eye a ready smile and a well poised not to say supercilious bearing In response to Elizabeth s timid questions she vouchsafed the explanation that she could do everything and was prepared to take full charge
7026-86946-0035	train-other-500	And by that you mean I mean that the lady where I work doesn t have to worry herself about anything I take full charge of everything ordering cooking laundry and waiting on table
7026-86946-0036	train-other-500	and I don t mind wiping up the floors in a small apartment like this Window cleaning and rugs the janitor attends to of course When could you come if I decide to engage you
7026-86946-0037	train-other-500	asked Elizabeth finding herself vaguely uncomfortable under the scrutiny of the alert black eyes If you please madam I d rather speak first about wages and days out I d like my alternate Thursdays and three evenings a week
none	none	 and will you be going to theatres often with supper parties after 
7026-86946-0038	train-other-500	I don t care for that unless I get paid extra I left my last place on account of it I can t stand it to be up all hours of the night and do my work next day I should think not returned Elizabeth with ready sympathy
7026-86946-0039	train-other-500	We should not require anything of the sort As to wages Miss Tripp said you would be willing to come for twenty dollars It seemed very high to me for only two in the family Elizabeth spoke in a very dignified way
none	none	 she felt that she appeared quite the experienced housekeeper in the eyes of the maid who was surveying her with a faint inscrutable smile I never work for a family where there is more than two said Miss McMurtry pointedly I could make my thirty five a month easy if I would 
7026-86946-0041	train-other-500	But Miss Tripp must have misunderstood me twenty two was what I said but you ll find I earn it I ll come to morrow morning about this time and thank you kindly madam
none	none	 The young woman arose with a proud composure of manner 
7026-86946-0042	train-other-500	which put the finishing touch upon the interview and accomplished her exit with the practised ease of a society woman
none	none	 I wonder if I ought to have done it And what will Sam say 
7026-86946-0043	train-other-500	Elizabeth asked herself ready to run undignifiedly after the girl
none	none	 whose retiring footsteps were already dying away down the corridor 
7026-86946-0044	train-other-500	But Sam was found to be of the opinion that his Elizabeth had done exactly right He hadn t thought of hiring a servant to be sure
none	none	 but he ought manifestly to have been reminded of his omission 
7026-86946-0045	train-other-500	It was surely not to be expected that a man s wife should spend her time and strength toiling over his food in a dark little den of a kitchen No decent fellow would stand for that sort of thing He wanted his wife to have time to go out he said
7026-86946-0046	train-other-500	to enjoy herself to see pictures and hear music As for the expense he guessed they could swing it he was sure to get another rise in salary before long And much more of the same sort all of which proved pleasantly soothing to Elizabeth s somewhat disturbed conscience
none	none	 I suppose Grandma Carroll would say I was a lazy girl she sighed You didn t marry Grandma Carroll dear Sam told her with a humorous twinkle in his eyes which Elizabeth thought delightfully witty CHAPTER VIII Whatever the opinion of the unthinking many on the subject of honest work as related to the happiness of the individual there can be but one just conclusion as to the effect of continued idleness whether it be illustrated in the person of the perennially tired gentleman who frequents our back doors at certain seasons of the year or in the refined woman who has emptied her hands of all rightful activities At the end of her first week s experience with her new maid Elizabeth found herself for the first time in her wholesome well ordered life at a loss for something to do When Miss McMurtry stated that she would take full charge of missus Brewster s menage she meant what she said and Elizabeth s inexperienced efforts to play the role of mistress as she had conceived it met with a civil but firm resistance on the part of the maid Yes missus Brewster I had expected to wipe up the dining room floor this morning after I have finished my kitchen work she would announce frostily in response to Elizabeth s timid suggestion I have my regular days for things an I don t need to be told I ve already spoken to the janitor s boy about the rugs an you ll please to leave some money with me to pay him Just put it on the kitchen dresser And No madam I shall not have time to make an apple pie this morning I generally order pastry of the baker when it s called for Yes missus Brewster those were baker s rolls you had on the breakfast table I ordered the man to stop regularly You prefer home made bread you say I m sorry but I never bake It is quite unnecessary in the city The young woman s emphasis on the last word delicately conveyed her knowledge of missus Brewster s country origin and her pitying disapproval of it Miss Tripp to whom Elizabeth confided her new perplexities merely laughed indulgently You mustn t interfere if you want Annita to stay with you she counselled Just keep religiously out of your kitchen my dear and everything will go on peacefully We never think of such a thing as dictating to Marie and we re careful not to make too many suggestions Of course you don t know what a perfectly dreadful time people are having with servants here in town My dear I could tell you things that would frighten you Just fancy having your prettiest lingerie disappear bit by bit and your silk stockings worn to rags and not daring to say a word I have lost two handkerchiefs since Annita came said Elizabeth doubtfully Oh handkerchiefs nobody expects to keep those forever Really do you know when I treat myself to a half dozen new ones I conceal them from Marie as long as I possibly can for fear she ll decide I have too many Elizabeth s artlessly inquiring gaze provoked another burst of well bred merriment You dear little innocent you do amuse me so Don t you see our good Marie doesn t propose to encourage me in senseless extravagance in laundry you see there is no telling to what lengths I might go if left to myself and it all takes Marie s time No I don t pretend to know what she does with them all Gives them to her relations perhaps She couldn t use them all and I give her a half dozen at Christmas every year Why they re all that way and both Marie and Annita would draw the line at one s best silk stockings I am sure We think Marie perfectly honest that is to say I would trust her with everything I have feeling sure that she would use her discretion in selecting for herself only the things I ought not to want any longer They know I can tell you and they despise parsimonious people who try to make their old things do forever You may as well make up your mind to it my dear and when you are fortunate enough to secure a really good competent servant like Annita you mustn t see too much Just why Elizabeth upon the heels of this enlightening conversation should have elected to purchase for herself two new handkerchiefs of a somewhat newer pattern than the ones she had lost was not entirely clear even to herself There had been a new crisp bill in her purse for a number of weeks nestling comfortably against the twin gold pieces her father had given her on the day of her wedding Sam had put it there himself and had joked with her on her economical habits when he had found it unbroken on what he laughingly called her next pay day Seriously though little wife of mine I never want you to be out of money he had said if I am cad enough to forget you mustn t hesitate to remind me And you need never feel obliged to tell me what you ve done with it This wasn t the ideal arrangement for either but neither husband nor wife was aware of it nor of the fact that in the small dainty purse which lay open between them lurked a possible danger to their common happiness Elizabeth had been brought up in the old fashioned way her wants supplied by her careful mother and an occasional pocket piece by her overworked father who always referred to the coins transferred from his pocket to her own as money to buy a stick of candy with The sum represented by the twin gold pieces and the crisp bills appeared to contain unlimited opportunities for enjoyment A bunch of carnations for the dining table and a box of bonbons excused the long stroll down Tremont Street during which Miss Tripp carried on the education of her protegee on subjects urban without interruption If I had only thought to stop at the bank this morning observed Miss Tripp regretfully I should simply have insisted upon your lunching with me at Purcell s then we might have gone to the matinee afterward there is the dearest brightest little piece on now Mademoiselle Rosette You haven t heard it What a pity This is the very last matinee Never mind dear I sha n t be so thoughtless another day But why shouldn t I began Elizabeth tardily then with a deep blush I have plenty of money with me and I should be so happy if you would lunch with me and My dear I couldn t think of it I mustn t allow you to be extravagant demurred Miss Tripp But in the end she yielded prettily and Elizabeth forthwith tasted a new pleasure which is irresistibly alluring to most generous women That evening at dinner her eyes were so bright and her laughing mouth so red that her young husband surveyed her with new admiration What did you find to amuse you to day in this big dull town he wanted to know It isn t dull at all Sam and I ve had the loveliest time with Evelyn she told him and added a spirited account of the opera seen with the unjaded eyes of the country bred girl I ve never had an opportunity to go to theatres and operas before she concluded and Evelyn thinks I ought to see all the best things as a matter of education I think so too beamed the unselfish Sam and I hope you ll go often now that you have the chance I may as well I suppose now that I have Annita Elizabeth said It s dreadfully dull here at home when you are gone I ve nothing to do at all Sam pinched her pink ear gently as the two strolled away from the table How does the new kitchen mechanic suit you he asked The meat had been overdone the vegetables watery and the coffee of an indifferent colour and flavour he thought privately Why she seems to know exactly what to do and when to do it Elizabeth said rather discontentedly and she s very neat but did you like that custard Sam I thought it was horrid I m sure she didn t strain it and it was cooked too much Since you put it to me so pointedly I m bound to confess that the present incumbent isn t a patch on the last lady who cooked for me confessed her husband laughing at the puzzled look in her eyes Oh you mean me I m glad you like my cooking Sam I should feel dreadfully if you didn t But about Annita I am afraid she won t allow me to teach her any of the things I know and when I said I meant to make a sponge cake this morning she said she was going to use the oven But she wasn t for I went out and looked afterward Then she said right out that she wasn t used to having ladies in her kitchen and that it made her nervous Hum commented the mere man you d better ask your father to prescribe for the young person and in the meanwhile I should frequent her kitchen till she had gradually accustomed herself to the idea She would leave if I did that Sam There are others Not like Annita objected Elizabeth with the chastened air of a three dimensioned experience You ve no idea of the dreadful times people have with servants here in Boston And really one oughtn t to expect an angel to work in one s kitchen for twenty two dollars a month do you think so Sam Her uplifted eyes and earnest lips and rose tinted cheeks were so altogether charming as she propounded this somewhat absurd question that Sam said Speaking of angels puts me in mind of the fact that I have one right in hand and much more of the good old fashioned nonsense which makes the heart beat quicker and the eyes glow and sparkle with unreasoning joy when the heart is young Half an hour had passed in this agreeable manner when Elizabeth bethought herself to ask What had I better do about the butcher s and grocer s slips Sam dear Annita says that in all the places where she has worked they always run bills but if we aren t to do that And we re not you know we agreed about that Elizabeth Yes of course but Annita brought me several when I came in to day I had forgotten all about them Do you think I ought to stay at home every day till after the butcher and grocer and baker have been here Sometimes they don t call till after twelve o clock This was manifestly absurd and he said so emphatically The result of his subsequent cogitations was an order to Annita to leave the slips on his desk where they would be attended to each evening Mind he said I don t want missus Brewster annoyed with anything of the sort Indeed sir I can see that missus Brewster has not been used to being worrited about anything an no more she ought the young woman had replied with an air of respectful affection for her mistress which struck Sam as being no less than admirable It materially assisted him in his efforts to swallow Annita s muddy coffee of a morning and her leaden puddings at night All this while Elizabeth light heartedly entered upon what Miss Tripp was pleased to call her first Boston season There was so much to be learned so much to be seen so much to enjoy and the new gowns and hats and gloves were so exactly the thing for the matinees teas card parties and luncheons to which she found herself asked with unlooked for cordiality She could hardly have been expected to know that her open sesame to even this circle without a circle consisted in a low voiced allusion to the sidereally remote missus Van Duser a connection by marriage my dear It was on a stormy afternoon in late February when doctor North unannounced and disdaining the noisy little elevator climbed the three flights of stairs to his daughter s apartment and tapped lightly on the corridor door His summons was answered by an alert young woman in a frilled cap and apron missus Brewster was giving a luncheon she informed him and could see no one But I am missus Brewster s father and she ll want to see me the good doctor had insisted sniffing delicately at the odours of salad and coffee which floated out to him from the gingerly opened door Go tell your mistress that doctor North is here and would like to see her In another minute a fashionable little figure in palest rose colour had thrown two pretty lace clad arms about his neck Oh you dear old darling daddy why didn t you let me know you were coming Now I ve this luncheon party with bridge after it and I can t But you must come in and wait I ll tuck you away somewhere in my bedroom or I can t stay Bess at least not long I ve a consultation at the hospital at three But I ll tell you I ll be back at five how ll that do I ve a message from your mother and Elizabeth shrugged her shoulders distractedly They won t go a minute before six she said but come then to dinner Be sure now The doctor was hungry he had had no lunch and despite the warmth of his welcome there was a perceptible chill about his aging heart as he slowly made his way down the stairs I m afraid I ll not be able to make it he told himself my train goes at six fifty and bless me I ve just time for a bite at a restaurant before I m due at the hospital CHAPTER IX A loving letter from his daughter followed doctor North to Innisfield In it Elizabeth had described her disappointment in not being able to see more of her darling daddy They had waited dinner for him that night she said and Sam was dreadfully put out about it He almost scolded me for not bringing you right in But how could I with all those women You wouldn t have enjoyed it daddy dear I know you too well Next time and I hope it will be soon you must telephone me We have a phone in our apartment now and I m sure I don t know how we ever lived without it You see I have so many engagements that even if I didn t happen to be entertaining I might not be at home which would be just as bad The rest of the sheet was filled with a gay description of the automobile show which was really quite a function this year and of her success as a hostess Evelyn says I ve made immense progress and she s quite proud of me There was a short silence as missus North folded the letter and slipped it into its envelope But I don t understand why you didn t go back and take dinner with them as Bessie asked you to do she said at last in a reproachful tone You ought to have made an effort Richard The doctor s grizzled brows lifted humorously as he glanced across the breakfast table at his wife s worried face Ought to have made an effort eh he repeated Well didn t I I wanted to see Bess the worst way but it seems she didn t want to see me at least not at the time I arrived So I went my way got my lunch met Grayson at the hospital at two thirty finished the operation at four ran over to Avery s and left an order then But why I could have gone back to Bess then and I wanted to but she didn t invite me to come till six and I knew I must make that six twenty train for I d promised missus Baxter I d call in the evening So you see my dear I was up against it as the boys say Did she look well Richard asked his wife anxiously Perfectly well I should say And did she tell you when we might expect her at home for a little visit The doctor shook his head I didn t have a chance to ask any questions my dear He arose and pushed back his chair Well I must be going When you write to Bess tell her it s all right and she s not to worry I ll take care to let her know next time I m coming He went out and closed the door heavily behind him Grandma Carroll who had listened to the conversation without comment pursed up her small wise mouth That reminds me daughter I think I shall go to Boston to day she observed briskly To Boston to day echoed her daughter in surprise I don t believe I can possibly get away to go with you mother Malvina Bennett is coming to fix my black skirt besides there s the baking and You needn t to feel that you must put yourself out on my account Lizzie missus Carroll replied with a slightly offended air I am quite capable of going to China if it was necessary I hadn t thought to mention it to you yesterday but there s some shopping I want to do so I ll get right off on the morning train Will you have time to get around to see Bessie I ll make time said grandma trenchantly I want to see what she s doing with my own eyes I don t know what you think about her not asking her father in to her table but I know what I think Oh mother I hope you won t You needn t to worry a mite about what I ll say or do I shan t be hasty but I mistrust that Sipp woman is leading Lizzie into extravagance and foolishness and I mean to find out I shall probably stay all night and maybe all day to morrow But it might not be convenient for Bessie hesitated missus North you know what she said about telephoning I guess I d better let her know you re coming Hump ejaculated grandma it wasn t always convenient for me to be up nights with her when she had whooping cough and measles but I did it just the same I don t want you should telephone daughter I don t know just when I shall get around to Lizzie s house when I do I ll stay till I get ready to come home you can depend upon that if all the folks in Boston are there a visiting I ll go right in and visit with them I m going to take my best silk dress and my point lace collar so I guess I ll be full as dressy as any of em missus North sighed apprehensively but in the end she saw missus Carroll onto the train with a wondering sense of relief Mother always did know how to manage Bessie better than I did she told herself vaguely When missus Carroll arrived at her destination the whistles were proclaiming the hour of noon I m just in time for dinner I guess she observed cheerfully to the elevator boy who grinned his appreciation But there was no token of occupancy about the Brewster apartment when missus Carroll rapped smartly upon the door The missis is out volunteered the boy who had lingered to watch the progress of the pink cheeked smiling old lady but the girl s there I seen her go in not fifteen minutes ago Thus encouraged missus Carroll repeated her summons After what seemed a second interminable silence the door opened disclosing an alert presence in an immaculate cap and apron How do you do said grandma pleasantly This boy here says missus Brewster isn t at home but I ll come in and wait till she does I m her grandmother missus Carroll you ve probably heard her speak of me and I guess you re the girl she tells about in her letters sometimes You ve got a pretty name my dear and you look real neat and clean Now if you ll just take my bag it s pretty heavy and Annita had not taken her beady black eyes off the little presence I never let strangers in when missus Brewster s not at home she said stolidly It ain t to be expected that I should I guess you ll have to come again about four this afternoon maybe I like to see a hired girl careful and watchful said grandma approvingly but if you look in the photograph album I gave my grandaughter Lizzie on her sixteenth birthday you ll see my picture on the front page and that ll relieve you of all responsibility She pushed determinedly past the astonished Annita and was laying off her bonnet in the front room before that young person could collect her forces for a second protest So your mistress isn t coming home for dinner missus Carroll s voice full of kindly inflections pursued Miss McMurtry to her final stronghold My I d forgotten what a small kitchen this was Dark isn t it I m afraid that s what makes you look so pale Now if you ll just make me a cup of tea or let me do it if you re busy I m used to waiting on myself I suppose I ll find the tea caddy in here You let my place alone you hissed Annita livid with rage as Grandma Carroll laid her hand on the door of the cupboard But she was too late the open door disclosed a large frosted cake a heap of delicately browned rolls and a roasted chicken Well well your cooking looks very nice indeed I suppose you re expecting company but if you can spare me one of those tasty rolls I shall make out nicely with the tea Be sure and have it hot my dear And grandma pattered gently back into the dining room smiling wisely to herself Just how many of Miss McMurtry s plans went awry that afternoon it would be hard to say At three o clock when a mysterious black robed elderly person carrying a capacious basket came up in the elevator she was met in the corridor by a white visaged fury in a frilled cap and apron who implored her distractedly to go away An phwat for should I go away ain t the things ready as usual demanded the lady with the basket I d like me cup o tea too I m that tired an cold Miss McMurtry almost wept on the maternal shoulder I ve got a lovely chicken she whispered an a cake besides the rolls you was hungry for an the groceries but her gran mother bad luck to her come this mornin from the country an she s helpin me clean my kitchen Phwat for d you let her into your kitchen demanded the elder McMurtry indignantly I m surprised at ye Annie I didn t let her in she walked right out and poked her nose into me cupboard without so much as sayin by your leave I think I ll be leavin my place I won t wait t be trowed out by her Miss McMurtry s tone was bitter They ain t much anyway I d rather go where there was more to do with Right you are Annie my girl I ve towld you that same many s the time But if you re leavin the night be sure The woman s voice dropped to a hissing whisper I ll do it sure and maybe The girl s black eyes gleamed wickedly as she caught the creak and rattle of the ascending elevator I can do better than what you said in the end It s safe enough with the likes o them They re easy At six o clock in fluttered Elizabeth a vision of elegant femininity in her soft furs and plumes and trailing skirts Darling grandmamma was kissed and embraced quite in the latest fashion and the two sat down cosily to visit while Annita set the table for dinner with stony composure I ve been here since noon said grandma complacently and I ve been putting in my time helping your hired girl clean her cupboards What Annita You ve been helping Annita Why yes I didn t have anything else to do and the cupboards certainly did need cleaning Seems to me Lizzie you keep a big stock of all sorts of groceries on hand for so small a family as yours Do we asked Elizabeth yawning daintily I m sure I don t know what we have Annita is perfectly competent to attend to everything in the kitchen and I never interfere She doesn t like it and so why should I What are you paying for butter this winter grandma wanted to know after a thoughtful pause I m sure I don t know the usual price I suppose Sam attends to the bills He looks them over every night when he comes home and gives Annita the money to pay them with Hum commented grandma surveying her granddaughter keenly over the top of her spectacles that s a new way to keep house seems to me It s a nice way I know that laughed Elizabeth She had changed subtly from the shy undeveloped girl who had left Innisfield less than a year ago into a luxuriance of bloom and beauty which astonished the older woman There was an air of poise of elegance of assured dignity about her slender figure which fitted her as did her gown It must be easy certainly agreed missus Carroll sniffing delicately after a well remembered fashion Elizabeth laughed and shrugged her shoulders in a way she had caught from Evelyn Tripp Now you know you are dying to lecture me grandma she said caressingly but you see dear that things are decidedly different here in Boston and But here comes Sam he ll be so glad to see you missus Carroll was very cheerful and chatty with the young people that evening She told them all the Innisfield news in her most spirited fashion and never once by word or look expressed her growing disapproval of what her shrewd old eyes were telling her Miss McMurtry who stood with her ear glued to the crack of the door for a long half hour finally retired with a contemptuous toss of her black head Then the coast being clear she found opportunity to convey to their destination the comestibles dutifully provided for maternal consumption She s full as easy as the young one for all her meddlin ways said Miss McMurtry an she ll be leavin in the mornin so there ll be no back talk comin from her But for once Annita was mistaken in her premises missus Carroll it is true made no immediate reference to the disclosures afforded by her daring invasion of the kitchen fastnesses nor did she even remotely allude to the probable date of her departure for Innisfield I don t want you should make company of me Lizzie she said pleasantly or put yourself out a mite I ll just join right in and do whatever you re planning to do Elizabeth puckered her pretty forehead perplexedly she was thinking that Grandma Carroll s unannounced visit would necessitate the hasty giving up of a gay luncheon and theatre party planned for that very afternoon Tears of vexation sparkled in her brown eyes as she took down the telephone receiver missus Carroll listened to the one sided conversation which followed without visible discomfiture Now that s too bad she observed sympathetically Why didn t you tell me you wanted to go and I d have eaten my lunch right here at home There s plenty of cooked victuals in your kitchen pantry I saw em yesterday whilst I was out helping around I suppose your hired girl cooked that roast chicken and the layer cake and the rolls for Samuel s noonings I hope you ll see to it Lizzie that he takes a good tasty lunch to work every day But of course you do Elizabeth stared Why grandma she said Sam doesn t carry his lunch like a common workman He eats it at a restaurant in South Boston Hum mused missus Carroll I wonder if he gets anything fit to eat there Samuel appears to have gone off in his weight considerable since I saw him last she added shaking her head wisely He needs a gentian tonic I should say or something You re mistaken grandma Elizabeth said with an air of offended wifely dignity Sam isn t the least bit ill Of course he works hard but I should be the first to notice it if there was anything the matter with my husband Care killed a cat quoted grandma sententiously and you appear to be pretty much occupied with other things Home ought to come first my dear I hope you aren t forgetting that Elizabeth s pretty face was a study she bit her lip to keep back the petulant words that trembled on her tongue Evelyn is coming grandma she said hurriedly and please don t discuss things before her Miss Tripp was unaffectedly surprised and as she declared charmed to see dear missus Carroll in Boston I didn t suppose she said that you ever could bring yourself to leave dear quiet Innisfield missus Carroll on her part exhibited a smiling blandness of demeanour which served as an incentive to the lively if somewhat one sided conversation which followed a shrewd question now and then on the part of missus Carroll eliciting numerous facts all bearing on the varied social activities of dear Elizabeth I m positively looking forward to Lent sighed Miss Tripp for really I m worn to a fringe but dear Elizabeth never seems tired no matter how many engagements she has It is a perfect delight to look at her isn t it dear missus Carroll Lizzie certainly does look healthy admitted the smiling old lady but it beats me how she finds time to look after her husband and her hired girl with so many parties The result of missus Carroll s subsequent observations and conclusions were summed up in the few trenchant remarks addressed to her granddaughter the following day as she was tying on her bonnet preparatory to taking the train for Innisfield I hope you ll come again soon grandma Elizabeth said dutifully I mistrust you don t mean that Lizzie replied missus Carroll facing about and gazing keenly at the young matron and I may as well say that I m not likely to interfere with your plans often I like my own bed and my own rocking chair too well to be going about the country much But I couldn t make out from what your father said just what the matter was Elizabeth shrugged her shoulders with a pretty air of forbearance I was awfully sorry about daddy she murmured but I don t see how I could have done anything else under the circumstances Well I do said Grandma Carroll severely She buttoned her gloves energetically as she went on in no uncertain tones I ve always been a great believer in everybody minding their own business but there s times when a little plain speech won t hurt anybody Things aren t going right in your house Lizzie I can see that without half looking I warn you to keep an eye on your kitchen pantry I mistrust there s a leak there I trust Annita perfectly said Elizabeth her round chin tilted aggressively And I m sure I ought to know by this time I agree with you there Lizzie you ought to know but you don t That girl is carrying things out of your kitchen as fast as the grocer and the butcher can bring them in I don t think you can afford to let her spend your husband s money as she pleases and that is what it amounts to the way you re managing now But grandma protested Elizabeth Sam looks over every one of the bills himself before he pays them It isn t your husband s place to do your work and his own too my dear Elizabeth hung her head her face flaming with angry colour You ve been brought up to be a sensible industrious economical woman pursued missus Carroll earnestly but from what that Tipp girl said yesterday I should imagine you d taken leave of your senses What does Samuel say to your spending so much money and being out so constant He he likes to have me have a good time Well I ll lose my guess if he s having one said grandma pointedly Samuel looked worried to death last night when Terita brought him the bills And I took notice he didn t eat scarcely anything at dinner For that matter I didn t myself there wasn t a thing on the table cooked properly Now Lizzie I ve said my say and I m going She kissed her granddaughter heartily Take time to think it over child and mind you don t tell the Fripp girl what I ve said She could talk a bird off a bush without a bit of trouble I wonder if everybody gets as queer and unreasonable as grandma when they are old mused Elizabeth as she picked her way daintily through the sloppy streets I m sure I hope I sha n t Of course Sam is all right I guess he d tell me the very first thing if he wasn t Nevertheless missus Carroll s significant words had left an unpleasant echo in her mind which haunted her at intervals all day Under its influence she made a bold incursion into her kitchen after a luncheon of chipped beef dry toast and indifferent baker s cake Have we any cold chicken Annita she asked hesitatingly I that is I am expecting a few friends this afternoon and I thought Miss McMurtry faced about and eyed her mistress with lowering brows There ain t any chicken in the place missus Brewster she said stonily an as I ain t in the habit of havin parties sprung on me unbeknownst I ll be leaving at the end of my month which is to morrow if you please Elizabeth s new found dignity enabled her to face the woman s angry looks without visible discomfiture Very well Annita she said quietly Perhaps that will be best for both of us CHAPTER X Elizabeth greeted her husband that night with a speculative anxiety in her eyes born of the uncomfortable misgivings which had haunted her during the day And when after dinner he dropped asleep over his evening paper she perceived with a sharp pang of apprehension that his face was thinner than she had ever seen it that his healthy colour had paled somewhat and that hitherto unnoticed lines had begun to show themselves about his mouth and eyes She reached for his hand which hung idly by his side and the light touch awakened him Oh Sam she began Grandma Carroll insisted upon it that you were looking ill and I wanted to see if you had any fever working over there in that unhealthy part of town you might have caught something Who told you it was unhealthy he wanted to know It really isn t at all little girl and you re not to worry about me or anything At just what point in his career Samuel Brewster had acquired the Quixotic idea that a woman and particularly a young and beautiful woman should not be allowed to taste the smallest drop of the world s bitterness he could not have explained But the notion albeit a mistaken one was as much a part of himself as the blue of his steadfast eyes or the bronzy brown of his crisp locks You re not he repeated positively to give yourself the slightest anxiety about me I never felt better in my life And he smiled determinedly But Sam dear I shall be obliged to worry if you are going to be ill or if a misty light breaking in upon her confused thoughts you are keeping anything from me that I ought to know I ve been thinking about it all day and I ve been wondering if she lowered her voice cautiously Annita is perfectly reliable I ve always thought so till to day Anyway she s going to leave to morrow and you ll be obliged to go back to my cooking for a while till I can get some one else The somewhat vague explanations which followed called for an examination of grocer s and butcher s accounts and the two heads were bent so closely over the parti coloured slips that neither heard the hasty preparations for departure going on in the rear It looks to me as if our domestic had been spoiling the Egyptians hazarded Sam after half an hour of unsatisfactory work But I really don t know how much meat groceries and stuff we ought to be using I might have found out murmured Elizabeth contritely I ve just gone on enjoying myself like a child and and I m afraid I ve spent too much money I haven t kept any count Her husband glanced at her pretty worried face with a frown of perplexity and annoyance between his honest eyes The fact is Betty he burst out a poor man has no business to marry and make a woman uncomfortable and unhappy You haven t spent but a trifle dear and all on the simplest most innocent pleasures yet it does count up so confoundedly I wanted you to have a good time dear and I couldn t bear He dropped into a chair and thrust his hands deep into his pockets Then we have been spending too much on contingencies why didn t you tell me before He bit his lip We ve spent nearly every dollar of our reserve Betty he said slowly and this month I m afraid I don t see how I am going to meet all of the bills Oh Sam gasped Elizabeth turning pale A voice from the softly opened kitchen door broke in upon this crucial conversation You ll please to excuse me missus Brewster but I ve had word that my mother is sick an I ll have to be leaving at once My month s up in the morning anyway an I hope you ll not mind paying me my wages to night Her lip curled scornfully as she glanced at the tradesmen s slips scattered on the table Miss McMurtry openly despised people who as she expressed it were always trying to save a copper cent on their meat and groceries She herself felt quite above such economies One could always change one s place and being somewhat versed in common law she felt reasonably secure in such small pecadilloes as she had seen fit to commit while in the employ of the Brewsters I should like to ask you a few questions first about these accounts said the inexperienced head of the house sternly How does it happen that you ordered fifteen pounds of sugar seven pounds of butter and two of coffee last week Surely missus Brewster and I never consumed such an amount of provisions as I see we have paid for Miss McMurtry s elbows vibrated slightly I only ordered what was needed sir she replied in a high shrill voice Sure you told me yourself not to bother the madame I did tell you that I know I thought you were to be trusted but this doesn t look like it A fearsome change came over the countenance of the respectable young person in the frilled apron Are you meaning to insinooate that I took them groceries she demanded fiercely I ll ask you to prove that same Prove it I say It s a lie an I d be willin to swear to it in a court of justice That s what comes of me workin for poor folks that can t pay their bills Miss McMurtry swung about on her heels and included Elizabeth in the lightning of her gaze I come here to accomydate her thinkin she was a perfec lady an I ve slaved night an day in her kitchen a tryin my best to please her an this is what I gets for it But you can t take my character away that easy I ve the best of references an I ll trouble you for my wages if you can pay em If not there s ways I can collect em Pay her Sam and let her go do begged Elizabeth in a frightened whisper I ought not to pay the girl I m sure of that but to save you further annoyance my dear He counted out twenty two dollars and pushed the little pile of bills across the table Take it he said peremptorily and go The two gazed at each other in silence while the loud trampling footsteps of the erstwhile gentle and noiseless Annita sounded in the rear Then when a violent and expressive bang of the kitchen door announced the fact that their domestic had finally shaken off the dust of her departure against them Elizabeth burst into a relieved laugh She came presently and perched on her husband s knee Sam dear she murmured it is all my fault every bit of it No don t contradict me nor interrupt please We can t afford to go on this way and we re not going to We ll begin over again just as we meant to before I she paused while a flood of shamed colour swept over her drooped face tried to be fashionable It isn t really so very much fun to go to card parties and teas and luncheons and I don t care a bit about it all especially if if it is going to cost us too much and I can see that it has already All her little newly acquired graces and affectations dropped away as she spoke and her husband saw the sweet womanly soul he had loved and longed for in the beginning looking out of her brown eyes He kissed her thankfully almost solemnly Dear Betty he whispered Couldn t we go away from this place she went on after a while It isn t very pleasant is it and I m almost ashamed to say it but Evelyn Tripp has such a way of making things look different to one What she says sounds so so sensible that I can t at least I haven t done as I intended in hardly anything There s a little red cottage to let with a pocket handkerchief lawn in front and room for a garden behind not half a mile from where we are working Sam told her but I haven t mentioned it because it s a long way to Tremont Street and Evelyn His blue eyes were full of the laughing light she had missed vaguely for more weeks than she cared to remember Let s engage it to morrow exclaimed Elizabeth Why Sam dear we could have roses and strawberries and all sorts of fun out there When after missing her friend for several days Miss Tripp called at the Brewster apartment she was astonished beyond measure to find her dearest Elizabeth busy packing some last trifles while several brawny men were engaged in taking away the furniture My dear she exclaimed What are you doing We re moving said Elizabeth tranquilly You know I never cared particularly for this apartment the rooms are so dark and unpleasant besides the rent is too high for us But where I was just going to tell you we ve taken a little house away over near the new water works Then as Miss Tripp s eyebrows and shoulders expressed a surprise bordering on distraction I felt that it would be better for us both to be nearer Sam s work He can come home to luncheon now and I we shall like that immensely But you re going out of the world do you realise that my dear And just as you were beginning to be known too and when I ve tried so hard to Miss Tripp s voice broke and she touched her eyelids delicately with her handkerchief Oh why didn t you consult me before taking such an irrevocable step I m sure I could have persuaded you to change your mind Elizabeth opened her lips to reply then she hesitated at sight of Evelyn s wan face whereon the lavishly applied rice powder failed to conceal the traces of the multiplied fatigues and disappointments of a purely artificial life You ll be glad you didn t try to make me change my mind when you see our house she said gaily It has all been painted and papered and everything about the place is as fresh and sunny and delightful as this place is dark and dingy and disagreeable Only think Evelyn there is a real fireplace in the living room where we are going to burn real wood of an evening and the bay window in the dining room looks out on a grass plot bordered with rose bushes But the neighbourhood dear wailed Evelyn Only think what a social Sahara you are going into I don t know about that Elizabeth told her calmly Several of the engineers who are working with Sam live near with their families and Sam thinks we are going to enjoy it immensely He is so glad we are going Evelyn had folded her hands in her lap and sat looking hopelessly about the dismantled rooms You don t seem to think about me Betty she said after a while I I am going to miss you terribly Tears shone in her faded eyes and her voice trembled Elizabeth s warm heart was touched You ve been very good to me Evelyn she said I shall never forget all that I ve learned from you But we re really not going out of the world and you shall come and see us whenever you will and bye and bye we shall have strawberries and roses to offer you CHAPTER XI The roses on the tiny lawn of which Sam had spoken were in full bud and Elizabeth was searching eagerly for the first streak of pink in the infant blossoms when she was surprised by the sight of an imposing equipage drawing up at the curb The fat black horses pawed the gravel disdainfully shaking their jingling harness as the liveried footman dismounted from his perch and approached the mistress of the house I beg pawdon miss he said loftily but can you tell me where aw missus Samuel Brewster lives I am missus Brewster Elizabeth told him Whereupon the man presented a card with an air of haughty humility Elizabeth s wondering eyes uprose from its perusal to the vision of a tall stout lady attired in purple broadcloth who was being assisted from the carriage The hot colour flamed over her fair face and for an instant she was tempted to run into the house and hide herself and the neat checked gingham gown she was wearing Then she gripped her courage with both hands and came forward smiling determinedly The august personage in purple paused at sight of the slender blue frocked figure and raising a gold mounted lorgnette to her eyes deliberately inspected it You are Samuel Brewster s wife she asked Yes missus Van Duser Elizabeth s voice trembled in spite of herself but her eyes were calmly bright Won t you come in she added politely The lady breathed somewhat heavily as she mounted the vine wreathed porch I will sit down here she announced magisterially the air is pleasant in the country Elizabeth s brief experience in Boston society came to her assistance enabling her to reply suitably to this undeniable statement of fact Then an awesome silence ensued broken only by the bold chirp of an unabashed robin successfully hunting worms in the grass plot Where is your husband suddenly propounded the visitor mister Brewster is engaged in making a topographical map for the city I do not know exactly where he is this afternoon replied Elizabeth her colour paling then rising as she recalled the too well remembered words of missus Van Duser s late communication Did you wish to see him missus Van Duser was apparently engaged in a severe inspection of the adventurous robin She did not at once reply Elizabeth looked down at the toe of her shabby little shoe Sam comes home to lunch now she faltered I he hasn t been gone long Ah intoned missus Van Duser majestically transferring her attention from the daring robin to Elizabeth s crimson face Samuel has neglected to call upon me since his return to Boston was missus Van Duser s next remark delivered in an awe inspiring contralto though it is evident that he owes me an acknowledgment of his present good fortune Elizabeth fixed round eyes of astonishment upon her visitor I can t think what you mean she exclaimed unguardedly And yet I find you here in this sylvan spot far removed from the follies and temptations of your former position and I trust prospering in a modest way Thank you murmured Elizabeth pink with indignation we are getting on very well What rent do you pay Elizabeth looked about rather wildly as if searching for a way of escape The robin had swallowed his latest find with an air of huge satisfaction and now flew away with a ringing summons to his mate We pay thirty dollars missus Van Duser she said slowly by the month Um Why don t you buy the place I don t think I m sure we couldn t hesitated Elizabeth You are wrong said missus Van Duser again raising her lorgnette to her eyes if you can afford to pay three hundred and sixty dollars in rent you can afford to own a home and you should do so Tell Samuel I said so Yes missus Van Duser murmured Elizabeth in a depressed monotone Do you keep a maid No missus Van Duser I do my own housework Elizabeth s brown eyes sparkled defiantly as she added I was brought up to work and I like to do it missus Van Duser s large solemn countenance relaxed into a smile as she gazed into the ingenuous young face at her side Ah my dear she sighed I envy you your happiness though I had it myself once upon a time I don t often speak of those days but John Van Duser was a poor man when I married him and we lived in a little house not unlike this and I did the cooking Do you think you could give me a cup of tea my dear When Samuel Brewster came home from his work at an unexpectedly early hour that afternoon he was astonished to find an imposing coupe drawn by two fat shining horses being driven slowly up and down before his door and further as he entered the house by the cheerful sound of clinking silver and china and low voiced conversation Elizabeth pink cheeked and smiling met him with an exclamation of happy surprise I am so glad you came home Sam dear she said missus Van Duser was hoping to see you before she went And missus Van Duser looking very much at home and very comfortable indeed in Sam s own big wicker chair proffered him a large white jewelled hand while she bade him give an account of himself quite in the tone of an affectionate relative You have a charming and sensible wife Samuel and a well conducted home said the great lady I have seen the whole house cellar kitchen and all she added with a reminiscent sigh and it has carried me back to the happiest days I ever spent The young engineer passed his arm about his Elizabeth s shoulders as the two stood at the gate watching the stately departure of the Van Duser equipage Well Betty he said so the mountain came to Mahomet But the mountain doesn t seem such a bad sort after all I liked the way she kissed you good bye though I should never have guessed she was capable of it Elizabeth drew a deep breath I never was so frightened in my life as when she first came she confessed But she is kind Sam in her way though at first I thought it wasn t a pleasant way And O Sam dear she thinks we gave up our flat and came out here just because she wrote us that letter she was as complacent as could be when she spoke of it Did you undeceive her N no dear I didn t even try Perhaps it was the letter partly and anyway I felt sure I couldn t make her think any differently whatever I might say But I did tell her about Annita and about how thoughtless and selfish I was and Did you tell her about the Tripp lady he suggested teasingly No she said gravely Evelyn meant to be kind too I am sure of that O benevolent Betty he exclaimed with mock gravity O most sapient Elizabeth I perceive that in gaining a new friend thou hast not lost an old one I suppose from now on you will begin to model your small self on the Van Duser pattern My lady will see to it that you do if you see much of her Elizabeth looked up at her tall husband her brown eyes brimming with thoughtful light It is good to have friends she said slowly but Sam dear we must never allow any friend to come between us again We must live our own lives and solve our own problems even if we make an occasional blunder doing it We ve solved our problems already he said confidently and I m not afraid of the blunders thanks to the dearest and best little wife a man ever had And Elizabeth smiled back at him knowing in her wiser woman s heart that there were yet many problems to be solved but not fearful of what the future would bring in the light of his loving eyes End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of And So They Were Married by Florence Morse
