POLITICIAN A Novel BY F MARION CRAWFORD AUTHOR OF mister ISAACS doctor CLAUDIUS A ROMAN SINGER TO LEEWARD et cetera TO MY DEAR FRIEND ELIZABETH CHRISTOPHERS HOBSON IN GRATITUDE AND AFFECTION I DEDICATE THIS STORY CONSTANTINOPLE October seventy one thousand eight hundred eighty four CHAPTER I missus Sam Wyndham was generally at home after five o clock The established custom whereby the ladies who live in Beacon Street all receive their friends on Monday afternoon did not seem to her satisfactory She was willing to conform to the practice but she reserved the right of seeing people on other days as well missus Sam Wyndham was never very popular That is to say she was not one of those women who are seemingly never spoken ill of and are invited as a matter of course or rather as an element of success to every dinner musical party and dance in the season Women did not all regard her with envy all young men did not think she was capital fun nor did all old men come and confide to her the weaknesses of their approaching second childhood She was not invariably quoted as the standard authority on dress classical music and Boston literature and it was not an unpardonable heresy to say that some other women might be had been or could be more amusing in ordinary conversation Nevertheless missus Sam Wyndham held a position in Boston which Boston acknowledged and which Boston insisted that foreigners such as New Yorkers Philadelphians and the like should acknowledge also in that spirit of reverence which is justly due to a descent on both sides from several signers of the Declaration of Independence and to the wife of one of the ruling financial spirits of the aristocratic part of Boston business As a matter of fact missus Wyndham was about forty years of age as all her friends of course knew for it is as easy for a Bostonian to conceal a question of age as for a crowned head In a place where one half of society calls the other half cousin and went to school with it every one knows and accurately remembers just how old everybody else is But missus Wyndham might have passed for younger than she was among the world at large for she was fresh to look at and of good figure and complexion Her black hair showed no signs of turning gray and her dark eyes were bright and penetrating still There were lines in her face those microscopic lines that come so abundantly to American women in middle age speaking of a certain restless nervousness that belongs to them especially but on the whole missus Sam Wyndham was fair to see having a dignity of carriage and a grace of ease about her that at once gave the impression of a woman thoroughly equal to the part she had to play in the world and not by any means incapable of enjoying it For the rest missus Sam led a life very much like the lives of many rich Americans She went abroad frequently wandered about the continent with her husband went to Egypt and Algiers stayed in England where she had a good many friends avoided her countrymen and countrywomen when away from home and did her duty in the social state to which she was called in Boston She read the books of the period and generally pronounced them ridiculous she believed in her husband s politics and aristocratically approved the way in which he abstained from putting theory into practice from voting and in a general way from dirtying his fingers with anything so corrupt as government or so despicable as elections she understood Boston business to some extent and called it finance but she despised the New York Stock Market and denounced its doings as gambling She made fine distinctions but she was a woman of sense and was generally more likely to be right than wrong when she had a definite opinion or expressed a definite dislike Her religious views were simple and unobtrusive and never changed Her custom of being at home after five o clock was perhaps the only deviation she allowed herself from the established manners of her native city and since two or three other ladies had followed her example it had come to be regarded as a perfectly harmless idiosyncrasy for which she could not properly be blamed The people who came to see her were chiefly men except of course on the inevitable Monday A day or two before Christmas then missus Sam Wyndham was at home in the afternoon The snow lay thick and hard outside and the sleigh bells tinkled unceasingly as the sleighs slipped by the window gleaming and glittering in the deep red glow of the sunset The track was well beaten for miles away down Beacon Street and across the Milldam to the country and the pavements were strewn with ashes to give a foothold for pedestrians For the frost was sharp and lasting But within missus Wyndham sat by the fire with a small table before her and one companion by her side for whom she was pouring tea Tell me all about your summer mister Vancouver said she teasing the flame of the spirit lamp into better shape with a small silver instrument mister Pocock Vancouver leaned back in his corner of the sofa and looked at the fire then at the window and finally at his hostess before he answered He was a pale man and slight of figure with dark eyes and his carefully brushed hair turning gray at the temples and over his forehead threw his delicate intelligent face into relief I have not done much he answered rather absently as though trying to find something interesting in his reminiscences and he watched missus Wyndham as she filled a cup He was not the least anxious to talk it seemed and he had an air of being thoroughly at home You were in England most of the time were you not

none	none	I believe I was Oh by the bye I met Harrington in Paris I thought he meant to stay at home He often goes abroad said missus Wyndham indifferently One lump of sugar Two if you please no cream thanks Does he go to Paris to convert the French or to glean materials for converting other people inquired mister Vancouver languidly I am sure I cannot tell you answered the lady still indifferently What do you go to Paris for Principally to renew my acquaintance with civilized institutions and humanizing influences What does anybody go abroad for You always talk like that when you come home mister Vancouver said missus Wyndham But nevertheless you come back and seem to find Boston bearable It is not such a bad place after all is it If it were not for half a dozen people here I would never come back at all said mister Vancouver But then I am not originally one of you and I suppose that makes a difference And pray who are the half dozen people who procure us the honor of your presence You are one of them missus Wyndham he answered looking at her I am much obliged she replied demurely Any one else Oh John Harrington said Vancouver with a little laugh

none	none	said missus Wyndham innocently I did not know you were such good friends mister Vancouver sipped his tea in silence for a moment and stared at the fire I have a great respect for Harrington he said at last He interests me very much and I like to meet him He spoke seriously as though thoroughly in earnest The faintest look of amusement came to missus Wyndham s face for a moment I am glad of that she said mister Harrington is a very good friend of mine Do you mind lighting those candles The days are dreadfully short Pocock Vancouver rose with alacrity and performed the service required By the way said missus Wyndham watching him I have a surprise for you Indeed Yes an immense surprise Do you remember Sybil Brandon Charlie Brandon s daughter Very well saw her at Newport some time ago Lily white style all eyes and hair You ought to remember her You used to rave about her and you nearly ruined yourself in roses You will have another chance she is going to spend the winter with me Not really ejaculated mister Vancouver in some surprise as he again sat down upon the sofa Yes you know she is all alone in the world now What Is her mother dead too She died last spring in Paris I thought you knew No said Vancouver thoughtfully How awfully sad Poor girl said missus Wyndham I thought it would do her good to be among live people even if she does not go out When is she coming There was a show of interest about the question She is here now answered missus Sam Dear me said Vancouver May I have another cup His hostess began the usual series of operations necessary to produce a second cup of tea missus Wyndham began Vancouver again after a pause I have an idea do not laugh it is a very good one I am sure I am not laughing Why not marry Sibyl Brandon to John Harrington missus Wyndham stared for a moment How perfectly ridiculous she cried at last Why They would starve to begin with I doubt it said Vancouver Why I am sure mister Harrington never had more than five thousand a year in his life You could not marry on that you know possibly No but Miss Brandon is very well off rich in fact I thought she had nothing She must have thirty or forty thousand a year from her mother at the least You know Charlie never did anything in his life he lived on his wife s money and Miss Brandon must have it all missus Wyndham did not appear surprised at the information she hardly seemed to think it of any importance I knew she had something she repeated but I am glad if you are right But that does not make it any more feasible to marry her to mister Harrington I thought that starvation was your objection said Vancouver Oh no not that only Besides he would not marry her He would be very foolish not to if he had the chance remarked Vancouver Perhaps he might not even have the chance perhaps she would not marry him said missus Wyndham thoughtfully Besides I do not think John Harrington ought to marry yet he has other things to do mister Vancouver seemed about to say something in answer but he checked himself possibly he did not speak because he saw some one enter the room at that moment and was willing to leave the discussion of John Harrington to a future time In fact the person who entered the room should have been the very last to hear the conversation that was taking place for it was Miss Brandon herself though mister Vancouver had not recognized her at once There were greetings and hand shakings and then Miss Brandon sat down by the fire and spread out her hands as though to warm them She looked white and cold There are women in the world both young and old who seem to move among us like visions from another world a world that is purer and fairer and more heavenly than this one in which the rest of us move It is hard to say what such women have that marks them so distinctly sometimes it is beauty sometimes only a manner often it is both It is very certain that we know and feel their influence and that many men fear it as something strange and contrary to the common order of things a living reproach and protest against all that is base and earthly and badly human Most people would have said first of Sybil Brandon that she was cold and many would have added that she was beautiful Ill natured people sometimes said she was deathly No one ever said she was pretty Vancouver s description lily white all eyes and hair certainly struck the principal facts of her appearance for her skin was whiter than is commonly natural her eyes were very deep and large and blue and her soft brown hair seemed to be almost a burden to her from its great quantity She was dressed entirely in black and being rather tall and very slight of figure the dress somewhat exaggerated the ethereal look that was natural to her She seemed cold and spread out her delicate hands to the bright flame of the blazing wood fire missus Wyndham and Pocock Vancouver looked at her in silence for a moment Then missus Wyndham rose with a cup of tea in her hand and crossed to the other side of the fireplace where Sybil was sitting and offered it to her Poor Sybil you are so cold Drink some tea The elder woman sat down by the young girl and lightly kissed her cheek You must not be sad darling she whispered sympathetically I am not sad at all really answered Miss Brandon aloud quite naturally but pressing missus Wyndham s hand a little as though in acknowledgment of her sympathy No one can be sad in Boston said Vancouver putting in a word Our city is altogether too wildly gay He laughed a little You must not make fun of us to visitors mister Vancouver answered missus Wyndham still holding Sybil s hand It is mister Vancouver s ruling passion though he never acknowledges it said Miss Brandon calmly I remember it of old I am flattered at being remembered said mister Vancouver whose delicate features betrayed neither pleasure nor interest however But he continued I am not particularly flattered at being called a scoffer at my own people I did not say that interrupted Miss Brandon Well you said my ruling passion was making fun of Boston to visitors at least you and missus Wyndham said it between you I really never do that unless I give the other side of the question as well What other side asked missus Sam who wanted to make conversation Boston said Vancouver with some solemnity It is not more often ridiculous than other great institutions You simply take one s breath away mister Vancouver said missus Wyndham with a good deal of emphasis The idea of calling Boston an institution Why certainly The United States are only an institution after all You could not soberly call us a nation Even you could not reasonably be moved to fine patriotic phrases about your native country if your ancestors had signed twenty Declarations of Independence We live in a great institution and we have every right to flatter ourselves on the success of its management but in the long run this thing will not do for a nation Miss Brandon looked at Vancouver with a sort of calm incredulity missus Wyndham always quarreled with him on points like the one now raised and accordingly took up the cudgels I do not see how you can congratulate yourself on the management of your institution as you call it when you know very well you would rather die than have anything to do with it Very true But then you always say that gentlemen should not touch anything so dirty as politics missus Wyndham retorted Vancouver Well that just shows that it is not an institution at all and that you are quite wrong and that we are a great nation supported and carried on by real patriotism And the Irish and German votes added Vancouver with that scorn which only the true son of freedom can exhibit in speaking of his fellow citizens Oh the Irish vote That is always the last word in the argument answered missus Sam I do not see exactly what the Irish have to do with it remarked Miss Brandon innocently She did not understand politics Vancouver glanced at the clock and took his hat It is very simple he said rising to go It is the bull in the china shop the Irish bull amongst the American china dangerous you know Good evening missus Wyndham good evening Miss Brandon And he took his leave Miss Brandon watched his slim figure disappear through the heavy curtains of the door He has not changed much since I knew him she said turning again to the fire I used to think he was clever And have you changed your mind asked missus Wyndham laughing Not quite but I begin to doubt He has very good manners and looks altogether like a gentleman Of course said missus Wyndham His mother was a Shaw although his father came from South Carolina But he is really very bright Sam always says he is one of the ablest men in Boston In what way inquired Sybil Oh he is a lawyer don t you know great railroad man Oh ejaculated Miss Brandon and relapsed into silence missus Wyndham rose and stood before the fire and pushed a log back with her small foot Miss Brandon watched her half wondering whether the flames would not catch her dress I have been to see that Miss Thorn said Sybil presently Oh exclaimed missus Sam with sudden interest tell me all about her this minute dear Is not she the most extraordinary creature I rather like her answered Miss Brandon She is very pretty What style Dark No not exactly Brown hair and lots of eyebrows She is a little thing but very much alive you know Awfully English of course suggested missus Sam Well yes I suppose so She is wild about horses and says she shoots But I like her I am sure I shall like her very much She does not seem very pleased with her aunt I do not wonder said missus Sam Poor little thing she has nobody else belonging to her has she Oh yes answered Sybil with a little tremor in her voice she has a mother in England I want to see her ever so much said missus Sam Bring her to luncheon You will see her to night I think she said she was going to that party I hate to leave you alone said missus Wyndham I really think I had better not go Dear missus Wyndham said Sybil rising and laying her hands on her hostess s shoulders half affectionately half in protest this idea must be stopped from the first and I mean to stop it You are not to give up any party or any society or anything at all for me If you do I will go away again Promise me will you not Very well dear But you know you are the dearest girl in the world And so they kissed and agreed that missus Wyndham should go out and that Sybil should stay at home missus Wyndham was really a very kind hearted woman and a loving friend That might be the reason why she was never popular Popularity is a curious combination of friendliness and indifference but very popular people rarely have devoted friends and still more rarely suffer great passions Everybody s friend is far too apt to be nobody s for it is impossible to rely on the support of a person whose devotion is liable to be called upon a hundred times a day from a hundred different quarters The friendships that mean anything mean sacrifice for friendship s sake and a man or a woman really ready to make sacrifices for a considerable number of people is likely to be asked to do it very often and to be soon spent in the effort to be true to every one But popularity makes no great demands The popular man is known to be so busy in being popular that his offenses of omission are readily pardoned His engagements are legion his obligations are innumerable and far more than he can fulfill But meet him when you will his smile is as bright his greeting as cordial and his sayings as universally good natured and satisfactory as ever He has acquired the habit of pleasing and it is almost impossible for him to displease He enjoys it all is agreeable to every one and is never expected to catch cold in attending a friend s funeral or otherwise to sacrifice his comfort because he is quite certain to have important engagements elsewhere in which the world always believes There is probably no individual more absolutely free and untrammeled than the thoroughly popular man CHAPTER II Fate the artist mixes her own colors She grinds them with a pestle in the fashion of the old masters and out of the most strange pigments she produces often only soft neutral tints for background and shadow kneading a vast deal of bright colors away among the grays and browns but now and then she takes a palette loaded with strong paint and a great brush and splashes a startling full length portrait upon the canvas without much regard for drawing or general composition but with very startling effect To paint well needs life long study to paint so as merely to attract attention needs courage and a heart hardened against artistic sensitiveness John Harrington was a high light against the mezzotint of his surroundings He was a constant source of interest and not infrequently of terror to the good town of Boston True he was a Bostonian himself a chip of the old block whose progenitors had lived in Salem and whose very name breathed Pilgrim memories He even had a teapot that had come over in the Mayflower This was greatly venerated and whenever John Harrington said anything more than usually modern his friends brandished the teapot morally speaking in his defense and put it in the clouds as a kind of rainbow a promise that Puritan blood could not go wrong Nevertheless John Harrington continued to startle his fellow townsmen by his writings and sayings so that many of the grave sort shook their heads and swore that he sympathized with the Irish and believed in Chinese labor As a matter of fact he did not mince matters Endowed with unbounded courage and an extraordinary command of language when he got upon his feet he spoke his mind in a way that was good to hear Moreover he had the strong oratorical temperament that forces attention and commands men in a body He said that things were wrong and should be put right and when he had said so for half an hour to a couple of thousand people most of them were ready to follow him out of the hall and go and put things right on the spot with their own hands As yet the opportunity had not offered for proceeding in so simple a manner but the aforesaid Bostonians of the graver sort said that John Harrington would some day be seen heading a desperate mob of socialists in an assault upon the State House What he had to do with socialism or to what end he should thus fiercely invade the headquarters of all earthly respectability was not exactly apparent but the picture thus evoked in the minds of the solemn burghers satisfactorily defined for them the personality of the man and they said it and said it again It was somewhat remarkable that he had never been called clever At first he was regarded as a fool by most of his own class though he always had friends who believed in him By and by as it came to be seen that he had a purpose and would be listened to while he stated it Boston said there was something in him but he was never said to be clever or bright he was John Harrington neither more nor less He was never even called Jack He was a friend of missus Wyndham s her keen instincts had long ago recognized the true metal in the man and of all who came and went in her house there was none more welcome than he Sam Wyndham utterly disagreed with him in politics but always defended him in private saying that he would calm down a lot when he got older and that meanwhile he was a very good fellow if you did not stir him up He was therefore very intimate at the Sam Wyndham establishment in fact at the very hour when Pocock Vancouver was drinking missus Sam s tea John had intended to be enjoying the same privilege Unfortunately for his intention he was caught elsewhere and could not get away He was drinking tea it is true but the position in which he found himself was not entirely to his taste Old Miss Schenectady whose niece Miss Josephine Thorn had lately come over from England to pass the winter had asked John Harrington to call that afternoon The old lady believed in John on account of the Mayflower teapot and consequently thought him a desirable acquaintance for her niece Accordingly John went to the house and met Miss Sybil Brandon just as she was leaving it which he regretted suspecting that her society would have been more interesting than that of Miss Thorn As it turned out he was right for his first impression of the young English girl was not altogether agreeable and he found himself obliged to stay and talk to her until an ancient lady who had come to gossip with Miss Schenectady and was fully carrying out her intentions should go away and make it possible for him to take his leave without absolutely abandoning Miss Thorn in the corner of the room she had selected for the tete a tete All that of course you know said Miss Thorn in answer to some remark of John s but what sort of things do you really care for People answered John without hesitation Of course returned his companion everybody likes people It is not very original One could not live without lots of society could one That depends on the meaning of society Oh I am not in the least learned about meanings answered Miss Thorn I mean what one means by society you know Heaps of men and women and tea parties and staying in the country and that That is a sketch indeed said John laughing But then it is rather different here We do not relapse into the country as you do in England and then come back to town like lions refreshed with sleep Why not Because once in society here one is always in it At least most people are As soon as heat begins Boston goes to New York and by and by New York goes to Saratoga and takes Boston with it and then all three go to Newport and the thing begins again until there is a general rush to Lenox to see the glories of the autumn and by the time the glories are getting a little thin it is time to be in Beacon Street again But when do people shoot and ride do they ever hunt asked Miss Thorn opening her wide brown eyes in some astonishment at John Harrington s description of society life in America Oh yes they hunt at Newport with a drag and a bagged fox They do it in July and August when it is as hot as it can be and the farmers turn out with pitchforks and stones to warn them off the growing crops How ridiculous exclaimed Miss Josephine It is absurd of course said Harrington and cruel But I must say they ride as though there were no hereafter and it is a stiff country They must I should think no one who believed in a hereafter would hunt in summer I will wager that if you go to Newport this summer you will hunt just like everybody else said John boldly Josephine Thorn knew in her heart that it was true but she did not like the tone in which John said it There was an air of certainty about his way of talking that roused her opposition I would do nothing so foolish said she You do not know me And do you mean to tell me that you like these people who rush madly about the country and hunt in summer and those sort of things No said John not always But you said you liked people How awfully inconsistent you are Excuse me I think not I meant that I liked people and having to do with them with men and women better than I like things What are things inquired Josephine sarcastically You are not very clear in your way of expressing yourself I will be as clear as you please answered John looking across the room at Miss Schenectady and her ancient friend and devoutly wishing he could get away I mean by things the study of the inanimate part of creation of such sciences as are not directly connected with man s thoughts and actions and such pursuits as hunting shooting and sporting of all kinds which lead only to the amusement of the individual I mean also the production of literature for literature s sake and of works of art for the mere sake of themselves When I say I like people I mean men and women their opinions and their relations to each other I should think you would get very tired of them said Miss Thorn scornfully They are all dreadfully alike She never forgot the look Harrington turned upon her as he answered His calm deep set gray eyes gazed steadily at her and his square features assumed an air of gravity that almost startled her I am never tired of men and women he said Has it ever struck you Miss Thorn that the study of men and women means the study of government and that a knowledge of men and women may give the power to influence the destiny of mankind I never thought of it like that said Josephine very quietly She was surprised at his manner and she suddenly felt that he was no ordinary man To tell the truth her aunt had informed her that John Harrington was coming that afternoon and had told her he was an exceedingly able man a statement which at once roused Josephine s opposition to its fiercest pitch She thoroughly hated to be warned about people to be primed as it were with a dose of their superiority beforehand It always prepared her to dislike the admirable individual when he appeared It seemed as though it were taken for granted that she herself had not enough intelligence to discover wit in others and needed to be told of it with great circumstance in order to be upon her good behavior Consequently Josephine began by disliking John She thought he was a Philistine his hair was too straight and besides it was red he shaved all his face whereas the men she liked always had beards she liked men with black eyes or blue John s were gray and hard he spoke quietly without expression and she liked men who were enthusiastic After all too the things he said were not very clever anybody could have said them She meant to show her Boston aunt that she had no intention of accepting Boston genius on faith It was not her way she liked to find out for herself whether people were able or not without being told and if she ascertained that John Harrington enjoyed a fictitious reputation for genius it would amuse her to destroy it or at all events to write a long letter home to a friend expressing her supreme opinion on that and other matters John on his part did not very much care what impression he produced He never did on such occasions and just now he was rendered doubly indifferent by the fact that he was wishing himself somewhere else True there was a certain novelty in being asked point blank questions about his tastes Boston people knew what he liked and generally only asked him about what he did Perhaps if he had met Josephine by daylight instead of in the dim shadows of Miss Schenectady s front drawing room he might have been struck by her appearance and interested by her manner As it was he was merely endeavoring to get through his visit with a proper amount of civility in the hope that he might get away in time to see missus Sam Wyndham before dinner Josephine thought John dull probably well informed and utterly without interest in anything She felt inclined to do something desperate to throw the cushions at him to do anything in short to rouse him from his calmness Then he made that remark about government and his voice deepened and his gray eyes shone and she was aware that he had a great and absorbing interest in life and that he could be roused in one direction at least To do her justice she had quick perceptions and the impression on her mind was instantaneous I never thought of it like that she said Do you know she added in a moment I should not have thought you took much interest in anything at all John laughed He was amused at the idea that he who knew himself to be one of the most enthusiastic of mortals should be thought indifferent and he was amused at the outspoken frankness of the girl s remark You know that is just like me continued Miss Thorn quickly I always say what I think you know I cannot help it a bit What a pity all the world is not like you said John It would save a great deal of trouble I am sure The frump is going at last said Josephine in an undertone as the ancient friend rose and showed signs of taking leave of Miss Schenectady There is certainly no mistake about the frankness of that speech said John rising to his feet and laughing again There is no mistaking its truth answered Josephine She is the real thing the real old fashioned frump we have lots of them at home You remind me of Heine said John He said he called a spade a spade and Herr Schmidt an ass Miss Thorn laughed Exactly she answered that is the knowledge of men which you say leads to power She rose also and there was a little stir as the old lady departed Josephine watched John as he bowed and opened the door of the room to let the visitor out She wondered vaguely whether she would like him whether he might not really be a remarkable man a fact she doubted in proportion as her aunt assured her of its truth she liked his looks and tried to determine whether he was handsome or not and she watched closely for any awkwardness or shyness of manner that being the fault in a man which she never pardoned He was very different from the men she had generally known and most completely different from those she had known as her admirers In fact she had never admired her admirers at all except dear Ronald of course They competed with her on her own ground and she knew well enough she was more than a match for any of them Ronald was different she had known him all her life But all those other men They could ride but she rode as well or better They could shoot but so could she and allowing for the disadvantages of a woman in field sports she was as good a shot as they She knew she could do anything they could do and understood most things they understood All in all she did not care for the average young Englishman He was great fun in his own way but there were probably more interesting things in the world than pheasants and fences Politics would be interesting she thought she had known three or four men who were young and already prominent in Parliament and they were undeniably interesting but they were generally either ugly or clumsy the unpardonable sin or perhaps they were vain Josephine could not bear vain men John Harrington probably had some one or more of these defects He was certainly no beauty man to begin with nevertheless she wondered whether he might not be called handsome by stretching a point She rather hoped inwardly and unconsciously that her ultimate judgment would decide in favor of his good looks She always judged it was the first thing she did and she was surprised on the present occasion to find her judgment so slow People who pride themselves on being critical are often annoyed when they find themselves uncertain of their own opinion As for his accomplishments they were doubtful to say the least Miss Thorn was not used to considering American men as manly She had read a great many books which made game of them and showed how unused they were to all those good things which make up the life of an English country gentleman she had met one or two Americans who turned up their noses in impotent scorn of all field sports except horse racing which they regarded from a financial point of view Probably John Harrington had never killed a pheasant in his life Lastly he might be vain A man with such a reputation for ability would most likely be conceited And yet despite probability she could not help thinking John interesting That one speech of his about government had meant something He was a man with a strong personality with a great interest in the world led by a dominant aspiration of some sort and Josephine in her heart loved power and admired those who possessed it Political power especially had that charm for her which it has for most English people of the upper class There is some quality in the English race which breeds an inordinate admiration for all kinds of superiority it is certain that if one class of English society can be justly accused of an over great veneration for rank the class which is rank itself is not behindhand in doing homage to the political stars of the day In favor of this peculiarity of English people it may fairly be said that they love to associate with persons of rank and power from a disinterested love of those things themselves whereas in most other countries the society of noble and influential persons is chiefly sought from the most cynical motives of personal advantage Politics that is the outward and appreciable manifestations of political life must always furnish abundant food for the curiosity of the many and the intelligent criticism of the few There is no exception to that rule be the state great or small But politics in England and politics in America so far as the main points are concerned are as different as it is possible for any two social functions to be Roughly Government and the doings of Government are centripetal in England and centrifugal in America In England the will of the people assists the workings of Providence whereas in America devout persons pray that Providence may on occasion modify the will of the people In England men believe in the Queen the Royal Family the Established Church and Belgravia first and in themselves afterwards Americans believe in themselves devoutly and a man who could establish upon them a church a royalty or a peerage would be a very clever fellow Josephine Thorn and John Harrington were fair examples of their nationalities Josephine believed in England and the English John Harrington believed in America and the Americans How far England and America are ever likely to believe in each other however is a question of future history and not of past experience and any reasonable amount of doubt may be cast upon the possibility of such mutual confidence But as Josephine stood watching John Harrington while he opened the drawing room door for the visitor to go out she thought of none of these things She certainly did not consider herself a type of her nation a distinction to which few English people aspire and she as certainly would have denied that the man before her was a type of the modern American John remained standing when the lady was gone Do sit down said Miss Schenectady settling herself once more in her corner Thank you I think I must be going now answered John It is late As he spoke he turned toward Miss Thorn and for the first time saw her under the bright light of the old fashioned gas chandelier The young girl was perhaps not what is called a great beauty but she was undeniably handsome and she possessed that quality which often goes with quick perceptions and great activity and which is commonly defined by the expression striking Short rather than tall she was yet so proportioned between strength and fineness as to be very graceful and her head sat proudly on her shoulders too proudly sometimes for she could command and she could be angry Her wide brown eyes were bright and fearless and honest The faint color came and went under the clear skin as freely as the heart could send it and though her hair was brown and soft there were ruddy tints among the coils that flashed out unexpectedly here and there like threads of red gold twined in a mass of fine silk John looked at her in some astonishment for in his anxiety to be gone and in the dimness of the corner where they had sat he had not realized that Josephine was any more remarkable in her appearance than most of the extremely young women who annually make their entrance into society with the average stock of pink and white prettiness They call them buds in Boston an abbreviation for rosebuds Fresh young roses of each opening year fresh with the dew of heaven and the blush of innocence coming up in this wild garden of a world what would the gardener do without you Where would all beauty and sweetness be found among the thorny bushes and the withering old shrubs and the rotting weeds were it not for you Maidens with clean hands and pure hearts in whose touch there is something that heals the ills and soothes the pains of mortality roses whose petals are yet unspotted by dust and rain and whose divine perfume the hot south wind has not scorched nor the east wind nipped and frozen you are the protest set every year among us against the rottenness of the world s doings the protest of the angelic life against the earthly of the eternal good against the eternal bad John Harrington looked at Miss Thorn and looked at her with pleasure for he saw that she was fair but in spite of her newly discovered beauty he resisted Miss Schenectady s invitation to sit down again and departed Any other man would have stayed under the circumstances Well Josephine said Miss Schenectady when he was gone now you have seen John Harrington Josephine looked at her aunt and laughed a little it seemed to her a very self evident fact since John had just gone Exactly said she Won t you call me Joe aunt Zoruiah They all do at home even Ronald Joe Boy s name Well if you insist upon it As I was saying you have seen John Harrington now Exactly repeated Joe But I mean how does he strike you Clever I should think answered the young lady Clever you know that sort of thing Not bad looking either I told you so said Miss Schenectady Yes but I expected ever so much more from what you said returned Joe kneeling on the rug before the fire and poking the coals with the tongs Miss Schenectady looked somewhat offended at the slight cast upon her late guest You are very difficile Josephi I mean Joe I forgot Ye es very diffyseal that sort of thing repeated Josephine mimicking her aunt s pronunciation of the foreign word I know I am I can t possibly help it you know A dashing thrust with the tongs finally destroyed the equilibrium of the fire and the coals came tumbling down upon the hearth Goodness gracious me exclaimed the old lady in great anxiety you will have the house on fire in no time Give me the tongs right away my dear You do not understand American fires CHAPTER III Dear Ronald You can t imagine what a funny place Boston is I wish you were here it would be so nice to talk about them together I mean the people of course for they are much funnier than the place they live in But I think they are very nice too particularly some of the men I don t understand the women in the least they go in awfully for sets if you understand that kind of thing and art too and literature The other day at a lunch party that is what they call it here they sat and talked about pictures for ever so long I wonder what you would have said if you had been there but then there were no men and so you couldn t have been could you And the sets too The girls who come out together all in a batch like a hive of bees swarming spend the rest of their lives together and they have what they call sewing circles that go on all their lives There are sewing circles of old frumps sixty years old who have never been parted since they all went to their first ball together They sew for the poor they don t sew so very much you know but then they have a tremendous lunch afterwards I sewed for the poor the other day because one of the sewing circles asked me to their meeting I sewed two buttons on to the end of something and then I ate six kinds of salad and went to drive with mister Vancouver I dare say it does a lot of good in its way but I think the poor must be awfully good natured It is quite too funny about driving too You may go out with a man in a sleigh but you couldn t possibly go with him on wheels on the same road at the same hour same man same everything except the wheels You agree to go out next week in a sleigh with mister Vancouver but when the day comes if it has happened to thaw and there is no snow and he comes in a buggy you couldn t possibly go with him because it would be quite too improper But I mean to some day just to see what they will say I wish you would come We would do a lot of driving together and by and by in the spring they say one can ride here but only along the roads for everything else is so thick with steam engines and Irishmen that one could not possibly go across country But although they are so funny they are really very nice and awfully clever I don t think there are nearly so many clever men anywhere else in society when once you have got over their Americanisms Most of them would be in Parliament at home but nobody goes into Parliament here except mister Harrington that is into Congress which is the same thing you know They say politics in America are not at all fit for gentlemen and they spend an hour or two every day in abusing all the politicians instead of turning them out and managing things themselves But mister Harrington is going to be a senator as soon as he can and he is so clever that I am sure he will make a great reform I don t think of anything else to say just now but if I do I will write again only it s unfeminine to write two letters running so you must answer at once And if you should want to travel this winter you can come here they will treat you ever so much better than you deserve So good by Yours ever sincerely JOE THORN The precise nature of the friendship that existed between Josephine Thorn and Ronald Surbiton could not be accurately inferred from the above specimen of correspondence and indeed the letter served rather to confuse than to enlighten the recipient as to the nature of his relations with the writer He was of course very much in love with Joe Thorn he knew it because he had always been in love with her since they were children together so there could be no possible doubt in the matter But whether she cared a jot for him and his feelings he could not clearly make out from the style of the hurried ungrammatical sentences crammed with abbreviations and unpermissible elisions True she said three times that she hoped he would come to America but America was a long way off and she very likely reckoned on his laziness and dislike to foreign traveling It is so easy for a young woman writing from Boston to say to a young man residing in Scotland Do come over for a few days Surbiton thought it would be a good joke to take her at her word and go The idea of seeing her again so much sooner than he had expected was certainly uppermost in his mind as he began to make his resolution but it was sustained and strengthened by a couple of allusions Joe had made to men of her acquaintance in Boston not to say by the sweeping remark that there were more clever men in Boston society than anywhere else which made his vanity smart rather unpleasantly When Josephine used to tell him half in earnest half in jest that he was so dreadfully stupid he did not feel much hurt but it was different when she took the trouble to write all the way from America to tell him that the men there were much cleverer than at home He had a great mind to go and see for himself whether it were true Nevertheless the hunting was particularly good just at the time when he got the letter and being rather prudent of counsel Ronald determined to wait until a hard frost should spoil his temper and give the necessary stimulus to his activity before he packed his boxes for a western voyage As for Josephine it was very natural that she should feel a little homesick and wish to have some one of her own people with her In spite of the favorable views she expressed about America Boston and her new acquaintances her position was not without some drawbacks in her own eyes She felt herself out of her natural element and the very great admiration she received in society though pleasant enough in itself was not to her so entirely satisfactory as it would have been to a woman older or younger than she or to a more thorough flirt An older woman would have enjoyed more keenly the flattery of it a younger girl would have found it more novel and fresh and the accomplished professional society flirt there is no other word to express her would have rejoiced exceedingly over a great holocaust of victims In writing to Surbiton and suggesting to him to come to Boston Joe had no intention of fanning his hopes into flame She never thought much about Ronald She had long been used to him and regarded him in the light of a marriage fixture though she had never exactly promised to marry him she had been brought up to suppose she would and that was all When or where the marriage would actually take place was a question she did not care to raise and if ever Surbiton raised it she repressed him ruthlessly For the present she would look about the world seeing she had been transported into a new part of it and she found it amusing Only she would like to have a companion to whom she could talk Ronald would be so convenient and after all it was a great advantage to be able to make use of the man to whom she was engaged She never had known any other girl who could do that and she rather prided herself on the fact that she was not ridiculous although she was in the most traditionally absurd position that of betrothal She would like to compare Ronald with the men she had met lately The desire for comparison had increased of late A fortnight had passed since she had first met John Harrington and she had made up her mind He was handsome though his hair was red and he had no beard and she liked him she liked him very much it was quite different from her liking for Ronald She liked Ronald she said to herself that she loved him dearly partly because she expected to marry him and partly because he was so good and so much in love with herself He would take any amount of trouble for anything she wanted But John was different She knew very well that she was thinking much more of him than he of her if indeed he thought of her at all But she was a little ashamed of it and in order to justify herself in her own eyes she was cold and sarcastic in her manner to him so that people noticed it and even John Harrington himself who never thought twice whether his acquaintances liked him or disliked him remarked one day to missus Wyndham that he feared he had offended Miss Thorn as she took such particular pains to treat him differently from others On the other hand Joe was always extremely candid to Pocock Vancouver It was on a Monday that John made the aforesaid remark All Boston was at missus Wyndham s excepting all the other ladies who lived in Beacon Street and that is a very considerable portion of Boston as every schoolboy knows John was standing near the tea table talking to missus Sam when Joe entered the room and came up to the hostess who welcomed her warmly She nodded coldly to John without shaking hands and joined a group of young girls near by It is very strange said John to missus Wyndham I wonder whether I can have done anything Miss Thorn resents I am not sensitive but it is impossible to mistake people when they look at one like that She always does it just in that way missus Wyndham looked inquiringly at John for a moment and the quick smile of ready comprehension played on her sensitive mouth Are you really quite sure you have not offended her she asked Quite sure John answered in a tone of conviction Besides I never offend any one certainly not ladies I never did such a thing in my whole life Not singly said missus Wyndham laughing You offend people in large numbers when you do it at all especially newspaper people Sam read that ridiculous article in the paper to me last night Which paper asked John smiling They have most of them been at me this week The paper answered missus Sam the horrid paper You do not suppose I would mention such a publication in my house Oh my old enemy laughed John I do not mind that in the least One might almost think those articles were written by Miss Thorn Perhaps they are answered missus Wyndham Really she added glancing at Josephine whom Pocock Vancouver had just detached from her group of girls really you may not be so very very far wrong John s glance followed the direction of her eyes and he saw Vancouver He looked steadily at the man s delicate pale features and intellectual head and at the end of half a minute he and missus Wyndham looked at each other again She probably regretted the hint she had carelessly dropped but she met Harrington s gaze frankly I did not mean to say it she said for John looked so grave that she was frightened It was only a guess But have you any reason to think it might be the truth asked John None whatever really none except that he differs so much from you in every way politically speaking She knew very well that Vancouver hated John and she had often thought it possible that the offensive articles in question came from the pen of the former There was a tone of superior wit and a ring of truer English in them than are generally met with in the average office work of a daily newspaper I do not believe Vancouver writes them said John slowly He is not exactly a friend but he is not an enemy either missus Wyndham who knew better than that held her peace She was not a mischief maker and moreover she liked both the men too well to wish a quarrel between them She busied herself at the tea table for a moment and John stood near her watching the moving crowd Now and then his eyes rested on Josephine Thorn s graceful figure and he noticed how her expressive features lighted up in the conversation John could hear something of their conversation which was somewhat noisy They were talking in that strain of objectless question and answer which may be stupid to idiocy or clever to the verge of wit according to the talkers Joe called it chaff I have learned America said Joe Indeed said Vancouver You have not been long about it but then you will say there is not much to learn I never believe in places till I have lived in them said Joe Nor in people till you have seen them I suppose returned Vancouver But now that you have learned America of course you believe in us all without exception We are the greatest nation on earth I suppose you have heard that Yes you told me so the other day but it needs all the faith I have in your judgment to believe it If any one else had said it you know I should have thought there was some mistake Oh no it is pretty true taking it all round returned Vancouver with a smile But I am tremendously flattered at the faith you put in my sayings Oh are you That is odd you know because if you are so much flattered at my believing you you would not be much disappointed if I doubted you I beg to differ Excuse me Not at all answered Joe laughing Only we have old fashioned prejudices at home We begin by expecting to be believed and are sometimes a good deal annoyed if any one says we are telling fibs Of course if you put it in that way said Vancouver But I suppose it is not a very bad fib to say one s country is the greatest on earth I am sure you English say it quite as often and as loudly as we do and you see we cannot both be right possibly No not exactly But suppose two men any two like you and mister Harrington for instance each made a point of telling every one you met that you were the greatest man on earth It is conceivable that we might both be wrong said Vancouver laughing at the idea But one of you might be right objected Joe No that is not conceivable retorted Vancouver No Let us ask mister Harrington mister Harrington Joe turned towards John and called him He was only a step from her and joined the two instantly He looked from one to the other inquiringly Here is a great question to be decided mister Harrington said Joe I was saying to mister Vancouver that supposing each of you asserted that he was the greatest man on earth it would I mean how could the point be settled John stared for a moment If you insist upon raising such a very remarkable point of precedence Miss Thorn he answered calmly I am sure Vancouver will agree with me to leave the decision to you also Joe looked slightly annoyed She had brought the retort on herself Pardon me said Vancouver quickly I object to the contest The match is not a fair one mister Harrington means to be the greatest man on earth or in the water under the earth whereas I have no such aspiration Instead of being grateful to Vancouver for coming to her rescue in the rather foolish position in which she was placed Joe felt unaccountably annoyed She was willing to make sure of John herself if she could but she was not prepared to allow that privilege to any one else Accordingly she turned upon Vancouver before John could answer The question began in a foolish comparison mister Vancouver she said coldly I think you are inclined to make it personal I believe it became personal from the moment you hit upon mister Harrington and me as illustrations of what you were saying Miss Thorn retorted Vancouver very blandly but with a disagreeable look in his eyes He was angry at Joe s rebuke John stood calmly by without exhibiting the least shade of annoyance The chaff of a mere girl and the little satirical thrusts of a lady s man like Vancouver did not seem to him of much importance Joe however did not vouchsafe any answer to Vancouver s last remark and it devolved on John to say something to relieve the awkwardness of the situation Have you become reconciled to our methods of amusement Miss Thorn he asked or shall we devise something different from the everlasting sleighing and five o clock tea and dinner parties and dancing classes Oh do not remind me of all that said Joe I did not mean half of it you know She turned to John and Vancouver moved away in pursuit of Sybil Brandon who had just entered the room Tell me said Joe when Pocock was gone do you like mister Vancouver You are great friends are you not John looked at her inquiringly I should not say we were very great friends he answered because we are not intimate but we have always been on excellent terms as far as I know Vancouver is a very clever fellow Yes said Joe thoughtfully I fancy he is You do not mind my having asked do you Not in the least said John quietly His face had grown very grave again and he seemed suddenly absorbed by some thought Let us sit down he said presently and the two installed themselves on a divan in a corner You are not in the least inquisitive remarked Joe as soon as they were settled What makes you say that asked John It was such a silly thing you know and you never asked what it was all about When you called me No I did not hear what led up to it and I supposed from what you said afterwards that I understood Did you What did you think asked Joe I thought from the question about Vancouver that you wanted to put us into an awkward position in order to find out whether we were friends No said Joe with a little laugh I am not so clever as that It was pure silliness chaff you know that sort of thing Oh ejaculated John still quite unmoved then it was not of any importance Very silly things sometimes turn out to be very important Saul you know was not it he was looking for asses and he found a kingdom John laughed suddenly And so it is clear which part Vancouver and I played in the business he said But where is the kingdom I did not mean that said Joe seriously I am not making fun any more I have not been successful in my chaff to day I should think that in your career it would be very important for you to know who are your friends Is it not Certainly said John looking at her curiously It is very important but I think political life is generally much simpler than people suppose It is rather like fighting The man who hits you is your enemy The man who does not is practically your friend Do you mean in regard to Vancouver Yes Vancouver never hit me that I can swear said John and I am very sure I never hit him I dare say I am mistaken said Joe You ought to know best Let us leave him alone With all my heart answered John Tell me what you have been doing mister Harrington said Joe after a moment s pause all the papers are full of you Yes I have been rather in the passive mood during the last week I have been standing up to be shot at Without shooting back What are they so angry about The truth said John calmly They do not like to hear it What is truth in this instance Apparently something so unpleasant that the mere mention of it has roused the bile of every penny a liner in the Republican press I undertook to demonstrate that one of the fifteen millions of the ablest men in the country whom you are always hearing about is a swindler He is but he does not like to be told so I suppose not said Joe I wonder if any one likes unpleasant truths But what do you mean to do now Are you going to fight it out I hope so Of course in good time One can hardly retire from such a position as mine they would make an end of me in a week and quarrel over my bones But the real fight will be fought by and by when the elections come on How exciting it must all be said Joe I wish I were a man And an American asked John smiling How are the mighty fallen You were laughing at us and our politics the day before yesterday and now you are wishing you were one of us yourself I think you must be naturally fond of fighting Fond of a row suggested Miss Thorn with a laugh Yes I fancy I am I am fond of all active things Are not you I do not know said John I never thought much about it But I suppose I should be called rather an active person Is not she beautiful ejaculated Miss Thorn looking across the room at Sybil Brandon whose fair head was just visible between two groups of people Who asked John who was looking at his companion Miss Brandon said Joe Look at her over there I think she is the most beautiful thing I ever saw Yes said John she is very beautiful CHAPTER IV All sorts and conditions of men and women elbowed and crowded each other under the dim gaslight at the three entrances to the Boston Music Hall The snow was thick on the ground outside and it had been thawing all the afternoon The great booby sleighs slid and slipped and rocked through the wet stuff the policemen vociferated the horse car drivers on Tremont Street rang their bells furiously and a great crowd of pedestrians stumbled and tumbled about in the mud and slush and snow of the crossings all bent on getting inside the Music Hall in time for the beginning of the lecture The affair was called a lecture in accordance with the time honored custom of Boston and unless it were termed an oration it would be hard to find a better name for it A meeting implies a number of orators or at least a well filled row of chairs upon the platform A lecture on the other hand does not convey to the ordinary mind the idea of a political speech and critical persons with a taste for etymology say that the word means something which is read John Harrington had determined to speak in public on certain subjects connected with modern politics and had caused the fact to be extensively made known His name alone would have sufficed to draw a large audience but the great attention he had attracted by his doings for some time past and the severe criticisms lately made upon him by the local press rendered the interest even greater than it would otherwise have been Moreover the lecture was free Harrington was a poor man as fortunes go in Boston but it was his chiefest principle that a man had no right to be paid for speaking the truth even though it might sometimes be just that people should pay something for hearing it Accordingly the lecture was free and at the appointed hour the house was full to overflowing In the front row of the first gallery sat old Miss Schenectady and by her side was Josephine Thorn A little colony of Beacon Street had collected there and Pocock Vancouver was not far off It is not often that Beacon Street goes to such lectures but John was one of themselves and had too many friends and enemies among them not to be certain of a large attendance Miss Schenectady was there partly because she believed in John Harrington and partly because Joe insisted upon going and generally speaking what Joe insisted upon was done The old lady did not understand why her niece was so very anxious to be present but as the proposition fell in with her own desires she made no objection The fact was that Joe s interest in John had very greatly increased of late and her curiosity to hear the man she met so often speak to a great audience was excited to its highest pitch She fancied too from many things she had heard said that a large proportion of his audience would be hostile to him and that she would see him roused to his greatest strength and eloquence She did not consider her impulse in the least for though she felt a stronger interest in Harrington than she had ever before felt in any individual it had not struck her that she was beginning to care overmuch for the sight of his face and the sound of his voice She could not have believed she was beginning to love him and if any secret voice had suggested to her conscience that it was so she could have silenced it at once to her own satisfaction by merely remembering the coldness with which she generally treated him She had got into the habit of treating him in that way from the first when she had been prejudiced against him and the annoyance she often felt at his indifference made her think that she ought to be consistent and never allow her formal manner to change Unfortunately she now and then forgot herself as she had done after the little skirmish with Vancouver at missus Wyndham s and then she talked to him and asked him questions of himself almost as though he were an intimate friend John who was a man of the world as well as a man of talent thought she was capricious and since he was infinitely removed from falling in love with her or indeed with any other woman he found it agreeable to talk to her when she was in a good humor and when she was ungracious he merely kept out of her way If he had deliberately made up his mind to attract her attention and interest he could have chosen no surer way than this But although he admired her beauty and vivacity and now and then took a real pleasure in her conversation his mind was too full of other matters to receive any lasting impression of such a kind Besides she was capricious and he hated mere caprice And now there was a hush in the house and then a short burst of applause and Josephine looking down saw John standing alone upon the platform in front of the great bronze statue of Beethoven He looked exactly as he did when she met him in society there was no change in the even color of his face nor any awkwardness or self consciousness in his easy attitude as he stood there broad shouldered and square his strong hand just resting on the plain desk that had been placed in the middle of the stage He waited a few seconds for silence in the audience and then began to speak His voice sounded as natural and his accent as unaffected as though he were talking alone with a friend saving only that every syllable he uttered was audible in the furthest gallery Josephine leaned forward upon the red leather cushion of the railing before her watching and listening intently She did not understand the subject well John Harrington was a reformer she knew or to speak more accurately he desired to be one He believed great changes were necessary He believed in an established Civil Service in something which if not exactly Free Trade was much nearer to it than the existing tariff Above all he believed in truth and freedom instead of lying and bribery As he spoke and cleared the way to his main points his voice never quavered or faltered He was perfectly sure of himself and he reserved all his strength for the time when it should be most required For a quarter of an hour he proceeded and the people sat in dead silence before him Then he paused a moment and shifted his position a little moving a step forward as though to gain a better hearing I am coming to the point he said the point that I must come to sooner or later I am a Democrat as perhaps some of you know Here there was an uneasy movement in the house Yes I guess you are cried a voice from somewhere in a tone of high nasal irony Some one laughed and some one hissed and then there was silence again Exactly continued John unmoved by the interruption I am a Democrat and though the sight does not astonish you so much as it might have done twenty years ago it is worthy of remark nevertheless But I have a peculiarity which I think you will allow to be extremely novel I do not begin by saying that salvation is only to be found with Democrats and I will not believe any man who says it belongs exclusively to Republicans If we were suddenly put in great danger of any kind war famine or revolution I think that in some way or other we should manage to save the country between us Republicans and Democrats for the common good That s so said more than one voice Of course we should Is there any one among us all who would not give up his individual views about a local election rather than see the country go to pieces Would any man be such a coward as to be afraid to change his mind in order to prevent another Rebellion another Civil War No no we are more civilized than that We want our own men in Congress our own friends in office just so long as they are serviceable just so long as the country can stand it if you like it in that way But if it comes to be a question between the public good and having your cousin made postmaster in a country village I think there is enough patriotism in the average Democrat or Republican to send the country cousin about his business If worst comes to worst we can save the country between us depend upon it We have done it before Here there was a burst of willing applause It is a great point to bring an audience into the position of applauding themselves Joe watched John s every gesture and listened intently to every word His voice rang clear and strong through the great hall and he was beginning to be roused He had gained a decided advantage in the success of his last words and as he gathered his strength for the real effort which was to come his cheek paled and his gray eyes grew brighter He spoke out again through the subsiding clamor Now I say that the country is in danger It is in very great danger the greatest danger that can threaten any community The institutions of a nation are like the habits of a man except that they are harder to improve and easier to spoil We have got into bad habits and if we do not mend them they will take us to a more certain destruction than revolution famine or war or all three together It is easier to fight a thing that has a head to it and a name than a thing that is everywhere and has no name because no one has the courage to christen it We are like a man who has grown from being a peddler of tape and buttons to be the greatest dry goods man in his town and then to being a great dealer for many towns When he was a peddler he could carry the profit and loss on his buttons and tape in his head because the profits were literally in his pocket and the losses were literally out of it But when he has grown into a great merchant he must keep books and he must keep a great many of them and they must be kept accurately or he will get into trouble and go to ruin That is true is it not And when he was a peddler he could buy his stock in trade himself and be sure that it was what he wanted but when he is one of the great merchants he must employ other people to help him and unless they are the right people and understand the business he will be ruined Nobody can deny that Very well We began in a small way as a nation without much stock in trade and we kept our accounts by rule of thumb But it seems to me we are doing a pretty large business as a nation just now There was a laugh and sundry remarks to the effect that the audience understood what John was driving at Yes we are doing a great business and to all intents and purposes we are doing it on false business principles and with an absolutely incompetent staff of clerks What would you think of a merchant who dismissed all his book keepers every four years and engaged a set of shoemakers or tailors or artists or musicians to fill up the vacancies A low murmur ran through the hall a murmur of disapprobation Probably a large number out of the three thousand men and women present had cousins in country post offices But John did not pause his voice grew full and clear ringing high above the dull sounds in the house From her place in the gallery Josephine looked down never taking her eyes from the face of the orator She too was pale with excitement had she been willing to acknowledge it it was fear That deep toned beginning of a protest from the great concourse was like an omen of failure to her sensitive ear She longed to see John Harrington succeed and carry his hearers with him into an access of enthusiasm John expected no such thing He only wanted the people to understand thoroughly what he meant for he was sure that if once they knew the truth clearly they would feel for it as he himself did Nevertheless he continued I tell you that is what we are doing what we have been doing for years from the very beginning And if we go on doing it we shall get into trouble We choose schoolboys to do the work of men we expect that by the mere signature of the head of the executive any man can be turned into an accomplished public officer fit to be compared with one whose whole life has been spent in the public service We wish to be represented abroad among foreign nations in a way becoming to our dignity and very great power and we select as our ministers a number of gentlemen who in most cases have never read a diplomatic dispatch in their lives and who sometimes are not even acquainted with any language save their own Perhaps you will say that our dignity is not of much importance provided our power is great enough I do not think you will say it but there are communities in our country where it would most certainly be said Very well so be it But where do you think our power comes from Do you think there is a boundless store of some natural product called power of which we need only take as much as we want in order to stand a head and shoulders higher than any other nation in the world What is power Can a man be strong if he has an internal disease or is his strength any use to him if his arms and legs are out of joint Would you believe in the strength of a great firm that hired a company of actors from a theatre and made the tragedian cashier and the low comedy man head book keeper The sick man may live for years with his sickness and the man whose limbs are all distorted may still deal a formidable blow with his head if it is thick enough The firm may prosper for a time with its staff of theatrical clerks provided there is enough business to pay for all their mistakes and leave a margin of profit But the sick man does not live because he is diseased but in spite of it The distorted joints of the cripple do not help him to fight The firm is not rich because its business is done by tragedians and walking gentlemen but in spite of them If the doctor fails to give his medicine if the fighting grows too rough for the cripple if business grows slack or if some good business man with competent assistants starts a strong opposition what happens What must inevitably happen Why the sick man dies the cripple gets the worst of it and the theatrical firm of merchants goes straight into bankruptcy And so I tell you that we are in danger We are sick with the foul disease of office seeking we are crippled hand and foot not only for fighting but for working because our public officers are inexperienced men who spend four years in learning a trade not theirs and are very generally turned out before they have half learnt it we are doing a political business which will succeed fairly well just so long as we are rich enough to provide funds for any amount of extravagance and keep enough in our pockets to buy bread and cheese with afterwards Just so long When we have been lanced here in Boston and the blood is running freely we can still cut a slice out of the West and use it like court plaster to stop the bleeding Some day there will be no more slices to be had It will be a bad day in State Street This remark raised a laugh and a good deal of noise for a moment But the audience were soon silent again Whether they meant to approve or disapprove they kept their opinions to themselves Miss Thorn did not comprehend the allusion but she was listening with all her ears You understand that John went on Then understand it about the rest of the country as well Understand that we are all the time patching our income with our capital and it answers pretty well because there is a good deal of capital and not so very many of ourselves as yet There will be twice as many of us in a few years and very much less than half as much capital Understand above all that we are getting into bad habits habits we should despise in a corporation and condemn by very bad names in any individual man of our acquaintance And when you have understood it look at matters as they stand Look at the incompetence of our public officers look at our ruined carrying trade at those vile enactions of fools and worse than fools the Navigation Laws of the United States and tell me whether things are as they should be Tell me what has become of liberty if you cannot buy a ship where you can get her best and cheapest and hoist your own flag upon her and call her your own You may pay for her and bring her home with you but though she were ten times paid for you cannot hoist the American flag nor register her in your own port nor claim the protection of your country for your own property because forsooth the ship was not built on American stocks where she would cost three times her value and put a job into the hands of a set of builders of river steamboats and harbor mudscows Loud murmurs ran through the audience and cries of That s so and counter cries of Freetrader were heard on all sides John s great voice rang out like a trumpet He knew the sensitiveness of his townsmen on the point I am not speaking against protection he said and at the magic word protection a dead silence again fell over the vast crowd I say to you Protect Protect all of you merchants tradesmen the great body of the commerce of this country protect whatever you all decide together needs protection But by the greatness and the power you have by the Heaven that gave us this land of ours to till and to enjoy protect also yourselves and your liberties A patriotic phrase in the mouth of a man who has the golden gift of speech coupled with the statement of a principle popular with his audience is a sure point in an oration Something in John s tone and gesture touched the sympathetic chord and the house broke out in a great cry of applause An orator cannot always talk in strict logical sequence He must search about for the right nail till he has found it and then drive it home Aye that is the point he said You men of Boston here look to your harbors crowded with English craft and think of what is gone lost to you forever unless you will strike a blow for it Many of you are old enough to remember how it used to be Look at Salem Harbor at Marblehead Where are the fleets of noble ships that lay side by side along the great docks the ships that did half the carrying trade of the world Where are the great merchantmen that used to sail so grandly away to the East and that came home so richly laden They are sunk or gone to pieces or sold as old timber and copper and nails to the gentlemen who build mudscows What are the great merchants doing who owned those fleets They are employing their time in building railroads with English iron and foreign labor into desolate deserts in the West which they hope to sell for a handsome profit and probably will But when there are no more desolate deserts and English iron and foreign labor to be had they will wish they had their ships again and that in all these years they had got possession of the carrying trade of the world as they might have done That is what I am here to say The time is come to give up the shifts and unstable expedients that we needed or thought we needed in our early beginnings Let us pull down all these scaffoldings and stages that have helped us to build and let us see whether our fabric will stand upon its base erect without the paltry support of a few rotting timbers Let us substitute the permanent for the transitory the stable for the unstable and the reality for the sham Let us have a Civil Service in fact as well as in name a service of men trained to their duties and who shall spend their lives in fulfilling them a service of competent men to represent us abroad and a service of honest men to do the country s business at home instead of making the country do theirs and being paid for it into the bargain Let us put men into Congress who will cover the seas with our ships again as well as make our harbors impassable with a competition of cheap ferry boats Begin here as you began here more than a hundred years ago and as you succeeded then you will succeed now Begin and go on and God prosper you and when the work is done when bribery and extortion and all corruption are crushed forever out of our public life when the Navigation Act is a thing of the past and you are again the carriers of the world s commerce as well as the greatest sharers in it then it will be time enough to give a name to the men who shall have done all these things Republicans and Democrats together a new party the last and the greatest of all parties that the country has ever seen You will find a name surely enough that will answer the purpose then but whatever that name may be it will not be forgotten that for the third time in the history of our land Massachusetts has struck the first and the strongest blow in the struggle for liberty honor and truth Few men in public life had as good a right as John Harrington to denounce all manner of dishonesty Many a speaker would have raised a sneering laugh by that last phrase but even John s enemies admitted that his hands were clean Coming from one of themselves it was a strong appeal and the applause was long and loud With a courteous inclination John turned and left the platform through the door at the back He was well enough satisfied His hearers had been moved for a moment to enthusiasm They would go home and on mature reflection would not agree with him but a blow struck is a point in the fight so long as it is felt at all and John was well pleased at the reception he had met with He had avoided every detail and had confined himself to the widest generalities but his homely illustrations would not be forgotten and his strong individuality had created a sincere desire in many who had been there that night to hear him speak again For some minutes after John had left the platform Josephine sat unmoved in her seat beside her aunt lost in thought as she watched the surging crowd below Well said Miss Schenectady you have heard John Harrington now Joe started She had grown used to the implied interrogation her aunt usually conveyed in that way He is a great man Aunt Zoe she said quietly and looked round There was a moisture in her beautiful brown eyes that told of great excitement She was very pale too and looked tired Yes my dear said Aunt Zoruiah But we had better go home right away Joe darling You are so pale I suppose you must be a good deal used up Allow me to see you to your carriage said Pocock Vancouver in dulcet tones coming up to the two ladies as they rose CHAPTER V Why can t you get in mister Vancouver inquired Miss Schenectady when she and Joe were at last packed into the deep booby It was simply a form of invitation There was no reason why mister Vancouver should not get in and with a word of thanks he did so Ten minutes later the three were seated round the fire in Miss Schenectady s drawing room It was very fine was it not Miss Thorn said Vancouver Yes said Joe staring at the fire There are some people said Miss Schenectady it does not seem to make much difference what they say but it is always fine Is that ironical asked Vancouver Why goodness gracious no Of course not I am John Harrington s very best friend I only mean to say What Aunt Zoe inquired Joe not yet altogether accustomed to the peculiar implications of her aunt s language Why what I said of course it sounds very fine Then you do not believe it all asked Vancouver I don t understand politics said the old lady You might ring the bell Joe and ask Sarah for some tea Nobody understands politics said Vancouver When people do there will be an end of them Politics consist in one half of the world trying to drive paradoxes down the throats of the other half Joe laughed a little I do not know anything about politics here she said though I do at home of course I must say though mister Harrington did not seem so very paradoxical Oh no answered Vancouver blandly I did not mean in this case Harrington is very much in earnest But it is like war you see When every one understands it thoroughly it will stop by universal consent Did you ever read Bulwer s Coming Race Yes said Joe I always read those books Vril and that sort of thing you mean Oh yes Approximately answered Vancouver It was an allegory you know A hundred years hence people will write a book to explain what Bulwer meant Vril stands for the cumulative power of potential science of course I think Bulwer s word shorter and a good deal easier to understand said Joe laughing It is a great thing to be great remarked Miss Schenectady Sarah I think you might bring us some tea please and ask John if he couldn t stir the furnace a little And then to have people explain you Goethe must be a good deal amused I expect when people write books to prove that Byron was Euphorion Miss Schenectady was fond of German literature and the extent of her reading was a constant surprise to her niece What a lot of things you know Aunt Zoe said Joe But what had Bulwer to do with war mister Vancouver Oh in the book the Coming Race you know they abolished war because they could kill each other so easily How nice that would be exclaimed Joe looking at him Why you perfectly shock me Joe cried Miss Schenectady I mean to have no war returned Joe sweetly Oh I belonged to the Peace Conference myself said her aunt immediately pacified Well yes Perhaps you could bring us a little cake Sarah War is a terrible thing my dear as mister Vancouver will tell you Vancouver however was silent He probably did not care to have it remembered that he was old enough to carry a musket in the Rebellion Joe understood and asked no Questions about it and Vancouver was grateful for her tact She rose and began to pour out some tea You began talking about mister Harrington s speech said she presently but we got away from the subject Is it all true That is scarcely a fair question Miss Thorn answered Vancouver You see I belong to the opposite party in politics But mister Harrington said he wanted both parties to combine Besides you do not take any active part in it all I have very strong opinions nevertheless replied Pocock Strong opinions and activity ought to go together said Joe Not always But if you have strong opinions and disagree with mister Harrington persisted Miss Thorn then you have a strong opinion against your two parties acting together for the common good Not exactly that said Vancouver embarrassed between the directness of Joe s question and a very strong impression that he had better not say anything against John Harrington Then what do you believe Will you please give this cup to Miss Schenectady Vancouver rose quickly to escape Cream and sugar Miss Schenectady he said Ah Miss Thorn has already put them in It is such celebrated tea of yours Do you know I always look forward to a cup of it as one of the greatest pleasures in life When you have quite done praising the tea will you please tell me what you believe about mister Harrington s speech said the inexorable Joe drowning her aunt s reply to Vancouver s polite remark Thus cornered Vancouver faced the difficulty I believe it was a very good speech he said mildly Do you believe what he said was true A great deal of it was true but I assure you that Harrington is very enthusiastic Much of it was extremely imaginative I dare say all that about making a Civil Service I suppose Well not exactly I think all good Republicans hope to have a regular Civil Service some day It is necessary or will be so before long But then it is what he said about that ridiculous Navigation Act that you object to pursued Joe without mercy Really I think it would be an advantage to repeal it It is only kept up for the sake of a few builders who have influence Ah I see exclaimed Joe triumphantly you think the hope he expressed that bribery and that sort of thing might be suppressed was altogether imaginary I hope not Miss Thorn But I am sure there is not nearly so much of it as he made out It was a very great exaggeration Was there Really he only used the word once in the most general way I remember very well at the end he said when bribery corruption and all extortion are crushed forever anybody might say that You make out a wonderfully good case Miss Thorn said Vancouver who was not altogether pleased was the speech printed before Harrington spoke it this evening No exclaimed Joe I have a very good memory in that way just to remember what I hear I could repeat word for word everything he said and everything you have said since during the evening What a terrible person you are said Vancouver smiling pleasantly Well then now that you have proved every word of Harrington s speech out of an opponent s evidence I will tell you frankly how it is that I do not agree with him He is a Democrat I am a Republican That is the whole story I do not believe nor shall I ever believe that any large number of the two parties can work together I cannot help my belief in the least it is a matter of conscience Nevertheless I have a very great respect for Harrington and as 
2787_157400_000049_000001	train-clean-360	I take no active part 
none	none	whatever in any political contest my opinion of his politics will never interfere with my personal feeling for him Frankness seemed to be mister Vancouver s strong point Joe was obliged to admit that he spoke clearly even if she did not greatly respect his logic During all this time Miss Schenectady had been sipping her tea in silence Joe she said at last you are a perfect Socrates for questions You ought to have been a lawyer I wish I were said Joe laughing or Socrates himself Yes you ought to have been Here you know nothing at all about this thing and you have been talking like anything for half an hour I think Socrates was perfectly horrid So do I said Vancouver laughing aloud Why Joe asked turning to her aunt To be always stopping people in the street and button holing them with his questions Of course it was very clever as Plato makes it out but I do wish he could have met me when I was young my dear I would have answered him once and for all Try me Aunt Zoe for practice said Joe until you meet him Really I expect you would do almost as well Look at mister Vancouver he is quite used up The case was not so serious with mister Vancouver as the old lady made it out to be He was silent and to all intents vanquished for the present but it was not long before he turned the conversation to other things and succeeded in making himself very agreeable He admired Josephine very much and though she occasionally made him feel very uncomfortable he always returned to the charge with renewed intelligence and sweetness Joe liked him too in spite of an unfounded suspicion she felt that he was dangerous He was always ready when she needed anything at a party he never bored her but whenever he saw she was wearied by any one else he came up and saved her clearing a place for himself at her side with an ease that bespoke long and constant experience of the world Women especially young women always like men of that description they are flattered at the attention of a man who is so evidently able to choose and they enjoy the immunity from all annoyance and weariness that such men are able to carry with them Consequently Joe accepted the attentions of Pocock Vancouver with a certain amount of satisfaction and she had not been displeased that he should come to Miss Schenectady s house for tea The evening passed quickly and Vancouver took his leave As he opened the front door to let himself out he nearly fell over a small telegraph messenger Thorn here inquired the boy laconically Yes I ll take it in said Vancouver quickly He went back with the telegram and the boy stood inside the door waiting for the receipt He noticed the stamp of the Cable Office on the envelope Miss Thorn said Vancouver entering the drawing room again hat in hand I just met this telegram on the steps so I brought it in It may need an answer you know Thanks so much said Joe tearing open the pale yellow cover She was startled not being accustomed to receive telegrams Her brow contracted as she read the contents and she tapped her small foot on the carpet impatiently THORN care Schenectady Beacon Boston Sailed to day RONALD Josephine crushed the paper in her hand and signed the receipt with the pencil Vancouver offered her Thanks so much she said again but in a different tone of voice Any answer suggested Vancouver Thanks no answered Joe 
2787_157400_000118_000001	train-clean-360	Good night 
none	none	again Good night And Vancouver departed wondering what the message could have been Miss Schenectady had looked on calmly throughout the little scene and nodded to Pocock as he left the room her peculiarities were chiefly those of diction she was a well bred old lady not without wisdom Nothing wrong Joe she inquired when alone with her niece I hardly know answered Joe Ronald has just sailed from England I suppose he will be here in ten days Business here asked Miss Schenectady Oh dear no He knows nothing about business I wish he would stay at home What a bore It was evident that Joe had changed her mind since she had written to Ronald a fortnight before It seemed to her now when she looked forward to Surbiton s coming that he would not find his place in Boston society so easily as she had done Of course he would expect to see her every day and to spend all his leisure hours at Miss Schenectady s house Whatever she happened to be doing it would always be necessary to take Ronald into consideration and the prospect did not please her at all Ronald was a dear good fellow of course and she meant to marry him in the end at least she probably would But then she intended to marry him at a more convenient season some time in the future She knew him well and she was certain that when he saw her surrounded by her Boston acquaintances his British nature would assert itself and he would claim her or try to claim her and persuade her to go away She bid Miss Schenectady good night and went to her room and presently when she was sure every one was in bed in the house she stole down to the drawing room again and sat alone by the remains of the coal fire thinking what she should do Josephine Thorn was young and more full of life and activity than most girls of her age She enjoyed what came in her way to enjoy with a passionate zest and she had the reputation of being somewhat capricious and changeable But she was honest in all her thoughts and very clear sighted People often said she spoke her mind too freely and was not enough in awe of the veiled deity known in society as The Thing How she hated it How many times she had been told that what she said and did was not quite The Thing She knew now what Ronald would say when he came if he found her worshiped on all sides by Pocock Vancouver and his younger and less accomplished compeers Ronald would say it was rather rough you know She sat by the fire and thought the matter over and when she came to formulating in her mind the exact words that Ronald would say she paused to think of him and how he would look He was handsome far handsomer than Vancouver or or John Harrington He was very nice much nicer than Vancouver John Harrington was different nice did not describe him but Ronald was nicer than all the other men she knew He would make a charming husband At the thought Joe started My husband she repeated aloud to herself in the silence Then she rose quickly to her feet and leaned against the smooth white marble mantelpiece and buried her face in her small white hands for an instant Oh no no no no she cried aloud It is impossible oh no never I never really meant it did I She stared at herself in the glass for a few seconds and her face was very pale Then she bent over her hands again and the tears came and wetted them a little and at last she sat down as she had sat before and stared vacantly at the fire It would be very wrong to break Ronald s heart she thought He would come to her so full of hope and gladness how could she tell him she did not love him But how was it possible that in all these years she had never before understood that she could not marry him It had always seemed so natural to marry Ronald And yet she must have always really felt just as she did to night only she had never realized it never at all Why had it come over her so suddenly too It would have been so much better if she could have seen the truth at home before she parted from him for it would be so hard for him to bear it now after coming across the ocean to see her so cruelly hard Dear Ronald and yet he must be told Yes there was no doubt about it the very first meeting must explain it to him He would say what would he say He would tell her she liked some one else better Some one else Some one who had stolen away her heart of course he would say that But he would be wrong for there was no one else not one of all these men she had seen who had so much as breathed a word of love to her None whom she liked nearly so much as Ronald no not one For a long time she sat very quietly following a train of thought that was half unconscious Her lips moved now and then as though she were repeating something to herself and gradually the pained and anxious expression of her face melted away into a look of peace The old gilt clock upon the chimney piece struck twelve in its shrill steel tones Josephine started at the sound and passed one hand over her eyes as though to rouse herself and at the same time a deep blush spread over her delicate cheek For with the voice of midnight there was also the voice of a man ringing in her ears and she heard the two together so that it seemed as though all the world must hear them also and her gentle maiden s soul was shamed at the thought So it is that our loves are always with us and though we search ourselves diligently to find them and rebuke them we find them not but if we give up searching they come upon us unawares and speak very soft words Love also is a gentle thing full of sweetness and peace when he comes to us so and though the maiden blushes at his speaking she would not stop the ears of her heart against him for all the world and although the boy trembles and turn pale and forgets to be boyish when the fit is on him nevertheless he goes near and worships and loses his heart in learning a new language So kind and soft is love so tender and sweet spoken that you would think he would not so much as ruffle the leaf of a rose nor breathe too sharply on a violet lest he should hurt the flower soul within and if you treat him hospitably he is kind to the last so that when he is gone there is still a sweet savor of him left But if you would drive him roughly away with scorn and rude language he will stand at your door and will not leave you Then his wings drop from him and he grows strong and fierce and deadly and beautiful as the fallen archangel of heaven crying aloud bitter things to you by day and night till at the last he will break down bolt and bar and panel and enter your chamber and drag you out with him to your death in the wild darkness But Josephine blushed deeply there in the old fashioned drawing room at midnight and as she turned away she wondered at herself for she could not believe nor understand what was happening Poor girl She had talked of love so often as an abstract thing she had seen so many love makings of others and so many men had tried to make love to her in her short brilliant life and she had always thought it could not come near her because of course she really loved Ronald She had marveled indeed at what people were willing to do and at what they were ready to sacrifice for a feeling that seemed to her of such little importance as that It had been an illusion and the waking had come at last very suddenly Whoever it might be whom she was destined to take it was not Ronald It was madness to think she could be bound forever to him however much she might admire him and desire him as a friend When the clock struck she was thinking of John and the words he had said that night to his great audience were ringing again in her ears She blushed indeed at the idea that she was thinking so much of him but it was not that she believed she loved him If as yet she really did she was herself most honestly unconscious of it and so the blush was not accounted for in the reckoning she made She lay awake long trying to determine what was best to be done but she could not One thing she must do she must explain to Ronald when he came that she could never never marry him If only she had a sister or some one Dear Aunt Zoruiah was so horrid about such things that it was impossible to talk to her CHAPTER VI Do you know how to skate Sybil Brandon asked of Joe as the two young girls clad in heavy furs walked down the sunny side of Beacon Street two days later They were going from Miss Schenectady s to a lunch party one of those social institutions of Boston which had most surprised Joe on her first arrival Of course answered Joe I do not know anything but I can do everything How nice said Sybil Then you can go with us to night That will be too lovely What is it We are all going skating on Jamaica Pond Nobody has skated for so long here that it is a novelty I used to be so fond of it We always skate at home when there is ice said Joe It will be enchanting though with the full moon and all What time missus Sam Wyndham will arrange that said Sybil She is going to matronize us How dreadful to have to be chaperoned ejaculated Joe But missus Wyndham is very jolly after all so it does not much matter I believe they used to have Germans here without any mothers remarked Sybil but they never do now Poor little things how awfully lonely for them laughed Joe Who The Germans without their mothers Oh I forgot the German was the cotillon You mean cotillons without tapestry as we say Yes exactly But about the skating party It will be very select you know just ourselves You know I never go out Sybil added rather sadly but I do love skating so Who are ourselves exactly Why you and I and the Sam Wyndhams and the Aitchison girls and mister Topeka and mister Harrington and mister Vancouver let me see and Miss saint Joseph and young Hannibal He is very nice and is very attentive to Miss saint Joseph Is it nice like that skating about in couples asked Joe No that is the disagreeable part but the skating is delicious Let us stay together all the time said Joe spontaneously it will be ever so much pleasanter I would not exactly like to be paired off with any of those men you know Sybil looked at Joe opening her wide blue eyes in some astonishment She did not think Joe was exactly one of those young women who object to a moonlight tete a tete if properly chaperoned Yes if you like dear she said I would like it much better myself of course Do you know Sybil said Joe looking up at her taller companion I should not think you would care for skating and that sort of thing Why asked Sybil You do not look strong enough You are not a bit like me brought up on horseback Oh I am very strong answered Sybil only I am naturally pale you see and people think I am delicate But the north wind kissed her fair face and the faint color came beneath the white and through it so that Joe looked at her and thought she was the fairest woman in the world that day When I was a little girl said Joe mamma used to tell me a story about the beautiful Snow Angel she must have been just like you dear What is the story asked Sybil the delicate color in her cheek deepening a little I will tell you to night when we are skating we have not time now Here we are And the two girls went up the steps of the house where they were going to lunch On the other side of the street Pocock Vancouver and John Harrington met and stopped to speak just as Joe and Sybil had rung the bell and stood waiting at the head of the steps Don t let us look at each other so long as we can look at them said Vancouver shaking hands with John but looking across the street at the two girls John looked too and both men bowed They are pretty enough for anything are they not continued Vancouver Yes said John they are very pretty With a nod and a smile Joe and Sybil disappeared into the house Why don t you marry her asked Vancouver Which The English girl No Sybil Brandon Thank you I am not thinking of being married said John a half comic half contemptuous look in his strong face Miss Brandon could do better than marry a penniless politician and besides even if I wanted it I care too much for Miss Brandon s friendship to risk losing it by asking her to marry me Nonsense my dear fellow said Vancouver she would accept you straight off So would the other You ought to know said John eyeing his companion calmly Vancouver looked away it was generally believed that he had been refused by Miss Brandon more than a year previous Well you can take my word for it you could not do better he answered ambiguously There is no knowing how the moonlight effects on Jamaica Pond may strike you this evening I say though you were pretty lucky in having such warm weather the night before last Yes said John The house was full Were you there Of course If I were not a Republican I would congratulate you on your success It is a long time since any one has made a Boston audience listen to those opinions You did it surprisingly well that sentence about protection was a masterpiece I wish you were one of us It is of no use arguing with you said John If it were I could make a Democrat of you in an afternoon I make a pretty good thing of arguing though answered the other It s my trade you see and it is not yours You lay down the law it is my business to make a living out of it I wish I could lay it down as you say and lay it down according to my own ideas said John I would have something to say to you railroad men As for that I should not care Railroad law is stronger than iron and more flexible than india rubber and the shape of it is of no importance whatever So long as there is enough of it to work with you can twist it and untwist it as much as you please John laughed It would simplify matters to untwist it and cut it up into lengths he said But then your occupation would be gone I think my occupation will last my life time answered Vancouver laughing in his turn Not if I can help it returned John But we can provide you with another Good by I am going to Cambridge They shook hands cordially and John Harrington turned down Charles Street while Vancouver pursued his way up the hill He had been going in the opposite direction when he met Harrington but he seemed to have changed his mind He was not seen again that day until he went to dine with missus Sam Wyndham There was no one there but mister Topeka and young John C Hannibal well dressed men of five and thirty and five and twenty respectively belonging to good families of immense fortune and educated regardless of expense No homely Boston phrase defiled their anglicized lips their great collars stood up under their chins in an ecstasy of stiffness and their shirt fronts bore two buttons avoiding the antiquity of three and the vulgarity of one Well bred Anglo maniacs both but gentlemen withal and courteous to the ladies mister Topeka was a widower John C Hannibal was understood to be looking for a wife They came they dined and they retired to Sam Wyndham s rooms to don their boots and skating clothes At nine o clock the remaining ladies arrived and then the whole party got into a great sleigh and were driven rapidly out of town over the smooth snow to Jamaica Pond John Harrington had not come and only three persons missed him Joe Thorn missus Sam and Pocock Vancouver The ice had been cut away in great quantities for storing and the thaw had kept the pond open for a day or two Then came the sharpest frost of the winter and in a few hours the water was covered with a broad sheet of black ice that would bear any weight It was a rare piece of good fortune but the fashion of skating had become so antiquated that no one took advantage of the opportunity and as the party got out of the sleigh and made their way down the bank they saw that there was but one skater before them sweeping in vast solitary circles out in the middle of the pond under the cold moonlight The party sat on the bank in the shadow of some tall pine trees preparing for the amusement piling spare coats and shawls on the shoulders of a patient groom and screwing and buckling their skates on their feet What beautiful ice exclaimed Joe when Vancouver had done his duty by the straps and fastenings She tapped the steel blade twice or thrice on the hard black surface still leaning on Vancouver s arm and then without a word of warning shot away in a long sweeping roll The glorious vitality in her was all alive and her blood thrilled and beat wildly in utter enjoyment She did not go far at first but seeing the others were long in their preparations she turned and faced them skating away backwards leaning far over to right and left on each changing stroke and listening with intense pleasure to the musical ring of the clanging steel on the clean ice Some pride she felt too at showing the little knot of Bostonians how thoroughly at home she was in a sport they seemed to consider essentially American Joe had not noticed the solitary skater and thought herself alone but in a few moments she was aware of a man in an overcoat bowing before her as he slackened his speed She turned quickly to one side and stopped herself for the man was John Harrington Why where did you come from mister Harrington she asked in some astonishment You were not hidden under the seats of the sleigh were you Not exactly said John looking about for the rest of the party I was belated in Cambridge this afternoon so I borrowed a pair of skates and walked over Splendid ice is it not I am so glad you came said Joe She was in such high spirits and was so genuinely pleased at meeting John that she forgot to be cold to him It would have been a dreadful pity to have missed this It would indeed said John skating slowly by her side For down by the pine trees two or three figures began to move on the ice I want to thank you mister Harrington said Joe What for Miss Thorn he asked For the pleasure you gave me the other night she answered I have not seen you since to speak to It was splendid Thanks said John I saw you there in the gallery on my left Yes but how could you have time to look about and recognize people You must have splendid eyes It is all a habit said John When one has been before an audience a few times one does not feel nervous and so one has time to look about Do you care for that sort of thing Miss Thorn Oh ever so much But I was frightened once when they began to grumble There was nothing to fear said John laughing Audiences of that kind do not punctuate one s speeches with cabbages and rotten eggs They do sometimes in England said Joe But here come the others Two and two in a certain grace of order the little party came out from the shore into the moonlight The women s faces looked white and waxen against their rich furs and the moonbeams sparkled on their ornaments A very pretty sight is a moonlight skating party and Pocock Vancouver knew what he was saying when he hinted at the mysterious and romantic influences that are likely to be abroad on such occasions Indeed it was not long before young Hannibal was sliding away hand in hand with Miss saint Joseph at a pace that did not invite competition And mister Topeka decided which of the Aitchison girls he preferred and gave her his arm so that the other fell to the lot of Sam Wyndham while missus Sam and Sybil Brandon came out escorted by Vancouver who noticed with some dismay that the party was a man short The moment he saw Joe talking to the solitary skater he knew that the latter must be Harrington who had gone to Cambridge and come across John bowed to every one and shook hands with missus Wyndham Joe eluded Vancouver and put her arm through Sybil s as though to take possession of her Joe would have been well enough pleased at first to have been left with John but the sight of Vancouver somehow reminded her of the compact she had made in the morning with Sybil and in a few moments the two girls were away together talking so persistently to each other that Vancouver who at first followed them and tried to join their conversation was fain to understand that he was not wanted so that he returned to missus Wyndham I want so much to talk to you Joe began when they were alone Yes dear said Sybil half interrogatively as they moved along We can talk here charmingly unless mister Vancouver comes after us again But you do skate beautifully you know I had no idea you could Oh I told you I could do everything said Joe with some pride Where did you get that beautiful fur my dear It is magnificent You are just like the Snow Angel now In Russia Everybody wears white fur there you know We were in saint Petersburg some time I know We cannot get it in England If one could I would have told Ronald to bring me some when he comes Who is Ronald asked Sybil innocently Oh he is the dearest boy said Joe with a little sigh but I do so wish he were not coming Because he has not got the white fur suggested Sybil Oh no But because Joe lowered her voice and spoke demurely at the same time linking her arm more closely in Sybil s You see dear he wants to marry me and I am afraid he is coming to say so And you do not want to marry him Is that it Joe s small mouth closed tightly and she merely nodded her head gravely looking straight before her Sybil pressed her arm sympathetically and was silent expecting more It was such a long time ago you see said Joe after a while I was not out when it was arranged and it seemed so natural But now it is quite different But of course if you do not love him you must not think of marrying him said Sybil simply I won t answered Joe with sudden emphasis But I shall have to tell him you know she added despondently It is very hard to say those things said Sybil in a tone of reflection But of course it must be done if you were really engaged that is Yes almost really said Joe Not quite suggested Sybil I think not quite but I know he thinks it is quite quite you know Well but perhaps he is not so certain after all Do you know I do not think men really care so much do you Oh of course not said Joe scornfully But it does not seem quite honest to let a man think you are going to marry him if you do not mean to But you did mean to dear until you found out you did not care for him enough And just think how dreadful it would be to be married if you did not care enough Yes that is true answered Joe It would be dreadful for him too When is he coming asked Sybil I think next week He sailed the day before yesterday Then there is plenty of time to settle on what you want to say said Sybil If you make up your mind just how to put it you know it will be ever so much easier Oh no cried Joe I will trust to luck I always do it is much easier Excuse me Miss Brandon said the voice of Vancouver who came up behind them at a great pace and holding his feet together let himself slide rapidly along beside the two girls excuse me but do you not think you are very unsociable going off in this way May I give you my arm Miss Thorn asked Harrington coming up on the other side Without leaving each other Joe and Sybil took the proffered arms of the two men and the four skated smoothly out into the middle of the ice that rang again in the frosty air under their joint weight missus Wyndham had insisted that Vancouver and Harrington should leave her and follow the young girls and they had obeyed in mutual understanding Which do you like better Miss Brandon boating in Newport or skating on Jamaica Pond asked Vancouver This is better than the Music Hall is it not remarked John to Miss Thorn Oh Jamaica Pond by far Sybil answered and her hold on Joe s arm relaxed a very little Oh no I would a thousand times rather be in the Music Hall exclaimed Joe and her hand slipped away from Sybil s white fur And so the four were separated into couples and went their ways swiftly under the glorious moonlight As they parted Sybil turned her head and looked after Joe but Joe did not see her I would rather be here said John quietly Why asked Joe There is enough fighting in life to make peace a very desirable thing sometimes John answered A man cannot be always swinging his battle axe There was a very slight shade of despondency in the tone of his voice Joe noticed it at once Women do not all worship success however much they may wish their champion to win when they are watching him fight In the brilliant unfailing all conquering man the woman who loves him feels pride if she be vain and ambitious she feels wholly satisfied for the time But woman s best part is her gentle sympathy and where there is no room at all for that there is very often little room for love In the changing hopes and fears of uncertain struggles a woman s love well given and truly kept may turn the scale for a man and it is at such times perhaps that her heart is given best and most loyally held by him who has it I wish I could do anything to help him to succeed thought Joe in the innocent generosity of her half conscious devotion Has anything gone wrong she asked aloud CHAPTER VII Has anything gone wrong There was so much of interest and sympathy in her tone as Joe put the simple question that John turned and looked into her face The magic of moonlight softens the hardest features makes interest look like friendship and friendship like love but it can harden too at times and make a human face look like carved stone No there is nothing wrong John answered presently what made you think so You spoke a little regretfully answered Joe Did I I did not mean to Perhaps one is less gay and less hopeful at some times than at others It has nothing to do with success or failure I know answered Joe One can be dreadfully depressed when one is enjoying one s self to any extent But I should not have thought you were that sort of person You seem always the same I try to be That is the great difference between people who live to work and people who live to amuse and be amused How do you mean I mean said John that people who work especially people who have to do with large ideas and great movements need to be more or less monotonous The men who succeed are the men of one idea or at least they are the men who only have one idea at a time Whereas people who live to amuse and be amused must have as many ideas as possible Yes to play with said John completing the sentence Their life is play their ideas are their playthings and so soon as they have spoiled one toy they must have another The people who supply ideas to an idle public are very valuable and may have great power Novel writers and that sort of people suggested Joe All producers of light literature and second rate poetry and a very great variety of other people besides A man who amuses others may often be a worker himself He raises a laugh or excites a momentary interest by getting rid of his superfluous ideas and imaginations reserving to himself all the time the one idea in which he believes Not at all a bad theory said Joe There are more men of that sort with you in Europe than with us You need more amusement and you will generally give more for it You English who are uncommonly fond of doing nothing give yourselves vast trouble in the pursuit of pleasure We Americans who are ill when we are idle are content to surround ourselves with the paraphernalia of pleasure when office hours are over but we make very little use of our opportunities for amusement being tired out at the end of the day with other things which we think more important The result is that we have no such thing as what you denominate Society because we lack the prime element of aristocratic social intercourse the ingrained determination to be idle You are very hard on us remarked Joe Excuse me returned John you are compensated by having what we have not Europeans are the most agreeable people in the world wherever mutual and daily conversation and intercourse are to be considered The majority of you of polite European society are not troubled with any very large ideas but you have an immense number of very charming and attractive small ones In America there are only two ideas that practically affect society but they are very big ones indeed What asked Joe laconically growing interested in John s queer lecture Money and political influence answered John Harrington They are the two great motors of our machine All men who are respected among us are in pursuit of one or the other or have attained to one or the other by their own efforts The result is that European society is amusing and agreeable whereas Americans of the same class are more interesting less polished better acquainted with the general laws that govern the development of nations Really mister Harrington said Joe you are making us out to be very insignificant And I think it would be very dull if we all had to understand ever so many general laws Besides I do not agree with you About what Miss Thorn About Americans They talk better than Englishmen as a rule But I am comparing Americans with the whole mass of Europeans John objected The English are a rather silent race I should say Cold you think suggested Joe No not cold Perhaps less cold than we are but less demonstrative I like that answered Joe I like people to feel more than they show Why asked John Why should not people be perfectly natural and show when they feel anything or be cold when they do not I think when you know some one feels a great deal and hides it that gives one the idea of reserved strength They had reached a distant part of the ice and were slowly skating round the limits of a little bay where the slanting moonbeams fell through tall old trees upon the glinting black surface They were quite alone only in the distance they could hear the long drawn clang and ring of the other skaters echoing all along the lake with a tremulous musical sound in the still bright night You must be very cold yourself mister Harrington Joe began again after a pause stopping and looking at him John laughed a little I he cried
2787_157400_000105_000000	train-clean-360	 No indeed 
none	none	I am the most enthusiastic man alive You are when you are speaking in public said Joe But that may be all comedy you know Orators always study their speeches with all the gestures and that before a glass don t they I do not know said John Of course I know by heart what I am going to say when I make a speech like that of the other evening but I often insert a great deal on the spur of the moment It is not comedy I grow very much excited when I am speaking Never at any other time asked Joe Seldom why should I I do not feel other things or situations so strongly In other words replied Joe it is just as I said you are generally very cold I suppose so John acquiesced since you will not allow the occasions when I am not cold to be counted Joe looked down as she stood and moved her skates slowly on the ice the shadows hid her face Do you know she said presently you lose a great deal you must you cannot help it You only like people in a body so as to see what you can do with them You only care for things on a tremendously big scale so that you may try to influence them When you have not a crowd to talk to or a huge scheme to argue about you are bored to extinction No said John I am not bored at present by any means Because you are talking about big things Most men in your place would be talking about the moonlight and quoting Shelley To oblige you Miss Thorn I could quote a little now and then said John laughing Would it please you I dare say you have seen elephants stand upon their hind legs and their heads alternately I should feel very much like one but I will do anything to oblige you That is frivolous said Joe who did not smile Of course it is I am heavy by nature You may teach me all sorts of tricks but they will not be at all pretty No you are very interesting as you are said Joe quietly But I do not think you will be happy It is not a question of happiness What is it then Usefulness said John You do not care to be happy you only care to be useful Joe asked Yes But my ideas of usefulness include many things Some of the people who listen to me would be very much astonished if they knew what I dream Nothing would astonish me said Joe thoughtfully Of course you must think of everything in a large way it is your nature You will be a great man John looked at his companion She had struck the main chord of his nature in her words and he felt suddenly that thrill of pleasure which comes from the flattery of our pride and our hopes John was not a vain man but he was capable of being intoxicated by the grandeur of a scheme when the possibility of its realization was suddenly thrust before him Like all men of exceptional gifts who are constantly before the public he could estimate very justly the extent of the results he could produce on any given occasion but his enthusiastic belief in his ideas could see no limit to the multiplication of those results His strong will and natural modesty about himself constantly repressed any desire he might have to speak over confidently of ultimate success so that the prediction of ultimate success by some one else was doubly sweet to him We Americans have said of ourselves that we are the only nation who accomplish what we have boasted of Rash speech and rash action are our national characteristics and lead us into all manner of trouble but in so far as such qualifications or defects imply a positive conviction of success they contribute largely to the realization of great schemes No one can succeed who does not believe in himself nor can any scheme be realized which has not gained the support of a sufficient number of men who believe in it and in themselves John was gratified by Miss Thorn s speech for he saw that it was spontaneous I will try to be great he said for the sake of what I think is great There was a short pause and the pair by common consent skated slowly out of the shadow into the broad moonlight Not that I believe you will be happy if you think of nothing else said Joe presently In order to do anything well one must think of nothing else answered John Many great men find time to be great and to do many other things said Joe Look at mister Gladstone he has an immense private correspondence about things that interest him quite apart from the big things he is always doing When a man has reached that point he may find plenty of time to spare answered Harrington But until he has accomplished the main object of his life he must not let anything take him from his pursuit He must form no ties he must have no interests that do not conduce to his success I think a man who enters on a political career must devote himself to it as exclusively as a missionary Jesuit attacks the conversion of unbelievers as wholly as a Buddhist ascetic gives himself to the work of uniting his individual intelligence with the immortal spirit that gives it life I do not agree with you said Joe decisively and in her womanly intelligence of life she understood the mistake John made I cannot agree with you You are mixing up political activity which deals with the government of men with spiritual ideas and immortality and that sort of thing How so asked John in some surprise I am quite sure said Joe that to govern man a man must be human and the imaginary politician you tell me of is not human at all And yet I aspire to be that imaginary politician said John Do not think me too dreadfully conceited Joe answered in talking about such things Of course I do not pretend to understand them but I am quite sure people must be like other people I mean in good ways or other people will not believe in them you know You are not vexed are you She looked up into John s face with a little timid smile that might have done wonders to persuade a less prejudiced person than Harrington No indeed why should I be vexed But perhaps some day you will believe that I am right Oh no never exclaimed Joe in a tone of profound conviction You will never persuade me that people are meant to shut themselves from their fellow creatures and not be human and that And yet you were so good as to say that you thought I might attain greatness said John smiling Yes I think you will But you will change your mind about a great many things before you do John s strong face grew thoughtful and the white moonlight made his features seem harder and sterner than ever Slowly the pair glided over the polished black ice now marked here and there with clean white curves from the skates and in a few minutes they were once more within hail of the remainder of their party CHAPTER VIII Eight days after the skating party Ronald Surbiton telegraphed from New York that he would reach Boston the next morning and Josephine Thorn knew that the hour had come She was not afraid of the scene that must take place but she wished with all her heart that it were over As Sybil Brandon had told her there had been time to think of what she should say and although she had answered recklessly that she would trust to luck she knew when the day was come that she had in reality thought intensely of the very words which must be spoken To Miss Schenectady she had said nothing but on the other hand she had become very intimate with Sybil and to tell the truth she hoped inwardly for the support and sympathy of her beautiful friend Meanwhile since her long evening with John Harrington on the ice she had made every effort to avoid his society Like many very young women with a vivid love of enjoyment and a fairly wide experience she was something of a fatalist That is to say she believed that her evil destiny might spring upon her unawares at any moment and she felt something when she was with Harrington that warned her For the first time in her life she knew what it was to have moods of melancholy she caught herself asking what was really the end and object of her gay life whether it amounted to anything worthy in comparison with the trouble one had to take to amuse one s self whether it would not be far better in the end to live like Miss Schenectady reading and studying and caring nothing for the world Not that Josephine admired Miss Schenectady or thought that she herself could ever be like her The old lady was a type of her class intelligent and well versed in many subjects even learned she might have been called by some But to Joe s view essentially European by nature and education it seemed as though her aunt like many Bostonians judged everything literature music art of all kinds history and the doings of great men by one invariable standard Her comments on what she heard and read were uniformly delivered from the same point of view in the same tone of practical judgment and with the same assumption of original superiority It was the everlasting Carthago delenda of the Roman orator Whatever the world wrote sang painted thought or did the conviction remained unshaken in Miss Schenectady s mind that Beacon Street was better than those things and that of all speeches and languages known and spoken in the world s history the familiar dialect of Boston was the one best calculated by Providence and nature to express and formulate all manner of wisdom It is a strange thing that where criticism is on the whole so fair and cultivation of the best faculties so general the manner of expressing a judgment and of exhibiting acquired knowledge should be such as to jar unpleasantly on the sensibilities of Europeans Where is the real difference It probably lies in some subtle point of proportion in the psychic chemistry of the Boston mind but the analyst who shall express the formula is not yet born though there be those who can cast the spectrum of Boston existence and thought upon their printed screens with matchless accuracy Joe judged but did not analyze She said Miss Schenectady was always right but that the way she was right was horrid Consequently she did not look to her aunt for sympathy or assistance and though they had more than once talked of Ronald Surbiton since receiving his cable from England Joe had not said anything of her intentions regarding him When the second telegram arrived from New York saying that he would be in Boston on the following morning Joe begged that Miss Schenectady would be at home to receive him when he came Well if you insist upon it I expect I shall have to said Miss Schenectady She did not see why her niece should require her presence at the interview young men may call on young ladies in Boston without encountering the inevitable chaperon or being obliged to do their talking in the hearing of a police of papas mammas and aunts But as Joe insisted upon it as the old lady said she expected there were no two ways about it Her expectations were correct for Joe would have refused absolutely to receive Ronald alone I know the value of a stern aunt my dear she had said to Sybil the day previous When matters were arranged therefore they went to bed and in the morning Miss Schenectady sat in state in the front drawing room reading the life of mister Ticknor until Ronald should arrive Joe was up stairs writing a note to Sybil Brandon wherein the latter was asked to lunch and to drive in the afternoon Ronald could not come before ten o clock with any kind of propriety and they could have luncheon early and then go out after which the bitterness of death would be past It was not quite ten o clock when Ronald Surbiton rang the bell and was turned into the drawing room to face an American aunt for the first time in his life Miss Schenectady said he taking the proffered hand of the old lady and then bowing slightly He pronounced her name Schenectady with a strong accent on the penultimate syllable Sche nec tady corrected his hostess I expect you are mister Surbiton A exactly so said Ronald in some embarrassment Well we are glad to see you in Boston mister Surbiton Miss Schenectady resumed her seat and Ronald sat down beside her holding his hat in his hand Put your hat down said the old lady What sort of a journey did you have Very fair thanks said Ronald depositing his hat on the floor beside him in fact I believe we came over uncommonly quick for the time of year How is What steamer did you come by interrupted Miss Schenectady The Gallia She is one of the Cunarders But as I was going to ask Yes an old boat I expect So you came on right away from New York without stopping Exactly answered Ronald I took the first train The fact is I was so anxious so very anxious to What hotel are you at here inquired Miss Schenectady without letting him finish Brunswick How is Miss Thorn Ronald succeeded at last in putting the question he so greatly longed to ask the only one he supposed which would cause a message to be sent to Joe announcing his arrival Joe She is pretty well I expect she will be down in a minute Are you going to stay some while mister Surbiton Ronald thought Miss Schenectady the most pitiless old woman he had ever met In reality she had not the most remote intention of being anything but hospitable But her idea of hospitality at a first meeting seemed to consist chiefly in exhibiting a great and inquisitive interest in the individual she wished to welcome Besides Joe would probably come down when she was ready and so it was necessary to talk in the mean time At last Ronald succeeded in asking another question Excuse the anxiety I show he said simply but may I ask whether Miss Thorn is at home Perhaps if you rang the bell I could send for her remarked the old lady in problematic answer Oh certainly exclaimed Ronald springing to his feet and searching madly round the room for the bell Miss Schenectady watched him calmly I think if you went to the further side of the fire place you would find it back of the screen she suggested Thanks here it is cried Ronald discovering the handle in the wall Yes you have found it now said Miss Schenectady with much indifference Perhaps you find it cold here she continued observing that Ronald lingered near the fire place Oh dear no thanks quite the contrary he answered Because if it is you might Sarah I think you could tell Miss Josephine that mister Surbiton is in the parlor could not you Oh if it is any inconvenience Ronald began misunderstanding the form of address Miss Schenectady used to her handmaiden Why asked Miss Schenectady in some astonishment Nothing said Ronald looking rather confused I did not quite catch what you said There was a silence and the old lady and the young man looked at each other Ronald was a very handsome man as Joe knew He was tall and straight and deep chested His complexion was like a child s and his fine moustache like silk His thick fair hair was parted accurately in the middle and his smooth white forehead betrayed no sign of care or thought His eyes were blue and very bright and looked fearlessly at every one and everything and his hands were broad and clean looking He was perfectly well dressed but in a fashion far less extreme than that affected by mister Topeka and young John C Hannibal There was less collar and more shoulder to him and his legs were longer and straighter than theirs Nevertheless had he stood beside John Harrington no one would have hesitated an instant in deciding which was the stronger man With all his beauty and grace Ronald Surbiton was but one of a class of handsome and graceful men John Harrington bore on his square brow and in the singular compactness of his active frame the peculiar sign manual of an especial purpose He would have been an exception in any class and in any age It was no wonder Joe had wished to compare the two In a few moments the door opened and Joe entered the drawing room She was pale and her great brown eyes had a serious expression in them that was unusual There was something prim in the close dark dress she wore and the military collar of most modern cut met severely about her throat If Ronald had expected a very affectionate welcome he was destined to disappointment Joe had determined not to be affectionate until all was over To prepare him in some measure for what was in store she had planned that he should be left alone for a time with Miss Schenectady who she thought would chill any suitor to the bone My dear Ronald said Joe holding out her hand I am so glad to see you Her voice was even and gentle but there was no gladness in it Not half so glad as I am to see you said Ronald holding her hand in his his face beaming with delight It seems such an age since you left It is only two months though said Joe with a faint smile I ought to apologize but I suppose you have introduced yourself to Aunt Zoe She could not call her Aunt Zoruiah even for the sake of frightening Ronald What did you think when you got my telegram asked the latter I thought it was very foolish of you to run away just when the hunting was so good answered Joe with decision But you are glad are you not he asked lowering his voice and looking affectionately at her Miss Schenectady was again absorbed in the life of mister Ticknor Yes said Joe gravely It is as well that you have come because I have something to say to you and I should have had to write it Let us go out Would you like to go for a walk Ronald was delighted to do anything that would give him a chance of escaping from Aunt Zoruiah and being alone with Joe I think you had best be back to lunch remarked Miss Schenectady as they left the room Of course Aunt Zoe answered Joe Besides Sybil is coming you know So they sallied forth It was a warm day the snow had melted from the brick pavement and the great icicles on the gutters and on the trees were running water in the mid day sun Joe thought a scene would be better to get over in the publicity of the street than in private Ronald all unsuspecting of her intention walked calmly by her side looking at her occasionally with a certain pride mixed with a good deal of sentimental benevolence Do you know Joe began presently when your cable came I felt very guilty at having written to you that you might come Why asked Ronald innocently You know I would come from the end of the world to see you I have in fact
2787_157400_000082_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I know 
none	none	said Joe wearily wishing she knew exactly how to say what she was so thoroughly determined should be said What is the matter Joe asked Ronald suddenly He smiled rather nervously but his smooth brow was a little contracted He anticipated mischief There is something the matter Ronald she said at last resolved to make short work of the revelation of her feelings There is something very much the matter Well said Surbiton beginning to be alarmed You know Ronald dear somehow I think you have thought honestly I know you have thought for a long time that you were to marry me Yes said Ronald with a forced laugh for he was frightened I have always thought so I think so now It is of no use to think it Ronald dear said Joe turning very pale I have thought of it too thought it all over I cannot possibly marry you dear boy Honestly I cannot Her voice trembled violently However firmly she had decided within herself it was a very bitter thing to say she was so fond of him What asked Ronald hoarsely But he turned red instead of pale It was rather disappointment and anger that he felt at the first shock than sorrow or deep pain Do not make me say it again said Joe entreatingly She was not used to entreating so much as to commanding and her voice quavered uncertainly Do you mean to say said Ronald speaking loudly in his anger and then dropping his voice as he remembered the passers by do you mean to tell me Joe after all this when I have come to America just because you told me to that you will not marry me I do not believe it You are making fun of me No Ronald Joe answered sorrowfully but regaining her equanimity in the face of Surbiton s wrath I am in earnest I am very very fond of you but I do not love you at all and I never can marry you Ronald was red in the face and he trod fast and angrily tapping the pavement with his stick He was very angry but he said nothing It is much better to be honest about it said Joe still very pale and when she had spoken her little mouth closed tightly Oh yes said Ronald who was serious by this time it is much better to be honest now that you have brought me three thousand miles to hear what you have to say much better By all means I am very sorry Ronald Joe answered I really did not mean you to come and I am very sorry oh more sorry than I can tell you but I cannot do it you know If you won t of course you can t he said Will you please tell me who he is Who what asked Joe coldly She was offended at the tone The fellow you have pitched upon in my place he said roughly Joe looked up into his face with an expression that frightened him Her dark eyes flashed with an honest fire He stared angrily at her as they walked slowly along I made a mistake she said slowly I am not sorry I am glad I would be ashamed to marry a man who could speak like that to any woman I am sorry for you but I am glad for myself She looked straight into his eyes until he turned away For some minutes they went on in silence I beg your pardon Joe said Ronald presently in a subdued tone Never mind Ronald dear I was angry Joe answered But her eyes were full of tears and her lips quivered Again they went on in silence but for a longer time than before Joe felt that the blow was struck and there was nothing to be done but to wait the result It had been much harder than she had expected because Ronald was so angry she had expected he would be pained He poor fellow was really startled out of all self control The idea that Joe could ever ultimately hesitate about marrying him had never seemed to exist even among the remotest possibilities But he was a gentleman in his way and so he begged her pardon and chewed the cud of his wrath in silence for some time Joe he said at last with something of his usual calm though he was still red of course you are really perfectly serious I mean you have thought about it Yes said Joe I am quite sure Then perhaps it is better we should go home he continued Perhaps so said Joe Indeed it would be better I would like to see you again Joe he said in a somewhat broken fashion I mean by and by when I am not angry you know Joe smiled at the simple honesty of the proposition Yes Ronald dear whenever you like You are very good Ronald she added No I am not good at all said Ronald sharply and they did not speak again until he left her at Miss Schenectady s door Then she gave him her hand I shall be at home until three o clock said she Thanks he answered so they parted Joe had accomplished her object but she was very far from happy The consciousness of having done right did not outweigh the pain she felt for Ronald who was after all her very dear friend They had grown up together from earliest childhood and so it had been settled for Ronald was left an orphan when almost a baby and had been brought up with his cousin as a matter of expediency Therefore as Joe said it had always seemed so very natural They had plighted vows when still in pinafores with a ring of grass and later they had spoken more serious things which it hurt Joe to remember and now they were suffering the consequence of it all and the putting off childish illusions was bitter It was not long before Sybil Brandon came in answer to Joe s invitation She knew what trouble her friend was likely to be in and was ready to do anything in the world to make matters easier for her Besides though Sybil was so white and fair and seemingly cold she had a warm heart and had conceived a very real affection for the impulsive English girl Miss Schenectady had retired to put on another green ribbon leaving the life of mister Ticknor open on the table and the two girls met in the drawing room Joe was still pale and the tears seemed ready to start from her eyes Dear Sybil it is so good of you to come said she Sybil kissed her affectionately and put her arm round her waist They stood thus for a moment before the fire You have seen him Sybil asked presently Joe had let her head rest wearily against her friend s shoulder and nodded silently in answer Sybil bent down and kissed her soft hair and whispered gently in her ear Was it very hard dear Oh yes indeed it was cried Joe hiding her face on Sybil s breast Then as though ashamed of seeming weak she stood up boldly turning slightly away as she spoke It was dreadfully hard she continued but it is all over and it is very much better very very much you know I am so glad said Sybil looking thoughtfully at the fire And now we will go out into the country and forget all about it all about the disagreeable part of it Perhaps said Joe who had recovered her equanimity Ronald may come too You see he is so used to me that after a while it will not seem to make so very much difference after all Of course if he would said Sybil it would be very nice He will have to get used to the idea and if he does not begin at once perhaps he never may He will be just the same as ever when he gets over his wrath answered Joe confidently Was he very angry Oh dreadfully I never saw him so angry It is better when men are angry than when they are sorry said Sybil Something like this once happened to me and he got over it very well I think it was much more my fault too she added thoughtfully Oh I am sure you never did anything bad in your life said Joe affectionately Nothing half so bad as this my dear Snow Angel And so they kissed again and went to lunch I suppose you went to walk remarked Miss Schenectady when they met at table Yes said Joe we walked a little Well all Englishmen walk of course continued her aunt Most of them can said Joe smiling I mean it is a great deal the right thing there Perhaps you might pass me the pepper Before they had finished their meal the door opened and Ronald Surbiton entered the room Oh excuse me he began I did not know Oh I am so glad you have come Ronald cried Joe rising to greet him and taking his hand Sybil let me introduce mister Surbiton Miss Brandon Sybil smiled and bent her head slightly Ronald bowed and sat down between Sybil and Miss Schenectady CHAPTER IX Josephine Thorn never read newspapers partly because she did not care for the style of literature known as journalistic and partly too because the papers always came at such exceedingly inconvenient hours If she had possessed and practiced the estimable habit of keeping up with the times she would have observed an article which appeared on the morning after the skating party and which dealt with the speech John Harrington had made in the Music Hall two days previous Miss Schenectady had read it but she did not mention it to Joe because she believed in John Harrington and wished Joe to do likewise wherefore she avoided the subject for the article treated him roughly Nevertheless some unknown person sent Joe a copy of the paper through the post some days later with a bright red pencil mark at the place and Joe seeing what the subject was read it with avidity As she read her cheek flushed her small mouth closed like a vise and she stamped her little foot upon the floor It was evident that the writer was greatly incensed at the views expressed by John and he wrote with an ease and a virulence which proclaimed a practiced hand The spectacle of an accomplished Democrat said the paper is always sufficiently unusual to attract attention but to find so rare a bird among ourselves is indeed a novel delight The orator who alternately enthralled and insulted a considerable audience at the Music Hall two nights ago laid a decided claim both to accomplishment and to democracy He himself informed his hearers that he was a Democrat and indeed it was necessary that he should state his position for it would have been impossible to decide from the tone and quality of his opinions whether he were a socialist a reformer a conservative or an Irishman Perchance he has discovered the talisman by which it is possible for a man to be all four and yet to be a man Furthermore he claims to be an orator No one could listen to the manifold intonations of his voice or witness the declamatory evolutions of his body without feeling an inward conviction that the gentleman on the platform intended to present himself to us as an orator Lest we be accused of partiality and prejudice we will at once state that we believe it possible for a man to be singular in his manner and quaint in his mode of phrasing and yet to utter an opinion in some one direction which if neither novel nor interesting nor even tenable shall yet have the one redeeming merit of representing a conceivable point of view But when a man begins by stating that he belongs to the Democrats and then claims as his own the views of his political opponents winding up by demanding the sympathy and support of a third party the obvious conclusion is that he is either a lunatic a charlatan or both A man cannot serve God and Mammon neither can any man serve both the Irish and Chinese mister John Harrington has made a great discovery He has discovered that we require a Civil Service This is apparently the ground on which he states himself to be a Democrat If we remember rightly the Civil Service Convention which sat in discussion of the subject in the summer of eighteen eighty one was presided over by a prominent member of the Republican party As some time has elapsed since then and the gentlemen connected with the movement are as active and as much interested in it as ever our orator will pardon us for questioning his right of discovery on the one hand and his claim to be considered a Democrat on the strength of it on the other A Civil Service is doubtless a good thing even a very good thing and in due time we shall certainly have it but that the Constitution of the United States is on the verge of dissolution at the hands of our corrupt public officers that our finance is only another name for imminent bankruptcy or that the new millennium of Washington morals will be organized by mister John Harrington these things we deny in toto from beginning to end So wide and deep is our skepticism that we even doubt whether war famine revolution or all three together would have instantly ensued if mister John Harrington had not delivered his speech on Wednesday evening In illustration or rather in the futile attempt to illustrate mister Harrington put forth a series of similes that should make any dead orator turn in his grave The nation was successively held up to our admiration in the guise of a sick man a cripple a banker a theatrical company and a peddler of tape and buttons We were bankrupt diseased and our bones like those of the Psalmist were all out of joint and if our hearts did not become like melting wax in the midst of our bodies it was not the fault of mister John Harrington but rather was it due to the hardening of those organs against the voice of the charmer The Navigation Act called down the choicest of the orator s vessels of wrath Fools had made it worse than fools submitted to it and the reason why the Salem docks were no longer crowded with the shipping of the Peabody family was that there were ferry boats in Boston harbor a train of reasoning that must be clear to the mind of the merest schoolboy mister Harrington further stated that these same ferry boats not to mention certain articles he terms mudscows with which we have no acquaintance are built of old timber copper and nails obtained by breaking tip the fleets of the Peabody family which is manifestly a fraud on the nation As far as the ferry boats are concerned we believe we are in a position to state that they are not built of old material as regards the aforesaid mudscows we can give no opinion not having before heard of the article which we presume is not common in commerce and may therefore be regarded as an exception to the universal rule that things in general should not be made of old timber copper and rusty nails We will not weary our readers with any further attempt at unraveling the opinions illustrations and rhetoric of mister John Harrington Democrat and orator The possession of an abundant vocabulary without any especial use for it in the shape of an idea will not revolutionize modern government whatever may be the opinion of the individual so richly gifted nor will any accomplished Democrat find a true key to success in following a course of politics which consists in one half of the world trying to drive paradoxes down the throat of the other half It will not do and mister Harrington will find it out He will find out also that the differences which exist between the Republican and the Democratic parties are far deeper and wider than he suspects and do not consist in such things as the existence or non existence of a Civil Service free trade or mudscows and when these things are forever crushed out of his imagination it will be time enough to give him a name seeing he is neither Republican nor Democrat nor Tammany nor even a Stalwart nor a three hundred and sixer seeing in fact that he is not an astronomical point in any political heaven with which the world is acquainted but only the most nebulous of nebulae which have yet come within our observation Joe read the article rapidly and then read the last paragraph again and threw the paper aside She sat by the fire after breakfast and Miss Schenectady had come into the room several times and had gone out again busied with much housekeeping For Miss Schenectady belonged to the elder school of Boston women who see to things themselves in the intervals of literature gossip and transcendental philosophy But Joe sat still for nearly half an hour after she had done reading and nursed her wrath while she toasted her little feet at the fire At last she made up her mind and rose I am going to see Sybil Aunt Zoe she said meeting the old lady at the door Well if she is up at this time of day answered Miss Schenectady Oh I fancy so said Joe missus Sam Wyndham s establishment was of the modern kind and nobody was expected to attend an early breakfast of fish beefsteaks buckwheat cakes hot rolls tea coffee and chocolate at eight o clock in the morning Visitors did as they pleased and so did missus Sam and they met at luncheon a meal which Sam Wyndham himself was of course unable to attend Joe knew this and knew she was certain to find Sybil alone It was Sybil she wanted to see and not missus Wyndham But as she walked down Beacon Street the aspect of affairs changed in her mind Joe had not exaggerated when she said to Vancouver that she had a very good memory and it would have been better for him if he had remembered the fact Joe had not forgotten the conversation with him in the evening after Harrington s speech and in reading the article that had been sent to her she instantly recognized a phrase word for word as Vancouver had uttered it In speaking to her he had said that politics consisted in one half of the world trying to drive paradoxes down the throat of the other half It was true that in the article John Harrington was warned that he would discover the fallacy of this proposition but in Joe s judgment this did not constitute an objection Vancouver had written the article and none other Vancouver who professed a boundless respect for John and who constantly asserted that he took no active part whatever in politics It was inconceivable that the coincidence of language should be an accident Vancouver had made the phrase when making conversation and had used it in his article Joe was absolutely certain of that and being full of her discovery and of wrath she was determined to consult with her dearest friend as to the best way of revenging the offense on its author But as she walked down Beacon Street she reflected on the situation She was sure Sybil would not understand why she cared so much and Sybil would form hasty ideas as to the interest Joe took in Harrington That would never do It would be better to speak to missus Sam Wyndham who was herself so fond of John that she would seize with avidity on the information from whatever source it came But then missus Wyndham was fond of Vancouver also No she was not When Joe thought of it she was sure that though Vancouver was devoted to missus Sam missus Sam did not care for him excepting as an agreeable person of even temper who was useful in society But for Harrington she had a real friendship If it came to the doing of a service missus Wyndham would do it Joe s perceptions were wonderfully clear and just But when she reached the house she was still uncertain and she passed on intending to turn back and go in as soon as she had made up her mind In spite of all that she could argue to herself it seemed unsafe unwise at least Sybil might laugh at her after all missus Wyndham might possibly tell Vancouver instead of telling John It would be better to tell John herself she remembered having once spoken to him about Vancouver and she could easily remind him of the conversation She would probably see him that evening at a party she was going to and yet it was so hard to have to keep it all to herself for so many hours instead of telling Nevertheless she would go and see Sybil taking care of course to say nothing about the article At the time Joe was walking up and down Beacon Street in the effort to come to a decision John Harrington found himself face to face with a very much more formidable problem He stood before the fire place in his rooms in Charles Street with an extinguished cigar between his teeth his face paler than usual and a look of uncertainty on his features that was oddly out of keeping with his usual mood He wore an ancient shooting coat and his feet were trust into a pair of dingy leather slippers his hands were in his pockets and he was staring vacantly at the clock On the oak writing table that filled the middle of the room lay an open telegram It was dated from Washington and conveyed the simple information that Senator Caleb Jenkins had died at five o clock that morning It was signed by an abbreviation that meant nothing except to John himself The name of the senator was itself fictitious and stood for another which John knew The table was covered with Government reports for when the message came John was busy studying a financial point of importance to him The telegram had lain on the table for half an hour and John still stood before the fire place staring at the clock The senator had not been expected to live in fact it was remarkable that he should have lived so long But when a man has been preparing for a struggle during many months he is apt to feel that the actual moment of the battle is indefinitely far off But now the senator was dead and John meant to stand in his place The battle was begun No one who has not seen some of the inside workings of political life can have any idea of what a man feels who is about to stand as a candidate in an election for the first time in his life For months perhaps for years he has been engaged with political matters his opinions have been formed by himself or by others into a very definite shape it may be that like Harrington he has frequently spoken to large audiences with more or less success he may have written pamphlets and volumes upon questions of the day and his writings may have roused the fiercest criticism and the most loyal support All this he may have done and done it well but when the actual moment arrives for him to stand upon his feet and address his constituents no longer for the purpose of making them believe in his opinions but in order to make them believe in himself he is more than mortal if he does not feel something very unpleasantly resembling fear It is one thing to express a truth it is another to set one s self upon a pedestal and declare that one represents it and is in one s own person the living truth itself John was too honest and true a man not to feel a positive reluctance to singing his own praises and yet that is what most electioneering consists in But to be elected a senator in Massachusetts is a complicated affair A man who intends to succeed in such an enterprise must not let the grass grow under his feet In a few hours the whole machinery of election must be at work and before night he would have to receive all sorts and conditions of men and electioneering agents The morning papers did not contain any notice of the senator s death as they had already gone to press when the news reached them if indeed it was as yet public property But other papers appeared at mid day and by that time the circumstances would undoubtedly be known John struck a match and relit his cigar The moment of hesitation was over the last breathing space before the fight and all his activity returned Half an hour later he went out with a number of written telegrams in his hand and proceeded to the central telegraph office The case was urgent In the first place the governor of the state would according to law and custom immediately appoint a senator pro tempore to act until the legislature should elect the new senator in place of the one deceased Secondly the legislature which meets once a year was already in session and the election would therefore take place immediately unless some unusual delay were created and this was improbable In spite of the article which had so outraged Josephine Thorn s sense of justice there were many who believed in John Harrington as the prophet of the new faith as the senator of reform and the orator of the future and his friends were numerous and powerful both in the electing body and among the non official mass of prominent persons who make up the aggregate of public opinion It had long been known that John Harrington would be brought forward at the next vacancy which in the ordinary course of things would have occurred in about a year s time at the expiration of the senior senator s term of office but which had now been suddenly caused by the death of his colleague John was therefore aware that his success must depend almost immediately upon the present existing opinion of him that prevailed and as he made his way through the crowded streets to the telegraph office he realized that no effort of his own would be likely to make a change in that opinion at such short notice At first it had seemed to him as though he were on a sudden brought face to face with a body of men whom he must persuade to elect him as their representative and in spite of his great familiarity with political proceedings the idea was extremely disagreeable to him But on more mature reflection it was clear to him that he was in the hands of his friends that he had said his say and had done all he would now be able to do in the way of public speaking or public writing and that his only possible sphere of present action lay in exerting such personal influence as he possessed John Harrington was ambitious or to speak more accurately he was wholly ruled by a dominant aspiration He was convinced by his own study and observation as well as by a considerable amount of personal experience that great reforms were becoming necessary in the government of the country and he was equally sure that a man was needed who should be willing to make any sacrifice for the sake of creating a party to inaugurate such changes In his opinion the surest step towards obtaining influence in the affairs of the country was a seat in the senate and with an unhesitating belief in the truth and honesty of the principles he desired to make known he devoted every energy he possessed to the attainment of his object To him government seemed the most important function of society the largest the broadest and the noblest to help if possible to be a leader in the establishment of what was good for the country and to be the very foremost in destroying that which was bad were in his view the best objects and aims for a strong man to follow And John Harrington knew himself to be strong and believed himself to be right and thus armed he was prepared for any struggle The quality of vanity exists in all men not least in those whose chief profession is modesty and seeing that it is a universal element created and inherent in every one it is impossible to say it is bad in itself For it is impossible to conceive any human creature without it A recent philosopher of reputation has taught that by vanity by the desire to appear attractive to the other sex man has changed his own person from the form of a beast to the image of God Vanity is a mighty power and incentive as great as hunger and thirst and much more generally active in the affairs of civilized humanity And yet its very name means hollowness The hollowness of hollowness all things are hollowness said the preacher and his translators have put the word vanity in his mouth because it means the same thing But in itself being hollow it is neither bad nor good its badness or goodness lies in those things whereof a man makes choice to fill the void the inexpressible and indefinable craving within his soul as also hunger is only bad when it is satisfied by bad things or not satisfied at all so that in the one case it leads to disease and in the other to the committing of crimes in the desire for satisfaction Many a poor fellow was hung by the neck in old times for stealing a loaf to stop his hunger and many a man of wit goes to the mad house nowadays because the void of his vanity is unfilled But vanity is called by yet another name when its disagreeable side is hidden and when its emptiness has come to crave for great things It is pride then honorable pride then ambition and perhaps at the last it is called heroic sacrifice Vanity is an unsatisfied desire hollow in itself but capable of holding both bad and good It is not identical with self complacency nor yet with conceit Probably John Harrington had originally possessed as much of this mysterious quality as most men who are conscious of strength and talent It had never manifested itself in small things and its very extent had made many things seem small which were of the highest importance to other men He had worked as a boy at all manner of studies like other boys but the idea of laboring in distasteful matters for the sake of being first among his companions seemed utterly absurd to him From the time he had begun to think for himself and he was young when he reached that stage he had formed a rooted determination to be first in his country to be a great reformer or a great patriot and he cared to study nothing that was not connected with this idea When his name was first heard in public life it was as the author of a pamphlet advocating certain sweeping measures of which no one else had ventured to dream as yet He would have smiled now had he taken the trouble to read again some of those earlier productions of his It had seemed so easy to move the world then and it seemed so hard now But nevertheless he meant to move it and as each year brought him increased strength and wider experience it brought with it also the conviction of ultimate success He had long forgotten to hope for the sudden and immediate power to stir the world for he had discovered that it was a labor of years the work of a lifetime but if he had ever had any doubts as to the result of that work he had forgotten them also And now his strength his aspirations his vanity and his intellect were roused together to the highest activity of which they were capable the hour having come for which he had longed through half his lifetime and though it was but the first trial in which he might fail it had for him all the importance of the supreme crisis of his existence No wonder that his face was pale and his lips set as he walked back to his lodgings from the telegraph office As he walked down the hill by the railings of the Common he came upon Josephine Thorn standing at the entrance of one of the boarded walks as though hesitating whether to go in He was close to her as he bowed and something in her face made him stop Good morning Miss Thorn he said She nodded gravely and hesitated He was about to go on thinking she was in one of those moods which he called capricious But she stopped him mister Harrington I want to speak to you she said quickly seeing that her opportunity was on the point of slipping away Yes said John smiling faintly mister Harrington did you read that article about you the day after the skating party Yes said John It was not complimentary if I remember It was vile said Joe the angry color rising to her temples again It was abominable It was written by mister Vancouver John started slightly I think you must be mistaken he said No I am not mistaken There were things in it word for word as he said them to me just after the speech I am perfectly sure John looked very gravely at Joe as though to be sure of her honesty There was no mistaking the look in her eyes Miss Thorn John said Vancouver may have said those very things to some one else who wrote them and printed them But in any case I am exceedingly obliged to you for the information You are not angry Joe began already repenting No how could I be It may be important The junior senator for Massachusetts died this morning and there may be an election at any moment I have not told any one else but it will be known everywhere in an hour s time Good by and many thanks You will be senator of course said Joe in great excitement I cannot tell John answered Are you going down the hill No thanks I am going home said Joe Good by 
2787_157400_000002_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER X 
none	none	Joe had been mistaken in thinking that Ronald would be less well received than herself 
2787_157400_000003_000001	train-clean-360	There was of course the usual amount of gossip concerning him but as he refrained from eccentricities of dress when asked to dinner and did not bet that he would ride his horse into the smoking room of the Somerset Club the gossip soon lost ground against the list of his good qualities 
none	none	Moreover he was extremely good looking and his manner was modesty itself He admired everything he saw partly because it was new to him and partly because there was a good deal to admire For a day or two after the final scene with Joe he had avoided seeing her He had not been able to resist the temptation to go back on the same day and he had spent some hours in considering that human affairs are extremely mutable 
2787_157400_000004_000001	train-clean-360	But the scenes about him were too new and very many of the faces he saw were too attractive to allow of his brooding for long over his misfortune 
none	none	His first impulse had been to go away again on the very evening of his arrival 
2787_157400_000004_000003	train-clean-360	He had gone to see Joe arriving during luncheon in the expectation of seeing her alone again 
2787_157400_000004_000004	train-clean-360	There would be a scene of solemn farewell in which he would bid her be happy in her own way in a tone of semi paternal benevolence after which he would give her his blessing and bid farewell to the pomps and vanities of society 
2787_157400_000004_000005	train-clean-360	He would naturally retire gloomily from the gay world and end his miserable existence in the approved Guy Livingstone fashion of life between cavendish tobacco deep drinking and high play 
2787_157400_000004_000006	train-clean-360	Joe would then repent of the ruin she had caused and that would be a great satisfaction 
none	none	There was once a little boy in Boston whose hands were very cold as he went to school But he blew on them savagely saying I am glad of it 
2787_157400_000004_000009	train-clean-360	It serves my father right for not buying me my gloves That was Ronald s state of mind 
none	none	He had led the most sober of lives and the wildest dissipation he remembered was the Lord Mayor s supper to the Oxford and Cambridge crews when he himself had been one of the winners 
2787_157400_000004_000011	train-clean-360	But surely for a disappointed lover there could be no course so proper as a speedy death by dissipation which would serve Joe right 
2787_157400_000004_000012	train-clean-360	Therefore on his return to his hotel he ordered whiskey in a sepulchral tone of voice 
2787_157400_000004_000013	train-clean-360	He tasted it and thought it detestable 
2787_157400_000005_000000	train-clean-360	On reflection he would put off the commencement of his wild career until the evening after he had seen Joe again 
none	none	The ravages of drink would not be perceptible so soon after all 
2787_157400_000005_000002	train-clean-360	He changed his tie for one of a darker hue ate sparingly of a beefsteak and went back to bid Joe a last farewell 
2787_157400_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Sybil Brandon and Miss Schenectady were elements in the solemn leave taking which Ronald had not anticipated 
2787_157400_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Sybil moreover made a great effort for she was anxious to help Joe as much as possible in her difficulties 
2787_157400_000006_000002	train-clean-360	She talked to Ronald with a vivacity that was unusual and Joe herself was astonished at the brilliance of her conversation 
2787_157400_000006_000003	train-clean-360	She had always thought Sybil very reserved if not somewhat shy 
2787_157400_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Perhaps Sybil pitied Ronald a little 
none	none	He was very quiet in his manner though after the first few minutes he found himself talking much as usual True he often looked at Joe and then was silent but then again he looked at Sybil and his tongue was unloosed 
2787_157400_000007_000002	train-clean-360	He was grateful after a time and he was also flattered 
2787_157400_000007_000003	train-clean-360	Besides he could not help noticing that his new acquaintance was extremely beautiful 
2787_157400_000007_000004	train-clean-360	His conscience smote him as he realized that he was thinking of her appearance and he immediately quieted the qualm by saying that it was but natural admiration for an artistic object 
2787_157400_000007_000005	train-clean-360	Ronald did not know much about artists and that sort of people but the expression formed itself conveniently in his mind 
2787_157400_000008_000000	train-clean-360	The consequence was that he accepted an invitation to drive with the two girls after luncheon and when they left him at his hotel a proceeding against which he vehemently protested on the score of propriety he reluctantly acknowledged to himself that he had enjoyed the afternoon very much 
2787_157400_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Come and see us after five o clock said Sybil 
none	none	I will present you to missus Wyndham 
2787_157400_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Nine hundred and thirty six Beacon Street she added laughing 
2787_157400_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 With great pleasure thanks said Ronald 
2787_157400_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Good by Ronald dear said Joe pleasantly 
2787_157400_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 Good by he answered in a doubtful tone of voice as he raised his hat and the two girls drove away 
none	none	Sybil was apparently in very good spirits
2787_157400_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 Do not be frightened Joe dearest she said 
none	none	We will manage it very well He is not hurt in the least
2787_157400_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 Really I do not believe he is so very much you know Joe answered But she was thoughtful and did not speak again for some time 
2787_157400_000016_000000	train-clean-360	It was on the morning after this that Joe read the article on John s speech and met him by the Common 
none	none	Ronald did not call during the day and in the evening Joe went to her party as she had intended but neither Sybil nor John Harrington were there 
2787_157400_000016_000002	train-clean-360	Sybil did not go to parties and John probably had too much to do 
2787_157400_000016_000003	train-clean-360	But at supper Joe chanced to be standing near missus Sam Wyndham 
2787_157400_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I so much wanted to see you Miss Thorn said the latter 
none	none	I wanted to tell you how much we like your cousin mister Surbiton 
2787_157400_000017_000002	train-clean-360	He came today and I have asked him to dinner to morrow 
2787_157400_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes said Joe turning a shade paler 
none	none	I am so glad you like him 
2787_157400_000018_000002	train-clean-360	He is a very nice boy 
2787_157400_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 He is perfectly lovely said missus Sam enthusiastically 
none	none	And he is so natural you would not know he was English at all Really said Joe raising her eyebrows a little but laughing at the same time
2787_157400_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh my dear said missus Wyndham I always forget you are not one of us Besides you are you see 
2787_157400_000022_000000	train-clean-360	missus Wyndham rarely said a tactless thing but this evening she was in such good spirits that she said what came uppermost in her thoughts 
2787_157400_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Joe was not offended she was only bored 
2787_157400_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Will you not come and dine too to morrow night asked missus Wyndham who was anxious to atone 
none	none	Thanks awfully said Joe but I have to dine with the Aitchisons 
2787_157400_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Pocock Vancouver pale and exquisite as ever came up to the two ladies 
2787_157400_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Can I get you anything missus Wyndham he inquired after a double bow 
2787_157400_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 No thank you 
2787_157400_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Johnny Hannibal is taking care of me answered missus Sam coldly 
2787_157400_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 Miss Thorn what can I get you he asked turning to Joe 
2787_157400_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Nothing thanks said Joe mister 
2787_157400_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Biggielow is getting me something She did not look at Vancouver as she answered and the angry color began to rise to her temples 
2787_157400_000029_000002	train-clean-360	Vancouver who was not used to repulses such as these and was too old a soldier to give up a situation so easily stood a moment playing with his coat tails 
2787_157400_000029_000003	train-clean-360	A sudden thought passed through Joe s mind 
2787_157400_000029_000004	train-clean-360	It struck her that considering the situation of affairs it would be unwise to break off her acquaintance with Vancouver at the present time 
none	none	Her first honest impulse was to cut him and never speak to him again But it was better to act with more deliberation 
2787_157400_000029_000007	train-clean-360	In the first place there might be more to be learnt which might be of service to John secondly people would talk about it if she cut him and would invent some story to the effect that he had proposed to marry her or that she had proposed to marry him 
2787_157400_000029_000008	train-clean-360	It was contrary to her nature to pretend anything she did not feel but it would nevertheless be a mistake to quarrel openly with Vancouver 
2787_157400_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 On second thoughts if you would get me a glass of water she said speaking to him 
2787_157400_000030_000001	train-clean-360	He instantly disappeared but even in the moment before he departed to execute her command he had time to express by his look a sense of injury forgiven which did not escape Joe 
2787_157400_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 What a hypocrite the man is she thought 
2787_157400_000032_000000	train-clean-360	Vancouver on his part could form no conception of the cause of the coldness the two ladies had shown him 
2787_157400_000032_000001	train-clean-360	He could not know that Joe had discovered in him the writer of the article still less could he have guessed that Joe had told John and that John had told missus Sam 
2787_157400_000032_000002	train-clean-360	He could only suppose that the two had been talking of something and were annoyed at being interrupted 
none	none	When he came back with the glass of water mister Biggielow had just brought Joe some salad The usual struggle began between the two men 
2787_157400_000033_000002	train-clean-360	mister Bonamy Biggielow was a little poet 
2787_157400_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 I ought to thank you Miss Thorn instead of you thanking me said Vancouver in a seductive voice on one side of Joe 
none	none	Is it not the most crowded supper you ever saw remarked mister Biggielow on the other side
2787_157400_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Why said Joe eating her salad and looking straight before her 
none	none	I thought you were going to send me away I was so glad when you condescended to make use of me answered Vancouver 
2787_157400_000038_000000	train-clean-360	mister Biggielow also answered Joe s interrogation 
2787_157400_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 Well he said I mean it is thronged with people 
none	none	There is a decided sound of revelry by night
2787_157400_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 Youth and beauty 
2787_157400_000040_000001	train-clean-360	That sort of thing said Joe to Biggielow 
2787_157400_000040_000002	train-clean-360	Then turning to Vancouver she added Why should I send you away 
2787_157400_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 I hope there is no reason he said gravely 
2787_157400_000041_000001	train-clean-360	 In fact I am sure there is none except that you would of course always do exactly as you pleased about that and everything else 
2787_157400_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes indeed Joe answered and her lip curled a little proudly you are quite right about that 
2787_157400_000042_000001	train-clean-360	But then you know I did not send you away 
2787_157400_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 Thanks again said Vancouver 
2787_157400_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Do let me get you something more Miss Thorn suggested mister Biggielow No 
none	none	There is any amount of pates 
2787_157400_000044_000002	train-clean-360	You always like 
2787_157400_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course you have heard about Harrington said Vancouver in a low voice close to Josephine s ear 
none	none	No really she answered
2787_157400_000046_000001	train-clean-360	 Will you take my plate 
none	none	And the glass thanks mister Bonamy Biggielow was obliged to retire
2787_157400_000046_000003	train-clean-360	 You mean about the senatorship asked Joe 
none	none	Yes The senator died this morning Harrington will make a fight for it He has many friends
2787_157400_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Among whom you count yourself doubtless remarked Joe 
2787_157400_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Not politically of course 
none	none	I take no active part
2787_157400_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I know Joe knew the remainder of the sentence by heart 
none	none	Then you will have a glorious opportunity for maintaining an armed neutrality
2787_157400_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh if it comes to that said Vancouver mildly I would rather see Harrington senator than some of our own men 
2787_157400_000051_000001	train-clean-360	At all events he is honest 
2787_157400_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 At all events Joe repeated 
2787_157400_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 You think perhaps that some man of your own party may be elected who will not turn out to be honest 
2787_157400_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Well the thing is possible 
2787_157400_000053_000001	train-clean-360	You see politics are such a dirty business all kinds of men get in 
none	none	Joe laughed in a way that made Vancouver nervous He was beginning to know her and he could tell when some sharp thrust was coming by the way she laughed 
2787_157400_000054_000002	train-clean-360	Nevertheless he was fascinated by her 
2787_157400_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 It is not long since you told me that mister Harrington s very mild remark about extinguishing bribery and corruption was a piece of gross exaggeration said Joe 
2787_157400_000055_000001	train-clean-360	 Why do you say politics are dirty work 
2787_157400_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 There is a great difference answered Vancouver 
2787_157400_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 What difference 
2787_157400_000057_000001	train-clean-360	Between what 
2787_157400_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Between saying that the business of politics is not clean and saying that all public officers are liars like the Cretans 
2787_157400_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Who is exaggerating now asked Joe scornfully 
2787_157400_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course it is I answered Vancouver submissively 
2787_157400_000060_000001	train-clean-360	 If it is not a rude question did not that dress come from Egypt 
none	none	Yes The garment in question was made of a kind of soft white fluted material over a rose colored silk ground The raised flutings followed the exquisite lines of Joe s figure and had the double merit of accentuating its symmetry and of so leading the eye as to make her height seem greater than it really was 
2787_157400_000061_000002	train-clean-360	Cut square at the neck it showed her dazzling throat at its best advantage and a knot of pink lilies at the waist harmonized delicately with the color of the whole 
2787_157400_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 It is just like you said Vancouver to have something different from everybody else 
none	none	I admire Eastern things so much and one gets so tired of the everlasting round of French dresses
2787_157400_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 I am glad you like it said Joe indifferently 
2787_157400_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 I am so anxious to meet your cousin Miss Thorn said Vancouver trying a new subject 
2787_157400_000064_000001	train-clean-360	 I hear there is to be a dinner for him to morrow night at missus Sam Wyndham s 
2787_157400_000064_000002	train-clean-360	But of course I am not asked 
2787_157400_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 Why of course inquired Joe quickly 
2787_157400_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 I believe missus Wyndham thinks I dislike Englishmen said Vancouver at random 
none	none	But she is really very much mistaken Really
2787_157400_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes I should be willing to like any number of Englishmen for the sake of being liked by one Englishwoman He looked at Joe expressively as he spoke 
none	none	Really Indeed yes Do you not believe me
2787_157400_000071_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh yes said Joe 
2787_157400_000071_000001	train-clean-360	 Why should I not believe you Her voice was calm but that same angry flush that had of late so often shown itself began to rise slowly at her temples 
2787_157400_000071_000002	train-clean-360	Vancouver saw it and thought she was blushing at what he said 
2787_157400_000072_000000	train-clean-360	 I trust you will said Vancouver 
2787_157400_000072_000001	train-clean-360	 I trust that some day you will let me tell you who that Englishwoman is 
2787_157400_000073_000000	train-clean-360	It was horrible he was making love to her this wretch whom she despised 
none	none	She turned her head away to hide the angry look in her eyes
2787_157400_000074_000000	train-clean-360	 Thanks no if you do not mind said she 
2787_157400_000074_000001	train-clean-360	 I do not care to receive confidences I always forget to forget them It was not in order that Pocock Vancouver might make love to her that she had sent away Bonamy Biggielow the harmless little poet 
2787_157400_000074_000002	train-clean-360	She wished him back again but he was embarked in an enterprise to dispute with Johnny Hannibal a place near Miss saint Joseph 
2787_157400_000074_000003	train-clean-360	missus Wyndham had long since disappeared 
2787_157400_000075_000000	train-clean-360	 Will you please take me back to my aunt said Joe 
2787_157400_000075_000001	train-clean-360	As they passed from the supper room they suddenly came upon John Harrington who was wandering about in an unattached fashion apparently looking for some one 
2787_157400_000075_000002	train-clean-360	He bowed and stared a little at seeing Joe on Vancouver s arm but she gave him a look of such earnest entreaty that he turned and followed her at a distance to see what would happen 
2787_157400_000075_000003	train-clean-360	Seeing her sit down by her aunt he came up and spoke to her almost thrusting Vancouver aside with his broad shoulders 
none	none	Vancouver however did not dispute the position but turned on his heel and went away Oh I am so glad said Joe with a sigh of relief I thought I should never get away from him 
2787_157400_000077_000000	train-clean-360	It is amazing what a difference the common knowledge of a secret will make in the intimacy of two people 
2787_157400_000078_000000	train-clean-360	 I was rather taken aback at seeing you with him said John 
2787_157400_000078_000001	train-clean-360	 Not that it can make any difference to you he added quickly only you seemed so angry at him this morning 
2787_157400_000079_000000	train-clean-360	 But it does Joe began impulsively 
2787_157400_000079_000001	train-clean-360	 That is I began by meaning to cut him and then I thought it would be a mistake to make a scandal 
none	none	Yes said John it would be a great mistake 
2787_157400_000080_000001	train-clean-360	Besides I would not for all the world have you take a part in this thing 
2787_157400_000080_000002	train-clean-360	It would do no good and it might do harm 
2787_157400_000081_000000	train-clean-360	 I think I have taken a part already said Joe somewhat hurt 
none	none	Yes I know 
2787_157400_000082_000001	train-clean-360	I am very grateful but I hope you will not think any more about it nor allow it to influence you in any way 
none	none	But what is the use of friends if they do not take a part in one s quarrels asked Joe 
2787_157400_000084_000000	train-clean-360	John looked at her earnestly for a few seconds and saw that she was perfectly sincere 
2787_157400_000084_000001	train-clean-360	He had grown to like Josephine of late and he was grateful to her for her friendship 
2787_157400_000084_000002	train-clean-360	Her manner that morning when she told him of her discovery had made a deep impression on him 
2787_157400_000085_000000	train-clean-360	 My dear Miss Thorn he said earnestly in a low voice you are too good and kind and I thank you very heartily for your friendship 
2787_157400_000085_000001	train-clean-360	But I think you were very wise not to cut Vancouver and I hope you will not quarrel with anybody for any matter so trivial The color came to Joe s face but not for anger this time 
2787_157400_000086_000000	train-clean-360	 Trivial she exclaimed 
2787_157400_000087_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes trivial John repeated 
2787_157400_000087_000001	train-clean-360	 Remember that it is the policy of that paper to abuse me and that if Vancouver had not written the article the editor could have found some one else easily enough who would have done it 
none	none	But it is such a dastardly thing said Joe
2787_157400_000088_000001	train-clean-360	 He always says to every one that he has the greatest respect for you and then he does a thing like this 
2787_157400_000088_000002	train-clean-360	If I were you I would kill him I am sure I would 
none	none	That would not be the way to win an election nowadays said John laughing
2787_157400_000090_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I would not care about that said Joe hotly 
none	none	But I dare say it is very silly of me she added
2787_157400_000090_000002	train-clean-360	 You do not seem to mind it at all 
2787_157400_000091_000000	train-clean-360	 It is not worth while to lose one s temper or one s soul for the iniquities of mister Pocock Vancouver said John 
2787_157400_000091_000001	train-clean-360	 The man may do me harm but as I never expected his friendship or help he neither falls nor rises in my estimation on that account 
none	none	Blessed are they who expect nothing Blessed indeed said Joe
2787_157400_000092_000001	train-clean-360	 But one cannot help expecting men who have the reputation of being gentlemen to behave decently 
2787_157400_000093_000000	train-clean-360	 Vancouver has a right to his political opinions and a perfect right to express them in any way he sees fit said John 
none	none	Oh of course said Joe impatiently
2787_157400_000094_000001	train-clean-360	 This is a free country and that sort of thing 
none	none	But if he means to express political opinions he should not cry aloud at every tea party in town that he is neutral and takes no active part in politics 
2787_157400_000094_000003	train-clean-360	I think that writing violent articles in a newspaper is a very active part indeed 
2787_157400_000094_000004	train-clean-360	And he should not go about saying that he has the highest reverence for a man and then call him a lunatic and a charlatan in print unless he is willing to sign his name to it and take the consequences 
2787_157400_000094_000005	train-clean-360	Should he 
2787_157400_000094_000006	train-clean-360	I think it is vile and horrid and abominable and nasty and I hate him 
none	none	With the exception of the peroration to that speech said John who was very much amused I am afraid I must agree with you A man certainly ought not to do any of those things
2787_157400_000096_000000	train-clean-360	 Then why do you defend him asked Joe with flashing eyes 
2787_157400_000097_000000	train-clean-360	 Because on general principles I do not think a man is so much worse than his fellows because he does things they would very likely do in his place 
2787_157400_000097_000001	train-clean-360	There are things done every day all over the world quite as bad as that and no one takes much notice of them 
2787_157400_000097_000002	train-clean-360	Almost every businessman is trying to get the better of some other business man by fair means or foul 
2787_157400_000098_000000	train-clean-360	 You do not seem to have a very exalted idea of humanity said Joe 
2787_157400_000099_000000	train-clean-360	 A large part of humanity is sick said John and it is as well to be prepared for the worst in any illness 
2787_157400_000100_000000	train-clean-360	 I wish you were not so tremendously calm you know said Joe looking thoughtfully into John s face 
2787_157400_000100_000001	train-clean-360	 I am afraid it will injure you 
2787_157400_000101_000000	train-clean-360	 Why in the world should it injure me asked John much astonished at the remark 
2787_157400_000102_000000	train-clean-360	 I have a presentiment she checked herself suddenly 
2787_157400_000102_000001	train-clean-360	 I do not like to tell you she added 
2787_157400_000103_000000	train-clean-360	 I would like to hear what you think if you will tell me said John gravely 
2787_157400_000104_000000	train-clean-360	 Well do not be angry 
2787_157400_000104_000001	train-clean-360	I have a presentiment that you will not be made senator 
2787_157400_000104_000002	train-clean-360	Are you angry 
none	none	No indeed 
2787_157400_000105_000001	train-clean-360	But why 
2787_157400_000106_000000	train-clean-360	 Just for that very reason you are too calm 
2787_157400_000106_000001	train-clean-360	You are not enough of a partisan 
2787_157400_000106_000002	train-clean-360	Every one is a partisan here 
2787_157400_000107_000000	train-clean-360	John was silent and his face was grave and thoughtful 
2787_157400_000107_000001	train-clean-360	The remark was profound in its way and showed a far deeper insight into political matters than he imagined Joe possessed 
2787_157400_000107_000002	train-clean-360	He had long regarded missus Wyndham as a woman of fine sense and judgment and had often asked her opinion on important questions 
2787_157400_000107_000003	train-clean-360	But in all his experience she had never said anything that seemed to strike so deeply at the root of things as this simple remark of Josephine s 
2787_157400_000108_000000	train-clean-360	 I am afraid you are angry said Joe seeing that he was grave and silent 
2787_157400_000109_000000	train-clean-360	 You have set me thinking Miss Thorn he answered 
2787_157400_000110_000000	train-clean-360	 You think I may be right she said 
2787_157400_000111_000000	train-clean-360	 The idea is quite new to me I think it is perhaps the best definition of the fact that I ever heard 
2787_157400_000111_000001	train-clean-360	But it is not what ought to be 
2787_157400_000112_000000	train-clean-360	 Of course not Joe answered 
2787_157400_000112_000001	train-clean-360	 Nothing is just what it ought to be 
2787_157400_000112_000002	train-clean-360	But one has to take things as they are 
2787_157400_000113_000000	train-clean-360	 And make them what they should be added John and the look of strong determination came into his face 
2787_157400_000114_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah yes said Joe softly 
2787_157400_000114_000001	train-clean-360	 Make things what they should be 
none	none	That is the best thing a man can live for
2787_157400_000115_000000	train-clean-360	 Perhaps we might go home Joe said Miss Schenectady who had been conversing for a couple of hours with another old lady of literary tastes 
none	none	Yes Aunt Zoe said Joe rousing herself I think we might
2787_157400_000117_000000	train-clean-360	 Shall I see you to morrow night at missus Wyndham s dinner asked John as they parted 
2787_157400_000118_000000	train-clean-360	 No I refused 
none	none	Good night 
2787_157400_000119_000000	train-clean-360	As Joe sat by her aunt s side in the deep dark carriage on the way home her hands were cold and she trembled from head to foot 
none	none	And when at last she laid her head upon her pillow there were tears in her eyes and on her cheeks Is it possible that I can be so heartless she murmured to herself CHAPTER XI Ronald went to see Sybil Brandon at five o clock and as it chanced he found her alone missus Wyndham she said had gone out or rather she had not yet come home but if Ronald would wait she would certainly be in Ronald waited and talked to Miss Brandon in the mean while He had a bereaved air when he arrived which was calculated to excite sympathy and his conversation was subdued in tone and grave in subject But Sybil did her best to cheer him and in the fullness of her sympathy did perhaps more than was absolutely necessary Ronald s wound was not deep but he had a firm conviction that it ought to be Any man would have thought the same in his place Certainly few people would have understood what they felt in such a position He had grown up believing he was to marry a young and charming woman of whom he was really exceedingly fond and now he was suddenly told that the whole thing was a mistake It was enough to break a man s heart and yet Ronald s heart was not broken and to his great surprise beat nearly as regularly the day after his disaster as it had done during the whole two and twenty years of his life He could not understand his own calmness and he was sure that he ought to be profoundly grieved over the whole affair so that his face was drawn into an expression of solemnity somewhat out of keeping with its singular youthful freshness of color and outline The idea of devoting himself to the infernal gods as a sacrifice to the blighted passion had passed away in the course of the drive on the previous afternoon He had felt no inclination to drown his cares in drink during the evening but on the contrary he had gone for a brisk walk in Beacon Street and had ascertained by actual observation and the assistance of a box of matches the precise position of No nine hundred thirty six This had occupied some time as it is a peculiarity of Boston to put the number of the houses on the back instead of the front so that the only certain course to follow in searching for a friend is to reach the rear of his house by a circuitous route through side streets and back alleys and then having fixed the exact position of his residence by astronomical observation to return to the front and inquire for him It is true that even then one is frequently mistaken but there is nothing else to be done It was perhaps not extraordinary that Ronald should be at some pains to find out where missus Wyndham lived for Sybil was the only person besides Joe and Miss Schenectady whom he had yet met and he wanted company for he hated and dreaded solitude with his whole heart Having traveled all the night previous he went home and slept a sounder sleep than falls to the lot of most jilted lovers The next day he rose early and did Boston It did not take him long and he said to himself that half of it was very jolly and half of it was too utterly beastly for anything The Common and the Gardens and Commonwealth Avenue you know were rather pretty and must have cost a deuce of a lot of money in this country but as for the State House and Paul Revere s Church and the Old South and the city generally why it was simply disgusting all that you know And in the afternoon he went to see Sybil Brandon and began talking about what he had seen She was if anything more beautiful than ever and as she looked at him and held out her hand with a friendly greeting Ronald felt himself actually blushing and Sybil saw it and blushed too a very little Then they sat down by the window where there were plants and they looked out at the snow and the people passing Sybil asked Ronald what he had been doing I have been doing Boston he said Of course it was the proper thing But I am afraid I do not know much about it But do you like it she asked It is much more important I think to know whether you like things or dislike them than to know everything about them Do not you think so Oh of course said Ronald But I like Boston very much I mean the part where you live All this you know Commonwealth Place and the Public Park you know and Beacon Avenue of course very much But the city You do not like the city suggested Sybil seeing he hesitated and smiling at his strange confusion of names No said Ronald I think it is so cramped and ugly and all little narrow streets But then of course it is such a little place You get into the country the moment you walk anywhere It seems very big to the Bostonians said Sybil laughing Oh of course You have lived here all your life and so it is quite different I Dear me no I am not a Bostonian at all Oh said Ronald I thought you were That was the reason I was not sure of abusing the city to you But it is not a bad place I should think when you know lots of people and that was such a pretty drive we went yesterday Yes it must seem very new to you Everything must I should think most of all this casual way we have of receiving people But there really is a missus Wyndham with whom I am staying and she will be in before long Oh don t don t mention her said Ronald hastily I mean it it is of no importance whatever you know He blushed violently Sybil laughed and Ronald blushed again but in all his embarrassment lie could not help thinking what a silvery ring there was in her voice I am afraid missus Wyndham would not like it if she heard you telling me she was not to be mentioned and was not of any importance whatever But she is a very charming woman and I am very fond of her She is your aunt I presume Miss Brandon said Ronald My aunt repeated Sybil Oh no not at all only a friend Oh I thought all unattached young ladies lived with aunts here like Miss Schenectady Ronald smiled grimly at the recollections of the previous day Not quite that said Sybil laughing missus Wyndham is not the least like Miss Schenectady She is less clever and more human Really I am so glad said Ronald And she talks so oddly Joe s Miss Thorn s aunt Could you tell me if it is not a rude question why so many people here are never certain of anything It strikes me as so absurdly ridiculous you know She said yesterday that perhaps if I rang the bell she could send a message And the man at the hotel this morning had no postage stamps and said that perhaps if I went to the General Post Office I might be able to get some there Yes said Sybil it is absurd and one catches it so easily But would it not be ridiculous if the guard called out at a station Perhaps this is Boston or Perhaps this is New York It would be too utterly funny I am afraid that if you begin to make a list of our peculiarities yon will find funnier things than that said Sybil laughing But then we always laugh at you in England so that it is quite fair Oh we are very absurd I know said Ronald but I think we are much more comfortable For instance we do not have niggers about who call us Mister You must not use such words in Boston mister Surbiton said Sybil Seriously there are people who would be very much offended You must speak of waiters of color or the colored help you must be very careful I will said Ronald Thanks Is everything rechristened in that way I am afraid I shall always be in hot water Oh yes there are no men and women here They are all ladies and gentlemen or the gurls and the fellows But it is very soon learnt Yes I can imagine said Ronald very much amused But by the bye this is the season here is not it So they chattered together for nearly an hour about the merest nothings not saying anything particularly witty but never seeming to each other in the least dull Ronald had gone to Sybil for consolation and he was so well consoled that he was annoyed when missus Wyndham came in and interrupted his tete a tete Sybil introduced Ronald and when he rose to go after a quarter of an hour missus Wyndham asked him to dinner on the following day That night when Ronald was alone in his room at the hotel he took Josephine s photograph from a case in his bag and set it before him on the table He would think about her for a while and reflect on his situation and he sat down for that purpose his chin resting on his folded hands Dear Joe he loved her so dearly and she was so cruel not to marry him But somehow as he looked he seemed to see through the photograph and another face came and smiled on him Again and again he called his attention back and tried to realize that the future would be very blank and dreary without Joe but do what he would it did not seem so blank and dreary after all there was somebody else there Joe is quite right he said aloud I am a brute And he went to bed trying hard to be disgusted with himself But his dreams were sweet for he dreamed he was sitting among the ferns at missus Wyndham s house talking to Sybil Brandon Why my dear said missus Wyndham when Ronald was gone he is perfectly charming We have positively found a new man Yes said Sybil I am so glad you asked him to dinner I do not think he is very clever but he talks easily and says funny things I suppose he has come over to marry his cousin has not he inquired missus Wyndham No replied Sybil he is not going to marry Joe Thorn she answered absently for she was thinking of something and her tone indicated such absolute certainty in the matter that missus Wyndham looked quickly at her Well you seem quite certain about it any way she said I Oh well yes I think it is extremely unlikely that he will marry her I almost wish I had offered to take him to the party to night said missus Wyndham evidently unsatisfied However as he is coming to morrow that will do quite as well Sybil dear you look tired Why don t you go and lie down before dinner Oh because I am not tired really I am always pale you know Well I am tired to death myself my dear and as there is no one here I will say I am not at home and rest till dinner missus Wyndham had been as much startled as any one by news of the senator s death that morning and though she always professed to agree with her husband she was delighted at the prospect of John Harrington s election She had been a good friend to him and he to her for years and she cared much more for his success than for the turn of events She had met him in the street that afternoon and they had perambulated the pavement of Beacon Street for more than an hour in the discussion of the future John had also told her that he was now certain that Vancouver was the writer of the offensive articles that had so long puzzled him at all events that the especial one which had appeared the morning after the skating party was undoubtedly from his pen missus Wyndham who had long suspected as much was very angry when she found that her suspicions had been so just and she proposed to deal summarily with Vancouver John however begged her to temporize and she promised to be prudent By the way she said to Sybil as she was about to leave the room it was a special providence that you did not marry Vancouver He has turned out badly Sybil started slightly and looked up Her experience with Pocock Vancouver was a thing she rarely referred to She had undoubtedly given him great encouragement and had then mercilessly refused him to the great surprise of every one But as that had occurred a year and a half ago it was quite natural that she should treat him like any one else now just as though nothing had happened She looked up at missus Wyndham in some surprise What has he done she asked You know how he always talks about John Harrington He always says he respects him immensely Very well It is he who has been writing those scurrilous articles that we have talked about so much How disgraceful exclaimed Sybil How perfectly detestable Are you quite sure There is not the least doubt about it John Harrington told me himself Oh then of course it is true said Sybil How dreadful Harrington takes it in the calmest way as though he had expected it all his life He says they were never friends and that Vancouver has a perfect right to his political opinions I never saw anybody so cool in my life What a splendid fellow he is exclaimed Sybil There is something lion like about him He would forgive an enemy a thousand times a day and say the man who injured him had a perfect right to his opinions Why gracious goodness Sybil how you talk cried missus Wyndham you are not in love with the man yourself are you my dear I asked Sybil Then she laughed No indeed I would not marry him if he asked me Why not Oh I would never marry a celebrity like that He is splendid and noble and honest but everything in him is devoted to his career There is no room for a woman at all I think the amount of solid knowledge about men that you dear sweet lovely beautiful innocent little girls possess is something just too perfectly amazing said missus Wyndham slowly and with great emphasis If we do said Sybil it is not surprising I am sure I do not wonder at girls knowing a great deal about the world Everything is discussed before them and marriage and men are the usual topics of conversation The wonder is that girls still make so many mistakes in their choice after listening to the combined experience of all the married women of their acquaintance for several years It shows that no one is infallible What a funny girl you are Sybil exclaimed missus Wyndham I think you turn the tables on me altogether Yes Well I have experiences of my own now said Sybil leaning back against an enormous cushion missus Wyndham came and sat upon the arm of the easy chair and put one arm round Sybil s neck and kissed her Sybil dear she said affectionately and then stopped They sat in silence for some time looking at the great logs burning in the deep fire place Sybil dear missus Wyndham began again presently why did you refuse Vancouver You do not mind telling me do you Why do you ask said Sybil It makes no difference now No perhaps not Only I always thought it strange He must have done something you did not like of course Yes that was it He did something I did not like mister Harrington would have said he had a perfect right to do as he pleased But I could not marry him after that Was it anything so very bad asked missus Wyndham affectionately smoothing Sybil s thick fair hair It was not as deep as a well nor as broad as a house said Sybil with a faint scornful laugh but it was enough It would do I wish you would tell me dear persisted missus Wyndham I have a particular reason for wanting to know Well I would not have told before this other affair came out said Sybil I would not marry him because he tried to find out from poor mamma s man of business whether we were rich And the day after he got the information that I was rich enough to suit him he proposed But mamma knew all about what had gone on and told me and so I refused him She said I was wrong and would not have told me if she had known it would make any difference And now you say I was right I am sure I was it was only a fancy I had for him because he was so clever and well bred Besides he is much too old He is old enough to be your father my dear said missus Wyndham but I think you were a little hard on him Almost any man would do the same We here in Boston of course always know about each other It was a little mean of him no doubt but it was not a mortal crime I think it was low said Sybil decisively To think of a man as rich as that caring for a paltry twenty or thirty thousand a year I know my dear said missus Wyndham it is mean but they all do it and life is uncertain and so is business I suppose and twenty or thirty thousand a year does make a difference to most people I expect missus Wyndham looked at the fire reflectively as though not absolutely certain of the truth of the proposition Sam Wyndham was commonly reputed to be worth a dozen millions or so He would have been very well off even in New York and in Boston he was rich It would make a great difference to me said Sybil laughing for it is all I have in the world But I am glad I refused Vancouver on that ground all the same If it had not been for that I should have married him just imagine Yes just imagine exclaimed missus Wyndham And to have had him turn out such an abominable blackguard There is no mistaking what you think of him now at all events said Sybil No my dear And now we have talked so long that it is time to dress for dinner How missus Wyndham went to the party and met Joe Thorn has already been told It was no wonder that missus Sam treated Vancouver so coldly and she repulsed him again more than once during the evening When Joe was gone John Harrington went up to her I came very late he said and at first I could not find you and then I had to say something to Miss Thorn But I wanted to see you especially Give me your arm said missus Wyndham and we will go into the conservatory I have something especial to say to you too Once out of the thick of the party they sat down I have discovered something more about our amiable friend she continued It is a side light on his character something he did a year and a half ago Do you remember his flirtation with Sybil Brandon at Saratoga and then at Newport Yes I was in Newport most of the summer You don t know why she refused him though It s perfectly rich missus Sam laughed dryly No I only know she did and every one seemed very much astonished answered John She refused him because he had been trying to find out how much she was worth It speaks volumes for the characters of both of them does it not Yes indeed said John What a Jew that man is He is as rich as Croesus Oh well as I told her most men would do it I suppose so John answered laughing a little A man the other night told me he was going to make inquiries concerning the fortunes of his beloved one He said he had no idea of buying a pig in a poke That was graceful was it not missus Wyndham laughed aloud He was honest at all events By the bye do you know you have a fanatic admirer in Sybil Brandon No really I like her very much too and I am very glad if she likes me She said she would not marry you if you asked her though said missus Sam laughing again You see you must not flatter yourself too much I do not I should not think of asking her to marry me Did she give any especial reason why she would inevitably refuse me Yes indeed she said you were lion like and oh the most delightful things But she said she would not marry you if you asked her because you are a celebrity and devoted to your career so that there is no room for a woman in your life Is that true I am not so sure said John thoughtfully Perhaps she is right in the way she means I never thought much about it CHAPTER XII The idea Joe had formed about Vancouver was just in the main and she was not far wrong in disliking him and thinking him dangerous Nevertheless John Harrington understood the man better Vancouver was so constituted that his fine intellect and quick perception were unsupported by any strong principle of individuality He was not capable of hatred he could only be spiteful he could not love he could only give a woman what he could spare of himself He would at all times rather avoid an open encounter but he rarely neglected an opportunity of dealing a thrust at any one he disliked when he could do so safely He was the very opposite of John who never said of any one what he would not say to themselves and granted to every man the broadest right of judgment and freedom of opinion Nevertheless there was not enough real strength in anything Vancouver felt to make him very dangerous as an opponent nor valuable as a friend Had it not been for the important position he had attained by his clever subtlety in affairs and by the assistance of great railroad magnates who found in him a character and intelligence precisely suited to their ends Pocock Vancouver would have been a neutral figure in the world lacking both the enterprise to create an idea and the courage to follow it out It was most characteristic of his inherent smallness that in spite of his wealth and the very large operations that must be constantly occupying his thoughts he could demean himself to write anonymous articles in a daily paper in the hope of injuring a man he disliked It is true that his feeling against Harrington was as strong as anything in his nature He detested John s strength because he had once made him a confidence and John had done him a favor He disliked him also because he knew that wherever they chanced to be together John received an amount of consideration and even of respect which he himself could not obtain with all his money and all his cleverness His mind too delighted in detail and revolted against John s sweeping generalities For these several reasons Vancouver had taken great delight in writing and printing sundry vicious criticisms upon John in the absolute certainty of not being found out The editor of the paper did not know Vancouver s name for the articles came through the post with a modest request that they might be inserted if they were of any use and they were generally so pungent and to the point that the editor was glad to get them especially as no remuneration was demanded As for the confidence Vancouver had once made to John it was another instance of his littleness At the time when Vancouver was anxious to marry Sybil Brandon John Harrington was very intimate at the house and was in Vancouver s opinion a dangerous rival at all events he felt that the contest was not an agreeable one nor altogether to his own advantage Accordingly he tried every means to clear the coast as he expressed it but although John probably had no intention of marrying Sybil and Sybil certainly had never thought of marrying John the latter was fond of her society and of her mother s and came to the cottage on the Newport cliff with a regularity that drove Vancouver to the verge of despair Pocock at last could bear it no longer and asked John to dinner Over a bottle of Pommery Sec he confided his passion and hinted that John was the obstacle to his wooing Harrington raised his eyebrows smiled wished Vancouver all success and left Newport the next day If Vancouver had not disgusted Sybil by his inquiries concerning her fortune he would have married her and his feelings towards John would have been different But to know that Harrington had done him the favor of going away knowing that he was about to offer himself to Miss Brandon and then to have failed in his suit was more than the vanity of mister Pocock Vancouver could bear with any sort of calmness and the consequence was that he disliked John as much as he disliked anybody or anything in the world There is no resentment like the resentment of wounded vanity nor any self reproach like that of a man who has shown his weakness When missus Wyndham told John the story of Vancouver s failure he could have told her the rest had he chosen and she would certainly have been very much amused But John was not a man to betray a confidence even that of a man who had injured him and so he merely laughed and kept his own counsel He would have scorned to speak to Vancouver about the articles or to make any change in his manner towards him As he had said to Josephine he had expected nothing from the man and now he was not disappointed Meanwhile Vancouver who was weakly but frequently susceptible to the charms of woman had made up his mind that if Josephine had enough pin money she would make him an admirable wife and he accordingly began to make love to her in his own fashion as has been seen A day or two earlier Joe would have laughed at him and it would perhaps have amused her to hear what he had to say as it amuses most young women to listen to pretty speeches But Joe was between two fires so to speak she was under the two influences that were strongest with her She loved John Harrington with all her heart and she hated Vancouver with all her strength It is true that her hatred was the only acknowledged passion for her maidenly nature was not able yet to comprehend her love and the mere thought that she cared for a man who did not care for her brought the hot blush to her cheek But the love was in her heart all the same strong and enduring so that Vancouver found the fortress doubly guarded He could not entirely explain to himself her conduct at the party She had always seemed rather willing to accept his attentions and to listen to his conversation but on this particular evening just when he wished to make a most favorable impression she had treated him with surprising coldness There was a supreme superiority in the way she had at first declined his services and had then told him he might be permitted to get her a glass of water The subsequent satisfaction of having ousted mister Bonamy Biggielow the little poet from his position at her side was small enough and was more than counterbalanced and destroyed by her returning to her chaperon at the first soft tongued insinuation of a desire to flirt which Vancouver ventured to speak Moreover when Harrington almost pushed him aside and sat down by Josephine Vancouver could bear it no longer but turned on his heel and went away with black thoughts in his heart It seemed as though John was to be always in his way It would be hard to say what he would have felt had he known that Josephine Thorn John Harrington and missus Sam Wyndham all knew of his journalistic doings And yet it was nearly certain that no one of the three would ever speak to him on the subject Joe would not because she knew John would not like it John himself despised the whole business too much to condescend to reproach Vancouver and finally missus Wyndham was too much a woman of the world to be willing to cause a scandal when it could possibly be avoided She liked Vancouver too and regretted what he had done Her liking only extended to his conversation and agreeable manners for she was beginning to despise his character but he had so long been an habitue about the house that she could not make up her mind to turn him out But for all that she could not help being cold to him at first John himself was too busy with important matters to bestow much thought on Vancouver or his doings His day had been spent in interviews and letter writing fifty people had been to see him at his rooms and he had dispatched more than that number of letters At five o clock he had slipped out with the intention of dining at his club before any one else was there but he had met missus Wyndham in the street and had spent his dinner hour with her At half past six he had another appointment in his rooms and it was not till nearly eleven that he was able to get away and look in upon the party when he met Joe For a week this kind of life would probably last and then all would be over in one way or another but meanwhile the excitement was intense On the next day Ronald came to see Joe before ten o clock The time hung heavily on his hands and he found it impossible to occupy himself with his troubles There were moments when the first impression of disappointment returned upon him very strongly but he was conscious of a curious duplicity about his feelings and he knew well enough in his inmost heart that he was only evoking a fictitious regret out of respect for what he thought he ought to feel Tell me all about the people here Joe said he sitting down beside her almost as though nothing had happened Who is missus Wyndham to begin with missus Wyndham she is Sam Wyndham s wife Just that said Joe And Sam Wyndham Oh he is one of the prevalent profession He is a millionaire In fact he is one of the real ones When do they get to be real asked Ronald Oh when they have more than ten millions The other ones do not count much It is much more the thing to be poor unless you have ten millions That is something in my favor at all events said Ronald Very much You have been to see missus Wyndham then Oh yes I went yesterday and she has asked me to dinner to night It is awfully good of her I must say You will like her very much and Sybil Brandon too said Joe Sybil is an adorable creature She is most decidedly good looking certainly There is no doubt about it Ronald pulled his delicate moustache a little Though she is quite different style from you Joe he added presently as though he had discovered a curious fact in natural history Of course Sybil is a great beauty and I am only pretty answered Joe in perfectly good faith I think you are a great beauty too said Ronald critically I am sure most people think so and I have heard lots of men say so Besides you are much more striking looking than she is Oh nonsense Ronald Joe who is mister Vancouver Vancouver Why do you ask especially It is very natural I am sure said Ronald in a somewhat injured tone You wrote about him He was the only person you mentioned in your letter that is he and a man called Harrington mister Vancouver mister Pocock Vancouver is a middle aged man of various accomplishments said Joe more especially distinguished by the fact that Sybil Brandon refused to marry him some time ago He is an enemy of mister Harrington s and they are both friends of missus Wyndham s Ah ejaculated Ronald and who is Harrington mister John Harrington is a very clever person who has to do with politics said Joe without hesitation but as she continued she blushed a little He is always being talked about because he wants to reform everything He is a great friend of ours Oh I thought so said Ronald What sort of a fellow is he I suppose he is five and thirty years old he is neither tall nor short and he has red hair said Joe What a beauty laughed Ronald He is not at all ugly you know said Joe still blushing Shall I ever see him You will see him to night at missus Wyndham s he told me he was going Oh are you going too Joe No I have another dinner party You will have to do without me I suppose I shall always have to do without you now said Ronald disconsolately Don t be silly Ronald Silly repeated Surbiton in injured tones You call it silly to be cut up when one is treated as you have treated me It is too bad Joe You are a dear silly old thing said his cousin affectionately and I will say it as much as I please It is ever so much better because we can always be like brother and sister now and we shall not marry and quarrel over everything till we hate each other I think you are very heartless all the same said Ronald Listen to me Ronald You will go and marry one of these middle aged people with red hair Be quiet said Joe stamping her little foot Listen to me I will not marry you because I like you and I do not love you and I never mean to marry any middle aged person I shall not marry at all most probably Will you please to imagine what life would have been like if we had married first and found out afterwards that we had made a mistake Of course that would have been awful said Ronald But then it would not be a mistake because I love you like anything Joe Oh nonsense You are quite mistaken my dear boy because some day you will fall desperately in love with some one else and you will like me just as much as ever Of course I should said Ronald indignantly Nothing would ever make any difference at all But Ronald retorted Joe laughing if you were desperately in love with some one else how could you still be just as fond of me I don t know but I should said Ronald Besides it is absurd for I shall never love any one else We shall see but of course if you never do we shall always be just the same as we are now Well that would not be so bad you know said Ronald with a certain air of resignation After this conversation Ronald became reconciled to the situation Joe s remark that he would be able to love some one else very much without being any the less fond of herself made him reflect and he came to the conclusion that the case was conceivable after all He therefore agreed within himself that he would think no more about the matter for the present but would take what came in his way and trust that Joe would ultimately change her mind But he went to missus Wyndham s that evening with a firm determination to dislike John Harrington to the best of his ability A middle aged man with red hair Five and thirty was undoubtedly middle age Short too But Joe had blushed and there was no doubt about it this was the man who had won her affections Ronald would hate him cordially But John refused to be hated His manner was easy and courteous but not gentle He was evidently no lady s man He talked to the men more than to the women and he was utterly without affectation Indeed he was not in the least like what Ronald had expected Moreover Ronald was seated next to Sybil Brandon at dinner and drove every one away who tried to disturb the tete a tete he succeeded in procuring with her afterwards He was surprised at his own conduct but he somehow connected it in his mind with his desire to hate Harrington It was not very clear to himself and it certainly would have been incomprehensible to any one else but the presence of Harrington stimulated him in his efforts to amuse Miss Brandon Sybil too in her quiet way was very willing to be amused and she found in Ronald Surbiton an absolute freshness of ideas that gave her a new sense of pleasure Her affair with Vancouver had made a deep impression on her mind and her mother s death soon afterwards had had the effect of withdrawing her entirely from the world It was no wonder therefore that she liked this young Englishman so different from most of the men she knew best It was natural too that he should want to talk to her for she was the only young girl present At last as Ronald began to feel that intimacy which sometimes grows out of a simple conversation between two sympathetic people he turned to the subject he had most in mind if not most in his heart You and my cousin are very intimate Miss Brandon I believe he said Yes I have grown very fond of her in a few weeks Sybil wondered whether Ronald was going to make confidences It seemed to her rather early in the acquaintance Yes she told me said Ronald She is very fond of you too I went to see her this morning I suppose you go every day said Sybil smiling No not every day answered Ronald But this morning I was asking her about some of the people here She seems to know every one Yes indeed she is immensely popular Whom did she tell you about Oh missus Wyndham and mister Wyndham and mister Vancouver and mister Harrington He is immensely clever she says added Ronald with a touch of irony in his voice What do you think about him Miss Brandon I cannot judge very well said Sybil He is a great friend of mine and I do not care in the least whether my friends are clever or not Joe does said Ronald She hates stupid people She is very clever too you know and so I suppose she is right about Harrington Oh yes I was only speaking of myself answered Sybil He is probably the strongest man in this part of the world He looks strong said Ronald who was a judge of athletes I mean in the way of brains said Sybil But he is more than that for he is so splendidly honest But lots of people are honest said Ronald who did not want to concede too much to the man he meant to dislike Perhaps but not so much as he is I do not believe John Harrington ever in his life said anything that could possibly convey a false impression or ever betrayed a confidence Sybil looked calmly across the room at John who was talking earnestly to Sam Wyndham But has he no defects at all What a model of faultlessness exclaimed Ronald People say he is self centred whatever that may mean He is certainly a very ambitious man but his ambitions are large and he makes no secret of them He will make a great stir in the world some day Ronald would have liked to ask about Vancouver also but he fortunately remembered what Joe had told him that morning and did not ask his questions of Sybil But he went home that night wondering what manner of man this Harrington might be concerning whom such great things were said He was conscious also that he had not been very wise in what he had asked of Sybil and he was dissatisfied at not having heard anything about the friendship that existed between Harrington and Joe But on the whole he had enjoyed the evening very much almost too much when he remembered the things Joe had said to him in the morning It ought not to be possible he thought for a jilted lover to look so pleasantly on life Well said Sam Wyndham to his wife when everybody was gone and he had lit a big cigar well it was a pleasant kind of an evening was not it Yes said missus Sam sitting down in a low easy chair for a chat with her husband What a nice boy that young Englishman is I was just going to say so said Sam He made himself pretty comfortable with Sybil did he not I could not help thinking they looked a very pretty pair as they sat in that corner What is he He is Miss Thorn s cousin Sam you really must not drop your ashes on the carpet There are no end of saucers and things about Oh bother the carpet my dear said Sam good naturedly tell me about that young fellow what is his name Surbiton is not it Yes well there is not very much to tell He is here traveling for amusement just like any other young Englishman For my part I expected he had come here to marry his cousin because Englishmen always marry their cousins But Sybil says it is not true How does she come to know inquired Sam rolling his cigar in his mouth and looking at the ceiling I suppose Miss Thorn told her She ought to know any way Well one would think so By the way this election is going to turn out a queer sort of a business I expect John says the only thing that is doubtful is that fellow Patrick Ballymolloy and his men Now is not that just about the queerest thing you ever heard of A set of Irishmen in the Legislature who are not sure they can manage to vote for a Democratic senator Yes that is something altogether new said missus Wyndham But it seems so funny that John should come telling you all about his election when you are such a Republican and would go straight against him if you had anything to say about it Oh he knows I don t vote or anything said Sam Of course you don t vote because you are not in the Legislature But if you did you would go against him would not you Well I am not sure answered Sam in a drawl of uncertainty I tell you what it is my dear John Harrington is not such a bad Republican after all though he is a Democrat And it is my belief he could call himself a Republican and could profess to believe just the same things as he does now if he only took a little care CHAPTER XIII A council of three men sat in certain rooms in Conduit Street London There was nothing whatever about the bachelor s front room overlooking the thoroughfare to suggest secrecy nor did any one of the three gentlemen who sat in easy chairs with cigars in their mouths in any way resemble a conspirator They were neither masked nor wrapped in cloaks but wore the ordinary garb of fashionably civilized life For the sake of clearness and convenience they can be designated as X Y and Z X was the president on the present occasion but the office was not held permanently devolving upon each of the three in succession at each successive meeting X was a man sixty years of age clean shaved with smooth iron gray hair and bushy eyebrows from beneath which shone a pair of preternaturally bright blue eyes His face was of a strong even healthy red he was stout but rather thick and massive than corpulent his hands were of the square type with thick straight fingers and large nails the great blue veins showing strongly through the white skin He was dressed in black as though in mourning and his clothes fitted smoothly over his short heavy figure Y was very tall and slight and it was not easy to make a guess at his age for his hair was sandy and thick and his military moustache concealed the lines about his mouth His forehead was high and broad and the extreme prominence between his brows made his profile look as though the facial angles were reversed as in certain busts of Greek philosophers His fingers were well shaped but extremely long and thin He wore the high collar of the period with a white tie fastened by a pin consisting of a single large pearl and it was evident that the remainder of his dress was with him a subject of great attention Y might be anywhere from forty to fifty years of age Z was the eldest of the three and in some respects the most remarkable in appearance He was well proportioned except that his head seemed large for his body His face was perfectly colorless and his thin hair was white and long and disorderly A fringe of snowy beard encircled his throat like a scarf but his lips and cheeks were clean shaved The dead waxen whiteness of his face was thrown into startling relief by his great black eyes in which there was a depth and a fire when he was roused that contrasted strongly with his aged appearance His dress was simple in the extreme and of the darkest colors The three sat in their easy chairs round the coal fire It was high noon in London and the weather was moderately fine that is to say it was possible to read in the room without lighting the gas X held a telegram in his hand This is a perfectly clear case against us he remarked in a quiet business like manner It has occurred at such an unfortunate time said Y who spoke very slowly and distinctly with an English accent We shall do it yet said Z confidently Gentlemen said the president it will not do to hesitate There is an individual in this case who will not let the grass grow under his feet His name is mister Patrick Ballymolloy We all know about him I expect I know him very well indeed said old Z It was I who put him in the book He rose quickly and took a large volume from a shelf near by It was a sort of ledger with the letters of the alphabet printed on the cut edges of the leaves I don t believe Y knows him said the president Please read him to us Z turned over the leaves quickly B Bally Ballymolloy Patrick Yes he said finding the place Patrick Ballymolloy Irish iron man Boston Mass Drinks Takes money from both sides Voted generally Democratic ticket P S eighteen eighty two opposed B in election for Governor Iron interest increased P S eighteen eighty three owns twenty votes in House Costs more than he did That is all said Z shutting up the book Quite enough said the president mister Patrick Ballymolloy and his twenty votes will bother us What a pity J H made that speech It appears that as Patrick has grown rich Patrick has grown fond of protection then remarked Y crossing one long leg over the other Exactly said Z That is it Now the question is who owns Patrick Anybody know Whoever can pay for him I expect said the president Now I have an idea said the old man suddenly and again he dived into the book Did either of you ever know a man called Vancouver Yes I know all about him said Y and a contemptuous smile hinted beforehand what he thought of the man I made an entry about him the other day said the president You will find a good deal against his name Here he is said Z again Pocock Vancouver Railways Rep Boston Mass Was taxed in eighteen seventy for nearly a million dollars Weak character very astute Takes no money Believed to be dissipated but he cleverly conceals it Never votes Has extensive financial interests eighteen eighty taxed for nearly three millions eighteen eighty one paid ten thousand dollars to Patrick Ballymolloy D for carrying a motion for the Monadminck Railroad see Railroads eighteen eighty two voted for Butler Hollo exclaimed the president Wait said Z there is more eighteen eighty three thought to be writer of articles against J H in Boston Daily Standard Subsequently confirmed by J H That is all Yes said the president that last note is mine Harrington wired it yesterday with other things But I was hurried and did not read his old record Things could not be much worse You see Harrington has no book with him or he would know all this and be on the lookout Has he figured it out inquired Y Yes he has figured it out He is a first rate man and he has the whole thing down cold Ballymolloy and his twenty votes will carry the election and if Vancouver cares he can buy mister Ballymolloy as he has done before He does care if he is going to take the trouble to write articles against J H depend upon it Well there is nothing for it said Z who in spite of his age was the most impulsive of the three We must buy Ballymolloy ourselves with his twenty men I think that would be a mistake said the president Do you said Z What do you say he asked turning to Y Nothing replied Y Then we will argue it I suppose said Z Certainly said the president I will begin He settled himself in his chair and knocked the ashes from his cigar I will begin by stating the exact position he said In the first place this whole affair is accidental resulting from the death of the junior senator No one could foresee this event We had arranged to put in John Harrington at the regular vacancy next year and we are now very busy with a most important business here in London If we were on the spot as one of us could have been had we known that the senator would die it would have been another matter This thing will be settled by next Saturday at the latest but probably earlier I am opposed to buying Ballymolloy because it is an uncertain purchase He has taken money from both sides and if he has the chance he will do it again If we were present it would be different for we could hold him to his bargain We do not like buying and we only do it in very urgent cases and when we are certain of the result To buy without certainty is simply to begin a system of reckless bribery which is exactly what we want to put down Moreover it is a bad plan to bribe a man who is interested in iron The man in that business ought to be with us any way without anything but a little talking to When you have stated any reasons to the contrary I will tell you what I propose instead That is all During the president s little speech Y and Z had listened attentively When he had finished Z turned in his chair and took his cigar from his lips I think said Z that the case is urgent The question is just about coming to a head and we want all the men we can get at any price It will not do to let a chance slip If we can put J H in the senate now we may put another man in at the vacancy That makes two men instead of one I am aware that it would be an improbable thing to get two of our men in for Massachusetts but I believe it can be done and for that reason I think we ought to make an effort to get J H in now It may cost something but I do not believe it is uncertain I expect Vancouver is not the sort of man to spend much just for the sake of spite The question of buying as a rule is another matter None of us want that but if the case is urgent I think there is no question about its being right Of course it is a great pity J H said anything about protection in that speech He did not mean to but he could not help it and at all events he had no idea his election was so near If we are not certain of the result J H ought to withdraw because it will injure his chance at the vacancy to have him defeated now That is all I have to say I am of opinion said the president that our best plan is to let John Harrington take his chance You know who his opponent is I suppose Ira C Calvin said Y and Z together Calvin refused last night said the president and they have put Jobbins in his place Here is the telegram It is code three he remarked handing it to Z Z read it and his face expressed the greatest surprise But Jobbins belongs to us he cried He will not move hand or foot unless we advise him Of course said the president But mister Ballymolloy does not know that nor any other member of the Legislature Harrington himself does not know it Verdict please Verdict against buying said Y Naturally said Z What a set of fools they are How about withdrawing Harrington I object said the president Proceed I think it will injure his chance at the vacancy to have him defeated now as I said before That is all said Z I think it would be dangerous to withdraw him before so weak a man as Jobbins It would hurt his reputation Besides our second man is in Washington arguing a case and after all there is a bare chance that J H may win If he does not we win all the same for Jobbins is in chains Verdict please Y was silent and smoked thoughtfully For five minutes no one spoke and the president occupied the time in arranging some papers Let him stand his chance said Y at last In spite of the apparent informality of the meetings of the three there was an unchangeable rule in their proceedings Whenever a question arose the member who first objected to the proposition argued the case briefly or at length with the proposer and the third gave the verdict against which there was no appeal These three strong men possessed between them an enormous power It rarely happened that they could all meet together and settle upon their course of action by word of month but constant correspondence and the use of an extensive set of telegraphic codes kept them in unbroken communication No oaths or ceremonies bound them together for they belonged to a small community of men which has existed from the earliest days of American independence and which took its rise before that period Into this council of three men of remarkable ability and spotless character were elected without much respect of age whenever a vacancy occurred They worked quietly with one immutable political purpose with which they allowed no prejudiced party view to interfere Always having under their immediate control some of the best talent in the country and frequently commanding vast financial resources these men and their predecessors had more than once turned the scale of the country s future They had committed great mistakes but they had also brought about noble results It had frequently occurred that all the three members of the council simultaneously held seats in the senate or that one or more were high in office More than one President since Washington had sat at one time or another in the triumvirate secretaries of state orators lawyers financiers and philanthropists had given the best years of their lives to the duties of the council and yet so perfect was the organization the tests were so careful and so marvelously profound was the insight of the leaders into human character that of all these men not one had ever betrayed the confidence placed in him In the truest sense they and their immediate supporters formed an order an order of true men with whom the love of justice honor and freedom took the place of oath and ceremonial binding them by stronger obligations than ever bound a ring of conspirators or a community of religious zealots The great element of secrecy as regards the outer world lay in the fact that only two men at any one time knew of the existence of the council of three and these were those who were considered fit to sit in the council themselves Even these two did not know more than one of the three leaders as such though probably personally and even intimately acquainted with all three The body of men whom the council controlled was ignorant of its existence therefore and was composed of the personal adherents of each of the three Manifestly one member of the council could with the consent and cooperation of the other two command the influence of the whole body of political adherents in favor of one of his friends at any time leaving the individual in entire ignorance of the power employed for his advancement When a vacancy occurred in the council by death or old age of any member one of the two already designated took the place while the other remained ignorant of the fact that any change had occurred unless the vacancy was caused by the withdrawal of the member he had known in which case he was put in communication with that member with whom he was most intimately acquainted By this system of management no one man knew more than one of the actual leaders until he was himself one of the three At the present time Z had been in the council nearly thirty years and X for upwards of twenty while Y who was in reality fifty years old had received his seat fifteen years before at the age of thirty five A year ago one of the men selected to fill a possible vacancy had died and John Harrington was chosen in his place It has been seen that the three kept a sort of political ledger which was always in the hands of the president for the time being whose duty it was to make the insertions necessary from time to time Some conception of the extent and value of the book may be formed from the fact that it contained upwards of ten thousand names including those of almost every prominent man and of not a few remarkable women in the principal centres of the country The details given were invariably brief and to the point written down in a simple but safe form of cipher which was perfectly familiar to every one of the three This vast mass of information was simply the outcome of the personal experience of the leaders and of their trusted friends but no detail which could by any possibility be of use escaped being committed to paper and the result was in many cases a positive knowledge of future events which to any one unacquainted with the system must have appeared little short of miraculous What time is it in Boston inquired the president rising and going to the writing table Twenty eight minutes past seven said Y producing an enormous three dial time piece set to indicate simultaneously the time of day in London Boston and Washington All right there is plenty of time answered X writing out a dispatch on a broad white sheet of cable office paper See here is this all right he asked when he had done The message ran as follows Do not withdraw If possible gain Ballymolloy and men but on no account pay for them If asked say iron protection necessary at present and probably for many years Y and Z read the telegram and said it would do In ten minutes it was taken to the telegraph office by X s servant And now said X lighting a fresh cigar we have disposed of this accident and we can turn to our regular business The question is broadly what effect will be produced by suddenly throwing eight or ten millions of English money into an American enterprise When Englishmen are not making money they are a particularly disagreeable set of people to deal with remarked Y who would have been taken for an Englishman himself in any part of the world And so the council left John Harrington and turned to other matters which do not in any way concern this tale John received the dispatch at half past ten o clock in the morning after the dinner at missus Wyndham s and he read it without comprehending precisely the position taken by his instructor Nevertheless the order coincided with what he would have done if left to himself He of course could not know that even if his opponent were elected it would be a gain to his own party for the outward life of mister Jobbins gave no cause for believing that he was in anybody s power Harrington was left to suppose that if he failed to get the votes of Patrick Ballymolloy and his party the election would be a dead loss Nevertheless he rejoiced that the said Patrick was not to be bought An honorable failure wherein he might honestly say that he had bribed no one nor used any undue pressure would in his opinion be better than to be elected ten times over by money and promises of political jobbery The end rarely justifies the means and there are means so foul that they would blot any result into their own filthiness All that the world can write or think or say will never make it honorable or noble to bribe and tell lies Men who lie are not brave because they are willing to be shot at in some instances by the men their falsehoods have injured Men who pay others to agree with them are doing a wrong upon the dignity of human nature and they very generally end by saying that human nature has no dignity at all and very possibly by being themselves corrupted Nevertheless so great is the interest which men even upright and honorable men take in the aims they follow that they believe it possible to wade knee deep through mud and then ascend to the temple of fame without dragging the mud with them and befouling the white marble steps Political necessity What deeds are done in thy name What a merciful and polite goddess was the necessity of the ancients compared with the necessity of the moderns Political necessity has been hard at work in our times from Robespierre to Sedan from saint Helena to the Vatican from the Tea chests of Boston Harbor to the Great Rebellion Political necessity has done more lying more bribery more murdering and more stealing in a century than could have been invented by all the Roman emperors together with the assistance of the devil himself CHAPTER XIV In all the endless folk lore of proverbs there is perhaps no adage more true than that which warns young people to beware of a new love until they have done with the old and as Ronald Surbiton reflected on his position the old rhyme ran through his head Ho was strongly attracted by Sybil Brandon but at the same time he still felt that he ought to make an effort to win Joe back It seemed so unmanly to relinquish her without a struggle just because she said she did not love him It could not be true for they had loved each other so long When Ronald looked out of the window of his room in the hotel on the morning after missus Wyndham s dinner the snow was falling as it can only fall in Boston The great houses opposite were almost hidden from view by the soft fluttering flakes and below in the broad street the horse cars moved slowly along like immense white turtles ploughing their way through deep white sand The sound of the bells was muffled as it came up and the scraping of the Irishmen s heavy spades on the pavement before the hotel followed by the regular fall of the great shovels full on the heap as they stacked the snow sounded like the digging of a gigantic grave Ronald felt that his spirits were depressed He watched the drifting storm for a few minutes and then turned away and looked for a novel in his bag and filled a pipe with some English tobacco he had jealously guarded from the lynx eyed custom house men in New York and then sat down with a sigh before his small coal fire and prepared to pass the morning in solitude But Ronald was not fond of reading and at the end of half an hour he threw his book and his pipe aside and stretched his long limbs Then he rose and went to the window again with an expression of utter weariness such as only an Englishman can put on when he is thoroughly bored The snow was falling as thickly as ever and the turtle backed horse cars crawled by through the drifts more and more slowly Ronald turned away with an impatient ejaculation and made up his mind that he would go and see Joe at once He wrapped himself carefully in a huge ulster overcoat and went out Joe was sitting alone in the drawing room curled up in an old fashioned arm chair by the fire with a book in her lap which she was not reading She had asked her aunt for something about politics and Miss Schenectady had given her the Life of Rufus Choate in two large black volumes The book was interesting but in Joe s mind it was but a step from the speeches and doings of the great and brilliant lawyer senator to the speeches and doings of John Harrington And so after a while the book dropped upon her knee and she leaned far back in the chair her great brown eyes staring dreamily at the glowing coals I was so awfully lonely said Ronald sitting down beside her that I came here You do not mind Joe do you Mind No I am very glad It must be dreadfully lonely for you at the hotel What have you been doing with yourself Oh trying to read And then I was thinking about you That is not much of an occupation See how industrious I am I have been reading the Life and Writings of Rufus Choate I am getting to be a complete Bostonian Have you read it all I never heard of him Who was he He was an extremely clever man He must have been very nice and his speeches are splendid You ought to read them Joe you are going to be a regular blue stocking The idea of spending your time in reading such stuff Why it would be almost better to read the parliamentary reports in the Times Just fancy Ronald laughed at the idea of any human being descending to such drudgery Don t be silly Ronald You do not know anything about it said Joe Oh it is of no use discussing the question answered Ronald You young women are growing altogether too clever with your politics and your philosophy and your culture I hate America If you really knew anything about it you would like it very much Besides you have no right to say you hate it The people here have been very good to you already You ought not to abuse them No not the people But just look at that snow storm Joe and tell me whether America is a place for human beings to live in It is much prettier than a Scotch mist and ever so much clearer than a fog in London retorted Joe But there is nothing for a fellow to do on a day like this said Ronald sulkily Nothing but to come and see his cousin and abuse everything to her and try to make her as discontented as himself said Joe mimicking his tone If I thought you liked me to come and see you began Ronald Well It would be different you know I like you when you are nice and good tempered said Joe But when you are bored you are simply well you are dreadful Joe raised her eyebrows and tapped with her fingers on the arm of the chair Do you think I can ever be bored when I come to see you Joe asked Ronald changing his tone You act as if you were precisely You know people who are bored are generally bores themselves Thanks said Ronald How kind you are Do say something nice Ronald You have done nothing but find fault since you came Have you heard from home No There has not been time yet Why do you ask Because I thought you might say something less disagreeable about home than you seem able to say about things here said Joe tartly You do not want me this morning I will go away again said Ronald with a gloomy frown He rose to his feet as though about to take his leave Oh don t go Ronald He paused Besides added Joe Sybil will be here in a little while You need not offer me Miss Brandon as an inducement to stay with you Joe if you really want me Twenty Miss Brandons would not make any difference Really said Joe smiling You are a dear good boy Ronald when you are nice she added presently Sit down again Ronald went back to his seat beside her and they were both silent for a while Joe repented a little for she thought she had been teasing him and she reflected that she ought to be doing her best to make him happy Joe do not you think it would be very pleasant to be always like this said Ronald after a time How like this Together said Ronald softly and a gentle look came into his handsome face as he looked up at his cousin Together only in our own home Joe did not answer but the color came to her cheeks and she looked annoyed She had hoped that the matter was settled forever for it seemed so easy for her Ronald misinterpreted the blush For the moment the old conviction came back to him that she was to be his wife and if it was not exactly love that he felt it was a satisfaction almost great enough to take its place Would it not said he presently Please do not talk about it Ronald What is the use I have said all there is to say I am sure But I have not he answered insisting Please Joe dearest think about it seriously Think what a cruel thing it is you are doing His voice was very tender but he was perfectly calm there was not the slightest vibration of passion in the tones Joe did not wholly understand she only knew that he was not satisfied with the first explanation she had given him and that she felt sorry for him but was incapable of changing her decision Must I go over it all again she asked piteously Did I not make it clear to you Ronald Oh don t talk about it You have no heart Joe said Ronald hotly You don t know what you make me suffer You don t know that this sort of thing is enough to wreck a man s existence altogether You don t know what you are doing because you have no heart not the least bit of one Do not say that please do not Joe entreated looking at him with imploring eyes for his words hurt her Then suddenly the tears came in a quick hot gush and she hid her face in her hands Oh Ronald Ronald it is you who do not know she sobbed Ronald did not quite know what to do he never did when Joe cried but fortunately that disaster had not occurred often since he was very small He was angry with himself for having disturbed and hurt her but he did not know what to do most probably because he did not really love her Joe he said looking at her in some embarrassment don t Then he rose and rather timidly laid a hand on her shoulder But she shrank from him with a petulant motion and the tears trickled through her small white hands and fell upon her dark dress and on the Life of Rufus Choate Joe dear Ronald began again And then in great uncertainty of mind he went and looked out of the window Presently he came back and stood before her once more I am awfully sorry I said it Joe Please forgive me You don t often cry you know and so He hesitated Joe looked up at him with a smile through her tears beautiful as a rose just wet with a summer shower And so you did not think I could she said She dried her eyes quickly and rose to her feet It is very silly of me I know but I cannot help it in the least said she turning from him in pretense of arranging the knickknacks on the mantel Of course you cannot help it Joe dear as if you had not a perfect right to cry if you like I am such a brute I know Come and look at the snow said Joe taking his hand and leading him to the window Enormous Irishmen in pilot coats comforters and india rubber boots armed with broad wooden spades were struggling to keep the drifts from the pavement Joe and Ronald stood and watched them idly absorbed in their own thoughts Presently a booby sleigh drawn by a pair of strong black horses floundered up the hill and stopped at the door Oh Ronald there is Sybil and she will see I have been crying You must amuse her and I will come back in a few minutes She turned and fled leaving Ronald at the window A footman sprang to the ground and nearly lost his footing in the snow as he opened a large umbrella and rang the bell In a moment Sybil was out of the sleigh and at the door of the house she could not sit still till it was opened although the flakes were falling as thickly as ever Oh she exclaimed as she entered the room and was met by Ronald I thought Joe was here There was color in her face and she took Ronald s hand cordially He blushed to the eyes and stammered Miss Thorn is she indeed she will be back in a moment How do you do Dreadful weather is not it Oh it is only a snowstorm said Sybil brushing a few flakes from her furs as she came near the fire We do not mind it at all here But of course you never have snow in England Not like this certainly said Ronald Let me help you he added as Sybil began to remove her cloak It was a very sudden change of company for Ronald five minutes ago he was trying very clumsily and hopelessly to console Joe Thorn in her tears feeling angry enough with himself all the while for having caused them Now he was face to face with Sybil Brandon the most beautiful woman he remembered to have seen and she smiled at him as he took her heavy cloak from her shoulders and the touch of the fur sent a thrill to his heart and the blood to his cheeks I must say he remarked depositing the things on a sofa you are very courageous to come out even though you are used to it You have come yourself said Sybil laughing a little You told me last night that you did not come here every day Oh I told my cousin I had come because I was so lonely at the hotel It is amazingly dull to sit all day in a close room reading stupid novels I should think it would be Have you nothing else to do Nothing in the wide world said Ronald with a smile What should I do here in a strange place where I know so few people I suppose there is not much for a man to do unless he is in business Every one here is in some kind of business you know so they are never bored Ronald wished he could say the right thing to reestablish the half intimacy he had felt when talking to Sybil the night before But it was not easy to get back to the same point There was an interval of hours between yesterday and to day and there was Joe I read novels to pass the time he said and because they are sometimes so like one s own life But when they are not they bore me Sybil was fond of reading and she was especially fond of fiction not because she cared for sensational interests but because she was naturally contemplative and it interested her to read about the human nature of the present rather than to learn what any individual historian thought of the human nature of the past What kind of novels do you like best she asked sitting down to pass the time with Ronald until Josephine should make her appearance I like love stories best said Ronald Oh of course said Sybil gravely so do I But what kind do you like best The sad ones or those that end well I like them to end well said Ronald because the best ones never do you know Never There was something in Sybil s tone that made Ronald look quickly at her She said the word as though she too had something to regret Not in my experience answered Surbiton with the decision of a man past loving or being loved How dreadfully gloomy One would think you had done with life mister Surbiton said Sybil laughing Sometimes I think so Miss Brandon answered Ronald in solemn tones I suppose we all think it would be nice to die sometimes But then the next morning things look so much brighter I think they often look much brighter in the evening said Ronald thinking of the night before I am sure something disagreeable has happened to you to day mister Surbiton said Sybil looking at him Ronald looked into her eyes as though to see if there were any sympathy there Yes something disagreeable has happened to me he answered slowly Something very disagreeable and painful I am sorry said Sybil simply But her voice sounded very kind and comforting That is why I say that love stories always end badly in real life said Ronald But I suppose I ought not to complain It was not until he had thought over this speech some minutes later that he realized that in a few words he had told Sybil the main part of his troubles He never guessed that she was so far in Joe s confidence as to have heard the whole story before But Sybil was silent and thoughtful Love is such an uncertain thing she began after a pause and it chanced that at that very moment Joe opened the door and entered the room She caught the sentence So you are instructing my cousin she said to Sybil laughing I approve of the way you spend your time my children No one would have believed that twenty minutes earlier Joe had been in tears She was as fresh and as gay as ever and Ronald said to himself that she most certainly had no heart but that Sybil had a great deal he was sure of it from the tone of her voice What is the news about the election Sybil she asked Of course you know all about it at the Wyndhams My dear the family politics are in a state of confusion that is simply too delightful said Sybil You know it is said that Ira C Calvin has refused to be a candidate and the Republicans mean to put in mister Jobbins in his place who is such a popular man and so good and benevolent quite a philanthropist Does it make very much difference asked Joe anxiously I wish I understood all about it but the local names are so hard to learn I thought you had been learning them all the morning in Choate put in Ronald who perceived that the conversation was to be about Harrington It does make a difference said Sybil not noticing Ronald s remark because Jobbins is much more popular than Calvin and they say he is a friend of Patrick Ballymolloy who will win the election for either side he favors Who is this Irishman inquired Ronald He is the chief Irishman said Sybil laughing and I cannot describe him any better He has twenty votes with him and as things stand he always carries whichever point he favors But mister Wyndham says he is glad he is not in the Legislature because it would drive him out of his mind to decide on which side to vote though he is a good Republican you know Of course he could vote for mister Harrington in spite of that said Joe confidently Anybody would who knows him I am sure But when is the election to come off They say it is to begin to day said Sybil We shall never hear anything unless we go to missus Wyndham s said Joe Aunt Zoe is awfully clever and that but she never knows in the least what is going on She says she does not understand politics If you were a Bostonian mister Surbiton said Sybil you would get into the State House and hear the earliest news I will do anything in the world to oblige you said Ronald gravely if you will only explain a little Oh no It is quite impossible Come with me both of you and we will get some lunch at the Wyndhams and hear all about it by telephone Very well said Joe One moment while I get my things She left the room Ronald and Sybil were again alone together You were saying when my cousin came in that love was a very uncertain thing suggested Ronald rather timidly Was I said Sybil standing before the mirror above the mantelpiece and touching her hat first on one side and then on the other Yes answered Ronald watching her Do you know I have often thought so too Yes I think it would be something different if it were quite certain Perhaps it would be something much less interesting but much better I think you are a little confused mister Surbiton said Sybil and as she smiled Ronald could see her face reflected in the mirror I yes that is I dare say I am said he hesitatingly But I know exactly what I mean But do you know exactly what you want she asked with a laugh Yes indeed said he confidently But I do not believe I shall ever get it Then that is the disagreeable and painful thing you referred to as having happened this morning I suppose remarked Sybil calmly as she turned to take up her cloak which lay on the sofa Ronald blushed scarlet Well yes he said forgetting in his embarrassment to help her It is so heavy said Sybil Thanks Do you know that you have been making confidences to me mister Surbiton she asked turning and facing him with a half amused half serious look in her blue eyes I am afraid I have he answered after a short pause You must think I am very foolish Never mind she said gravely They are safe with me Thanks said Ronald in a low voice Josephine entered the room clad in many furs and a few minutes later all three were on their way to missus Wyndham s the big booby sleigh rocking and leaping and ploughing in the heavy dry snow CHAPTER XV Pocock Vancouver was also abroad in the snowstorm He would not in any case have stayed at home on account of the weather but on this particular morning he had very urgent business with a gentleman who like Lamb rose with the lark though he did not go to bed with the chickens There are no larks in Boston but the scream of the locomotives answers nearly as well Vancouver accordingly had himself driven at an early hour to a certain house not situated in the West End but of stone quite as brown and having a bay window as prominent as any sixteen foot front on Beacon Street those advantages however did not prevent mister Vancouver from wearing an expression of fastidious scorn as he mounted the steps and pulled the polished German silver handle of the door bell The curl on his lip gave way to a smile of joyous cordiality as he was ushered into the presence of the owner of the house Indeed I m glad to see you mister Vancouver said his host whose extremely Celtic appearance was not belied by unctuous modulation of his voice and the pleasant roll of his softly aspirated consonants This great man was no other than mister Patrick Ballymolloy He received Vancouver in his study which was handsomely furnished with bright green wall paper a sideboard on which stood a number of decanters and glasses several leather easy chairs and a green china spittoon In personal appearance mister Patrick Ballymolloy was vastly more striking than attractive He was both corpulent and truculent and his hands and feet were of a size and thickness calculated to crush a paving stone at a step or to fell an ox at a blow The nails of his fingers were of a hue which is made artificially fashionable in eastern countries but which excites prejudice in western civilization from an undue display of real estate A neck which the Minotaur might have justly envied surmounted the thickness and roundness of mister Ballymolloy s shoulders and supported a head more remarkable for the immense cavity of the mouth and for a quantity of highly pomaded sandy hair than for any intellectuality of the brows or high bred fineness of the nose mister Ballymolloy s nose was nevertheless an astonishing feature and at a distance called vividly to mind the effect of one of those great glass bottles of reddened water behind which apothecaries of all degrees put a lamp at dusk in order that their light may the better shine in the darkness It was one of the most surprising feats of nature s alchemy that a liquid so brown as that contained in the decanters on Patrick s sideboard should be able to produce and maintain anything so supernaturally red as Patrick s nose mister Ballymolloy was clad in a beautiful suit of shiny black broadcloth and the front of his coat was irregularly but richly adorned with a profusion of grease spots of all sizes A delicate suggestive mezzotint shaded the edges of his collar and cuffs and from his heavy gold watch chain depended a malachite seal of unusual greenness and brilliancy Vancouver took the gigantic outstretched hand of his host in his delicate fingers with an air of cordiality which if not genuine was very well assumed I m glad to see you sir said the Irishman again Thanks said Vancouver and I am fortunate in finding you at home mister Ballymolloy smiled and pushed one of his leather easy chairs towards the fire Both men sat down I suppose you are pretty busy over this election mister Ballymolloy said Vancouver blandly Now that s just it mister Vancouver replied the Irishman That s just exactly what s the matter with me for indeed I am very busy and that s the truth Just so mister Ballymolloy Especially since the change last night I remember what a good friend you have always been to mister Jobbins Well as you say mister Vancouver I have been thinking that I and mister Jobbins are pretty good friends and that s just about what it is I think Yes I remember that on more than one occasion you and he have acted together in the affairs of the state said Vancouver thoughtfully Ah but it s the soul of him that I like answered mister Ballymolloy very sweetly He has such a beautiful soul mister Jobbins it does me good and indeed it does mister Vancouver As you say sir a man full of broad human sympathies Nevertheless I feel sure that on the present occasion your political interests will lead you to follow the promptings of duty and to vote in favor of the Democratic candidate I wish you and I did not differ in politics mister Ballymolloy And indeed there is not so very much difference if it comes to that mister Vancouver replied Patrick in conciliating tones But it s just what I have been thinking that I will vote for mister Harrington It s a matter of principle with me mister Vancouver and that s it exactly And where should we all be without principles mister Ballymolloy Indeed I may say that the importance of principles in political matters is very great And it s just the greatest pity in the world that every one has not principles like you mister Vancouver I m speaking the truth now According to mister Patrick Ballymolloy s view of destiny it was the truth and nothing but the truth He knew Vancouver of old and Vancouver knew him You flatter me sir said Pocock affecting a pleased smile To tell the truth there is a little matter I wanted to speak to you about if you can spare me half an hour Indeed I m most entirely delighted to be at your service mister Vancouver and I m glad you came so early in the morning The fact is mister Ballymolloy we are thinking of making an extension on one of our lines a small matter but of importance to us I guess it must be the branch of the Pocahontas and Dead Man s Valley you ll be speaking of mister Vancouver said the Irishman with sudden and cheerful interest Really mister Ballymolloy you are a man of the most surprising quickness It is a real pleasure to talk with you on such matters I have no doubt you understand the whole question thoroughly Well it s of no use at all to say I know nothing about it because I have heard it mentioned and that s the plain truth mister Vancouver And it will take a deal of rail too and that s another thing And where do you think of getting the iron from mister Vancouver Well I had hoped mister Ballmolly said Vancouver with some affected hesitation that as an old friend we might be able to manage matters with you But of course this is entirely unofficial and between ourselves mister Ballymolloy nodded with something very like a wink of one bloodshot eye He knew what he was about And when will you be thinking of beginning the work mister Vancouver he inquired after a short pause That is just the question or rather perhaps I should say the difficulty We do not expect to begin work for a year or so And surely that makes no difference then at all returned Patrick For the longer the time the easier it will be for me to accommodate you Ah but you see mister Ballymolloy it may be that in a year s time these new fangled ideas about free trade may be law and it may be much cheaper for us to get our rails from England as mister Vanderbilt did three or four years ago when he was in such a hurry you remember And indeed I remember it very well mister Vancouver Just so Now you see mister Ballymolloy I am speaking to you entirely as a friend though I hope I may before long bring about an official agreement But you see the difficulty of making a contract a year ahead when a party of Democratic senators and Congressmen may by that time have upset the duty on steel rails don t you And indeed I see it as plain as day mister Vancouver And that s why I was saying I wished every one had such principles as yourself and I m telling you no lie when I say it again Verily mister Ballymolloy was a truthful person Very well Now do not you think mister Ballymolloy that all this talk about free trade is great nonsense And surely it will be the ruin of the whole country mister Vancouver Besides free trade has nothing to do with Democratic principles has it You see here am I the best Republican in Massachusetts and here are you the best Democrat in the country and we both agree in saying that it is great nonsense to leave iron unprotected Ah it s the principle of you I like mister Vancouver exclaimed Ballymolloy in great admiration It s your principles are beautiful just Very good sir Now of course you are going to vote for mister Harrington to day or to morrow or whenever the election is to be Don t you think yon might say something to him that would be of some use I believe he is very uncertain about protection you see I think you could persuade him somehow Well now mister Vancouver it s the truth when I tell you I was just thinking of speaking to him about it just a little before I went up to the State House And indeed I ll be going to him immediately I think it is the wisest plan said Vancouver rising to go and we will speak about the contract next week when all this election business is over Ah and indeed I hope it will be soon sir said Ballymolloy But you ll not think of going out again in the snow without taking a drop of something will you mister Vancouver He went to the sideboard and poured out two stiff doses of the amber liquid Since you are so kind said Vancouver graciously taking the proffered glass He knew better than to refuse to drink over a bargain Well here goes he said And luck to yourself mister Vancouver said Ballymolloy I think you can persuade him somehow said Vancouver as his host opened the street door for him to go out And indeed I think so too said Ballymolloy Then he went back to his study and poured out a second glass of whiskey And if I cannot persuade him he continued in soliloquy why then it will just be old Jobbins who will be senator and that s the plain truth Vancouver went away with a light heart and the frank smile on his delicate features was most pleasant to see He knew John Harrington well and he was certain that mister Ballymolloy s proposal would rouse the honest wrath of the man he detested Half an hour later mister Ballymolloy entered Harrington s room in Charles Street John was seated at the table fully dressed and writing letters He offered his visitor a seat So the election is coming on right away mister Harrington began Patrick making himself comfortable and lighting one of John s cigars So I hear mister Ballymolloy answered John with a pleasant smile I hope I may count on you in spite of what you said yesterday These are the times when men must keep together Now mister Harrington you ll not believe that I could go to the House and vote against my own party surely will you now said Patrick But there was a tinge of irony in his soft tones He knew that Vancouver could make him great and advantageous business transactions and he treated him accordingly John Harrington was on the other hand a mere candidate for his twenty votes he could make John senator if he chose or defeat him if he preferred it and he accordingly behaved to John with an air of benevolent superiority I trust you would do no such thing mister Ballymolloy said John gravely Without advocating myself as in any way fit for the honors of the Senate I can say that it is of the utmost importance that we should have as many Democrats in Congress as possible in the Senate as well as in the House Surely you don t think I doubt that mister Harrington And indeed the Senate is pretty well Democratic as it is Yes said John smiling but the more the better I should think It is a very different matter from the local legislature where changes may often do good Indeed and it is mister Harrington And will you please to tell me what you will do about free trade when you re in the Senate sir I am afraid I cannot tell you anything that I did not tell you yesterday mister Ballymolloy I am a tariff reform man It is a great Democratic movement and I should be bound to support it even if I were not myself so thorough a believer in it as I am Now see here mister Harrington it s the gospel truth I m telling you when I say you re mistaken Here are plenty of us Democrats who don t want the least little bit of free trade I m in the iron business mister Harrington and you won t be after thinking me such an all powerful galoot as to cut my own nose off will you Well not exactly said John who was used to many peculiarities of language in his visitors But of course iron will be the thing last on the tariff I am of opinion that it is necessary to put enough tax on iron to protect home producers at the time of greatest depression That is fair is not it I dare say you may think so mister Harrington said Ballymolloy knocking the ashes from his cigar But you are not an iron man now are you Certainly not said John But I have studied the question and I know its importance In a reformation of the tariff iron would be one of the things most carefully provided for Oh I know all that said Ballymolloy somewhat roughly and there s not much you can tell me about tariff reform that I don t know neither And when you have reformed other things you ll be for reforming iron too just to keep your hands in And indeed I ve no objection whatever to your reforming everything you like so long as you don t interfere with me and mine But I don t trust the principles of the thing sir I don t trust them the least little bit and for me I would rather there were not to be any reforming at all except for the Chinamen and I don t care much for them neither and that s a fact Very good mister Ballymolloy Every man has a right to his free opinion But we stand on the reform platform for there is no country in the world where reform is more needed than it is here I can only repeat that the interests of the iron trade stand high with the Democratic party and that it is highly improbable that any law will interfere with iron for many years I cannot say more than that and yet stick to facts Always stick to facts mister Harrington You will find the truth a very important thing indeed and good principles too in dealing with plain spoken men like myself sir Stick to the truth mister Harrington forever and ever I propose to mister Ballymolloy answered John internally amused at the solemn manner of his interlocutor And then I will put the matter to you mister Harrington and indeed it s a plain matter too and not the least taste of dishonesty in it at all I ve been thinking I d make you senator if you ll agree to go against free trade and that s just what I ll do and no more It is impossible for me to make such a bargain mister Ballymolloy After your exposition of the importance of truth I am surprised that you should expect me to belie my whole political life As I have told you I am prepared to support laws to protect iron as much as is necessary Free trade nowadays does not mean cutting away all duties it means a proper adjustment of them to the requirements of our commerce A proper adjustment of duties could not possibly be interpreted to mean any injury to the iron trade You may rely upon that at all events Oh and I m sure I can said Ballymolloy incredulously and he grew if possible redder in the face than nature and the action of alcohol had made him And I m not only sure of it but I ll swear it s gospel truth But then you know I m of opinion that by the time you ve done reforming the other things the reformed gentlemen won t like it and then they ll just turn round and eat you up unless you reform us too and that just means the ruin of us Come now mister Ballymolloy that is exaggeration said John If you will listen to me for a moment I haven t got the time sir and that s all about it If you ll protect our interests and promise to do it you ll be senator The election is coming on mister Harrington and I d be sorry to see you thrown out mister Ballymolloy I had sincerely hoped that you would support me in this matter but I must tell you once more that I think you are unreasonable I vouch for the sufficient protection of your interests because it is the belief of our party that they need protection But it is not necessary for you to have an anti reform senator for that purpose in the first place and secondly the offer of a seat in the Senate would never induce me to change my mind nor to turn round and deny everything that I have said and written on the subject Then that is your last word of all mister Harrington said Ballymolloy heaving his heavy body out of the easy chair But his voice which had sounded somewhat irate during the discussion again rolled out in mellifluous tones Yes mister Ballymolloy that is all I have to say And indeed it s not so very bad at all said Patrick You see I just wanted to see how far you were likely to go because though I m a good Democrat sir I m against free trade in the main points and that s just the truth But if you say you will stand up for iron right through and use your best judgment why I guess you ll have to be senator after all It s a great position mister Harrington and I hope you ll do honor to it I hope so indeed said John Can I offer you a glass of wine or anything else mister Ballymolloy Indeed and it s dirty weather too said Patrick Thank you I ll take a little whiskey John poured out a glass You won t let me drink alone mister Harrington inquired Patrick holding his tumbler in his hand To oblige him after the manner of the country John poured out a small glass of sherry and put his lips to it Ballymolloy drained the whiskey to the last drop You were not really thinking I would vote for mister Jobbins were you now mister Harrington he asked with a sly look on his red face I always hope that the men of my party are to be relied upon mister Ballymolloy said John smiling politely Very well they are to be relied upon sir We are every man of us to the last drop of Christian blood in our blessed bodies said Patrick with a gush of patriotic enthusiasm at the same time holding out his heavy hand Then he took his leave You had better have said to the last drop of Bourbon whiskey in the blessed bottle said John to himself when his visitor was gone Then he sat down for a while to think over the situation That man will vote against me yet he thought He was astonished to find himself nervous and excited for the first time in his life With characteristic determination he went back to his desk and continued the letter which the visit of the Irish elector had interrupted Meanwhile mister Patrick Ballymolloy was driven to the house of the Republican candidate mister Jobbing CHAPTER XVI Sybil was right when she said the family politics at the Wyndhams were disturbed Indeed the disturbance was so great that missus Wyndham was dressed and down stairs before twelve o clock which had never before occurred in the memory of the oldest servant It is too perfectly exciting my dears she exclaimed as Joe and Sybil entered the room followed at a respectful distance by Ronald I can t stand it one minute longer How do you do mister Surbiton What is the latest news asked Sybil I have not heard anything for ever so long Sam has gone round to see perhaps he will be back soon I do wish we had tickers here in the house as they do in New York it is such fun watching when anything is going on She walked about the room as she talked touching a book on one table and a photograph on another in a state of great excitement Ronald watched her in some surprise it seemed odd to him that any one should take so much interest in a mere election Joe and Sybil who knew her better made themselves at home It appeared that although Sam had gone to make inquiries it was very improbable that anything would be known until late in the afternoon There was to be a contest of some sort but whether it would end in a single day or whether Ballymolloy and his men intended to prolong the struggle for their own ends remained to be seen Meanwhile missus Wyndham walked about her drawing room descanting upon the iniquities of political life with an animation that delighted Joe and amused Ronald Well there is nothing for it you see she said at last Sam evidently does not mean to come home and you must just stay here and have some lunch until he does The three agreed nothing loath to enjoying one another s company There is nothing like a day spent together in waiting for an event to bring out the characteristics of individuals missus Wyndham fretted and talked and fretted again Joe grew silent pale and anxious as the morning passed while Sybil and Ronald seemed to enjoy themselves extremely and talked without ceasing Outside the snow fell thick and fast as ever and the drifts rose higher and higher I do wish Sam would come back exclaimed missus Wyndham at last as she threw herself into an easy chair and looked at the clock But Sam did not come nevertheless and Joe sat quietly by the fire wishing she were alone and yet unwilling to leave the house where she hoped to have the earliest information The two who seemed rapidly growing indifferent to the issue of the election were Sybil and Ronald who sat together with a huge portfolio of photographs and sketches between them laughing and talking pleasantly enough Joe did not hear a word of their conversation and missus Wyndham paid little attention to it though her practiced ears could have heard it all if need be while she herself was profoundly occupied with some one else The four had a somewhat dreary meal together and Ronald was told to go into Sam s study and smoke if he liked while missus Wyndham led Joe and Sybil away to look at a quantity of new things that had just come from Paris Ronald did as he was bid and settled himself for an hour with a plentiful supply of newspapers and railroad literature It was past three o clock when Sam Wyndham entered the room his face wet with the snowflakes and red with excitement Hollo he exclaimed seeing Ronald comfortably ensconced in his favorite easy chair How are you Excuse me said Ronald rising quickly They told me to come in here after lunch and so I was waiting until I was sent for or told to come out Very glad to see you any way said Sam cordially Well I have been to hear about an election a friend of ours got put up for senator But I don t expect that interests you much On the contrary said Ronald I have heard it so much talked of that I am as much interested as anybody Is it all over Oh yes and a pretty queer business it was Well our friend is not elected anyway Has mister Harrington been defeated asked Ronald quickly It s my belief he has been sold said Sam But as I am a Republican myself and a friend of Jobbins more or less I don t suppose I feel so very bad about it after all But I don t know how my wife will take it I m sure said Sam presently I expect we had better go and tell her right off Then he has really lost the election inquired Ronald who was not altogether sorry to hear it Why yes as I say Jobbins is senator now I should not wonder if Harrington were a good deal cut up Come along with me now and we will tell the ladies The three ladies were in the drawing room missus Wyndham and Joe sprang to their feet as Sam and Ronald entered but Sybil remained seated and merely looked up inquiringly Oh now Sam cried missus Wyndham in great excitement tell us all about it right away We are dying to know Joe came close to missus Wyndham her face very pale and her teeth clenched in her great anxiety Sam threw back the lapels of his coat put his thumbs in the armholes of his broad waistcoat and turned his head slightly on one side Well he said slowly John s wiped out Do you mean to say he has lost the election cried missus Wyndham Yes he s lost it Jobbins is senator Sam you are perfectly horrid exclaimed his spouse in deepest vexation Josephine Thorn spoke no word but turned away and went alone to the window She was deathly pale and she trembled from head to foot as she clutched the heavy curtain with her small white fingers Poor mister Harrington said Sybil thoughtfully I am dreadfully sorry mister and missus Wyndham and Ronald moved toward the fire where Sybil was sitting No one spoke for a few seconds At last missus Wyndham broke out Sam it s a perfect shame she said I think all those people ought to be locked up for bribery I am certain it was all done by some horrid stealing or something now was not it I don t know about that my dear said Sam reflectively You see they generally vote fair enough in these things Well may be that fellow Ballymolloy has made something out of it He s a pretty bad sort of a scamp any way I expect Sorry you are so put out about it but Jobbins is not so very bad after all Sybil suddenly missed Joe from the group and looked across to where she stood by the window A glance told her that something was wrong and she rose from her seat and went to her friend The sight of Josephine s pale face frightened her Joe dear she said affectionately you are ill come to my room Sybil put one arm round her waist and quietly led her away Ronald had watched the little scene from a distance but mister and missus Wyndham continued to discuss the result of the election It is exactly like you Sam to be talking in that way instead of telling me just how it happened said missus Wyndham And then to say it is not so very bad after all Oh I will tell you all about it right away my dear if you ll only give me a little time You re always in such an immense fever about everything that it s perfectly impossible to get along Are you going to begin said missus Wyndham half vexed with her husband s deliberate indifference Well as near as I can make out it was generally thought at the start that John had a pretty good show The Senate elected him right away by a majority of four which was so much to the good for of course his friends reckoned on getting him in if the Senate hadn t elected him by the bigger majority of the House swamping the Senate in the General Court But it s gone just the other way Whatever is the General Court asked Ronald much puzzled Oh the General Court is when the House and the Senate meet together next day to formally declare a senator elected if they have both chosen the same man or to elect one by a general majority if they haven t Yes that is it added missus Wyndham to Ronald and then addressing her husband Do go on Sam you ve not told us anything yet Well as I said the Senate elected John Harrington by a majority of four The House took a long time getting to work and then there was some mistake about the first vote so they had to take a second And when that was done Jobbins actually had a majority of eighteen So John s beaten and Jobbins will be senator anyhow and you must just make the best you can out of it But I thought you said when the House and the Senate did not agree the General Court met next day and elected a senator asked Ronald again and in that case mister Harrington is not really beaten yet Well theoretically he s not said Sam because of course Jobbins is not actually senator until he has been elected by the General Court but the majority for him in the House was so surprisingly large and the majority for John so small in the Senate and the House is so much larger than the Senate that the vote to morrow is a dead sure thing and Jobbins is just as much senator as if he were sitting in Washington I suppose you will expect me to have mister Jobbins to dinner now I think the whole business is perfectly mean Don t blame me my dear said Sam calmly I did not create the Massachusetts Legislature and I did not found the State House nor discover America nor any of these things And after all Jobbins is a very respectable man and belongs to our own party while Harrington does not When I set up creating I ll make a note of one or two points and I ll see that John is properly attended to You need not be silly Sam said missus Wyndham What has become of those girls They went out of the room some time ago said Ronald who had been listening with much amusement to the description of the election He was never quite sure whether people could be serious when they talked such peculiar language and he observed with surprise that mister and missus Wyndham talked to each other in phrases very different from those they used in addressing himself Sybil had led Joe away to her room She did not guess the cause of Joe s faintness but supposed it to be a momentary indisposition amenable to the effects of eau de cologne She made her lie upon the great cretonne sofa moistening her forehead and giving her a bottle of salts to smell But Joe who had never been ill in her life recovered her strength in a few minutes and regaining her feet began to walk about the room What do you think it was Joe dear asked Sybil watching her Oh it was nothing Perhaps the room was hot and I was tired I thought you looked tired all the morning said Sybil and just when I looked at you I thought you were going to faint You were as pale as death and you seemed holding yourself up by the curtains Did I said Joe trying to laugh How silly of me I felt faint for a moment that was all I think I will go home Yes dear but stay a few minutes longer and rest yourself I will order a carriage it is still snowing hard Sybil left the room Once alone Joe threw herself upon the sofa again She would rather have died than have told any one even Sybil Brandon that it was no sickness she felt but only a great and overwhelming disappointment for the man she loved Her love was doubly hers her very own in that it was fast locked in her own heart beyond the reach of any human being to know Of all that came and went about her and flattered her and strove for her graces not one suspected that she loved a man in their very midst passionately fervently with all the strength she had Ronald s suspicions were too vague and too much the result of a preconceived idea to represent anything like a certainty to himself and he had not mentioned them to her If anything can determine the passion of love in a woman it is the great flood of sympathy that overflows her heart when the man she loves is hurt or overcome in a great cause When for a little moment that which she thinks strongest and bravest and most manly is struck down and wounded and brought low her love rises up and is strong within her and makes her more noble in the devotion of perfect gentleness than a man can ever be Oh if only he could have won Joe said again and again to herself If only he could have won I would have given anything Sybil came back in a few moments and saw Joe lying down still white and apparently far from well She knelt upon the floor by her side and taking her hands looked affectionately into her face There is something the matter she said I know you cannot deceive me there is something serious the matter Will you tell me Joe Can I do anything at all to help you Joe smiled faintly grateful for the sympathy and for the gentle words of her friend No Sybil dear It is nothing there is nothing you can do Thanks dearest I shall be very well in a little while It is nothing really Is the carriage there A few minutes later Joe and Ronald were again at Miss Schenectady s house Joe recovered her self control on the way and asked Ronald to come in an invitation which he cheerfully accepted John Harrington had spent the day in a state of anxiety which was new to him Enthusiastic by nature he was calm by habit and he was surprised to find his hand unsteady and his brain not capable of the intense application he could usually command Ten minutes after the results of the election were known at the State House he received a note from a friend informing him with expressions of hearty sympathy how the day had gone The strong physical sense of pain which accompanies all great disappointments took hold of him and he fell back in his seat and closed his eyes his teeth set and his face pale with the suffering while his broad hands convulsively grasped the heavy oaken arms of his chair It may be that this same bodily agony which is of itself but the gross reflection in our material selves of what the soul is bearing is a wholesome provision that draws our finer senses away from looking at what might blind them altogether There are times when a man would go mad if his mind were not detached from its sorrow by the quick sharp beating of his bodily heart and by the keen torture of the physical body that is like the thrusting of a red hot knife between breastbone and midriff The expression self control is daily in the blatant mouths of preachers and moralists the very cant of emptiness and folly It means nothing nor can any play of words or cunning twisting of conception ever give it meaning For the self is the divine imperishable portion of the eternal God which is in man I may control my limbs and the strength that is in them and I may force under the appetites and passions of this mortal body but I cannot myself for it is myself that controls being of nature godlike and stronger than all which is material And although for an infinitely brief space of time I myself may inhabit and give life to this handful of most changeable atoms I have it in my supreme power and choice to make them act according to my pleasure If I become enamored of the body and its ways and of the subtleties of a fleeting bodily intelligence I have forgotten to control those things and having forgotten that I have free will given me from heaven to rule what is mine I am no longer a man but a beast But while I who am an immortal soul command the perishable engine in which I dwell I am in truth a man For the soul is of God and forever whereas the body is a thing of to day that vanishes into dust to morrow but the two together are the living man And thus it is that God is made man in us every day All that which we know by our senses is but an illusion What is true of its own nature we can neither see nor hear nor feel nor taste It is a matter of time and nothing more and whatever palpable thing a man can name will inevitably be dissolved into its constituent parts that these may again agglomerate into a new illusion for future ages But that which is subject to no change nor disintegration nor reconstruction is the immortal truth to attain to a knowledge and understanding of which is to be saved from the endless shifting of the material and illusory universe John Harrington lay in his chair alone in his rooms while the snow whirled against the windows outside and made little drifts on the sills The fire had gone out and the bitter storm beat against the casements and howled in the chimney and the dusk of the night began to mingle with the thick white flakes and brought upon the solitary man a great gloom and horror of loneliness It seemed to him that his life was done and his strength gone from him He had labored in vain for years for this end and he had failed to attain it It were better to have died than to suffer the ignominy of this defeat It were better never to have lived at all than to have lived so utterly in vain One by one the struggles of the past came up to him each had seemed a triumph when he was in the glory of strength and hope The splendid aims of a higher and nobler government built by sheer truth and nobility of purpose upon the ashes and dust of present corruption the magnificent purity of the ideal State of which he had loved to dream all that he had thought of and striven after as most worthy of a true man to follow dwindled now away into a hollow and mocking image more false than hollowness itself poorer and of less substance than a juggler s show He clasped his hands over his forehead and tried to think but it was of no use Everything was vague broken crushed and shapeless Faces seemed to rise to his disturbed sight and he wondered whether he had ever known these people a ghastly weariness as of death was upon him and his arms fell heavily by his sides He groaned aloud and if in that bitter sigh he could have breathed away his existence he would have gladly done it Some one entered the room struck a match and lit the gas It was his servant or rather the joint servant of two or three of the bachelors who lived in the house a huge smooth faced colored man Oh excuthe me Mister Harrington I thought you wath out Thir There s two o them notes for you John roused himself and took the letters without a word They were both addressed in feminine handwriting The one he knew for it was from missus Wyndham The other he did not recognize He opened missus Wyndham s first DEAR mister HARRINGTON Sam and I are very much put out about it and sympathize most cordially We think you might like to come and dine this evening if you have no other invitation so I write to say we will be all alone and very glad to see you Cordially yours JANE WYNDHAM P S Don t trouble about the answer John read the note through and laid it on the table Then he turned the other missive over in his fingers and finally tore open the envelope It ran as follows MY DEAR mister HARRINGTON Please don t be surprised at my writing to you in this way I was at missus Wyndham s this afternoon and heard all about it and I must write to tell you that I am very very sorry It is too horrible to think how bad and wicked and foolish people are and how they invariably do the wrong thing I cannot tell you how sorry we all are because it is just such men as you who are most needed nowadays though of course I know nothing about politics here But I am quite sure that all of them will live to regret it and that you will win in the end Don t think it foolish of me to write because I m so angry that I can t in the least help it and I think everybody ought to Yours in sincerity JOSEPHINE THORN CHAPTER XVII John read Joe s note many times over before he quite realized what it contained It seemed at first a singular thing that she should have written to him and he did not understand it He knew her as an enthusiastic and capricious girl who had sometimes laughed at him and sometimes treated him coldly but who again had sometimes talked with him as though he were an old friend He called to mind the interest she had taken in his doings of late and how she had denounced Vancouver as his enemy and he thought of the long conversation he had had with her on the ice under the cold moonlight He thought of many a sympathetic glance she had given when he spoke of his aims and intentions of many a gentle word spoken in praise of him and which at the time he had taken merely as so much small good natured flattery such as agreeable people deal out to each other in society without any thought of evil nor any especial meaning of good All these things came back to him and he read the little note again It was a kindly word nothing more penned by a wild good hearted girl in the scorn of consequence or social propriety It was nothing but that And yet there was something more in it all something not expressed in the abbreviated words and hurriedly composed sentences but something that seemed to struggle for expression John s experience of womankind was limited for he was no lady s man and had led a life singularly lacking in woman s love or sentiment though singularly dependent on the friendship of some woman Nevertheless he knew that Joe s note breathed the essence of a sympathy wider than that of mere every day acquaintance and deeper perhaps than that of any friendship he had known He could not have explained the feeling nor reasoned upon it but he knew well enough that when he next met Joe it would be on new terms She had declared herself his friend in a way no longer mistakable for she must have followed her first impulse in writing such a note and the impulse must have been a strong one For a while he debated whether to answer the note or not almost forgetting his troubles in the tumult of new thoughts it had suggested to him A note thought he required an answer on general principles but such a note as this would be better answered in person than by any pen and paper He would call and see Joe and thank her for it But again he knew he could not see her until the next day and that seemed a long time to wait It would not have been long under ordinary circumstances but in this case it seemed to him an unreasonable delay He sat down and took a pen in his fingers Dear Miss Thorn he began and stopped In America it is more formal to begin without the preliminary my in England the my is indispensable unless people are on familiar terms John knew this and reflected that Joe was English While he was reflecting his eye fell upon a heap of telegraph blanks and he remembered that he had not given notice of his defeat to the council He pushed aside the note paper and took a form for a cable dispatch In a moment Joe was forgotten in the sudden shock that brought his thoughts back to his position He wrote out a simple message addressed to Z who was the only one of the three whom he officially knew But when he had done that he fell to thinking about Joe again and resolved to write the note MY DEAR MISS THORN I cannot allow your very friendly words to remain unanswered until tomorrow It is kind of you to be sorry for the defeat I have suffered it is kinder still to express your sympathy so directly and so soon Concerning the circumstances which brought the contest to such a result I have nothing to say It is the privilege of elective bodies to choose as they please and indeed that is the object of their existence No one has any right to complain of not being elected for a man who is a candidate knows from the first what he is undertaking and what manner of men he has to deal with Personally I am a man who has fought a fight and has lost it and however firmly I still believe in the cause which led me to the struggle I confess that I am disappointed and disheartened at being vanquished You are good enough to say you believe I shall win in the end I can only answer that I thank you very heartily indeed for saying so though I do not think it is likely that any efforts of mine will be attended with success for a long time Believe me with great gratitude Very sincerely yours JOHN HARRINGTON It was a longer note than he had meant to write in fact it was almost a letter but he read it over and was convinced he had said what he meant to say which was always the principal consideration in such matters Accordingly the missive was dispatched to its destination As for missus Wyndham John determined to accept her invitation and to answer it in person by appearing at the dinner hour He would not let any one think he was so broken hearted as to be unable to show himself He was too strong for that and he had too much pride in his strength He was right in going to missus Wyndham s for she and her husband were his oldest friends and he understood well enough what true hearts and what honest loyalty lie sometimes concealed in the bosoms of those brisk peculiar people who seem unable to speak seriously for long about the most serious subjects and whose quaint turns of language seem often so unfit to express any deep feeling But while he talked with his hosts his own thoughts strayed again and again to Joe and he wondered what kind of woman she really was He intended to visit her the next day The next day came however and yet John did not turn his steps up the hill towards Miss Schenectady s house It was a cloudless morning after the heavy storm and the great drifts of snow flashed like heaps of diamonds in the sun All the air was clear and cold and the red brick pavements were spotted here and there with white patches left from the shovels of the Irishmen Sleighs of all sizes were ploughing their way hither and thither breaking out a track in the heavy mass that encumbered the streets Every one was wrapped in furs and every one s face was red with the smarting cold Joe stayed at home until mid day when she went to a luncheon party of young girls As usual they had been sewing for the poor but Joe thought that she was not depriving the poor people of any very material assistance by staying away from the more industrious part of the entertainment The sewing they all did together in a morning did not produce results whereby even the very smallest baby could have been clothed and the part effected by each separate damsel in this whole was consequently somewhat insignificant Joe would have stayed at home outright had the weather not been so magnificent and possibly she thought that she might meet John Harrington on her way to the house of her friend in Dartmouth Street Fate however was against her for she had not walked thirty yards down the hill before she was overtaken by Pocock Vancouver He had been standing in one of the semi circular bay windows of the Somerset Club and seeing Joe coming down the steep incline had hurriedly taken his coat and hat and gone out in pursuit of her Had he suspected in the least how Joe felt toward him he would have fled to the end of the world rather than meet her Good morning Miss Thorn he said walking rapidly by her side and taking off his hat how very early you are to day It is not early said Joe looking at him coldly it is nearly one o clock It would be called early for most people said Vancouver for missus Wyndham for instance I am not missus Wyndham said Joe I am going to see Harrington remarked Vancouver who perceived that Joe was not in a good humor I am afraid he must be dreadfully cut up about this business So you are going to condole with him I do not believe he is in the least disturbed He has far too much sense I fancy the most sensible man in the world would be a trifle annoyed at being defeated in an election Miss Thorn said Vancouver blandly I am afraid you are not very sorry for him He is an old friend of mine and though I differ from him in politics very passively I cannot do less than go and see him and tell him how much I regret personally that he should be defeated Joe s lip curled in scorn and she flushed angrily She could have struck Vancouver s pale face with infinite pleasure and satisfaction but she said nothing in immediate answer Do you not think I am right asked Vancouver I am sure you do you have such a good heart They passed Charles Street as he was speaking and yet he gave no sign of leaving her I am not sure that I have a good heart and I am quite sure that you are utterly wrong mister Vancouver said Joe in calm tones Really Why you quite surprise me Miss Thorn Any man in my place ought Most men in your place would avoid mister Harrington interrupted Joe turning her clear brown eyes full upon him Had she been less angry she would have been more cautious But her blood was up and she took no thought but said what she meant boldly Indeed Miss Thorn said Vancouver stiffly I do not understand you in the least I think what you say is very extraordinary John Harrington has always been a friend of mine That may be mister Vancouver but you are certainly no friend of his said Joe with a scornful laugh You astonish me beyond measure rejoined Pocock maintaining his air of injured virtue although he inwardly felt that he was in some imminent danger How can you possibly say such a thing Joe could bear it no longer She was very imprudent but her honest anger boiled over She stopped in her walk her back against the iron railings and she faced Vancouver with a look that frightened him He was forced to stop also and he could not do less than return her glance Do you dare to stand there and tell me that you are mister Harrington s friend she asked in low distinct tones You the writer of articles in the Daily Standard calling him a fool and a charlatan You who have done your very best to defeat him in this election Indeed it is too absurd She laughed aloud in utter scorn and then turned to continue her way Vancouver turned a shade paler than was natural with him and looked down He was very much frightened for he was a coward Miss Thorn he said I am sorry you should believe such calumnies I give you my word of honor that I have never either written or spoken against mister Harrington He is one of my best friends Joe did not answer she did not even look at him but walked on in silence He did not dare to speak again and as they reached the corner of the Public Garden he lifted his hat I am quite sure that you will find you have misjudged me Miss Thorn he said with a grieved look In the mean while I wish you a very good morning Good morning said Joe without looking at him and she passed on full of indignation and wrath To tell the truth she was so much delighted at having spoken her mind for once that she had not a thought of any possible consequences The delight of having dealt Vancouver such a buffet was very great and she felt her heart beat fast with a triumphant pleasure But Vancouver turned and went away with a very unpleasant sensation in him He wished with all his might that he had not left the comfortable bay window of the Somerset Club that morning and more than all he wished he could ascertain how Joe had come to know of his journalistic doings As a matter of fact what she had said concerning Pocock s efforts against John in the election had been meant in a most general way But Vancouver thought she was referring to his interview with Ballymolloy and that she understood the whole matter Of course there was nothing to be done but to deny the accusations from beginning to end but they nevertheless had struck deep and he was thoroughly alarmed When he left the club he had had no intention of going to see Harrington the idea had formed itself while talking with her But now again he felt that he could not go He had not the courage to face the man he had injured principally because he strongly suspected that if Joe knew what he had done John Harrington most likely knew it too He was doubly hit He would have been less completely confused and frightened if the attack had come from Sybil Brandon but he had had vague ideas of trying to marry Joe and he guessed that any such plan was now hopelessly out of the question He turned his steps homeward uncertain what to do and hoping to find counsel in solitude He took up the letters and papers that lay on his study table brought by the mid day post One letter in particular attracted his attention and he singled it out and opened it It was dated from London and had been twelve days on its way MY DEAR VANCOUVER Enclosed please find Bank of England Post Note for your usual quarterly honorarium Ltwelve fifty My firm will address you upon the use to be made of the Proxies lately sent you for the ensuing election of officers of the Pocahontas and Dead Man s Valley R R touching your possession of which I beg to reiterate the importance of a more than Masonic discretion I apprehend that unless the scattered shares should have been quickly absorbed for the purpose of obtaining a majority these Proxies will enable you to control the election of the proper ticket If not and if the Leviathan should decline the overtures that will be made to him during his summer visit to London I should like your estimate of five thousand shares more to be picked up in the next three months which will assure our friends the control Should the prospective figure be too high we may elect to sell out after rigging the market for a boom In either event there will be lots of pickings in the rise and fall of the shares for the old joint account which has been so profitable because you have so skillfully covered up your tracks Yours faithfully SAUNDERS GRABBLES P S The expectations of the young lady about whom you inquire are involved in such a tangle of conditions as could only have occurred to the excited fancy of an old Anglo Indian He left about twenty lacs of rupees in various bonds G I P and others to his nephew Ronald Surbiton and to his niece jointly provided that they marry each other If they do not one quarter of the estate is to go to the one who marries first and the remaining three quarters to the other The estate is in the hands of trustees who pay an allowance to the heirs In case they marry each other the said heirs have power to dispose by will of the inheritance Otherwise the whole of it reverts to the last survivor and at his or her death it is to be devoted to founding a home for superannuated governesses Vancouver read the letter through with care and held it a moment in his hand Then he crushed it angrily together and tossed it into the fire It seemed as though everything went wrong with him to day Not only was no information concerning Joe of any use now It would be a hard thing to disabuse her of the idea that he had written those articles After all though as he thought the matter over it could be only guess work The manuscripts had always gone through the post signed with a feigned name and it was utterly impossible that the editor himself could know who had written them It would be still more impossible therefore for any one else to do more than make a guess It is easy to deny any statement however correct when founded on such a basis But there was the other thing Joe had accused him of having opposed John s election to the best of his ability No one could prove that either He had even advised Ballymolloy to vote for John in so many words On the whole his conscience was clear enough Vancouver s conscience was represented by all those things which could by any possibility be found out the things that no one could ever know gave him no anxiety In the present case the first thing to be done was plainly to put the whole blame of the articles on the shoulders of some one else a person of violent political views and very great vanity who would be greatly flattered at being thought the author of anything so clever That would not be a difficult task He would broach the subject to missus Wyndham telling her that the man whoever he should be had told him in strictest confidence that he was the writer Vancouver would of course tell it to missus Wyndham as a state secret and she would tell some one else it would soon be public property and Joe would hear of it It would be easy enough to pitch upon some individual who would not deny the imputation or who would deny it in such a way as to leave the impression on the public mind unchanged more especially as the articles had accomplished the desired result The prime cause of all this John Harrington himself sat in his room unconscious for the time of Vancouver s existence He was in a state of great depression and uncertainty for he had not yet rallied from the blow of the defeat Moreover he was thinking of Joe and her letter lay open on the table beside him His whole heart went out to her in thanks for her ready sympathy and he had almost made up his mind to go and see her as he had at first determined to do He would have laughed very heartily at the idea of being in love for he had never thought of himself in such a position But he realized that he was fond of Josephine Thorn that he was thinking of her a great deal and that the thought was a comfort to him in his distress He knew very well that he would find a great rest and refreshment in talking to her at present and yet he could not decide to go to her John was a man of calm manner and with plenty of hard practical sense in spite of the great enthusiasm that burned like a fire within him and that was the mainspring of his existence But like all orators and men much accustomed to dealing with the passions of others he was full of quick intuitions and instincts which rarely betrayed him Something warned him not to seek her society and though he said to himself that he was very far from being in love the thought that he might some day find that he wished to marry her presented itself continually to his mind and since John had elected to devote himself to celibacy and politics there was nothing more repugnant to his whole life than the idea of marriage At this juncture while he was revolving in his mind what was best to be done a telegram was brought to him It was from Z and in briefest terms of authority commanded John to hold himself ready to start for London at a moment s notice It must have been dispatched within a few hours after receiving his own message of the night before and considering the difference of time must have been sent from London early in the afternoon It was clearly an urgent case and the supreme three had work for John to do even though he had not been made senator The order was a great relief It solved all his uncertainty and scattered all his doubts to the wind It gave him new courage and stimulated his curiosity Z had only sent for him twice before and then only to call him from Boston or New York to Washington It was clear that something of very great importance was likely to occur His energy returned in full with the anticipation of work to do and of a journey to be made and before night he was fully prepared to leave on receipt of his orders His box was packed and he had drawn the money necessary to take him to London As for Joe he could go and see her now if he pleased In twenty four hours he might be gone never to see her again But it was too late on that day he would go on the following morning It was still the height of the Boston season which is short but merry while it lasts John had a dinner party a musical evening and a ball on his list for the evening and he resolved that he would go to all three and show himself bravely to the world He was full of new courage and strength since he had received Z s message and he was determined that no one should know what he had suffered The dinner passed pleasantly enough and by ten o clock he was at the musical party There he found the Wyndhams and many other friends but he looked in vain for Joe she was not there Before midnight he was at the dance pushing his way through crowds of acquaintances stumbling over loving couples ensconced on the landings of the stairs and running against forlorn old ladies whose mouths were full of ice cream and their hearts of bitterness against the younger generation and so at last he reached the ball room where everything that was youngest and most fresh was assembled swaying and gliding and backing and turning in the easy graceful half walk half slide of the Boston step As John stood looking on Joe passed him leaving the room on mister Topeka s arm There was a little open space before her in the crowd and Pocock Vancouver darted out with the evident intention of speaking to her But as she caught sight of him she turned suddenly away pulling mister Topeka round by his arm It was an extremely marked thing to do As she turned she unexpectedly came face to face with John who had watched the maneuver The color came quickly to her face and she was slightly embarrassed nevertheless she held out her hand and greeted John cordially CHAPTER XVIII I am so glad to have found you said John to Josephine when the latter had disposed of mister Topeka They had chosen a quiet corner in a dimly lighted room away from the dancers But I suppose it is useless to ask you for a dance No said Joe looking at her card I always leave two dances free in the middle of the evening in case I am tired We will sit them out Thank you said John looking at her She looked pale and a little tired but wonderfully lovely Thank you he repeated and thank you also for your most kind note I wish I could tell you better how very sorry I am said Joe impulsively It is bad enough to look on and see such things done but I should think you must be nearly distracted I think I was at first said John simply But one soon grows used to it Man is a vain animal and I suppose no one could lose a fight as I have without being disappointed If you were not disappointed it would be a sign you did not really care answered Joe And of course you must care a great great deal It is a loss to your cause as well as a loss to yourself But you cannot possibly give it up you will win next time Yes said John I hope I shall win some day But his voice sounded uncertain it lacked that determined ring that Joe loved so well She felt as she sat beside him that he was deeply hurt and needed fresh encouragement and strength to restore him to his old self She longed to help him and to rouse him once more to the consciousness of power and the hope of victory It is my experience said she with an air of superiority that would have been amusing if she had spoken less earnestly it is my experience that one should never think of anything in which one has come to grief I know when one is going at a big thing a double post and rails with a ditch or anything like that you know it would never do to remember that you have come off at the same thing or at something else before When a man is always remembering his last tumble he has lost his nerve and had better give up hunting altogether Thinking that you may get an ugly fall will not help you over anything No said John that is very true You must forget all about it and begin again You have missed one bird but you are a good shot and you will not miss the next You are a most encouraging person Miss Thorn said John with a faint smile But you know the only test of a good shot is that one hits the mark I have missed at the first trial and that is no reason why I should not miss at the second too You are disappointed and unhappy now said Joe gently It is very natural indeed Anybody would feel like that But you must not believe in yourself any less than your friends believe in you I fancy my friends do not all think alike answered John But I am grateful to you for what you say He was indeed grateful and the soothing sound of her gentle voice was the best refreshment for his troubled spirit He thought for a moment how brave a man could be with such a woman by his side and the thought pleased him the more because he knew that it could not be realized They sat in silence for a while contented to be together and in sympathy But before long the anxiety for the future and the sense of his peculiar position came over John again Do you know he said there are times when I regret it all very much I never told any one so before perhaps I was never so sure of it as I have been since this affair What is it that you regret so much asked Joe softly It is a noble life It is indeed if only a man knows how to live it answered John But sometimes I think I do not You once said a very true thing to me about it all Do you remember No what was it You said I should not succeed because I am not enough of a partisan and because every one is a partisan here Did I Yes I remember saying it answered Joe secretly pleased that he should not have forgotten it I do not think it is so very true after all It is true to day but it is for men like you to set things right to make partisanship a thing of the past Men ought to make laws because they are just and necessary not in order that they may profit by them at the expense of the rest of the world And to have such good laws men ought to choose good men to represent them There is no denying the truth of that said John That is the way to construct the ideal republic It would be the way to do a great many ideal things You need only persuade humanity to do right and humanity will do it Verily it is an easy task He laughed a little bitterly It is not like you to laugh in that way said Joe gravely No to tell the truth I am not overmuch inclined to laugh at anything to day excepting myself and I dare say there are plenty of people who will do that for me without the asking They will have no chance when I am gone Joe started slightly Gone she repeated Are you going away It is very likely said John A friend of mine has warned me to be ready to start at a moment s notice on very important business But it is uncertain then asked Joe quickly She had turned very white in an instant and she looked straight across the little room and pulled nervously at her fan She would not have dared to let her eyes meet John s at that moment Yes rather uncertain answered John But he would not have sent me such a warning unless it were very likely that he would really want me Joe was silent she could not speak So you see continued Harrington I may leave to morrow and I cannot tell when I may come back That is the reason I was glad to find you here I would have called to day if it had been possible after I got the message He spoke calmly not dreaming of the storm of fear and passion he was rousing in the heart of the fair girl beside him Where where are you going asked Joe in a low voice Probably to England said John Before the words were out of his mouth he turned and looked at her suddenly realizing the change in her tones But she had turned away from him He could see the quiver of her lips and the beating throb of her beautiful throat and as he watched the outline of her cheek a tear stole slowly over the delicate skin and trembled and fell upon her white neck But still she looked away Ah John Harrington what have you done You have taken the most precious and pure thing in this world the thing men as brave as you have given their heart s best blood to win and have perished for failing the thing which angels guard and Heaven has in its keeping the love of a good and noble woman It has come into your hands and you do not want it You hardly know it is yours and if you fully knew it you would not know what to do You are innocent indeed you have done nothing spoken no word given no look that in your opinion your cold indifferent opinion could attract a woman s love But the harm is done nevertheless and a great harm too When you are old and sensible you will look back to this day as one of sorrow and evil and you will know then that all greatness and power and glory of realized ambition are nothing unless a man have a woman s love You will know that a man who cannot love is blind to half the world he seeks to conquer and that a man who cannot love truly is no true man for he who is not true to one cannot be true to many That is the sum and reckoning of what love is worth But John knew of nothing beyond friendship and he could not conceive how friendship could turn into anything else When he saw the tear on Josephine Thorn s cheek he was greatly disturbed and vaguely wondered what in the world he should do The idea that any woman could care enough for him to shed a tear when he left her had never crossed his mind even now with the actual fact before his eyes he doubted whether it were possible She was ill perhaps and suffering pain Pshaw it was absurd it could not be that she cared so much for him Seeing she did not move he sat quite still for a while His usual tact had deserted him in the extremity of the situation He revolved in his mind what was best to say It was safest to suppose that Joe was ill but he would say something indifferent in order to see whether she recovered before he suggested that he might be of assistance It is cold here he remarked trying to speak as naturally as possible Would you not like to take a turn Miss Thorn Joe moved a little She was deadly pale and in the effort she had made to control her feelings she was unconscious of the tears in her eyes Oh no thanks she faltered I will not dance just now She could not say more John made up his mind You are ill Miss Thorn he said anxiously I am sure you are very far from well Let me get you something or call your aunt Shall I Oh no don t that is please I think so I will go home John rose quickly but before he reached the door she called him back mister Harrington it is nothing Please sit down John came back and did as he was bid more and more surprised and confused I was afraid it was something serious he said nervously for he was greatly disturbed Joe laughed a bitter harsh little laugh that was bad to hear She was making a great effort but she was strong and bravely forced back her bursting tears Oh no I was only choking she said I often do Go on please with what you were saying Why are you going away so suddenly Indeed answered John I do not know what the business is I am going if I am required simply because my friend wants me Do you mean to say asked Joe speaking more calmly that you will pack up your belongings and go to the end of the world whenever a friend asks you to It is most tremendously obliging you know Not for any friend John replied But I would most certainly do it for this particular one You must be very fond of him to do that said Joe I am under great obligations to him too He is certainly the most important man with whom I have any relations We can trust each other it would not do to endanger the certainty of good faith that exists between us He must be a very wonderful person said Joe who had grown quite calm by this time I should like to know him Very possibly you may meet him some day He is a very wonderful person indeed as you say He has devoted fifty years of his life and strength to the unremitting pursuit of the best aim that any man can set before him In other words said Joe he is your ideal He is what you hope to be at his age He must be very old Yes he is old As for his representing my ideal I think he approaches more nearly to it than any man alive But you would probably not like him Why He belongs to a class of men whom old world people especially dislike answered John He does not believe in any monarchy aristocracy or distinction of birth He looks upon titles as a decaying institution of barbarous ages and he confidently asserts that in two or three generations the republic will be the only form of social contract known amongst the inhabitants of the civilized world John was watching Joe while he spoke He was merely talking because it seemed necessary and he saw that in spite of her assumed calm she was still greatly agitated She seemed anxious however to continue the conversation It is absurd said she to say that all men are born equal Everything depends on what you mean by the word equal I mean by it that all men are born with an equal claim to a share in all the essential rights of free citizenship When a man demands more than that he is infringing on the rights of others when he is content with less he is allowing himself to be robbed But who is to decide just how much belongs to each man asked Joe leaning back wearily against the cushions She wished now that she had allowed him to call her aunt It was a fearful strain on her faculties to continue talking upon general subjects and listening to John Harrington s calm almost indifferent tones The majority decides that said John But a majority has just decided that you are not to be senator said Joe According to you they were right were they not It is necessary that the majority should be free said John and that they should judge of themselves each man according to his honest belief Majorities with us are very frequently produced by a handful of dishonest men who can turn the scale on either side to suit their private ends It is the aim we set before us to protect the freedom of majorities That is the true doctrine of a republic And for that aim said Joe slowly you would sacrifice everything Yes indeed we would said John gravely For that end we will sacrifice all that we have to give the care for personal satisfaction the hope of personal distinction the peace of a home and the love of a wife We seek neither distinction nor satisfaction and we renounce all ties that could hamper our strength or interfere with the persevering and undivided attention we try to give to our work That is a magnificent programme said Joe somewhat incredulously Do you not think it is possible sometimes to aim too high You say we seek we try as though there were several of you or at least some one besides yourself Do you believe that such ideas as you tell me of are really and seriously held by any body of men Nothing had seemed too high to Josephine an hour earlier nothing too exalted nothing so noble but that John Harrington might do it then and there But a sudden change had come over her the deadly cold phase of half melancholy unbelief that often follows close upon an unexpected disappointment so that she looked with distaste on anything that seemed so full of the enthusiasm she had lost The tears that bad risen so passionately to her dimmed eyes were suddenly frozen and seemed to flow back with chilling force to her heart She coldly asked herself whether she were mad that she could have suffered thus for such a man even ever so briefly He was a man she said who loved an unattainable fanatic idea in the first place and who dearly loved himself as well for his own fanaticism s sake He was a man in whom the heart was crushed even annihilated by his intellect which he valued far too highly and by his vanity which he dignified into a philosophy of self sacrifice He was aiming at what no man can reach and though he knew his object to be beyond human grasp he desired all possible credit for having madly dreamed of anything so high In the sudden revulsion of her strong passion she almost hated him she almost felt the power to refute his theories to destroy his edifice of fantastic morality and finally to show him that he was a fool among men and doubly a fool because he was not even happy in his own folly Joe vaguely felt all this and with it she felt a sense of shame at having so nearly broken down at the news that he was going away He had thought she was ill most assuredly he could not have guessed the cause of what he had seen but nevertheless she had suffered a keen pain and the tears had come to her eyes She did not understand it He might leave her now if he pleased and she would not care indeed it would be rather a relief if he would go She no longer asked what she was to him she simply reflected that after all was said he was nothing to her She felt a quick antagonism to his ideas to his words and to himself and she was willing to show it She asked him incredulously whether his ideas were really held by others It makes little difference answered John whether they are many or few who think as I do and I cannot tell how many there may be The truth is not made truth because many people believe it The world went round as Galileo knew although he alone stood up and said it in the face of mankind who scoffed at him for his pains In other words you occupy the position of Galileo suggested Joe calmly Not I said John but there are men and there have been men in our country who know truths as great as any he discovered and who have spent their lives in proclaiming them I know that they are right and that I am right and that however we may fail others will succeed at last I know that come what may honor and truth and justice will win the day in the end His gray eyes glittered as he spoke and his broad white hands clasped nervously together in his enthusiasm He was depressed and heartsick at his failure but it needed only one word of opposition to rouse the strong main thought of his life into the most active expression But Joe sat coldly by her whole nature seemingly changed in the few minutes that had passed And all this will be brought about by the measures you advocated the other day said she with a little laugh A civil service a little tariff reform that is enough to inaugurate the reign of honor truth and justice John turned his keen eyes upon hers He had begun talking because she had required it of him and he had been roused by the subject He remembered the sympathy she had given him and he was annoyed at her caprice Such things are the mere passing needs of a time he said The truth justice and honor at which you are pleased to be amused would insure the execution at all times of what is right and needful Without a foundation composed of the said truth justice and honor to get what is right and needful is often a matter so stupendous that the half of a nation s blood is drained in accomplishing the task if even it is accomplished after all I see nothing to laugh at Indeed Joe was only smiling faintly but John was so deeply impressed and penetrated by the absolute truth of what he was saying that he had altogether ceased to make any allowances for Joe s caprice of mood or for the disturbance in her manner that he had so lately witnessed He was beginning to be angry and she had never seen him in such a mood The world would be a very nice tiresome place to live in she said if every one always did exactly what is absolutely right I should not like to live among people who would be always so entirely padded and lined with goodness as they must be in your ideal republic It is a favorite and characteristic notion of modern society to associate goodness with dullness and consequently I suppose to connect badness with all that is gay interesting and diverting There is nothing more perverted absurd and contemptible than that notion in the whole history of the world John was not gentle with an idea when he despised it and the adjectives fell in his clear utterance like the blows of a sledge hammer But as the idea he was abusing had been suggested by Joe she resented the strong language I am flattered that you should call anything I say by such bad names she said I am not good at arguing and that sort of thing If I were I think I could answer you very easily Will you please take me back to my aunt She rose in a somewhat stately fashion John was suddenly aware that he had talked too much and too strongly and he was very sorry to have displeased her She had always let him talk as he pleased especially of late and she had almost invariably agreed with him in everything he said so that he had acquired too much confidence At all events that was the way he explained to himself the present difficulty Please forgive me Miss Thorn he said humbly as he gave her his arm to leave the room I am a very sanguine person and I often talk great nonsense Please do not be angry Joe paused just as they reached the door Angry I am not angry she said with sudden gentleness Besides you know this is you are really going away I think so said John Then if you do she said with some hesitation if you do this is good by is it not Yes I am afraid it is said John but not for long Not for long perhaps she answered but I would not like you to think I was angry the very last time I saw you No indeed I should be very sorry if you were But you are not No Well then she held out her hand Good by then She had almost hated him a few minutes ago Half an hour earlier she had loved him Now her voice faltered a little but her face was calm John took the proffered hand and grasped it warmly With all her caprice and despite the strange changes of her manner toward him she had been a good friend in a bad time during the last days and he was more sorry to leave her than he would himself have believed Good by he said and thank you once more with all my heart for your friendship and kindness Their hands remained clasped for a moment then she took his arm again and he led her out of the dimly lighted sitting room back among the brilliant dancers and the noise and the music and the whirling crowd CHAPTER XIX A change has come over Boston in four months since John Harrington and Josephine Thorn parted The breath of the spring has been busy everywhere and the haze of the hot summer is ripening the buds that the spring has brought out The trees on the Common are thick and heavy with foliage the Public Garden is a carpet of bright flowers and on the walls of Beacon Street the great creepers have burst into blossom and are stretching long shoots over the brown stone and the iron balconies There is a smell of violets and flowers in the warm air and down on the little pond the swan shaped boats are paddling about with their cargoes of merry children and calico nursery maids while the Irish boys look on from the banks and throw pebbles when the policemen are not looking wishing they had the spare coin necessary to embark for a ten minutes voyage on the mimic sea Unfamiliar figures wander through the streets of the West End and more than half the houses show by the boarded windows and doors that the owners are out of town The migration of the tax dodgers took place on the last day of April they will return on the second day of December having spent just six months and one day in their country places whereby they have shifted the paying of a large proportion of their taxes to more economical regions It is a very equitable arrangement for it is only the rich man who can save money in this way while his poorer neighbor who has no country seat to which he may escape must pay to the uttermost farthing The system stimulates the impecunious to become wealthy and helps the rich to become richer It is therefore perfectly good and just But Boston is more beautiful in the absence of the tax dodger than at any other season There is a stillness and a peace over the fair city that one may long for in vain during the winter Business indeed goes on without interruption but the habitation of the great men of business knows them not They come up from their cool bowers by the sea in special trains in steamers and in yachts every morning and early in the afternoon they go back so that all day long the broad streets at the west are quiet and deserted and seem to be basking in the sunshine to recover from the combined strain of the bitter winter and the unceasing gayety that accompanies it In the warm June weather Miss Schenectady and Joe still linger in town The old lady has no new fangled notions about taxes and though she is rich and has a pretty place near Newport she will not go there until she is ready no not for all the tax gatherers in Massachusetts As for Joe she does not want to go away Urgent letters come by every mail entreating her to return to England in time for a taste of the season in London but they lie unanswered on her table and often she does not read more than half of what they contain The books and the letters accumulate in her room and she takes no thought whether she reads them or not for the time is weary on her hands and she only wishes it gone no matter how Nevertheless she will not go home and she even begs her aunt not to leave Boston yet She is paler than she was and her face looks thin She says she is well and as strong as ever but the elasticity is gone from her step and the light has faded in her brown eyes so that one might meet her in the street and hardly know her As she sits by the window behind the closed blinds the softened light falls on her face and it is sad and weary It was not until John Harrington was gone that she realized all He had received the message he expected early on the morning after that memorable parting and before mid day he was on his way Since then she had heard no word of tidings concerning him save that she knew he had arrived in England For anything she knew he might even now be in America again but she would not believe it If he had come back he would surely have come to see her she thought There were times when she would have given all the world to look on his face again but for the most part she said to herself it was far better that she should never see him Where was the use Joe was not of the women who have intimate confidants and can get rid of much sorrow by much talking about it She was too proud and too strong to ask for help or sympathy in any real distress She had gone to Sybil Brandon when she was about to tell Ronald of her decision because she thought that Sybil would be kind to him and help him to forget the past but where she herself was alone concerned she would rather have died many deaths than confess what was in her heart She had gone bravely through the remainder of the season until all was over and no one had guessed her disappointment Such perfect physical strength as hers was not to be broken down by the effort of a few weeks and still she smiled and talked and danced and kept her secret But as the long months crawled out their tale of dreary days the passion in her soul spread out great roots and grew fiercely against the will that strove to break it down It was a love against which there was no appeal which had taken possession silently and stealthily with no outward show of wooing or sweet words and then safe within the fortress of her maidenly soul it had grown up to a towering strength feeding upon her whole life and ruthlessly dealing with her as it would But this love sought no confidence nor help nor assistance being of itself utterly without hope strong and despairing One satisfaction only she had daily She rejoiced that she had broken away from the old ties from Ronald and from her English life To have found herself positively loving one man while she was betrothed to another would have driven her to terrible extremity the mere idea of going back to her mother and to the old life at home with this wild thought forever gnawing at her heart was intolerable She might bear it to the end whatever the end might be and in silence so long as none of her former associations made the contrast between past and present too strong Old Miss Schenectady with her books and her odd conversation was as good a companion as any one since she could not live alone Sybil Brandon would have wearied her by her sympathy gentle and loving as it would have been and besides Sybil was away from Boston and very happy it would be unkind as well as foolish to disturb her serenity with useless confidences And so the days went by and the hot summer was come and yet Joe lingered in Boston suffering silently and sometimes wondering how it would all end Sybil was staying near Newport with her only surviving relation an uncle of her mother He was an old man upward of eighty years of age and he lived in a strange old place six or seven miles from the town But Ronald had been there more than once and he was always enthusiastic in his description of what he had seen and he seemed particularly anxious that Joe should know how very happy Sybil was in her country surroundings Ronald had traveled during the spring making short journeys in every direction and constantly talking of going out to see the West a feat which he never accomplished He would go away for a week at a time and then suddenly appear again and at last had gravitated to Newport Thence he came to town occasionally and visited Joe never remaining more than a day and sometimes only a few hours Joe was indifferent to his comings and goings but always welcomed him in a friendly way She saw that he was amusing himself and was more glad than ever that the relations formerly existing between them had been so opportunely broken off He had never referred to the past since the final interview when Joe had answered him by bursting into tears and he talked about the present cheerfully enough One morning he arrived without warning as usual to make one of his short visits Joe was sitting by the window dressed all in white and the uniform absence of color in her dress rather exaggerated the pallor of her face than masked it She was reading apparently with some interest in a book of which the dark lined binding sufficiently declared the sober contents As she read her brows bent in the effort of understanding while the warm breeze that blew through the blinds fanned her tired face and gently stirred the small stray ringlets of her soft brown hair Ronald opened the door and entered Oh Ronald exclaimed Joe starting a little nervously have you come up You look like the sunshine Come in and shut the door He did as he was bidden and came and sat beside her Yes I nave come up for the day How are you Joe dear You look pale It is this beastly heat you ought to come down to Newport for a month It is utterly idiotic you know staying in town in this weather I like it said Joe I like the heat so much that I think I should be cold in Newport Tell me all about what you have been doing Oh I hardly know said Ronald Lots of things Tell me what you do in one day yesterday for instance I want to be amused this morning It is not so very amusing you know but it is very jolly answered Ronald To begin with I get up at unholy hours and go and bathe in the surf at the second beach There are no end of a a lot of people there even at that hour Yes I dare say And then Oh then I go home and dress and later if I do not ride I go to the club casino I beg its pardon and play tennis They play very decently some of those fellows Are there any nice rides Just along the roads you know But when you get out to Sherwood there are meadows and things with a brook That is very fair Do you still go to Sherwood often How is Sybil Yes said Ronald and a blush rose quickly to his face I often go there It is such a queer old place you know full of trees and old summer houses and graveyards awfully funny Tell me Ronald said Joe insisting a little how is Sybil She looks very well so I suppose she is But she never goes to anything in Newport she has not been in the town at all yet since she went to stay with her uncle But of course lots of people go out to see her do they not Oh well not many In fact I do not remember to have met any one there answered Ronald as though he were trying to recall some face besides Miss Brandon s Her uncle is such an odd bird you have no idea I do not imagine you see very much of him when you go out there said Joe with a faint laugh Oh I always see him of course said Ronald blushing again He is about a hundred years old and wears all kinds of clothes and wanders about the garden perpetually But I do not talk to him unless I am driven to it Which does not occur often interrupted Joe Oh well I suppose not very often Why should it Ronald was visibly embarrassed Joe watched him with a look of amusement on her face but affectionately too as though what he said pleased her as well as amused her There was a short pause during which Ronald rubbed his hat slowly and gently Then he looked up suddenly and met Joe s eyes but he turned away again instantly blushing redder than ever Ronald Joe said presently I am so glad Glad Why About what I am glad that you like her and that she likes you I think you like her very much Ronald Oh yes very much repeated Ronald trying to seem indifferent Do you not feel as though we were much more like brother and sister now asked Joe after a little while Oh much assented Ronald I suppose it is better too though I did not think so at first It is far better said Joe laying her small thin hand across her cousin s strong fingers and pressing them a little You are free now and you will probably be very happy before long Do you not think so she asked looking affectionately into his eyes I hope so said Ronald with a last attempt at indifference Then suddenly his face softened and he added in a gentler tone Indeed Joe I think I shall be very happy soon I am so glad said Joe again still holding his hand but leaning her head back wearily in the deep chair There is only one thing that troubles me What is that That horrid will said Joe I am sure we could get it altered in some way We never thought about it before Joe Why should we think about it now It seems to me it is a very good will as things have turned out But my dear boy said Joe if you are married to Sybil Brandon you will need ever so much money Ronald blushed again I have not asked her to marry me he said quickly That makes no difference at all replied Joe As I was saying when you have married her you will need money What an idea exclaimed Ronald indignantly As if any one wanted to be rich in order to be happy Besides between what I have of my own and my share of the money there is nearly four thousand a year and then there is the place in Lanarkshire for us to live in As if that were not enough It is not so very much though said Joe reflecting I do not think Sybil has anything at all You will be as poor as two little church mice but I will come and stay with you sometimes Joe added laughing and help you about the bills The bills would take care of themselves said Ronald gravely They always do But whatever happens Joe my home is always yours You will always remember that will you not Dear Ronald answered his cousin affectionately you are as good as it is possible to be you really are Ronald said Joe after a pause I have an idea He looked at her inquiringly but said nothing I might she continued smiling at the thought I may go and marry first you know after all and spoil it But you will not will you Promise me you will not I wish I could said Joe and then you could have the money But I would not let you interrupted Ronald I would go off and get married by license and that sort of thing Without asking Miss Brandon suggested Joe Nonsense ejaculated Ronald coloring for the twentieth time I think we are talking nonsense altogether said Joe seriously I do not think indeed I am quite sure I shall never marry How absurd cried Ronald The idea of your not marrying It is perfectly ridiculous The name of John Harrington was on his lips but he checked himself John was gone abroad and with more than usual tact Ronald reflected that if Joe had really cared for the man an allusion to him would be unkind But Joe only shook her head and let her cousin s words pass unanswered She had long suspected from Ronald s frequent allusions to Sybil which were generally accompanied by some change of manner that he was either already in love with the fair American girl or that he soon would be and the acknowledgment she had now received from himself gave her infinite pleasure In her reflections upon her own conduct she had never blamed herself but she had more than once thought that he was greatly to be pitied To have married him six months ago when she was fully conscious that she did not love him would have been very wrong and to have gone back at a later period when she realized that her whole life was full of her love for John Harrington would have been a crime But in spite of that she was often very sorry for Ronald and feared that she had hurt his happiness past curing Now therefore when she saw how much he loved another she was exceedingly glad for she knew that the thing she had done had been wholly good both for him and for her They soon began to talk of other things but the conversation fell back to the discussion of Newport and Joe learned with some surprise that Pocock Vancouver assiduously cultivated Ronald s acquaintance and was always ready to do anything in the world that Ronald desired It appeared that Vancouver lent Ronald his horses at all times and was apparently delighted when Ronald would take a mount and stay away all day The young Englishman of course was not loath to accept such offers having a radical and undisguised contempt for hired horseflesh and as Sybil lived several miles out of town it was far the most pleasant plan to ride out to her and after spending the day there to ride back in the evening more especially as it cost him nothing Joe was on the point of making some remark upon Vancouver which would very likely have had the effect of cooling the intimacy between him and Ronald but she thought better of it and said nothing Ronald had had no part in all the questions connected with John s election and knew nothing of what Vancouver had done in the matter It was better on many grounds not to stir up fresh trouble and so long as Vancouver s stables afforded Ronald an easy and economical means of locomotion from Newport to the house of the woman he loved the friendship that had sprung up was a positive gain She could not understand the motives that prompted Vancouver in the least He had made more than one attempt to regain his position with her after the direct cut he had sustained on the evening when she parted with John but Joe had resolutely set her face against him Possibly she thought Vancouver might hope to regain her good opinion by a regular system of kindness to Ronald but it hardly seemed to her as though such a result would reward him for the pains of his diplomacy Meanwhile it would be foolish of her to interfere with any intimacy which was of real use to Ronald in his suit As a matter of fact Vancouver was carrying out a deliberate plan and one which was far from ill conceived He had not been so blind as not to suspect Joe s secret attachment for John when she was willing to go to such lengths in her indignation against himself for being John s enemy But he had disposed of John as he thought by assisting if not actually causing his defeat He imagined that Harrington had gone abroad to conceal the mortification he felt at having lost the election and he rightly argued that for some time Joe would not bestow a glance upon any one else In the mean time however he was in possession of certain details concerning Joe s fortune which could be of use and he accordingly set about encouraging Ronald s affections in any direction they might take so long as they were not set upon his cousin He was not surprised that Ronald should fall in love with Sybil though he almost wished the choice could have fallen upon some one else and accordingly he did everything in his power to make life in Newport agreeable for the young Englishman It was convenient in some respects that the wooing should take place at so central a resort but had the case been different Vancouver would not have hesitated to go to Saratoga Lenox or Mount Desert in the prosecution of his immediate purpose which was to help Ronald to marry any living woman rather than let him return to England a bachelor When Ronald should be married Joe would be in possession of three quarters of her uncle s money a very considerable fortune If she was human thought Vancouver she would be eternally grateful to him for ridding her of her cousin whom she evidently did not wish to marry and for helping her thereby to so much wealth He reflected that he had been unfortunate in the time when he had decided to be a candidate for her hand but whatever turn affairs took no harm was done to his own prospects by removing Ronald from the list of possible rivals He was delighted at the preference Surbiton showed for Sybil Brandon and in case Ronald hesitated he reserved the knowledge he possessed of her private fortune as a final stimulus to his flagging affections Hitherto it had not seemed necessary to acquaint his friend with the fact that Sybil had an income of some thirty thousand dollars yearly indeed no one seemed to know it and she was supposed to be in rather straitened circumstances As for his own chances with Joe he had carefully hidden the tracks of his journalistic doings in the way he had at once proposed to himself when Joe attacked him on the subject A gentleman had been found upon whom he had fastened the authorship of the articles in the public estimation and the gentleman would live and die with the reputation for writing he had thus unexpectedly obtained He had ascertained beyond a doubt that Joe knew nothing of his interview with Ballymolloy and he felt himself in a strong position Pocock Vancouver had for years taken an infinite amount of pains in planning and furthering his matrimonial schemes He was fond of money but in a slightly less degree he was fond of all that is beautiful and intelligent in woman so that his efforts to obtain for himself what he considered a perfect combination of wit good looks and money although ineffectual had occupied a great deal of his spare time very agreeably CHAPTER XX Sherwood was a very old place It had been built a hundred years at least before the Revolution in the days when the States had English governors and when its founder had been governor of Rhode Island His last descendant in the direct line was Sybil Brandon s great uncle The old country seat was remarkable chiefly for the extent of the gardens attached to the house and for the singularly advanced state of dilapidation in which everything was allowed to remain Beyond the gardens the woods stretched down to the sea unpruned and thick with a heavy undergrowth from the road the gardens were hidden by thick hedges and by the forbidding gray front of the building It was not an attractive place to look at and once within the precincts there was a heavy sense of loneliness and utter desolation that seemed to fit it for the very home of melancholy The damp sea air had drawn green streaks of mould downwards from each several jointing of the stones the long closed shutters of some of the windows were more than half hidden by creepers bushy and straggling by turns and the eaves were all green with moss and mould From the deep arched porch at the back a weed grown gravel walk led away through untrimmed hedges of box and myrtle to an ancient summer house on the edge of a steep slope of grass To right and left of this path the rose trees and box that had once marked the gayest of flower gardens now grew in such exuberance of wild profusion that it would have needed strong arms and a sharp axe to cut a way through Far away on a wooded knoll above the sea was the old graveyard where generations of Sherwoods lay dead in their quiet rest side by side But for a space in every year the desolation was touched with the breath of life and the sweet June air blew away the mould and the smell of death and the wild flowers and roses sprang up joyfully in the wilderness to greet the song birds and the butterflies of summer And in this copious year a double spring had come to Sherwood for Sybil Brandon had arrived one day and her soft eyes and golden hair had banished all sadness and shadow from the old place Even the thin old man who lived there among the ghosts and shadows of the dead and dying past smoothed the wrinkles from his forehead forgetting to long selfishly for his own death when Sybil came and with touching thoughtfulness he strove to amuse her and to be younger for her sake He found old garments of a gayer time full thirty years hidden away in the great wardrobes up stairs and he put them on and wore them though they hung loosely about his shaken and withered frame lest he should be too sad a thing for such young eyes to look upon Then Ronald came one day and the old man took kindly to him and bade him come often In the innocence of his old age it seemed good that what youth and life there was in the world should come together and Ronald treated him with a deference and respect to which he had long been unused Moreover Ronald accepted the invitation given him and came as often as he pleased which before long meant every day When he came in the morning he generally stayed until the evening and when he came in the afternoon he always stayed as long as Sybil would let him and rode home late through the misty June moonlight pondering on the happiness the world had suddenly brought forth for him who had supposed but a few months ago that all happiness was at an end Six months had gone by since Ronald had first seen Sybil and he had changed in that time from boy to man Looking back through the past years he knew that he was glad Joe had not married him for the new purpose of his new life was to love and marry Sybil Brandon There was no doubt in his mind as to what he would do the strong nature in him was at last roused and he was capable of anything in reason or without it to get what he wanted Some one has said that an Englishman s idea of happiness is to find something he can kill and to hunt it That is a metaphor as well as a fact It may take an Englishman half a lifetime to find out what he wants but when he is once decided he is very likely to get it or to die in the attempt The American is fond of trying everything until he reaches the age at which Americans normally become dyspeptic and during his comparatively brief career he succeeds in experiencing a surprising variety of sensations Both Americans and English are tenacious in their different ways and it is certain that between them they have gotten more things that they have wanted than any other existing nation What most surprised Ronald was that having made up his mind to marry Sybil he should not have had the opportunity or perhaps the courage to tell her so He remembered how easily he had always been able to speak to Joe about matrimony and he wondered why it should be so hard to approach the subject with one whom he loved infinitely more dearly than he had ever loved his cousin But love brings tact and the knowledge of fitness besides having the effect of partially hiding the past and exaggerating the future into an eternity of rose colored happiness wherefore Ronald supposed that everything would come right in time and that the time for everything to come right could not possibly be very far off On the day after he had seen Joe in Boston he rode over to Sherwood in the morning as usual upon one of Vancouver s horses He was lighter at heart than ever for he had somewhat dreaded the revelation of his intentions to Joe but she had so led him on and helped him that it had all seemed very easy He was not long in reaching his destination and having put his horse in the hands of the single man who did duty as gardener groom and dairyman for old mister Sherwood he entered the garden where he hoped to meet Sybil alone He was not disappointed for as he walked down the path through the wilderness of shrubbery he caught sight of her near the summer house stooping down in the act of plucking certain flowers that grew there She too was dressed all in white as he had seen his cousin on the previous day but the difference struck him forcibly as he came up and took her outstretched hand They had changed places and character one could almost have thought Joe had looked so tired and weary so wilted as they say in Boston that it had shocked Ronald to see her Sybil who had formerly been so pale and cold now was the very incarnation of life delicate and exquisitely fine in every movement and expression but most thoroughly alive The fresh soft color seemed to float beneath the transparent skin and her deep eyes were full of light and laughter and sunshine Ronald s heart leaped in his breast for love and pride as she greeted him and his brow turned hot and his hands cold in the confusion of his happiness You have been away again she asked presently looking down at the wild white lilies which she had been gathering Yes I was in Boston yesterday answered Ronald who had immediately begun to help in plucking the flowers I went to see Joe She looks dreadfully knocked up with the heat poor child And so they talked about Joe and Boston for a little while and Sybil sat upon the steps of the summer house on the side where there was shade from the hot morning sun while Ronald brought her handfuls of the white lilies At last there were enough and he came and stood before her She was so radiantly lovely as she sat in the warm shade with the still slanting sunlight just falling over her white dress he thought her so super humanly beautiful that he stood watching her without thinking of speaking or caring that she should speak to him She looked up and smiled a quick bright smile for she was woman enough to know his thoughts But she busied herself with the lilies and looked down again Let me help you said Ronald suddenly kneeling down before her on the path I don t think you can very much said Sybil demurely You are not very clever about flowers you know Oh take care You will crush it give it back to me Ronald had taken one of the lilies and was smelling it but it looked to Sybil very much as though he were pressing it to his lips He would not give it back but held it away at arm s length as he knelt Sybil made as though she were annoyed Of course said she I cannot take it if you will not give it to me Ronald gently laid the flower in her lap with the others She pretended to take no notice of what he did but went on composing her nosegay Miss Brandon began Ronald and stopped Well said Sybil without looking up May I tell you something he asked That depends said Sybil Is it anything very interesting Yes said Ronald There seemed to be something the matter with his throat all at once as though he were going to choke Sybil looked up and saw that he was very pale She had never seen him otherwise than ruddy before and she was startled she dropped the lilies on her knees and looked at him anxiously Ronald suddenly laid his hands over hers and held them Still she faced him I am very unworthy of you I know I am but I love you very very much He spoke distinctly enough now and slowly He was as white as marble and his fingers were cold and trembled as they held hers For an instant after he had spoken Sybil did not move Then she quietly drew back her hands and hid her face in a sudden convulsive movement She too trembled and her heart beat as though it would break but she said nothing Ronald sprang from the ground and kneeled again upon the step beside her very gently his arm stole about her and drew her to him She took one hand from her face and tried to disentangle his hold but he held her strongly and whispered in her ear Sybil I love you do you love me Sybil made a struggle to rise but it was not a very brave struggle and in another moment she had fallen into his arms and was sobbing out her whole love passionately Oh Ronald you mu must not But Ronald did Half an hour later they were still sitting side by side on the steps but the storm of uncertainty was passed and they had plighted their faith for better and for worse for this world and the next Ronald had foreseen the event and had hoped for it as he never had hoped for anything in his life Sybil had perhaps guessed it at all events now that the supreme moment was over they both felt that it was the natural climax to all that had happened during the spring I think said Sybil quietly that we ought to tell my uncle at once He is the only relation I have in the world Oh yes of course said Ronald holding her hand That is you know I think we might tell him after lunch Because I suppose it would not be the right thing for me to stay all day after he knows Would it Why not asked Sybil He must know it soon and you will come to morrow To morrow and the next day and the day after that and always said Ronald lovingly But he will not like it I suppose Why not asked Sybil again Because I am poor said Ronald quietly You know I am not rich at all Sybil dearest We shall have to be very economical and live on the place in Scotland But it is a very pretty place he added reassuringly Sybil flushed a little He did not know then that she had a fortune of her own It was a new pleasure She did not say anything for a moment Do you mind very much dearest asked Ronald doubtfully Do you think it would bore you dreadfully to live in the country Sybil hesitated before she answered She hardly knew whether to tell him or not but at last she decided it would be better No Ronald said she smiling a little I like the country But you know we can live anywhere we please I am rich Ronald you did not know it Ronald started slightly It was indeed an unexpected revelation Really he cried Oh I am so glad for you You will not miss anything then I was so afraid That evening Ronald telegraphed to Joe the news of his engagement and the next day he wrote her a long letter which was more remarkable for the redundant passion expressed than for the literary merit of the expression It seemed far easier to write it since he had seen her and talked with her about Sybil not because he felt in the least ashamed of having fallen in love within six months of the dissolution of his former engagement with Joe but because it seemed a terribly difficult thing to speak to any one about Sybil Ronald was very far from being poetical or in any way given to lofty and medieval reflections of the chivalric sort but he was a very honest fellow loving for the first time and he understood that his love was something more to be guarded and respected than anything that had yet come into his life wherefore it seemed almost ungentlemanly to speak about it When Joe received the intelligence her satisfaction knew no bounds for although she had guessed that the climax of the affair was not far off she had not expected it so very soon Had she searched through the whole of her acquaintance at home and in America she could have found no one whom she considered more fit to be Ronald s wife and that alone was enough to make her very happy but the sensation of freedom from all further responsibility to Ronald and the consciousness that every possible good result had followed upon her action added so much to her pleasure in the matter that for a time she utterly forgot herself and her own troubles She instantly wrote a long and sympathetic letter to Ronald and another to Sybil Sybil replied at once begging Joe to come and spend a month at Sherwood or as much time as she was able to give I expect you had best go remarked Miss Schenectady It is getting pretty hot here and you look quite sick Oh no I am very well said Joe but I think I will go for a week or ten days Well if you find you are going to have a good time you can always stay any way replied the old lady I think if I were you I would take some books and a Bible and a pair of old boots Miss Schenectady did not smile but Joe laughed outright A Bible and a pair of old boots she cried Yes I would said her aunt Old Tom Sherwood cannot have seen a Bible for fifty years I expect and it might sort of freshen him up The old lady s eye twinkled slightly and the corners of her mouth twitched a little As for the old boots if you conclude to go you will want them for you will be right out in the country there Joe laughed again but she took her aunt s advice and on the following day she reached Newport and was met by Sybil and Ronald who conveyed her to Sherwood in a thing which Joe learned was called a carryall Late in the afternoon when Ronald was gone the two girls sat in an angle of the old walls looking over the sea to eastward The glow of the setting sun behind them touched them softly and threw a rosy color upon Joe s pale face and gilded Sybil s bright hair hovering about her brows in a halo of radiant glory Joe looked at her and wondered at the change love had wrought in so short a time Sybil had once seemed so cold and white that only a nun s veil could be a fit thing to bind upon her saintly head but now the orange blossoms would look better there Joe thought twined in a bride s wreath of white and green of purity and hope My Snow Angel she exclaimed the sun has melted you at last Tell me the story of the Snow Angel said Sybil smiling You once said that you would I will tell you said Joe as well I can remember it Mamma used to tell it to me years and years ago when I was quite a small thing It is a pretty story Listen Once on a time far away in the north there lived an angel She was very very beautiful and all of the purest snow quite white her face and her hands and her dress and her wings She lived alone ever so far away all through the long winter in a valley of beautiful snow where the sun never shone even in the summer She was the most lovely angel that ever was but she was so cold that she could not fly at all and so she waited in the valley always looking southward and wishing with all her heart that the sun would rise above the hill Sometimes people passed far down below in sledges and she almost would have asked some one of them to take her out of the valley But once when she came near the track a man came by and saw her and he was so dreadfully frightened that he almost fell out of the sled Sometimes too the little angels who were young and curious would fly down into the cold valley and look at her and speak to her Pretty angel they would say why do you stay all alone in this dreary place They forgot me here she used to answer and now I cannot fly until the sun is over the hill But I am very happy It will soon come It was too cold for the little angels and so they soon flew away and left her and they began to call her the Snow Angel among themselves and some of them said she was not real but the other ones said she must be because she was so beautiful She was not unhappy because angels never can be you know only it seemed a long time to wait for the sun to come But at last the sun heard of her and the little angels who had seen her told him it was a shame that he should not rise high enough to warm her and help her to fly So as he is big and good natured and strong he said he would try and would do his best and on midsummer s day he determined to make a great effort He shook himself and pushed and struggled very hard and got hotter than he had ever been in his whole life with his exertions but at last with a great brave leap he found himself so high that he could see right down into the valley and he saw the Snow Angel standing there and she was so beautiful that he almost cried with joy And then as he looked he saw a very wonderful sight The Snow Angel all white and glistening looked up into the sun s face and stretched her arms towards him and trembled all over and as she felt that he was come at last and had begun to warm her she thrust out her delicate long wings and they gleamed and shone and struck the cold clear air Then the least possible tinge of exquisite color came into her face and she opened her lips and sang for joy and presently as she was singing she rose straight upward with a rushing sound like a lark in the sunlight the whitest and purest and most beautiful angel that ever flew in the sky And her voice was so grand and clear and ringing that all the other angels stopped in their songs to listen and then sang with her in joy because the Snow Angel was free at last That is the story mamma used to tell me long ago and when I first saw you I thought of it because you were so cold and beautiful that you seemed all made of snow But now the sun is over the hill Sybil dear is it not Dear Joe said Sybil winding her arm round her friend s neck and laying her face close to hers you are so nice The sun sank suddenly behind them and all the eastern water caught the purple glow It was dark when the two girls walked slowly back to the old house Joe stayed many days with Sybil at Sherwood and the days ran into weeks and the weeks to months as the summer sped by Ronald came and went daily spending long hours with Sybil in the garden and growing more manly and quiet in his happiness while Sybil grew ever fairer in the gradual perfecting of her beauty It was comforting to Joe to see them together knowing what honest hearts they were She occupied herself as she could with books and a few letters but she would often sit for hours in a deep chair under the overhanging porch where the untrimmed honeysuckle waved in the summer breeze like a living curtain and the birds would come and swing themselves upon its tendrils But Joe s cheek was always pale and her heart weary with longing and with fighting against the poor imprisoned love that no one must ever guess CHAPTER XXI The wedding day was fixed for the middle of August and the ceremony was to take place in Newport It is not an easy matter to arrange the marriage of two young people neither of whom has father or mother though their subsequent happiness is not likely to suffer much by the bereavement It was agreed however that missus Wyndham who was Sybil s oldest friend should come and stay at Sherwood until everything was finished and she answered the invitation by saying she was perfectly wild to come and she came at once Uncle Tom Sherwood was a little confused at the notion of having his house full of people but Sybil had been amusing herself by reorganizing the place for some time back and there is nothing easier than to render a great old fashioned country mansion habitable for a few days in the summer when carpets are useless and smoking chimneys are not a necessity missus Wyndham said that Sam would come down for the wedding and stay over the day but that she expected he was pretty busy just now By the way she remarked you know John Harrington has come home We must send him an invitation The three ladies were walking in the garden after breakfast hatless and armed with parasols Joe started slightly but no one noticed it When did he come where has he been all this time asked Sybil Oh I do not know He came down to see Sam the other day at our place He seems to have taken to business They talked about the Monroe doctrine and the Panama canal and all kinds of things Sam says somebody has died and left him money Anyway he seems a good deal interested in the canal missus Wyndham chatted on planning with Sybil the details of the wedding The breakfast was to be at Sherwood and there were not to be many people Indeed the distance would keep many away a fact for which no one of those principally concerned was at all sorry John Harrington sweltering in the heat of New York and busier than he had ever been in his life received an engraved card to the effect that mister Thomas Sherwood requested the pleasure of mister Harrington s company at the marriage of his grandniece Miss Sybil Brandon to mister Ronald Surbiton at Sherwood on the fifteenth of August There was also a note from missus Wyndham saying that she was staying at Sherwood and that she hoped John would be able to come John had of course heard of the engagement but he had not suspected that the wedding would take place so soon In spite of his business however he determined to be present A great change had come over his life since he had bid Joe good by six months earlier He had been called to London as he had expected and had arrived there to find that Z was dead and that he was to take his place in the council The fiery old man had died very suddenly having worked almost to his last hour in spite of desperate illness but when it was suspected that his case was hopeless John Harrington was warned that he must be ready to join the survivors at once In the great excitement and amidst the constant labor of his new position the past seemed to sink away to utter insignificance His previous exertions the short sharp struggle for the senatorship ending in defeat the hopes and fears of ten years of a most active life were forgotten and despised in the realization of what he had so long and so ardently desired and now at last he saw that his dreams were no impossibility and that his theories were not myths But he knew also that with all his strength and devotion and energy he was as yet no match for the two men with whom he had to do Their vast experience of men and things threw his own knowledge into the shade and cool as he was in emergencies he recognized that the magnitude of the matters they handled astonished and even startled him more than he could have believed possible Years must elapse before he understood what seemed as plain as the day to them and he must fight many desperate battles before he was their equal But the determination to devote his life wholly and honestly to the one object for which a man should live had grown stronger than ever In his exalted view the ideal republic assumed grand and noble proportions and already overshadowed the whole earth with the glory of honor and peace and perfect justice Before the advancing tide of a spotless civilization all poverty all corruption and filthiness all crime all war and corroding seeds of discord were swept utterly away and washed from the world to leave only forever and ever the magnificent harmony of nations and peoples wherein none of those vile base and wicked things should even be dreamed of or so much as remembered He thought of Joe sometimes wondering rather vaguely why she had acted as she had and whether any other motive than pure sympathy with his work had made her resent so violently Vancouver s position towards him It was odd he thought that an English girl should find such extreme interest in American political doings and then the scene in the dim sitting room during the ball came vividly back to his memory It was not in his nature to fancy that every woman who was taken with a fit of coughing was in love with him but the conviction formed itself in his mind that he might possibly have fallen in love with Joe if things had been different As it was he had put away such childish things and meant to live out his years of work with their failure or success without love and without a wife He would always be grateful to Joe but that would be all and he would be glad to see her whenever an opportunity offered just as he would be glad to see any other friend In this frame of mind he arrived in Newport on the morning of the wedding and reached the little church among the trees just in time to witness the ceremony It was not different from other weddings excepting perhaps that the place where the High Church portion of Newport elects to worship is probably smaller than any other consecrated building in the world Every seat was crowded and it was with difficulty that John could find standing room just within the door The heat was intense and the horses that stood waiting in the avenue sweated in the sun as they fought the flies and pawed the hard road in an agony of impatience Sybil was exquisitely lovely as she went by on old mister Sherwood s arm The old gentleman had consented to assume a civilized garb for once in his life and looked pleased with his aged self as well he might be seeing that the engagement had been made under his roof Then Ronald passed paler than usual but certainly the handsomest man present carrying himself with a new dignity as though he knew himself a better man than ever in being found worthy of his beautiful bride It was soon over and the crowd streamed out after the bride and bridegroom Hallo Harrington how are you said Vancouver overtaking John as he turned into the road You had better get in with me and drive out I have not seen you for an age John stood still and surveyed Vancouver with a curiously calm air of absolute superiority Thank you very much he answered civilly I have hired a carriage to take me there I dare say we shall meet Good morning John had been to Sherwood some years before but he was surprised at the change that had been wrought in honor of the marriage The place looked inhabited the windows were all open and the paths had been weeded though Sybil had not allowed the wild shrubbery to be pruned nor the box hedges to be trimmed She loved the pathless confusion of the old grounds and most of all she loved the dilapidated summer house John shook hands with many people that he knew missus Wyndham led him aside a little way Is it not just perfectly splendid she exclaimed They are so exactly suited to each other I feel as if I had done it all You are not at all enthusiastic On the contrary said John I am very enthusiastic It is the best thing that could possibly have happened Then go and do likewise returned missus Sam laughing Then she changed her tone There is a young lady here who will be very glad to see you Go and try and cheer her up a little can t you Who is that A young lady over there close to Sybil dressed in white with roses Don t you see How stupid you are There the second on the left Do you mean to say that is Miss Thorn exclaimed John in much surprise and looking where missus Sam directed him Good Heavens How she has changed Yes she has changed a good deal said missus Wyndham looking at John s face I hardly think I should have known her said John She must have been very ill what has been the matter The matter Well perhaps if you will go and speak to her you will see what the matter is answered missus Sam enigmatically What do you mean John looked at his companion in astonishment I mean just exactly what I say Go and talk to her and cheer her up a little She dropped her voice and spoke close to Harrington s ear No one else in the world can she added John s impulse was to answer missus Wyndham sharply What possible right could she have to say such things It was extremely bad taste if it was nothing worse even with an old friend like John But he checked the words on his lips and spoke coldly It is not fair to say things like that about any girl he answered I will certainly go and speak to her at once and if you will be good enough to watch you will see that I am the most indifferent of persons in her eyes Very well I will watch said missus Wyndham not in the least disconcerted Only take care John smiled quietly and made his way through the crowd of gaily dressed laughing people to here Joe was standing She had not yet caught sight of him but she knew he was in the room and she felt very nervous She intended to treat him with friendly coolness as a protest against her conduct in former days Poor Joe she was very miserable but she had made a brave effort Her pale cheeks and darkened eyes contrasted painfully with the roses she wore and her short nervous remarks to those who spoke to her sounded very unlike her former self How do you do Miss Thorn John said very quietly It is a long time since we met Joe put her small cold hand in his and it trembled so much that John noticed it She turned her head a little away from him frightened now that he was at last come Yes she said in a low voice it is a long time She felt herself turn red and then pale and as she looked away from John she met missus Wyndham s black eyes turned full upon her in an inquiring way She started as though she had been caught in some wrong thing but she was naturally brave and after the first shock she spoke to John more naturally We seem destined for festivities mister Harrington she said trying to laugh We parted at a ball and we meet again at a wedding It is always more gay to meet than to part answered John I think this is altogether one of the gayest things I ever saw What a splendid fellow your cousin is It does one good to see men like that Yes Ronald is very good looking said Joe I am so very glad you do not know and he is so happy Any man ought to be who marries such a woman said John By the bye he added with a smile Vancouver takes it all very comfortably does he not I would like to know what he really feels I am sure that whatever it is it is something bad said Joe How you hate him exclaimed John with a laugh I I do not hate him But you ought to mister Harrington I simply despise him that is all No I do not hate him either answered John I would not disturb my peace of mind for the sake of hating any one It is not worth while Some one came and spoke to Joe and John moved away in the crowd more disturbed in mind than he cared to acknowledge He had gone to Joe s side in the firm conviction that missus Wyndham was only making an untimely jest and that Joe would greet him indifferently Instead she had blushed turned paler hesitated in her speech and had shown every sign of confusion and embarrassment He knew that missus Wyndham was right after all and he avoided her not wishing to give a fresh opportunity for making remarks upon Joe s manner The breakfast progressed and the people wandered out into the garden from the hot rooms seeking some coolness in the shady walks By some chain of circumstances which John could not explain he found himself left alone with Joe an hour after he had first met her in the house A little knot of acquaintances had gone out to the end of one of the walks where there was a shady old bower and presently they had paired off and moved away in various directions leaving John and Joe together The excitement had brought the faint color to the girl s face at last and she was more than usually inclined to talk partly from nervous embarrassment and partly from the enlivening effect of so many faces she had not seen for so long Tell me she said pulling a leaf from the creepers and twisting it in her fingers tell me how long was it before you forgot your disappointment about the election Or did you think it was not worth while to disturb your peace of mind for anything so trivial I suppose I could not help it said John I was dreadfully depressed at first I told you so do you remember Of course you were and I was very sorry for you I told you you would lose it long before but you do not seem to care in the least now I do not understand you at all I soon got over it said John I left Boston on the day after I saw you and went straight to London And then I found that a friend of mine was dead and I had so much to do that I forgot everything that had gone before Joe gave a little sigh short and sharp and quickly checked You have a great many friends have you not she said Yes very many A man cannot have too many of the right sort I do not think you and I mean the same thing by friendship said Joe I should say one cannot have too few I mean friends who will help you at the right moment that is when you ask help Surely it must be good to have many Everything that you do and say always turns to one and the same end said Joe a little impatiently The one thing you live for is power and the hope of power Is there nothing in the world worth while save that Power itself is worth nothing It is the thing one means to get with it that is the real test Of course But tell me is anything you can obtain by all the power the world holds better than the simple happiness of natural people who are born and live good lives and fall in love and marry and that sort of thing and are happy and die Joe looked down and turned the leaf she held in her fingers as she stated her proposition John Harrington paused before he answered A moment earlier he had been as calm and cold as he was wont to be now he suddenly hesitated The strong blood rushed to his brain and beat furiously in his temples and then sank heavily back to his heart leaving his face very pale His fingers wrung each other fiercely for a moment He looked away at the trees he turned to Josephine Thorn and then once more he gazed at the dark foliage motionless in the hot air of the summer s afternoon Yes he said I think there are things much better than those in the world But his voice shook strangely and there was no true ring in it Joe sighed again In the distance she could see Ronald and Sybil as they stood under the porch shaking hands with the departing guests She looked at them so radiant and beautiful with the fulfilled joy of a perfect love and she looked at the stern strong man by her side whose commanding face bore already the lines of care and trouble and who he said had found something better than the happiness of yonder bride and bridegroom She sighed and she said in her woman s heart that they were right and that John Harrington was wrong Come she said rising and her words had a bitter tone let us go in it is late John did not move He sat like a stone paler than death and said no word in answer Joe turned and looked at him as though wondering why he did not follow her She was terrified at the expression in his face Are you not coming she asked suddenly going close to him and looking into his eyes CHAPTER XXII Joe was frightened she stood and looked into Harrington s eyes doubting what she should do not understanding what was occurring He looked so pale and strange as he sat there that she was terrified She came a step nearer to him and tried to speak What is the matter mister Harrington she stammered Speak you frighten me Harrington looked at her for one moment more and then without speaking buried his face in his hands Joe clasped her hands to her side in a sudden pain her heart beat as though it would break and the scene swam round before her in the hot air She tried to move another step towards the bench and her strength almost failed her she caught at the lattice of the old summer house still pressing one hand to her breast The rotten slabs of the wood work cracked under her light weight She breathed hard and her face was as pale as the shadows on driven snow in another moment she sank down upon the bench beside John and sat there staring vacantly out at the sunlight Harrington felt her gentle presence close to him and at last looked up every feature of his strong face seemed changed in the convulsive fight that rent his heart and soul to their very depths the enormous strength of his cold and dominant nature rose with tremendous force to meet and quell the tempest of his passion and could not dark circles made heavy shadows under his deep set eyes and his even lips left colorless and white were strained upon his clenched teeth God help me I love you That was all he said but in his words the deep agony of a mortal struggle rang strangely the knell of the old life and the birth chime of the new One by one the words he had never thought to speak fell from his lips distinctly the oracle of the heart answered the great question of fate in its own way Josephine Thorn sat by his side her hands lying idly in her lap her thin white face pressing against the old brown lattice while a spray of the sweet honeysuckle that climbed over the wood work just touched her bright brown hair As John spoke she tried to lift her head and struggled to put out her hand but could not As the shadows steal at evening over the earth softly closing the flowers and touching them to sleep silently and lovingly in the promise of a bright waking so as she sat there her eyelids drooped and the light faded gently from her face her lips parted a very little and with a soft breathed sigh she sank into unconsciousness John Harrington was in no state to be surprised or startled by anything that happened He saw indeed that she had fainted but with the unerring instinct of a great love he understood With the tenderness of his strength he put one arm about her and drew her to him till her fair head rested upon his shoulder and he looked into her face In a few moments he had passed completely from the old life to a life which he had never believed possible but which had nevertheless been long present with him He knew it and felt it quickly realizing that for the first time since he could remember he was wholly and perfectly happy He was a man who had dreamed of all that is noble and great for man to do who had consecrated his every hour and minute to the attainment of his end and though his aim was in itself a good one the undivided concentration which the pursuit of it required had driven him into a state outwardly resembling extreme egotism He had loved his own purposes as he had loved nothing else and as he had been persuaded that he could love nothing else in the whole world Now suddenly he knew his own heart There is something beyond mere greatness beyond the pursuit of even the highest worldly aims there is something which is not a means to the attainment of happiness which is happiness itself It is an inner sympathy of hearts and souls and minds a perfect union of all that is most worthy in the natures of man and woman it is a plant so sensitive that a breath of unkindness will hurt it and blight its beauty and yet it is a tree so strong that neither time nor tempest can overthrow it when it has taken root and if you would tear it out and destroy it the place where it grew is as deep and as wide as a grave It is a bond that is as soft as silk and as strong as death binding hearts not hands so long as it is not strained a man will hardly know that he is bound but if he would break it he will spend his strength in vain and suffer the pains of hell for it is the very essence and nature of a true love that it cannot be broken With such men as John Harrington love at first sight is an utter impossibility The strong dominant aspirations that lead them are a light too brilliant to be outshone by any sudden flash of hot passion Love when it comes to them is of slow growth but enduring in the same proportion as it is slow identifying itself by degrees so small that a man himself is unconscious of it with the deepest feelings of the heart and the highest workings of the intellect It steals silently into the soul in the guise of friendship asking nothing but loyal friendship in return in the appearance of kindness which asks but a little gratitude in the semblance of a calm and passionless trustfulness demanding only a like trust as its equivalent pledge a like faith as a gauge for its own an equal measure of charity for an equal and so love builds himself a temple of faith and charity and trust and kindness and honest friendship and rejoices exceedingly in the whole goodness and strength and beauty of the place where he will presently worship When that day comes he stands in the midst and kindles a strong clear flame upon the altar and the fire burns and leaps and illuminates the whole temple of love which is indeed the holy of holies of the temple of life John Harrington through five and thirty years of his life had believed that the patient labor of a powerful intellect could suffice to a man in its results for the attainment of all that humanity most honors even for the wise and unerring government of humanity itself To that end and in that belief he had honestly given every energy he possessed and had sternly choked down every tendency he felt in his inner nature toward a life less intellectual and more full of sympathy for the affairs of individual mankind With him to be strong was to be cold to be warm was to be weak and subject to error a supreme devotion to his career and a supreme disdain of all personal affections were the conditions of success which he deemed foremostly necessary and he had come to an almost superstitious belief in the idea that the love of woman is the destruction of the intellectual man Himself ready to sacrifice all he possessed and to spend his last strength in the struggle for an ideal he had nevertheless so identified his own person with the object he strove to attain that he regarded all the means he could possibly control with as much jealousy as though he had been the most selfish of men Friends he looked upon as tools for his trade and he valued them not only in proportion to their honesty and loyalty of heart but also in the degree of their power and intelligence He sought no friendships which could not help him and relinquished none that could be of service in the future But the world is not ruled by intellect though it is sometimes governed by brute force and yet more brutal passions The dominant power in the affairs of men is the heart Humanity is moved far more by what it feels than by what it knows and those who would be rulers of men must before all things be men themselves and not merely highly finished intellectual machines The guests were gone no one had missed Harrington and Joe and Ronald and Sybil had gone into the house They sat side by side in the little bower at the end of the long walk Joe s fair head resting in her unconsciousness upon John s shoulder Presently she stirred and opening her eyes looked up into his face She drew gently away from him and a warm blush spread quickly over her pale cheek she glanced down at her small white hands and they clasped each other convulsively John looked at her suddenly his gray eyes grew dark and deep and the mighty passion took all his strength into its own so that he trembled and turned pale again But the words failed him no longer now He knew in a moment all that he had to say and he said it You must not be angry with me Miss Thorn he began you must not think I am losing my head Let me tell you now perhaps you will listen to me God knows I am not worthy to say such things to you but I will try to be It is soon said I love you I can no more help loving you than I can help breathing You have utterly changed me and saved me and made a life for me out of what was not life at all Do not think it is sudden what is really to last forever must take some time in growing I never knew till to day I honored you and would have done everything in the world for you and I was more grateful to you than I ever was to any human being But I thought when we met we should be friends just as we always were and instead of that I know that this is the great day of my life and that my life with all that it holds is yours now for always to do with as you will Pray hear me out do not be afraid no man ever honored you as I honor you Joe glanced quickly at him and then again looked down but the surging blood came and went in her face coursing madly in her pulses every beat of her heart crying gladness It is little enough I have to offer you said John his voice growing unsteady in the great effort to speak calmly There was something almost terrible in the strength of his rising passion It is little enough my poor life with its wretched struggles after what is perhaps far too great for me But such as it is I offer it to you Take it if you will Be my wife and give me the right to do all I do for your sake and for your sake only He stretched out his hand and took hers very gently but the strained sinews of his wrist trembled violently Josephine made no resistance but she still looked down and said nothing Use me as you will he continued almost in a whisper I will be all to you that man ever was to a living woman Do not say I have no right to ask you for as much I have this right that I love you beyond the love of other men so truly and wholly I love you I will serve you so faithfully I will honor you so loyally that you will love me too Say the word my beloved say that it is not impossible I will wait I will work I will strive to be worthy of you He pressed his white lips to her white hand and tried to look into her eyes but she turned away from him Will you not speak to me Will you not give to me some word some hope I can never love you less whatever you may answer me yes or no but oh if you knew the difference to me Pale as death John looked at Joe She turned to him very white and gazed into the dark gray depths of his eyes where the raging force of a transcendent passion played so wildly but she felt no fear only a mad longing to speak Tell me for God s sake tell me John said in low trembling tones have I hurt you Is it too much that I ask For one moment there was silence as they gazed at each other Then with a passionate impulse Josephine buried her face in her hands upon John s shoulder No it is not that she sobbed I love you so much I have loved you so long CHAPTER XXIII John Harrington and Josephine Thorn were married in the autumn of that year and six months later John was elected to the Senate With characteristic patience he determined to await a favorable opportunity before speaking at any length in the Capitol He loved his new life and the instinct to take a leading part was strong in him but he knew too well the importance of the first impression made by a long speech to thrust himself forward until the right moment came It chanced that the presidential election took place in that year just a twelvemonth after John s marriage and the unusual occurrences that attended the struggle gave him the chance he desired Three candidates were supported nearly equally by the East the West and the South and on opening the sealed documents in the presence of the two houses it was found that no one of the three had obtained the majority necessary to elect him The country was in a state of unparalleled agitation The imminent danger was that the non election of the candidate from the West would produce a secession of the Western States from the Union in the same way that a revolution was nearly brought about in eighteen seventy six during the contest between mister Hayes and mister Tilden In this position of affairs the electors being unable to agree upon any one of the three candidates the election was thrown into the hands of Congress in accordance with the clause of the Constitution which provides that in such cases the House of Representatives shall elect a president each State having but one vote Harrington had made many speeches in different parts of the country during the election campaign and had attracted much attention by his calm good sense in such excited times There was consequently a manifest desire among senators and representatives to hear him speak in the Capitol and upon the day when the final election of the President took place he judged that his opportunity had come Josephine was in the ladies gallery and as John rose to his feet he looked long and fixedly up to her gathering more strength to do well what he so much loved to do from gazing at her whom he loved better than power or fame or any earthly thing His eyes shone and his cheek paled his old life with all its energy and active work was associated in his mind with failure with discontent and with solitude his new life with her by his side was brilliant happy and successful He felt within him the strength to move thousands the faith in his cause and in his power to help it which culminates in great deeds His strong voice rang out clear and far heard as he spoke mister PRESIDENT We are here to decide on behalf of our country a great matter Many of us many more who are scattered over the land will look back upon this day as one of the most important in our times and for their sakes as well as our own we are bound to summon all our strength of intelligence and all our calmness of judgment to aid us in our decision The question in which a certain number of ourselves are to become arbitrators is briefly this Are we to act on this occasion like partisans straining every nerve for the advantage of our several parties or are we to act like free men exerting our united forces in one harmonious body for the immediate good of the whole country The struggle may seem at first sight to be a battle between the East the West and the South In sober earnest it is a contest between the changing principles of party politics on the one hand and the undying principle of freedom on the other I need not make any long statement of the case to you We are here assembled to elect a President Our position is almost unprecedented in the history of the country Instead of acquiescing in the declared will of the people our fellow citizens we are told that the people s wish is divided and we are called upon to act spontaneously for the people in accordance with the constitution of our country By our individual and unhampered votes the life of the country is to be determined for the next four years Let us not forget the vast responsibility that is upon us Let us join our hands and say to each other We are no longer Republicans nor Democrats nor Independents we are one party the party of the Union and there are none against us A partisan is not necessarily a man who asserts a truth and defends it with his whole strength A partisan means one who takes up his position with a party There is a limit where a partisan becomes an asserter of falsehood and that limit is reached when a man resigns his own principles into the judgment of another his conscience into another s keeping when a man gives up free thought free judgment and free will in absolute and blind adherence to a set of thoughts judgments and decisions over which he exercises no control and in the formation of which he has but one voice in many millions Every one remembers the fable of the old man who when dying made his sons break their staves one by one and then bade them bind a bundle of others together and to try and break them by one effort In the uniting of individuals in a party there is strength but there must also be complete unity If the old man had bidden his sons bind their staves in several bundles instead of in one the result would have been doubtful That is what party spirit makes men do Party spirit is a universal solvent it is the great acid the aqua fortis of political alchemy which eats through bands of steel and corrodes pillars of iron in its acrid virulence till the whole engine of a nation s government is crumbled and dissolved into a shapeless and a worse than useless mass of broken metal Man is free his will is free his choice his judgments his capacity for thought and his power to profit by it are all as free as air just so long as he remembers that they are his own no longer When he forgets that he is his own master absolutely and entirely he becomes another man s slave The contest here is between political passion roused to its fiercest pitch by the antagonism of parties and the universal liberty of opinion which we all say we possess while so few of us dare honestly exercise it This passion this political frenzy that seizes men and whirls them in its eddies is a most singular compound of patriotism of enthusiasm for an individual and of the personal hopes fears generosity and avarice of the individual who is enthusiastic It is a passion which existing in others can be turned to account by the cool leader who does not possess it but which may too easily bring ruin upon the man who is led The danger ahead is this same party spirit this wild and thoughtless frenzy in matters where unbiased judgment is most of all necessary It is a rock upon which we have split before it has taken us many years to recover from the shock and now we are in danger of altogether losing our political life upon the same reef Unless we mend our course we inevitably shall Men forego every consideration of public honor and private conscience for the sake of electing a party candidate The man at the helm of the party ship has declared that he will sail due north or south or east or west whatever happens and his crew laugh together and keep no lookout they even feel a certain pride in their leader who thus defies the accidents of nature for the sake of sailing in a fixed direction What is the result of all this It is here before us The country is splitting into parties Three candidates are set up for the office of President Three distinct parties stand in the field each one vowing vengeance secession revolution utter dismemberment of the Union unless its chosen champion is elected to be chief of the Executive Department Is this to be the life of our Republic in future Is this all that so many millions of free citizens can do for the public good and for public harmony What shall we gain by electing the candidate from the North if the defeated candidate from the South is determined to produce a revolution and if the disappointed candidate from the West threatens to touch off the dry powder and spring the mine of a great western secession Have we not seen all this before Has not the bitter cry of a nation s broken heart gone up to heaven already in mortal agony for these very things to which our uncontrollable political passions are hourly leading us The contest is between political passion on the one hand and universal liberty on the other Liberty in some countries is a kind of charade word an anagram a symbol representing an imaginary quantity a password invented by unhappy men to express all that they do not possess a term meaning in the minds of slaves a conglomerate of conditions so absurd of aspirations so futile of imaginary delights so fantastically unreasonable that if the ideal state of which the chained dreamers rave were realized but for one moment humanity would start in amazement at the first glimpse of so much monstrosity and by and by would hold its sides with laughter at the folly of its deluded fellows In most countries where liberty is talked of it is but a dream and such a dream as could only occur to the sickened fancy of a generation of bondsmen But it means something else with us It is here in this country in this capital in this hall it is in the air we breathe in the light we see in the strong free pulses of our blood it is the heritage of men whose sires died for it whose fathers laid down all they had for it of men whose own veins have bled for it and not in vain In these United States liberty is a fact We must decide quickly then between the conditions of our liberty and the requirements of frantic political passion We must decide between peace and war for that is where the issue will come in the end Between freedom prosperity and peace on the one side and a civil war on the other an alternative so horrible and inhuman and hideous that the very mention of it makes brave men shiver in disgust at the memories the word recalls Do you think we are much further from it now than we were in eighteen sixty Do you think we were far from it in eighteen seventy six It is a short step from the threat to the deed when political passion is already turning to bitter personal hate In our times there is much talk of civilization and culture Two words define all that is necessary to be known about them Civilization is peace The uncivilized state of man is incessant war Culture is conscience because conscience means the exercise of honest judgment and an ignorant people can form no honest judgment of their own which can be exercised In a state of peace educated and truthful men judge fairly and act sensibly on their decisions In other words the majority is right and free In times of war and in times of great ignorance majorities have rarely been either free or right It is a bad sign of the times when education increases and truth disappears They ought to grow together for education means absolutely nothing but the teaching and learning of what is true If it does not mean that it means nothing In some countries the idea of truth is coexistent with the idea of destroying all existing forms of belief Some silly person recently went so far as to raise the cry in this country Separate Church and State If there is a country where they are absolutely separated it is ours but let the beliefs of mankind take care of themselves I dare say there will be Christians left in the world even when Professor Huxley has written his last book and when Colonel Ingersoll has delivered his last lecture I am reminded of the Chinese philosopher and political economist who answered when he was asked about religious matters Do you understand this world so well that you need occupy yourselves with another The issue turns upon no such absurdities neither does it rest with any consideration of so called platforms free trade civil service free navigation tariff reform and all the rest of those things The real issue is between civilization and barbarism between peace and war Be warned in this great strait I believe we need few principles but universal ones I believe in the republic because it was founded in simplicity and has been built up in strength by the strongest of strong men because its existence proves the greatest truth with which we ever have to do namely that men are born equal and free although they may grow up slaves to their evil passions and become greater or less according as they manfully put their hands to the plough or ignobly lie down and let themselves be trampled upon The battle of life is to the stronger but no man is so weak that he cannot raise himself a little if he will according to the abilities that are born in him and nowhere can he raise himself so speedily and securely as on this free soil of ours Nowhere can he go so far without being molested for nowhere can man put himself so closely and trustfully in the keeping of nature certain that she will not fail him certain that she will yield him a thousand fold for his labor There are indeed times in the history of a great institution when it is just as well as necessary to reconsider the principles upon which it is founded There are times in the life of a great nation when it behooves her chief men to examine and see whether the basis of her constitution is a sound one and whether she can continue to grow great without any change in the fundamental conditions of her development It is a bad and a dangerous time for a growing nation but it is an almost inevitable stage in her life Thank God that time is past with us Let us not think of the possibility of exposing ourselves again to civil war as an alternative against retrogression into barbarism Civilization is peace and to extend civilization is to increase the security of property in the world of property and life and conscience The natural and barbarous state of man is that where the human animal satisfies its cravings without any thought of consequences The cultivated state is that where humanity has ceased to be merely animal and considers the consequences first and the cravings afterwards Civilization unites men so that they dwell together in harmony to separate them into parties that strive to annihilate each other is to undo the work of civilization to plunge the state into civil war to hew it in pieces and split it and tear it to shreds till the magnificent body of thinking beings acting as one man for the public good is reduced to the miserable condition of a handful of hostile tribes whose very existence depends upon successful robbery and well timed violence Party spirit so long as it is only a force which binds together a number of men of honest purposes and opinions is a good thing and it is by its means that just and powerful majorities are formed and guided But where party spirit loses sight of the characters of men and judges them according as they are Republicans or Democrats instead of considering whether they are good or bad citizens when party spirit becomes a machine for obtaining power by fair or foul means instead of a fixed principle for upholding the fair against the foul then there is great danger that the majority itself is losing its liberty and upon the liberty of majorities depends ultimately the stability and prosperity of the republic Consider what is the history of the average politician to day of the man whose personal character is as good as that of his neighbor who has always belonged to the same party and who looks forward to the hope of political distinction Consider how he has struggled through all manner of difficulties to his present position striving always to maintain good relations with the chiefs of his party while often acknowledging in his heart that he would act differently were his connection with those chiefs a matter of less vital importance to himself He probably will tell you that his profession is politics He has sacrificed much to obtain his seat in Congress or his position in office and he knows that henceforth he must live by it or else begin life over again in another sphere At all events for a term of years his personal prosperity depends upon the use he can make of his hold upon the public goods He is not individually to be blamed perhaps for he follows a precedent as widely recognized as it is universally pernicious It is the system that is to be blamed the general belief that a man can and justly may support himself by clinging to a set of principles of which he does not honestly approve that he may earn his daily meal since it comes to that in the end by doing jobs which in the free state he would despise as unworthy and by speaking boldly in support of measures which he knows to be injurious to the welfare of the country That is the history the epitome of the ends and aims and manner of being of the average politician in our day He has ventured into the waters of political life and they have risen around him till he must use all his strength in keeping his head above them though the torrent carry him whither it will and whither he would not There are no compromises when a man is drowning There are many who are not in any such position There are men great and honest and disinterested in the highest sense of the word men whose whole lives prove it whose whole record is one of honor and truth whose following consists of men they have themselves chosen as their friends We are not obliged to select a drowning man for our President we can choose a man who stands on his own feet upon dry ground There is an old proverb which contains much wisdom Tell me who are your friends and I will tell you what you are Is a man fit to stand at the head of a community of men when he has associated with a set of parasites who live upon his leavings and will starve him if they can in order to enjoy his portion Consider what is the position of the President of the United States Think what vast power is placed in the hands of one man what vast interests of public and private good are at stake what an endless sequence of events and results of events must follow upon the individual action of the chief of the Executive Department and remember how free and untrammeled that individual action is A people who elect an officer to such a position need surely to be cautious in their choice and circumspect in their judgment of the man elected They must satisfy themselves about what he is likely to do by judging honestly what he has done they must know who are his friends his supporters his advisers in order to judge of the friends he will make They must take into their consideration also the character of his colleague the vice president and the effect upon the country and the country s relation with the world should any disaster suddenly throw the vice president into office We cannot afford to elect a vice president who would destroy the national credit in a week should the President himself be overtaken by death We must remember to count the cost of what we are doing not passing over one item because another item seems just We cannot overlook the future nor disregard the influence which our election has upon the next the steps which men once in office may take in order to secure to themselves another term or to strengthen the position of the men whom they desire to succeed them In a word we must put forth all our strength We must be cool far sighted and impartial in such times as these And yet how has this campaign been hitherto conducted Practically by raising a party cry by exciting every species of evil passion of which man is capable by tickling the cupidity of one man and flattering the ambitions of another by intimidating the weak and groveling before the strong by every species of fawning sycophancy on the one hand and brutal overbearing bullying on the other Party party party A man would rather commit a crime than vote against his party The evil runs through the country from East to West from North to South eating at the nation s heartstrings gnawing at her sinews and undermining her strength The time is coming is even now come when two or three parties no longer suffice to express the disunion of the Union There are three to day to morrow there will be five the next day ten twenty a hundred till every man s hand is against his fellow and his fellow s against him The divisions have grown so wide that the majority and the minority are but the extremities of a countless set of internecine majorities and minorities Members of parties are bound no longer by the honest determination to do the right to choose the right and to uphold the right they are bound by fearful penalties to support their own man were he the very chiefest outcast of the earth lest the man of another party be elected in his place The adverse candidate is perhaps avowedly better fitted for the office a hundred times more honest more experienced more worthy of respect But he belongs to the enemy Down with him let him perish in his honesty and righteousness There is no good in him for he is a Democrat There is no good in him for he is a Republican He is a scoundrel for he is a Southerner He is a thief for he is a Northerner He is the prince of liars for he comes from the West He is the scum of mankind for he is from the East The people rage and rend each other and the frenzy grows apace with the hour till honor and justice truth and manliness are lost together in the furious chaos of human elements The tortured airs of heaven howl out curses in a horrid unison this fair free soil of ours dishonored and befouled moans beneath our feet in a dismal drone of hopeless woe there is no rock or cavern or ghostly den of our mighty land but hisses back the echo of some hideous curse and hell itself is upon earth split and rent into multiplied hells And the ultimate expression of the senses of these things is money There is the chiefest disgrace We are not worse than the old nations but we have a right to be very much better we have the obligation to be better the unchanging moral obligation which lies upon every man to use the advantage he has We alone among nations are free we alone among nations inhabit a quarter of the world by ourselves and live and grow great in our own way with no thought of the rest Let us think more of living greatly than of prosecuting greatness for the sake of its pecuniary emoluments Let us elect presidents who will give their efforts to making us all great together and not to making some citizens rich at the expense of others who are also citizens A President can do much toward either of these results bad or good He has the future of the republic in his hands as well as the present Let us be the richest among nations since the course of events makes us so but let us not be the most sordid Let it never be said in the land which has given birth to the only true liberty the world has ever seen that liberty can be sold for a few dollars in the market place and bartered against the promise of four years of civil employment at a small salary This party spirit this miserable craving for the good things that may be extracted from the service of a party has produced the crying evil of our times A certain class a very large class call our politics dirty and our politicians dishonest Young men whose education and position in the commonwealth entitle them to a voice in public matters withdraw entirely from all contact with the real life of the country Liberty has become a leper a blind outcast in the eyes of the gilded youth of to day She sits apart in ashes and in rags and asks a little charity of the richest of her children a miserable mother despised and cast out by her sons They will not own her for their mother nor spare one crust to feed her from their plenty They pass by on the other side staring in admiration at the image they have set up for themselves the image of what they consider social excellence an idol compounded of decayed customs and breathing the poisonous emanations of a dead world a monument raised to the prejudices of former times to the petty thirst for aristocratic distinctions which they cherish in their hearts to their love of money show superficial culture and armorial bearings Truly let them perish in the fruition of their contemptible desires Let them set up a thing called society and worship it let them lose themselves in the contemplation of objects whose beauty they can never appreciate save by counting the cost let them disgrace the names their honest fathers bore by striving to establish their descent from houses stained with crime and denied with blood let them disown their fathers and spit in their mothers faces but let them not call themselves free nor give themselves the airs of men They toss their foolish heads in scorn of all that a man holds truest and best We can afford to let them speak if they please even words of contempt and dishonor we can afford to let them say that in laboring for our country we are groveling in mud and defiling our hands with impurity but we cannot afford to let them steal our children from us nor to submit to the pestilent influence of their corruption in our ranks Those who would be of the republic must labor for the public good instead of insolently asserting that there is no good in the public on which they have fattened and thriven so well All honor to those who have set their faces against the growing evil to check it if they can and to lay the foundation of a barrier against which the tidal wave of corruption and dishonesty shall break in vain All praise to the brave men who might live in the indolent lotus eating atmosphere of wasteful idleness but who have put their hand to the wheel of state determined to bear all their might upon the whirling spokes rather than see the good ship go to pieces on the rock ahead They have begun a good work and they have sown a good seed they ask for no reward nor look for the reaping of the harvest They mean to do right and they do it because right is right not because they expect to be rewarded with the spoils or fed with fat tit bits from the feast of party Upon such men as these be they rich or poor we must rely The poor man can make sacrifices as great as the rich for he can forego for his country s sake the promise of ease and the hope of wealth as well as any million maker in the land In the tremendous issue now before us we are called to decide upon the life of the country during the next four years We are chosen to direct the course of a stream from its very source and to turn it into a channel where it will run smoothly to the end For the four years of an administration are like a river The water rises suddenly from the spring and flows swiftly ever increasing in volume as it is swollen by tributaries and absorbs into itself other rivers by the way It may run smoothly in a fair stream moistening barren lands and softening the parched desert into fertility moving great engines of industry with a ceaseless even strength bearing the burden of a mighty and prosperous commerce on its broad bosom spreading plenty and refreshment through the wide pastures by its banks fed on its way by waters so clear that at the last it merges untainted and unsullied into the ocean whence its limpid drops may again be taken up and poured in soft life giving rain upon the earth But in digging for a spring men may find suddenly a torrent that they cannot control It suddenly bursts its bounds and banks and rushes headlong down carrying everything before it in a resistless whirl of devastation tearing great trees up by the roots crashing through villages and towns and factories girding the world with a liquid tempest that sends the works of man spinning down upon its dreadful course till it plunges into the abyss a frantic chaos of indiscriminate destruction storm and death Can any of us here present say that he will that he dare take upon himself the responsibility of electing a President from motives of party prejudice Having it in our power to agree upon the very best man would any of us remember this day without shame if we disgraced those who trust us by giving our votes to a mere party candidate The danger is great imminent universal We can save the country from it I would almost say from death itself by acting in accordance with our honest convictions Is any man so despicable so lost to honor that in such a case he will put aside the welfare of a nation for the miserable sake of party popularity Are we to stand here in the guise and manner of free men knowing that we are driven together like a flock of sheep into the fold by the howling of the wolves outside Are we to strut and plume ourselves upon our unhampered freedom while we act like slaves Worse than slaves we should be if we allowed one breath of party spirit one thought of party aggrandizement to enter into the choice we are about to make Slaves are driven to their work shall we willingly let ourselves be beaten into doing the dirty work of others by sacrificing the nobility of our manhood Do we meet here like paid gladiators of old to cut each other s throats in earnest while attacking and defending a sham fortress raised in the arena for the diversion of those who set us on to the butchery and promise to pay the survivors Are we to provide a feast of carrion for a flock of vultures and unclean beasts of prey when we need only stand together and be true to ourselves and to each other to accomplish one of the greatest acts in history The vultures will leave us alone unless we destroy each other we need not fear them We are not slaves to be terrified into compliance with evil neither are we sheep that we need huddle trembling together at the snarling of a wolf No no indeed were the words heard on all sides in the audience now thoroughly roused I do not say elect this candidate or that one I am not canvassing for any candidate It is too late for that even if it were seemly for me to do so I am canvassing for the cause of liberty against slavery as better men have done before me in this very house I am defending the reputation of unity against the slanderous attack of disunion against the fearful peril of secession I appeal to you as you are men to act as men in this great crisis to put out your strong hands together and avert the overwhelming disaster that threatens us to stand side by side as brothers for we are indeed brothers children of one father and one mother heirs of such magnificent heritage as has not fallen to the lot of mortality before company heirs of freedom and inheritors of the free estate five and fifty millions of free children born to our mother the great republic who bow the knee to no man and call no man master Loud applause greeted this part of the speech I appeal from license to law from division to harmony from the raging turmoil of angry and devouring passion without to the calm serenity that reigns within these walls As we turn in horror and loathing from the unbridled fury of human beings changed almost to beasts so let us turn in hope and security to those things we can honor and respect to the dignity of truth and the unbending strength of unquestioned right I appeal to you to make this day the greatest in your lives the most memorable in our history as a nation Lay aside this day the memories of the past and look forward to the brightness of the future Throw down the weapons of petty and murderous strife and join together in perfect harmony of mutual trust Be neither Republicans nor Democrats nor Independents Be what it is your greatest privilege to be American citizens Cast parties to the winds and uphold the state Trample under your free born feet the badges of party bondage the ignoble chains of party slavery the wretched hopes of party preferment Yes Hear hear He is right cried many voices Yes answered John Harrington in tones that rose to the very roof of the vast building Yes by that blood our fathers shed O Union in thy sacred cause Whilst streaming from the gallant dead It sealed and sanctified thy laws Yes and strong hearts and strong hands will hold their own the promise of brave men will prevail and echoing down the avenues of time will strike grand chords of harmony in the lives of our children and children s children So in the far off ages when hundreds of millions of our flesh and blood shall fill this land dwelling together in the glory of such peace as no turmoil can trouble and no discontent disturb those men of the dim future will remember what we swore to do and what we did and looking back they will say one to another On that day our fathers struck a mighty blow and shattered and crushed and trampled out all dissensions and all party strife forever and ever Choose then of your own heart and will a man to be our President and our leader Elect him with one accord and as you give your voices in the choice stand here together knee to knee shoulder to shoulder hand to hand and let the mighty oath go thundering up to heaven THIS UNION SHALL NOT BE BROKEN End of
