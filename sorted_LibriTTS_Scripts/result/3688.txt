254_145458_000011_000001	train-clean-100	The secret of our favourite restaurant to take a case is guarded jealously from all but a few intimates the secret to take a contrary case of our infallible remedy for seasickness is thrust upon every traveller we meet even if he be no more than a casual acquaintance about to cross the Serpentine So with our books 
254_145458_000011_000002	train-clean-100	There are dearly loved books of which we babble to a neighbour at dinner insisting that she shall share our delight in them and there are books equally dear to us of which we say nothing fearing lest the praise of others should cheapen the glory of our discovery 
254_145458_000011_000003	train-clean-100	The books of Saki were for me at least in the second class 
254_145458_000012_000000	train-clean-100	It was in the WESTMINSTER GAZETTE that I discovered him I like to remember now almost as soon as he was discoverable 
none	none	Let us spare a moment and a tear for those golden days in the early nineteen hundreds when there were five leisurely papers of an evening in which the free lance might graduate and he could speak of his Alma Mater whether the GLOBE or the PALL MALL with as much pride as he never doubted the GLOBE or the PALL MALL would speak one day of him Myself but lately down from saint 
254_145458_000012_000003	train-clean-100	JAMES I was not too proud to take some slight but pitying interest in men of other colleges 
254_145458_000012_000004	train-clean-100	The unusual name of a freshman up at WESTMINSTER attracted my attention I read what he had to say and it was only by reciting rapidly with closed eyes the names of our own famous alumni beginning confidently with Barrie and ending now very doubtfully with myself that I was able to preserve my equanimity 
none	none	Later one heard that this undergraduate from overseas had gone up at an age more advanced than customary and just as Cambridge men have been known to complain of the maturity of Oxford Rhodes scholars so one felt that this WESTMINSTER free lance in the thirties was no fit competitor for the youth of other colleges Indeed it could not compete 
254_145458_000013_000000	train-clean-100	Well I discovered him but only to the few the favoured did I speak of him 
254_145458_000013_000001	train-clean-100	It may have been my uncertainty which still persists whether he called himself Sayki Sahki or Sakki which made me thus ungenerous of his name or it may have been the feeling that the others were not worthy of him but how refreshing it was when some intellectually blown up stranger said Do you ever read Saki to reply with the same pronunciation and even greater condescension Saki 
254_145458_000013_000002	train-clean-100	He has been my favourite author for years 
254_145458_000014_000000	train-clean-100	A strange exotic creature this Saki to us many others who were trying to do it too 
254_145458_000014_000001	train-clean-100	For we were so domestic he so terrifyingly cosmopolitan 
254_145458_000014_000002	train-clean-100	While we were being funny as planned with collar studs and hot water bottles he was being much funnier with werwolves and tigers 
none	none	Our little dialogues were between John and Mary his and how much better between Bertie van Tahn and the Baroness Even the most casual intruder into one of his sketches as it might be our Tomkins had to be called Belturbet or de Ropp and for his hero weary man of the world at seventeen nothing less thrilling than Clovis Sangrail would do 
254_145458_000014_000005	train-clean-100	In our envy we may have wondered sometimes if it were not much easier to be funny with tigers than with collar studs if Saki s careless cruelty that strange boyish insensitiveness of his did not give him an unfair start in the pursuit of laughter 
254_145458_000014_000006	train-clean-100	It may have been so but fortunately our efforts to be funny in the Saki manner have not survived to prove it 
254_145458_000015_000000	train-clean-100	What is Saki s manner what his magic talisman 
254_145458_000015_000001	train-clean-100	Like every artist worth consideration he had no recipe 
none	none	If his exotic choice of subject was often his strength it was often his weakness if his insensitiveness carried him through at times to victory it brought him at times to defeat 
254_145458_000015_000003	train-clean-100	I do not think that he has that mastery of the CONTE in this book at least which some have claimed for him Such mastery infers a passion for tidiness which was not in the boyish Saki s equipment 
none	none	He leaves loose ends everywhere 
254_145458_000015_000005	train-clean-100	Nor in his dialogue delightful as it often is funny as it nearly always is is he the supreme master too much does it become monologue judiciously fed one character giving and the other taking 
254_145458_000015_000006	train-clean-100	But in comment in reference in description in every development of his story he has a choice of words a way of putting things which is as inevitably his own vintage as once tasted it becomes the private vintage of the connoisseur 
254_145458_000016_000000	train-clean-100	Let us take a sample or two of Saki nineteen eleven 
none	none	The earlier stages of the dinner had worn off The wine lists had been consulted by some with the blank embarrassment of a schoolboy suddenly called upon to locate a Minor Prophet in the tangled hinterland of the Old Testament by others with the severe scrutiny which suggests that they have visited most of the higher priced wines in their own homes and probed their family weaknesses
254_145458_000018_000000	train-clean-100	 Locate is the pleasant word here 
254_145458_000018_000001	train-clean-100	Still more satisfying in the story of the man who was tattooed from collar bone to waist line with a glowing representation of the Fall of Icarus is the word privilege 
none	none	The design when finally developed was a slight disappointment to Monsieur Deplis who had suspected Icarus of being a fortress taken by Wallenstein in the Thirty Years War but he was more than satisfied with the execution of the work which was acclaimed by all who had the privilege of seeing it as Pincini s masterpiece This story THE BACKGROUND and missus PACKLETIDE S TIGER seem to me to be the masterpieces of this book 
254_145458_000020_000001	train-clean-100	In both of them Clovis exercises needlessly his titular right of entry but he can be removed without damage leaving Saki at his best and most characteristic save that he shows here in addition to his own shining qualities a compactness and a finish which he did not always achieve 
none	none	With these I introduce you to him confident that ten minutes of his conversation more surely than any words of mine will have given him the freedom of your house A A MILNE CONTENTS ESME THE MATCH MAKER TOBERMORY missus PACKLETIDE S TIGER THE STAMPEDING OF LADY BASTABLE THE BACKGROUND HERMANN THE IRASCIBLE A STORY OF THE GREAT WEEP THE UNREST CURE THE JESTING OF ARLINGTON STRINGHAM SREDNI VASHTAR ADRIAN THE CHAPLET THE QUEST WRATISLAV THE EASTER EGG FILBOID STUDGE THE STORY OF A MOUSE THAT HELPED THE MUSIC ON THE HILL THE STORY OF saint VESPALUUS THE WAY TO THE DAIRY THE PEACE OFFERING THE PEACE OF MOWSLE BARTON THE TALKING OUT OF TARRINGTON THE HOUNDS OF FATE THE RECESSIONAL A MATTER OF SENTIMENT THE SECRET SIN OF SEPTIMUS BROPE MINISTERS OF GRACE THE REMOULDING OF GROBY LINGTON ACKNOWLEDGMENT ESME All hunting stories are the same said Clovis just as all Turf stories are the same and all My hunting story isn t a bit like any you ve ever heard said the Baroness 
1868-145459-0000	train-other-500	It happened quite a while ago when I was about twenty three I wasn t living apart from my husband then you see neither of us could afford to make the other a separate allowance In spite of everything that proverbs may say
1868-145459-0001	train-other-500	poverty keeps together more homes than it breaks up But we always hunted with different packs All this has nothing to do with the story We haven t arrived at the meet yet I suppose there was a meet
1868-145459-0002	train-other-500	said Clovis Of course there was a meet said the Baroness all the usual crowd were there especially Constance Broddle Constance is one of those strapping florid girls that go so well with autumn scenery
1868-145459-0003	train-other-500	or Christmas decorations in church I feel a presentiment that something dreadful is going to happen she said to me am I looking pale She was looking about as pale as a beetroot that has suddenly heard bad news
1868-145459-0004	train-other-500	You re looking nicer than usual I said but that s so easy for you Before she had got the right bearings of this remark we had settled down to business hounds had found a fox lying out in some gorse bushes
1868-145459-0005	train-other-500	I knew it said Clovis in every fox hunting story that I ve ever heard there s been a fox and some gorse bushes Constance and I were well mounted continued the Baroness serenely
1868-145459-0006	train-other-500	and we had no difficulty in keeping ourselves in the first flight though it was a fairly stiff run
none	none	 Towards the finish however we must have held rather too independent a line 
1868-145459-0007	train-other-500	for we lost the hounds and found ourselves plodding aimlessly along miles away from anywhere It was fairly exasperating and my temper was beginning to let itself go by inches
1868-145459-0008	train-other-500	when on pushing our way through an accommodating hedge we were gladdened by the sight of hounds in full cry in a hollow just beneath us There they go cried Constance
1868-145459-0009	train-other-500	and then added in a gasp In Heaven s name what are they hunting It was certainly no mortal fox It stood more than twice as high had a short ugly head and an enormous thick neck
1868-145459-0010	train-other-500	It s a hyaena I cried it must have escaped from Lord Pabham s Park At that moment the hunted beast turned and faced its pursuers and the hounds there were only about six couple of them
1868-145459-0011	train-other-500	stood round in a half circle and looked foolish Evidently they had broken away from the rest of the pack on the trail of this alien scent and were not quite sure how to treat their quarry now they had got him
1868-145459-0012	train-other-500	The hyaena hailed our approach with unmistakable relief and demonstrations of friendliness It had probably been accustomed to uniform kindness from humans
1868-145459-0013	train-other-500	while its first experience of a pack of hounds had left a bad impression The hounds looked more than ever embarrassed as their quarry paraded its sudden intimacy with us
1868-145459-0014	train-other-500	and the faint toot of a horn in the distance was seized on as a welcome signal for unobtrusive departure Constance and I and the hyaena were left alone in the gathering twilight What are we to do
1868-145459-0015	train-other-500	asked Constance What a person you are for questions I said Well we can t stay here all night with a hyaena she retorted I don t know what your ideas of comfort are I said
none	none	 but I shouldn t think of staying here all night even without a hyaena 
1868-145459-0016	train-other-500	My home may be an unhappy one but at least it has hot and cold water laid on and domestic service and other conveniences which we shouldn t find here We had better make for that ridge of trees to the right
1868-145459-0017	train-other-500	I imagine the Crowley road is just beyond We trotted off slowly along a faintly marked cart track with the beast following cheerfully at our heels What on earth are we to do with the hyaena came the inevitable question
1868-145459-0018	train-other-500	What does one generally do with hyaenas I asked crossly I ve never had anything to do with one before said Constance Well neither have I If we even knew its sex we might give it a name
none	none	 Perhaps we might call it Esme 
1868-145459-0019	train-other-500	That would do in either case There was still sufficient daylight for us to distinguish wayside objects and our listless spirits gave an upward perk as we came upon a small half naked gipsy brat
1868-145459-0020	train-other-500	picking blackberries from a low growing bush The sudden apparition of two horsewomen and a hyaena set it off crying and in any case we should scarcely have gleaned any useful geographical information from that source
none	none	 but there was a probability that we might strike a gipsy encampment somewhere along our route 
1868-145459-0021	train-other-500	We rode on hopefully but uneventfully for another mile or so I wonder what that child was doing there said Constance presently Picking blackberries Obviously
1868-145459-0022	train-other-500	I don t like the way it cried pursued Constance somehow its wail keeps ringing in my ears I did not chide Constance for her morbid fancies
none	none	 as a matter of fact the same sensation of being pursued by a persistent fretful wail had been forcing itself on my rather over tired nerves For company s sake I hulloed to Esme 
1868-145459-0023	train-other-500	who had lagged somewhat behind With a few springy bounds he drew up level and then shot past us The wailing accompaniment was explained The gipsy child was firmly and I expect painfully
1868-145459-0024	train-other-500	held in his jaws Merciful Heaven screamed Constance what on earth shall we do What are we to do
1868-145459-0025	train-other-500	I am perfectly certain that at the Last Judgment Constance will ask more questions than any of the examining Seraphs Can t we do something
none	none	 she persisted tearfully as Esme cantered easily along in front of our tired horses 
1868-145459-0026	train-other-500	Personally I was doing everything that occurred to me at the moment I stormed and scolded and coaxed in English and French and gamekeeper language I made absurd ineffectual cuts in the air with my thongless hunting crop
1868-145459-0027	train-other-500	I hurled my sandwich case at the brute in fact I really don t know what more I could have done And still we lumbered on through the deepening dusk with that dark uncouth shape lumbering ahead of us
1868-145459-0028	train-other-500	and a drone of lugubrious music floating in our ears
none	none	 Suddenly Esme bounded aside into some thick bushes 
1868-145459-0029	train-other-500	where we could not follow the wail rose to a shriek and then stopped altogether This part of the story I always hurry over because it is really rather horrible
1868-145459-0030	train-other-500	When the beast joined us again after an absence of a few minutes there was an air of patient understanding about him as though he knew that he had done something of which we disapproved but which he felt to be thoroughly justifiable
1868-145459-0031	train-other-500	How can you let that ravening beast trot by your side asked Constance She was looking more than ever like an albino beetroot In the first place I can t prevent it I said
1868-145459-0032	train-other-500	and in the second place whatever else he may be I doubt if he s ravening at the present moment Constance shuddered Do you think the poor little thing suffered much came another of her futile questions
1868-145459-0033	train-other-500	The indications were all that way I said on the other hand of course it may have been crying from sheer temper Children sometimes do It was nearly pitch dark when we emerged suddenly into the highroad
none	none	 A flash of lights and the whir of a motor went past us at the same moment at uncomfortably close quarters A thud 
1868-145459-0034	train-other-500	and a sharp screeching yell followed a second later The car drew up and when I had ridden back to the spot I found a young man bending over a dark motionless mass lying by the roadside You have killed my Esme I
none	none	 exclaimed bitterly 
1868-145459-0035	train-other-500	I m so awfully sorry said the young man I keep dogs myself so I know what you must feel about it I ll do anything I can in reparation
1868-145459-0036	train-other-500	Please bury him at once I said that much I think I may ask of you Bring the spade William he called to the chauffeur Evidently hasty roadside interments were contingencies that had been provided against
1868-145459-0037	train-other-500	The digging of a sufficiently large grave took some little time I say what a magnificent fellow said the motorist as the corpse was rolled over into the trench I m afraid he must have been rather a valuable animal
none	none	 He took second in the puppy class at Birmingham last year 
1868-145459-0038	train-other-500	I said resolutely Constance snorted loudly Don t cry dear I said brokenly it was all over in a moment He couldn t have suffered much
1868-145459-0039	train-other-500	Look here said the young fellow desperately you simply must let me do something by way of reparation I refused sweetly but as he persisted I let him have my address
1868-145459-0040	train-other-500	Of course we kept our own counsel as to the earlier episodes of the evening Lord Pabham never advertised the loss of his hyaena when a strictly fruit eating animal strayed from his park a year or two previously
1868-145459-0041	train-other-500	he was called upon to give compensation in eleven cases of sheep worrying and practically to re stock his neighbours poultry yards
none	none	 and an escaped hyaena would have mounted up to something on the scale of a Government grant The gipsies were equally unobtrusive over their missing offspring 
1868-145459-0042	train-other-500	I don t suppose in large encampments they really know to a child or two how many they ve got The Baroness paused reflectively and then continued There was a sequel to the adventure though
none	none	 I got through the post a charming little diamond brooch with the name Esme set in a sprig of rosemary 
1868-145459-0043	train-other-500	Incidentally too I lost the friendship of Constance Broddle You see when I sold the brooch I quite properly refused to give her any share of the proceeds
none	none	 I pointed out that the Esme part of the affair was my own invention and the hyaena part of it belonged to Lord Pabham if it really was his hyaena of which of course I ve no proof THE MATCH MAKER The grill room clock struck eleven with the respectful unobtrusiveness of one whose mission in life is to be ignored When the flight of time should really have rendered abstinence and migration imperative the lighting apparatus would signal the fact in the usual way Six minutes later Clovis approached the supper table in the blessed expectancy of one who has dined sketchily and long ago I m starving he announced making an effort to sit down gracefully and read the menu at the same time So I gathered said his host from the fact that you were nearly punctual I ought to have told you that I m a Food Reformer I ve ordered two bowls of bread and milk and some health biscuits I hope you don t mind Clovis pretended afterwards that he didn t go white above the collar line for the fraction of a second All the same he said you ought not to joke about such things There really are such people I ve known people who ve met them To think of all the adorable things there are to eat in the world and then to go through life munching sawdust and being proud of it They re like the Flagellants of the Middle Ages who went about mortifying themselves They had some excuse said Clovis They did it to save their immortal souls didn t they You needn t tell me that a man who doesn t love oysters and asparagus and good wines has got a soul or a stomach either He s simply got the instinct for being unhappy highly developed Clovis relapsed for a few golden moments into tender intimacies with a succession of rapidly disappearing oysters I think oysters are more beautiful than any religion he resumed presently They not only forgive our unkindness to them they justify it they incite us to go on being perfectly horrid to them Once they arrive at the supper table they seem to enter thoroughly into the spirit of the thing There s nothing in Christianity or Buddhism that quite matches the sympathetic unselfishness of an oyster Do you like my new waistcoat I m wearing it for the first time to night It looks like a great many others you ve had lately only worse New dinner waistcoats are becoming a habit with you They say one always pays for the excesses of one s youth mercifully that isn t true about one s clothes My mother is thinking of getting married Again It s the first time Of course you ought to know I was under the impression that she d been married once or twice at least Three times to be mathematically exact I meant that it was the first time she d thought about getting married the other times she did it without thinking As a matter of fact it s really I who am doing the thinking for her in this case You see it s quite two years since her last husband died You evidently think that brevity is the soul of widowhood Well it struck me that she was getting moped and beginning to settle down which wouldn t suit her a bit The first symptom that I noticed was when she began to complain that we were living beyond our income All decent people live beyond their incomes nowadays and those who aren t respectable live beyond other peoples A few gifted individuals manage to do both It s hardly so much a gift as an industry The crisis came returned Clovis when she suddenly started the theory that late hours were bad for one and wanted me to be in by one o clock every night Imagine that sort of thing for me who was eighteen on my last birthday On your last two birthdays to be mathematically exact Oh well that s not my fault I m not going to arrive at nineteen as long as my mother remains at thirty seven One must have some regard for appearances Perhaps your mother would age a little in the process of settling down That s the last thing she d think of Feminine reformations always start in on the failings of other people That s why I was so keen on the husband idea Did you go as far as to select the gentleman or did you merely throw out a general idea and trust to the force of suggestion If one wants a thing done in a hurry one must see to it oneself I found a military Johnny hanging round on a loose end at the club and took him home to lunch once or twice He d spent most of his life on the Indian frontier building roads and relieving famines and minimizing earthquakes and all that sort of thing that one does do on frontiers He could talk sense to a peevish cobra in fifteen native languages and probably knew what to do if you found a rogue elephant on your croquet lawn but he was shy and diffident with women I told my mother privately that he was an absolute woman hater so of course she laid herself out to flirt all she knew which isn t a little And was the gentleman responsive I hear he told some one at the club that he was looking out for a Colonial job with plenty of hard work for a young friend of his so I gather that he has some idea of marrying into the family You seem destined to be the victim of the reformation after all Clovis wiped the trace of Turkish coffee and the beginnings of a smile from his lips and slowly lowered his dexter eyelid Which being interpreted probably meant I DON T think TOBERMORY It was a chill rain washed afternoon of a late August day that indefinite season when partridges are still in security or cold storage and there is nothing to hunt unless one is bounded on the north by the Bristol Channel in which case one may lawfully gallop after fat red stags Lady Blemley s house party was not bounded on the north by the Bristol Channel hence there was a full gathering of her guests round the tea table on this particular afternoon And in spite of the blankness of the season and the triteness of the occasion there was no trace in the company of that fatigued restlessness which means a dread of the pianola and a subdued hankering for auction bridge The undisguised openmouthed attention of the entire party was fixed on the homely negative personality of mister Cornelius Appin Of all her guests he was the one who had come to Lady Blemley with the vaguest reputation Some one had said he was clever and he had got his invitation in the moderate expectation on the part of his hostess that some portion at least of his cleverness would be contributed to the general entertainment Until tea time that day she had been unable to discover in what direction if any his cleverness lay He was neither a wit nor a croquet champion a hypnotic force nor a begetter of amateur theatricals Neither did his exterior suggest the sort of man in whom women are willing to pardon a generous measure of mental deficiency He had subsided into mere mister Appin and the Cornelius seemed a piece of transparent baptismal bluff And now he was claiming to have launched on the world a discovery beside which the invention of gunpowder of the printing press and of steam locomotion were inconsiderable trifles Science had made bewildering strides in many directions during recent decades but this thing seemed to belong to the domain of miracle rather than to scientific achievement And do you really ask us to believe Sir Wilfrid was saying that you have discovered a means for instructing animals in the art of human speech and that dear old Tobermory has proved your first successful pupil It is a problem at which I have worked for the last seventeen years said mister Appin but only during the last eight or nine months have I been rewarded with glimmerings of success Of course I have experimented with thousands of animals but latterly only with cats those wonderful creatures which have assimilated themselves so marvellously with our civilization while retaining all their highly developed feral instincts Here and there among cats one comes across an outstanding superior intellect just as one does among the ruck of human beings and when I made the acquaintance of Tobermory a week ago I saw at once that I was in contact with a Beyond cat of extraordinary intelligence I had gone far along the road to success in recent experiments with Tobermory as you call him I have reached the goal mister Appin concluded his remarkable statement in a voice which he strove to divest of a triumphant inflection No one said Rats though Clovis s lips moved in a monosyllabic contortion which probably invoked those rodents of disbelief And do you mean to say asked Miss Resker after a slight pause that you have taught Tobermory to say and understand easy sentences of one syllable My dear Miss Resker said the wonderworker patiently one teaches little children and savages and backward adults in that piecemeal fashion when one has once solved the problem of making a beginning with an animal of highly developed intelligence one has no need for those halting methods Tobermory can speak our language with perfect correctness This time Clovis very distinctly said Beyond rats Sir Wilfrid was more polite but equally sceptical Hadn t we better have the cat in and judge for ourselves suggested Lady Blemley Sir Wilfrid went in search of the animal and the company settled themselves down to the languid expectation of witnessing some more or less adroit drawing room ventriloquism In a minute Sir Wilfrid was back in the room his face white beneath its tan and his eyes dilated with excitement By Gad it s true His agitation was unmistakably genuine and his hearers started forward in a thrill of awakened interest Collapsing into an armchair he continued breathlessly I found him dozing in the smoking room and called out to him to come for his tea He blinked at me in his usual way and I said Come on Toby don t keep us waiting and by Gad he drawled out in a most horribly natural voice that he d come when he dashed well pleased I nearly jumped out of my skin Appin had preached to absolutely incredulous hearers Sir Wilfrid s statement carried instant conviction A Babel like chorus of startled exclamation arose amid which the scientist sat mutely enjoying the first fruit of his stupendous discovery In the midst of the clamour Tobermory entered the room and made his way with velvet tread and studied unconcern across to the group seated round the tea table A sudden hush of awkwardness and constraint fell on the company Somehow there seemed an element of embarrassment in addressing on equal terms a domestic cat of acknowledged dental ability Will you have some milk Tobermory asked Lady Blemley in a rather strained voice I don t mind if I do was the response couched in a tone of even indifference A shiver of suppressed excitement went through the listeners and Lady Blemley might be excused for pouring out the saucerful of milk rather unsteadily I m afraid I ve spilt a good deal of it she said apologetically After all it s not my Axminster was Tobermory s rejoinder Another silence fell on the group and then Miss Resker in her best district visitor manner asked if the human language had been difficult to learn Tobermory looked squarely at her for a moment and then fixed his gaze serenely on the middle distance It was obvious that boring questions lay outside his scheme of life What do you think of human intelligence asked Mavis Pellington lamely Of whose intelligence in particular asked Tobermory coldly Oh well mine for instance said Mavis with a feeble laugh You put me in an embarrassing position said Tobermory whose tone and attitude certainly did not suggest a shred of embarrassment When your inclusion in this house party was suggested Sir Wilfrid protested that you were the most brainless woman of his acquaintance and that there was a wide distinction between hospitality and the care of the feeble minded Lady Blemley replied that your lack of brain power was the precise quality which had earned you your invitation as you were the only person she could think of who might be idiotic enough to buy their old car You know the one they call The Envy of Sisyphus because it goes quite nicely up hill if you push it Lady Blemley s protestations would have had greater effect if she had not casually suggested to Mavis only that morning that the car in question would be just the thing for her down at her Devonshire home Major Barfield plunged in heavily to effect a diversion How about your carryings on with the tortoiseshell puss up at the stables eh The moment he had said it every one realized the blunder One does not usually discuss these matters in public said Tobermory frigidly From a slight observation of your ways since you ve been in this house I should imagine you d find it inconvenient if I were to shift the conversation on to your own little affairs The panic which ensued was not confined to the Major Would you like to go and see if cook has got your dinner ready suggested Lady Blemley hurriedly affecting to ignore the fact that it wanted at least two hours to Tobermory s dinner time Thanks said Tobermory not quite so soon after my tea I don t want to die of indigestion Cats have nine lives you know said Sir Wilfrid heartily Possibly answered Tobermory but only one liver Adelaide said missus Cornett do you mean to encourage that cat to go out and gossip about us in the servants hall The panic had indeed become general A narrow ornamental balustrade ran in front of most of the bedroom windows at the Towers and it was recalled with dismay that this had formed a favourite promenade for Tobermory at all hours whence he could watch the pigeons and heaven knew what else besides If he intended to become reminiscent in his present outspoken strain the effect would be something more than disconcerting missus Cornett who spent much time at her toilet table and whose complexion was reputed to be of a nomadic though punctual disposition looked as ill at ease as the Major Miss Scrawen who wrote fiercely sensuous poetry and led a blameless life merely displayed irritation if you are methodical and virtuous in private you don t necessarily want every one to know it Bertie van Tahn who was so depraved at seventeen that he had long ago given up trying to be any worse turned a dull shade of gardenia white but he did not commit the error of dashing out of the room like Odo Finsberry a young gentleman who was understood to be reading for the Church and who was possibly disturbed at the thought of scandals he might hear concerning other people Clovis had the presence of mind to maintain a composed exterior privately he was calculating how long it would take to procure a box of fancy mice through the agency of the EXCHANGE AND MART as a species of hush money Even in a delicate situation like the present Agnes Resker could not endure to remain too long in the background Why did I ever come down here she asked dramatically Tobermory immediately accepted the opening Judging by what you said to missus Cornett on the croquet lawn yesterday you were out for food You described the Blemleys as the dullest people to stay with that you knew but said they were clever enough to employ a first rate cook otherwise they d find it difficult to get anyone to come down a second time There s not a word of truth in it I appeal to missus Cornett exclaimed the discomfited Agnes missus Cornett repeated your remark afterwards to Bertie van Tahn continued Tobermory and said That woman is a regular Hunger Marcher she d go anywhere for four square meals a day and Bertie van Tahn said At this point the chronicle mercifully ceased Tobermory had caught a glimpse of the big yellow Tom from the Rectory working his way through the shrubbery towards the stable wing In a flash he had vanished through the open French window With the disappearance of his too brilliant pupil Cornelius Appin found himself beset by a hurricane of bitter upbraiding anxious inquiry and frightened entreaty The responsibility for the situation lay with him and he must prevent matters from becoming worse Could Tobermory impart his dangerous gift to other cats was the first question he had to answer It was possible he replied that he might have initiated his intimate friend the stable puss into his new accomplishment but it was unlikely that his teaching could have taken a wider range as yet Then said missus Cornett Tobermory may be a valuable cat and a great pet but I m sure you ll agree Adelaide that both he and the stable cat must be done away with without delay You don t suppose I ve enjoyed the last quarter of an hour do you said Lady Blemley bitterly My husband and I are very fond of Tobermory at least we were before this horrible accomplishment was infused into him but now of course the only thing is to have him destroyed as soon as possible We can put some strychnine in the scraps he always gets at dinner time said Sir Wilfrid and I will go and drown the stable cat myself The coachman will be very sore at losing his pet but I ll say a very catching form of mange has broken out in both cats and we re afraid of it spreading to the kennels But my great discovery expostulated mister Appin after all my years of research and experiment You can go and experiment on the shorthorns at the farm who are under proper control said missus Cornett or the elephants at the Zoological Gardens They re said to be highly intelligent and they have this recommendation that they don t come creeping about our bedrooms and under chairs and so forth An archangel ecstatically proclaiming the Millennium and then finding that it clashed unpardonably with Henley and would have to be indefinitely postponed could hardly have felt more crestfallen than Cornelius Appin at the reception of his wonderful achievement Public opinion however was against him in fact had the general voice been consulted on the subject it is probable that a strong minority vote would have been in favour of including him in the strychnine diet Defective train arrangements and a nervous desire to see matters brought to a finish prevented an immediate dispersal of the party but dinner that evening was not a social success Sir Wilfrid had had rather a trying time with the stable cat and subsequently with the coachman Agnes Resker ostentatiously limited her repast to a morsel of dry toast which she bit as though it were a personal enemy while Mavis Pellington maintained a vindictive silence throughout the meal Lady Blemley kept up a flow of what she hoped was conversation but her attention was fixed on the doorway A plateful of carefully dosed fish scraps was in readiness on the sideboard but sweets and savoury and dessert went their way and no Tobermory appeared either in the dining room or kitchen The sepulchral dinner was cheerful compared with the subsequent vigil in the smoking room Eating and drinking had at least supplied a distraction and cloak to the prevailing embarrassment Bridge was out of the question in the general tension of nerves and tempers and after Odo Finsberry had given a lugubrious rendering of Melisande in the Wood to a frigid audience music was tacitly avoided At eleven the servants went to bed announcing that the small window in the pantry had been left open as usual for Tobermory s private use The guests read steadily through the current batch of magazines and fell back gradually on the Badminton Library and bound volumes of PUNCH Lady Blemley made periodic visits to the pantry returning each time with an expression of listless depression which forestalled questioning At two o clock Clovis broke the dominating silence He won t turn up to night He s probably in the local newspaper office at the present moment dictating the first instalment of his reminiscences Lady What s her name s book won t be in it It will be the event of the day Having made this contribution to the general cheerfulness Clovis went to bed At long intervals the various members of the house party followed his example The servants taking round the early tea made a uniform announcement in reply to a uniform question Tobermory had not returned Breakfast was if anything a more unpleasant function than dinner had been but before its conclusion the situation was relieved Tobermory s corpse was brought in from the shrubbery where a gardener had just discovered it From the bites on his throat and the yellow fur which coated his claws it was evident that he had fallen in unequal combat with the big Tom from the Rectory By midday most of the guests had quitted the Towers and after lunch Lady Blemley had sufficiently recovered her spirits to write an extremely nasty letter to the Rectory about the loss of her valuable pet Tobermory had been Appin s one successful pupil and he was destined to have no successor A few weeks later an elephant in the Dresden Zoological Garden which had shown no previous signs of irritability broke loose and killed an Englishman who had apparently been teasing it The victim s name was variously reported in the papers as Oppin and Eppelin but his front name was faithfully rendered Cornelius If he was trying German irregular verbs on the poor beast said Clovis he deserved all he got missus PACKLETIDE S TIGER It was missus Packletide s pleasure and intention that she should shoot a tiger Not that the lust to kill had suddenly descended on her or that she felt that she would leave India safer and more wholesome than she had found it with one fraction less of wild beast per million of inhabitants The compelling motive for her sudden deviation towards the footsteps of Nimrod was the fact that Loona Bimberton had recently been carried eleven miles in an aeroplane by an Algerian aviator and talked of nothing else only a personally procured tiger skin and a heavy harvest of Press photographs could successfully counter that sort of thing missus Packletide had already arranged in her mind the lunch she would give at her house in Curzon Street ostensibly in Loona Bimberton s honour with a tiger skin rug occupying most of the foreground and all of the conversation She had also already designed in her mind the tiger claw brooch that she was going to give Loona Bimberton on her next birthday In a world that is supposed to be chiefly swayed by hunger and by love missus Packletide was an exception her movements and motives were largely governed by dislike of Loona Bimberton Circumstances proved propitious missus Packletide had offered a thousand rupees for the opportunity of shooting a tiger without overmuch risk or exertion and it so happened that a neighbouring village could boast of being the favoured rendezvous of an animal of respectable antecedents which had been driven by the increasing infirmities of age to abandon game killing and confine its appetite to the smaller domestic animals The prospect of earning the thousand rupees had stimulated the sporting and commercial instinct of the villagers children were posted night and day on the outskirts of the local jungle to head the tiger back in the unlikely event of his attempting to roam away to fresh hunting grounds and the cheaper kinds of goats were left about with elaborate carelessness to keep him satisfied with his present quarters The one great anxiety was lest he should die of old age before the date appointed for the memsahib s shoot Mothers carrying their babies home through the jungle after the day s work in the fields hushed their singing lest they might curtail the restful sleep of the venerable herd robber The great night duly arrived moonlit and cloudless A platform had been constructed in a comfortable and conveniently placed tree and thereon crouched missus Packletide and her paid companion Miss Mebbin A goat gifted with a particularly persistent bleat such as even a partially deaf tiger might be reasonably expected to hear on a still night was tethered at the correct distance With an accurately sighted rifle and a thumbnail pack of patience cards the sportswoman awaited the coming of the quarry I suppose we are in some danger said Miss Mebbin She was not actually nervous about the wild beast but she had a morbid dread of performing an atom more service than she had been paid for Nonsense said missus Packletide it s a very old tiger It couldn t spring up here even if it wanted to If it s an old tiger I think you ought to get it cheaper A thousand rupees is a lot of money Louisa Mebbin adopted a protective elder sister attitude towards money in general irrespective of nationality or denomination Her energetic intervention had saved many a rouble from dissipating itself in tips in some Moscow hotel and francs and centimes clung to her instinctively under circumstances which would have driven them headlong from less sympathetic hands Her speculations as to the market depreciation of tiger remnants were cut short by the appearance on the scene of the animal itself As soon as it caught sight of the tethered goat it lay flat on the earth seemingly less from a desire to take advantage of all available cover than for the purpose of snatching a short rest before commencing the grand attack I believe it s ill said Louisa Mebbin loudly in Hindustani for the benefit of the village headman who was in ambush in a neighbouring tree Hush said missus Packletide and at that moment the tiger commenced ambling towards his victim Now now urged Miss Mebbin with some excitement if he doesn t touch the goat we needn t pay for it The bait was an extra The rifle flashed out with a loud report and the great tawny beast sprang to one side and then rolled over in the stillness of death In a moment a crowd of excited natives had swarmed on to the scene and their shouting speedily carried the glad news to the village where a thumping of tom toms took up the chorus of triumph And their triumph and rejoicing found a ready echo in the heart of missus Packletide already that luncheon party in Curzon Street seemed immeasurably nearer It was Louisa Mebbin who drew attention to the fact that the goat was in death throes from a mortal bullet wound while no trace of the rifle s deadly work could be found on the tiger Evidently the wrong animal had been hit and the beast of prey had succumbed to heart failure caused by the sudden report of the rifle accelerated by senile decay missus Packletide was pardonably annoyed at the discovery but at any rate she was the possessor of a dead tiger and the villagers anxious for their thousand rupees gladly connived at the fiction that she had shot the beast And Miss Mebbin was a paid companion Therefore did missus Packletide face the cameras with a light heart and her pictured fame reached from the pages of the TEXAS WEEKLY SNAPSHOT to the illustrated Monday supplement of the NOVOE VREMYA As for Loona Bimberton she refused to look at an illustrated paper for weeks and her letter of thanks for the gift of a tiger claw brooch was a model of repressed emotions The luncheon party she declined there are limits beyond which repressed emotions become dangerous From Curzon Street the tiger skin rug travelled down to the Manor House and was duly inspected and admired by the county and it seemed a fitting and appropriate thing when missus Packletide went to the County Costume Ball in the character of Diana She refused to fall in however with Clovis s tempting suggestion of a primeval dance party at which every one should wear the skins of beasts they had recently slain I should be in rather a Baby Bunting condition confessed Clovis with a miserable rabbit skin or two to wrap up in but then he added with a rather malicious glance at Diana s proportions my figure is quite as good as that Russian dancing boy s How amused every one would be if they knew what really happened said Louisa Mebbin a few days after the ball What do you mean asked missus Packletide quickly How you shot the goat and frightened the tiger to death said Miss Mebbin with her disagreeably pleasant laugh No one would believe it said missus Packletide her face changing colour as rapidly as though it were going through a book of patterns before post time Loona Bimberton would said Miss Mebbin missus Packletide s face settled on an unbecoming shade of greenish white You surely wouldn t give me away she asked I ve seen a week end cottage near Dorking that I should rather like to buy said Miss Mebbin with seeming irrelevance Six hundred and eighty freehold Quite a bargain only I don t happen to have the money Louisa Mebbin s pretty week end cottage christened by her Les Fauves and gay in summertime with its garden borders of tiger lilies is the wonder and admiration of her friends It is a marvel how Louisa manages to do it is the general verdict missus Packletide indulges in no more big game shooting The incidental expenses are so heavy she confides to inquiring friends THE STAMPEDING OF LADY BASTABLE It would be rather nice if you would put Clovis up for another six days while I go up north to the MacGregors said missus Sangrail sleepily across the breakfast table It was her invariable plan to speak in a sleepy comfortable voice whenever she was unusually keen about anything it put people off their guard and they frequently fell in with her wishes before they had realized that she was really asking for anything Lady Bastable however was not so easily taken unawares possibly she knew that voice and what it betokened at any rate she knew Clovis She frowned at a piece of toast and ate it very slowly as though she wished to convey the impression that the process hurt her more than it hurt the toast but no extension of hospitality on Clovis s behalf rose to her lips It would be a great convenience to me pursued missus Sangrail abandoning the careless tone I particularly don t want to take him to the MacGregors and it will only be for six days It will seem longer said Lady Bastable dismally The last time he stayed here for a week I know interrupted the other hastily but that was nearly two years ago He was younger then But he hasn t improved said her hostess it s no use growing older if you only learn new ways of misbehaving yourself missus Sangrail was unable to argue the point since Clovis had reached the age of seventeen she had never ceased to bewail his irrepressible waywardness to all her circle of acquaintances and a polite scepticism would have greeted the slightest hint at a prospective reformation She discarded the fruitless effort at cajolery and resorted to undisguised bribery If you ll have him here for these six days I ll cancel that outstanding bridge account It was only for forty nine shillings but Lady Bastable loved shillings with a great strong love To lose money at bridge and not to have to pay it was one of those rare experiences which gave the card table a glamour in her eyes which it could never otherwise have possessed missus Sangrail was almost equally devoted to her card winnings but the prospect of conveniently warehousing her offspring for six days and incidentally saving his railway fare to the north reconciled her to the sacrifice when Clovis made a belated appearance at the breakfast table the bargain had been struck Just think said missus Sangrail sleepily Lady Bastable has very kindly asked you to stay on here while I go to the MacGregors Clovis said suitable things in a highly unsuitable manner and proceeded to make punitive expeditions among the breakfast dishes with a scowl on his face that would have driven the purr out of a peace conference The arrangement that had been concluded behind his back was doubly distasteful to him In the first place he particularly wanted to teach the MacGregor boys who could well afford the knowledge how to play poker patience secondly the Bastable catering was of the kind that is classified as a rude plenty which Clovis translated as a plenty that gives rise to rude remarks Watching him from behind ostentatiously sleepy lids his mother realized in the light of long experience that any rejoicing over the success of her manoeuvre would be distinctly premature It was one thing to fit Clovis into a convenient niche of the domestic jig saw puzzle it was quite another matter to get him to stay there Lady Bastable was wont to retire in state to the morning room immediately after breakfast and spend a quiet hour in skimming through the papers they were there so she might as well get their money s worth out of them Politics did not greatly interest her but she was obsessed with a favourite foreboding that one of these days there would be a great social upheaval in which everybody would be killed by everybody else It will come sooner than we think she would observe darkly a mathematical expert of exceptionally high powers would have been puzzled to work out the approximate date from the slender and confusing groundwork which this assertion afforded On this particular morning the sight of Lady Bastable enthroned among her papers gave Clovis the hint towards which his mind had been groping all breakfast time His mother had gone upstairs to supervise packing operations and he was alone on the ground floor with his hostess and the servants The latter were the key to the situation Bursting wildly into the kitchen quarters Clovis screamed a frantic though strictly non committal summons Poor Lady Bastable In the morning room Oh quick The next moment the butler cook page boy two or three maids and a gardener who had happened to be in one of the outer kitchens were following in a hot scurry after Clovis as he headed back for the morning room Lady Bastable was roused from the world of newspaper lore by hearing a Japanese screen in the hall go down with a crash Then the door leading from the hall flew open and her young guest tore madly through the room shrieked at her in passing The jacquerie They re on us and dashed like an escaping hawk out through the French window The scared mob of servants burst in on his heels the gardener still clutching the sickle with which he had been trimming hedges and the impetus of their headlong haste carried them slipping and sliding over the smooth parquet flooring towards the chair where their mistress sat in panic stricken amazement If she had had a moment granted her for reflection she would have behaved as she afterwards explained with considerable dignity It was probably the sickle which decided her but anyway she followed the lead that Clovis had given her through the French window and ran well and far across the lawn before the eyes of her astonished retainers Lost dignity is not a possession which can be restored at a moment s notice and both Lady Bastable and the butler found the process of returning to normal conditions almost as painful as a slow recovery from drowning A jacquerie even if carried out with the most respectful of intentions cannot fail to leave some traces of embarrassment behind it By lunch time however decorum had reasserted itself with enhanced rigour as a natural rebound from its recent overthrow and the meal was served in a frigid stateliness that might have been framed on a Byzantine model Halfway through its duration missus Sangrail was solemnly presented with an envelope lying on a silver salver It contained a cheque for forty nine shillings The MacGregor boys learned how to play poker patience after all they could afford to THE BACKGROUND That woman s art jargon tires me said Clovis to his journalist friend She s so fond of talking of certain pictures as growing on one as though they were a sort of fungus That reminds me said the journalist of the story of Henri Deplis Have I ever told it you Clovis shook his head Henri Deplis was by birth a native of the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg On maturer reflection he became a commercial traveller His business activities frequently took him beyond the limits of the Grand Duchy and he was stopping in a small town of Northern Italy when news reached him from home that a legacy from a distant and deceased relative had fallen to his share It was not a large legacy even from the modest standpoint of Henri Deplis but it impelled him towards some seemingly harmless extravagances In particular it led him to patronize local art as represented by the tattoo needles of Signor Andreas Pincini Signor Pincini was perhaps the most brilliant master of tattoo craft that Italy had ever known but his circumstances were decidedly impoverished and for the sum of six hundred francs he gladly undertook to cover his client s back from the collar bone down to the waistline with a glowing representation of the Fall of Icarus The design when finally developed was a slight disappointment to Monsieur Deplis who had suspected Icarus of being a fortress taken by Wallenstein in the Thirty Years War but he was more than satisfied with the execution of the work which was acclaimed by all who had the privilege of seeing it as Pincini s masterpiece It was his greatest effort and his last Without even waiting to be paid the illustrious craftsman departed this life and was buried under an ornate tombstone whose winged cherubs would have afforded singularly little scope for the exercise of his favourite art There remained however the widow Pincini to whom the six hundred francs were due And thereupon arose the great crisis in the life of Henri Deplis traveller of commerce The legacy under the stress of numerous little calls on its substance had dwindled to very insignificant proportions and when a pressing wine bill and sundry other current accounts had been paid there remained little more than four hundred thirty francs to offer to the widow The lady was properly indignant not wholly as she volubly explained on account of the suggested writing off of one hundred seventy francs but also at the attempt to depreciate the value of her late husband s acknowledged masterpiece In a week s time Deplis was obliged to reduce his offer to four hundred five francs which circumstance fanned the widow s indignation into a fury She cancelled the sale of the work of art and a few days later Deplis learned with a sense of consternation that she had presented it to the municipality of Bergamo which had gratefully accepted it He left the neighbourhood as unobtrusively as possible and was genuinely relieved when his business commands took him to Rome where he hoped his identity and that of the famous picture might be lost sight of But he bore on his back the burden of the dead man s genius On presenting himself one day in the steaming corridor of a vapour bath he was at once hustled back into his clothes by the proprietor who was a North Italian and who emphatically refused to allow the celebrated Fall of Icarus to be publicly on view without the permission of the municipality of Bergamo Public interest and official vigilance increased as the matter became more widely known and Deplis was unable to take a simple dip in the sea or river on the hottest afternoon unless clothed up to the collarbone in a substantial bathing garment Later on the authorities of Bergamo conceived the idea that salt water might be injurious to the masterpiece and a perpetual injunction was obtained which debarred the muchly harassed commercial traveller from sea bathing under any circumstances Altogether he was fervently thankful when his firm of employers found him a new range of activities in the neighbourhood of Bordeaux His thankfulness however ceased abruptly at the Franco Italian frontier An imposing array of official force barred his departure and he was sternly reminded of the stringent law which forbids the exportation of Italian works of art A diplomatic parley ensued between the Luxemburgian and Italian Governments and at one time the European situation became overcast with the possibilities of trouble But the Italian Government stood firm it declined to concern itself in the least with the fortunes or even the existence of Henri Deplis commercial traveller but was immovable in its decision that the Fall of Icarus by the late Pincini Andreas at present the property of the municipality of Bergamo should not leave the country The excitement died down in time but the unfortunate Deplis who was of a constitutionally retiring disposition found himself a few months later once more the storm centre of a furious controversy A certain German art expert who had obtained from the municipality of Bergamo permission to inspect the famous masterpiece declared it to be a spurious Pincini probably the work of some pupil whom he had employed in his declining years The evidence of Deplis on the subject was obviously worthless as he had been under the influence of the customary narcotics during the long process of pricking in the design The editor of an Italian art journal refuted the contentions of the German expert and undertook to prove that his private life did not conform to any modern standard of decency The whole of Italy and Germany were drawn into the dispute and the rest of Europe was soon involved in the quarrel There were stormy scenes in the Spanish Parliament and the University of Copenhagen bestowed a gold medal on the German expert afterwards sending a commission to examine his proofs on the spot while two Polish schoolboys in Paris committed suicide to show what THEY thought of the matter Meanwhile the unhappy human background fared no better than before and it was not surprising that he drifted into the ranks of Italian anarchists Four times at least he was escorted to the frontier as a dangerous and undesirable foreigner but he was always brought back as the Fall of Icarus attributed to Pincini Andreas early Twentieth Century And then one day at an anarchist congress at Genoa a fellow worker in the heat of debate broke a phial full of corrosive liquid over his back The red shirt that he was wearing mitigated the effects but the Icarus was ruined beyond recognition His assailant was severely reprimanded for assaulting a fellow anarchist and received seven years imprisonment for defacing a national art treasure As soon as he was able to leave the hospital Henri Deplis was put across the frontier as an undesirable alien In the quieter streets of Paris especially in the neighbourhood of the Ministry of Fine Arts you may sometimes meet a depressed anxious looking man who if you pass him the time of day will answer you with a slight Luxemburgian accent He nurses the illusion that he is one of the lost arms of the Venus de Milo and hopes that the French Government may be persuaded to buy him On all other subjects I believe he is tolerably sane HERMANN THE IRASCIBLE A STORY OF THE GREAT WEEP It was in the second decade of the twentieth century after the Great Plague had devastated England that Hermann the Irascible nicknamed also the Wise sat on the British throne The Mortal Sickness had swept away the entire Royal Family unto the third and fourth generations and thus it came to pass that Hermann the Fourteenth of Saxe Drachsen Wachtelstein who had stood thirtieth in the order of succession found himself one day ruler of the British dominions within and beyond the seas He was one of the unexpected things that happen in politics and he happened with great thoroughness In many ways he was the most progressive monarch who had sat on an important throne before people knew where they were they were somewhere else Even his Ministers progressive though they were by tradition found it difficult to keep pace with his legislative suggestions As a matter of fact admitted the Prime Minister we are hampered by these votes for women creatures they disturb our meetings throughout the country and they try to turn Downing Street into a sort of political picnic ground They must be dealt with said Hermann Dealt with said the Prime Minister exactly just so but how I will draft you a Bill said the King sitting down at his typewriting machine enacting that women shall vote at all future elections Shall vote you observe or to put it plainer must Voting will remain optional as before for male electors but every woman between the ages of twenty one and seventy will be obliged to vote not only at elections for Parliament county councils district boards parish councils and municipalities but for coroners school inspectors churchwardens curators of museums sanitary authorities police court interpreters swimming bath instructors contractors choir masters market superintendents art school teachers cathedral vergers and other local functionaries whose names I will add as they occur to me All these offices will become elective and failure to vote at any election falling within her area of residence will involve the female elector in a penalty of Lten Absence unsupported by an adequate medical certificate will not be accepted as an excuse Pass this Bill through the two Houses of Parliament and bring it to me for signature the day after to morrow From the very outset the Compulsory Female Franchise produced little or no elation even in circles which had been loudest in demanding the vote The bulk of the women of the country had been indifferent or hostile to the franchise agitation and the most fanatical Suffragettes began to wonder what they had found so attractive in the prospect of putting ballot papers into a box In the country districts the task of carrying out the provisions of the new Act was irksome enough in the towns and cities it became an incubus There seemed no end to the elections Laundresses and seamstresses had to hurry away from their work to vote often for a candidate whose name they hadn t heard before and whom they selected at haphazard female clerks and waitresses got up extra early to get their voting done before starting off to their places of business Society women found their arrangements impeded and upset by the continual necessity for attending the polling stations and week end parties and summer holidays became gradually a masculine luxury As for Cairo and the Riviera they were possible only for genuine invalids or people of enormous wealth for the accumulation of Lten fines during a prolonged absence was a contingency that even ordinarily wealthy folk could hardly afford to risk It was not wonderful that the female disfranchisement agitation became a formidable movement The No Votes for Women League numbered its feminine adherents by the million its colours citron and old Dutch madder were flaunted everywhere and its battle hymn We don t want to Vote became a popular refrain As the Government showed no signs of being impressed by peaceful persuasion more violent methods came into vogue Meetings were disturbed Ministers were mobbed policemen were bitten and ordinary prison fare rejected and on the eve of the anniversary of Trafalgar women bound themselves in tiers up the entire length of the Nelson column so that its customary floral decoration had to be abandoned Still the Government obstinately adhered to its conviction that women ought to have the vote Then as a last resort some woman wit hit upon an expedient which it was strange that no one had thought of before The Great Weep was organized Relays of women ten thousand at a time wept continuously in the public places of the Metropolis They wept in railway stations in tubes and omnibuses in the National Gallery at the Army and Navy Stores in saint James s Park at ballad concerts at Prince s and in the Burlington Arcade The hitherto unbroken success of the brilliant farcical comedy Henry s Rabbit was imperilled by the presence of drearily weeping women in stalls and circle and gallery and one of the brightest divorce cases that had been tried for many years was robbed of much of its sparkle by the lachrymose behaviour of a section of the audience What are we to do asked the Prime Minister whose cook had wept into all the breakfast dishes and whose nursemaid had gone out crying quietly and miserably to take the children for a walk in the Park There is a time for everything said the King there is a time to yield Pass a measure through the two Houses depriving women of the right to vote and bring it to me for the Royal assent the day after to morrow As the Minister withdrew Hermann the Irascible who was also nicknamed the Wise gave a profound chuckle There are more ways of killing a cat than by choking it with cream he quoted but I m not sure he added that it s not the best way THE UNREST CURE On the rack in the railway carriage immediately opposite Clovis was a solidly wrought travelling bag with a carefully written label on which was inscribed J P Huddle The Warren Tilfield near Slowborough Immediately below the rack sat the human embodiment of the label a solid sedate individual sedately dressed sedately conversational Even without his conversation which was addressed to a friend seated by his side and touched chiefly on such topics as the backwardness of Roman hyacinths and the prevalence of measles at the Rectory one could have gauged fairly accurately the temperament and mental outlook of the travelling bag s owner But he seemed unwilling to leave anything to the imagination of a casual observer and his talk grew presently personal and introspective I don t know how it is he told his friend I m not much over forty but I seem to have settled down into a deep groove of elderly middle age My sister shows the same tendency We like everything to be exactly in its accustomed place we like things to happen exactly at their appointed times we like everything to be usual orderly punctual methodical to a hair s breadth to a minute It distresses and upsets us if it is not so For instance to take a very trifling matter a thrush has built its nest year after year in the catkin tree on the lawn this year for no obvious reason it is building in the ivy on the garden wall We have said very little about it but I think we both feel that the change is unnecessary and just a little irritating Perhaps said the friend it is a different thrush We have suspected that said J P Huddle and I think it gives us even more cause for annoyance We don t feel that we want a change of thrush at our time of life and yet as I have said we have scarcely reached an age when these things should make themselves seriously felt What you want said the friend is an Unrest cure An Unrest cure I ve never heard of such a thing You ve heard of Rest cures for people who ve broken down under stress of too much worry and strenuous living well you re suffering from overmuch repose and placidity and you need the opposite kind of treatment But where would one go for such a thing Well you might stand as an Orange candidate for Kilkenny or do a course of district visiting in one of the Apache quarters of Paris or give lectures in Berlin to prove that most of Wagner s music was written by Gambetta and there s always the interior of Morocco to travel in But to be really effective the Unrest cure ought to be tried in the home How you would do it I haven t the faintest idea It was at this point in the conversation that Clovis became galvanized into alert attention After all his two days visit to an elderly relative at Slowborough did not promise much excitement Before the train had stopped he had decorated his sinister shirt cuff with the inscription J P Huddle The Warren Tilfield near Slowborough Two mornings later mister Huddle broke in on his sister s privacy as she sat reading Country Life in the morning room It was her day and hour and place for reading Country Life and the intrusion was absolutely irregular but he bore in his hand a telegram and in that household telegrams were recognized as happening by the hand of God This particular telegram partook of the nature of a thunderbolt Bishop examining confirmation class in neighbourhood unable stay rectory on account measles invokes your hospitality sending secretary arrange I scarcely know the Bishop I ve only spoken to him once exclaimed J P Huddle with the exculpating air of one who realizes too late the indiscretion of speaking to strange Bishops Miss Huddle was the first to rally she disliked thunderbolts as fervently as her brother did but the womanly instinct in her told her that thunderbolts must be fed We can curry the cold duck she said It was not the appointed day for curry but the little orange envelope involved a certain departure from rule and custom Her brother said nothing but his eyes thanked her for being brave A young gentleman to see you announced the parlour maid The secretary murmured the Huddles in unison they instantly stiffened into a demeanour which proclaimed that though they held all strangers to be guilty they were willing to hear anything they might have to say in their defence The young gentleman who came into the room with a certain elegant haughtiness was not at all Huddle s idea of a bishop s secretary he had not supposed that the episcopal establishment could have afforded such an expensively upholstered article when there were so many other claims on its resources The face was fleetingly familiar if he had bestowed more attention on the fellow traveller sitting opposite him in the railway carriage two days before he might have recognized Clovis in his present visitor You are the Bishop s secretary asked Huddle becoming consciously deferential His confidential secretary answered Clovis You may call me Stanislaus my other name doesn t matter The Bishop and Colonel Alberti may be here to lunch I shall be here in any case It sounded rather like the programme of a Royal visit The Bishop is examining a confirmation class in the neighbourhood isn t he asked Miss Huddle Ostensibly was the dark reply followed by a request for a large scale map of the locality Clovis was still immersed in a seemingly profound study of the map when another telegram arrived It was addressed to Prince Stanislaus care of Huddle The Warren et cetera Clovis glanced at the contents and announced The Bishop and Alberti won t be here till late in the afternoon Then he returned to his scrutiny of the map The luncheon was not a very festive function The princely secretary ate and drank with fair appetite but severely discouraged conversation At the finish of the meal he broke suddenly into a radiant smile thanked his hostess for a charming repast and kissed her hand with deferential rapture Miss Huddle was unable to decide in her mind whether the action savoured of Louis Quatorzian courtliness or the reprehensible Roman attitude towards the Sabine women It was not her day for having a headache but she felt that the circumstances excused her and retired to her room to have as much headache as was possible before the Bishop s arrival Clovis having asked the way to the nearest telegraph office disappeared presently down the carriage drive mister Huddle met him in the hall some two hours later and asked when the Bishop would arrive He is in the library with Alberti was the reply But why wasn t I told I never knew he had come exclaimed Huddle No one knows he is here said Clovis the quieter we can keep matters the better And on no account disturb him in the library Those are his orders But what is all this mystery about And who is Alberti And isn t the Bishop going to have tea The Bishop is out for blood not tea Blood gasped Huddle who did not find that the thunderbolt improved on acquaintance To night is going to be a great night in the history of Christendom said Clovis We are going to massacre every Jew in the neighbourhood To massacre the Jews said Huddle indignantly Do you mean to tell me there s a general rising against them No it s the Bishop s own idea He s in there arranging all the details now But the Bishop is such a tolerant humane man That is precisely what will heighten the effect of his action The sensation will be enormous That at least Huddle could believe He will be hanged he exclaimed with conviction A motor is waiting to carry him to the coast where a steam yacht is in readiness But there aren t thirty Jews in the whole neighbourhood protested Huddle whose brain under the repeated shocks of the day was operating with the uncertainty of a telegraph wire during earthquake disturbances We have twenty six on our list said Clovis referring to a bundle of notes We shall be able to deal with them all the more thoroughly Do you mean to tell me that you are meditating violence against a man like Sir Leon Birberry stammered Huddle he s one of the most respected men in the country He s down on our list said Clovis carelessly after all we ve got men we can trust to do our job so we shan t have to rely on local assistance And we ve got some Boy scouts helping us as auxiliaries Boy scouts Yes when they understood there was real killing to be done they were even keener than the men This thing will be a blot on the Twentieth Century And your house will be the blotting pad Have you realized that half the papers of Europe and the United States will publish pictures of it By the way I ve sent some photographs of you and your sister that I found in the library to the MATIN and DIE WOCHE I hope you don t mind Also a sketch of the staircase most of the killing will probably be done on the staircase The emotions that were surging in J P Huddle s brain were almost too intense to be disclosed in speech but he managed to gasp out There aren t any Jews in this house Not at present said Clovis I shall go to the police shouted Huddle with sudden energy In the shrubbery said Clovis are posted ten men who have orders to fire on anyone who leaves the house without my signal of permission Another armed picquet is in ambush near the front gate The Boy scouts watch the back premises At this moment the cheerful hoot of a motor horn was heard from the drive Huddle rushed to the hall door with the feeling of a man half awakened from a nightmare and beheld Sir Leon Birberry who had driven himself over in his car I got your telegram he said what s up Telegram It seemed to be a day of telegrams Come here at once Urgent James Huddle was the purport of the message displayed before Huddle s bewildered eyes I see it all he exclaimed suddenly in a voice shaken with agitation and with a look of agony in the direction of the shrubbery he hauled the astonished Birberry into the house Tea had just been laid in the hall but the now thoroughly panic stricken Huddle dragged his protesting guest upstairs and in a few minutes time the entire household had been summoned to that region of momentary safety Clovis alone graced the tea table with his presence the fanatics in the library were evidently too immersed in their monstrous machinations to dally with the solace of teacup and hot toast Once the youth rose in answer to the summons of the front door bell and admitted mister Paul Isaacs shoemaker and parish councillor who had also received a pressing invitation to The Warren With an atrocious assumption of courtesy which a Borgia could hardly have outdone the secretary escorted this new captive of his net to the head of the stairway where his involuntary host awaited him And then ensued a long ghastly vigil of watching and waiting Once or twice Clovis left the house to stroll across to the shrubbery returning always to the library for the purpose evidently of making a brief report Once he took in the letters from the evening postman and brought them to the top of the stairs with punctilious politeness After his next absence he came half way up the stairs to make an announcement The Boy scouts mistook my signal and have killed the postman I ve had very little practice in this sort of thing you see Another time I shall do better The housemaid who was engaged to be married to the evening postman gave way to clamorous grief Remember that your mistress has a headache said J P Huddle Miss Huddle s headache was worse Clovis hastened downstairs and after a short visit to the library returned with another message The Bishop is sorry to hear that Miss Huddle has a headache He is issuing orders that as far as possible no firearms shall be used near the house any killing that is necessary on the premises will be done with cold steel The Bishop does not see why a man should not be a gentleman as well as a Christian That was the last they saw of Clovis it was nearly seven o clock and his elderly relative liked him to dress for dinner But though he had left them for ever the lurking suggestion of his presence haunted the lower regions of the house during the long hours of the wakeful night and every creak of the stairway every rustle of wind through the shrubbery was fraught with horrible meaning At about seven next morning the gardener s boy and the early postman finally convinced the watchers that the Twentieth Century was still unblotted I don t suppose mused Clovis as an early train bore him townwards that they will be in the least grateful for the Unrest cure THE JESTING OF ARLINGTON STRINGHAM Arlington Stringham made a joke in the House of Commons It was a thin House and a very thin joke something about the Anglo Saxon race having a great many angles It is possible that it was unintentional but a fellow member who did not wish it to be supposed that he was asleep because his eyes were shut laughed One or two of the papers noted a laugh in brackets and another which was notorious for the carelessness of its political news mentioned laughter Things often begin in that way Arlington made a joke in the House last night said Eleanor Stringham to her mother in all the years we ve been married neither of us has made jokes and I don t like it now I m afraid it s the beginning of the rift in the lute What lute said her mother It s a quotation said Eleanor To say that anything was a quotation was an excellent method in Eleanor s eyes for withdrawing it from discussion just as you could always defend indifferent lamb late in the season by saying It s mutton And of course Arlington Stringham continued to tread the thorny path of conscious humour into which Fate had beckoned him The country s looking very green but after all that s what it s there for he remarked to his wife two days later That s very modern and I dare say very clever but I m afraid it s wasted on me she observed coldly If she had known how much effort it had cost him to make the remark she might have greeted it in a kinder spirit It is the tragedy of human endeavour that it works so often unseen and unguessed Arlington said nothing not from injured pride but because he was thinking hard for something to say Eleanor mistook his silence for an assumption of tolerant superiority and her anger prompted her to a further gibe You had better tell it to Lady Isobel I ve no doubt she would appreciate it Lady Isobel was seen everywhere with a fawn coloured collie at a time when every one else kept nothing but Pekinese and she had once eaten four green apples at an afternoon tea in the Botanical Gardens so she was widely credited with a rather unpleasant wit The censorious said she slept in a hammock and understood Yeats s poems but her family denied both stories The rift is widening to an abyss said Eleanor to her mother that afternoon I should not tell that to anyone remarked her mother after long reflection Naturally I should not talk about it very much said Eleanor but why shouldn t I mention it to anyone Because you can t have an abyss in a lute There isn t room Eleanor s outlook on life did not improve as the afternoon wore on The page boy had brought from the library BY MERE AND WOLD instead of BY MERE CHANCE the book which every one denied having read The unwelcome substitute appeared to be a collection of nature notes contributed by the author to the pages of some Northern weekly and when one had been prepared to plunge with disapproving mind into a regrettable chronicle of ill spent lives it was intensely irritating to read the dainty yellow hammers are now with us and flaunt their jaundiced livery from every bush and hillock Besides the thing was so obviously untrue either there must be hardly any bushes or hillocks in those parts or the country must be fearfully overstocked with yellow hammers The thing scarcely seemed worth telling such a lie about And the page boy stood there with his sleekly brushed and parted hair and his air of chaste and callous indifference to the desires and passions of the world Eleanor hated boys and she would have liked to have whipped this one long and often It was perhaps the yearning of a woman who had no children of her own She turned at random to another paragraph Lie quietly concealed in the fern and bramble in the gap by the old rowan tree and you may see almost every evening during early summer a pair of lesser whitethroats creeping up and down the nettles and hedge growth that mask their nesting place The insufferable monotony of the proposed recreation Eleanor would not have watched the most brilliant performance at His Majesty s Theatre for a single evening under such uncomfortable circumstances and to be asked to watch lesser whitethroats creeping up and down a nettle almost every evening during the height of the season struck her as an imputation on her intelligence that was positively offensive Impatiently she transferred her attention to the dinner menu which the boy had thoughtfully brought in as an alternative to the more solid literary fare Rabbit curry met her eye and the lines of disapproval deepened on her already puckered brow The cook was a great believer in the influence of environment and nourished an obstinate conviction that if you brought rabbit and curry powder together in one dish a rabbit curry would be the result And Clovis and the odious Bertie van Tahn were coming to dinner Surely thought Eleanor if Arlington knew how much she had had that day to try her he would refrain from joke making At dinner that night it was Eleanor herself who mentioned the name of a certain statesman who may be decently covered under the disguise of X X said Arlington Stringham has the soul of a meringue It was a useful remark to have on hand because it applied equally well to four prominent statesmen of the day which quadrupled the opportunities for using it Meringues haven t got souls said Eleanor s mother It s a mercy that they haven t said Clovis they would be always losing them and people like my aunt would get up missions to meringues and say it was wonderful how much one could teach them and how much more one could learn from them What could you learn from a meringue asked Eleanor s mother My aunt has been known to learn humility from an ex Viceroy said Clovis I wish cook would learn to make curry or have the sense to leave it alone said Arlington suddenly and savagely Eleanor s face softened It was like one of his old remarks in the days when there was no abyss between them It was during the debate on the Foreign Office vote that Stringham made his great remark that the people of Crete unfortunately make more history than they can consume locally It was not brilliant but it came in the middle of a dull speech and the House was quite pleased with it Old gentlemen with bad memories said it reminded them of Disraeli It was Eleanor s friend Gertrude Ilpton who drew her attention to Arlington s newest outbreak Eleanor in these days avoided the morning papers It s very modern and I suppose very clever she observed Of course it s clever said Gertrude all Lady Isobel s sayings are clever and luckily they bear repeating Are you sure it s one of her sayings asked Eleanor My dear I ve heard her say it dozens of times So that is where he gets his humour said Eleanor slowly and the hard lines deepened round her mouth The death of Eleanor Stringham from an overdose of chloral occurring at the end of a rather uneventful season excited a certain amount of unobtrusive speculation Clovis who perhaps exaggerated the importance of curry in the home hinted at domestic sorrow And of course Arlington never knew It was the tragedy of his life that he should miss the fullest effect of his jesting SREDNI VASHTAR Conradin was ten years old and the doctor had pronounced his professional opinion that the boy would not live another five years The doctor was silky and effete and counted for little but his opinion was endorsed by missus de Ropp who counted for nearly everything missus De Ropp was Conradin s cousin and guardian and in his eyes she represented those three fifths of the world that are necessary and disagreeable and real the other two fifths in perpetual antagonism to the foregoing were summed up in himself and his imagination One of these days Conradin supposed he would succumb to the mastering pressure of wearisome necessary things such as illnesses and coddling restrictions and drawn out dullness Without his imagination which was rampant under the spur of loneliness he would have succumbed long ago missus de Ropp would never in her honestest moments have confessed to herself that she disliked Conradin though she might have been dimly aware that thwarting him for his good was a duty which she did not find particularly irksome Conradin hated her with a desperate sincerity which he was perfectly able to mask Such few pleasures as he could contrive for himself gained an added relish from the likelihood that they would be displeasing to his guardian and from the realm of his imagination she was locked out an unclean thing which should find no entrance In the dull cheerless garden overlooked by so many windows that were ready to open with a message not to do this or that or a reminder that medicines were due he found little attraction The few fruit trees that it contained were set jealously apart from his plucking as though they were rare specimens of their kind blooming in an arid waste it would probably have been difficult to find a market gardener who would have offered ten shillings for their entire yearly produce In a forgotten corner however almost hidden behind a dismal shrubbery was a disused tool shed of respectable proportions and within its walls Conradin found a haven something that took on the varying aspects of a playroom and a cathedral He had peopled it with a legion of familiar phantoms evoked partly from fragments of history and partly from his own brain but it also boasted two inmates of flesh and blood In one corner lived a ragged plumaged Houdan hen on which the boy lavished an affection that had scarcely another outlet Further back in the gloom stood a large hutch divided into two compartments one of which was fronted with close iron bars This was the abode of a large polecat ferret which a friendly butcher boy had once smuggled cage and all into its present quarters in exchange for a long secreted hoard of small silver Conradin was dreadfully afraid of the lithe sharp fanged beast but it was his most treasured possession Its very presence in the tool shed was a secret and fearful joy to be kept scrupulously from the knowledge of the Woman as he privately dubbed his cousin And one day out of Heaven knows what material he spun the beast a wonderful name and from that moment it grew into a god and a religion The Woman indulged in religion once a week at a church near by and took Conradin with her but to him the church service was an alien rite in the House of Rimmon Every Thursday in the dim and musty silence of the tool shed he worshipped with mystic and elaborate ceremonial before the wooden hutch where dwelt Sredni Vashtar the great ferret Red flowers in their season and scarlet berries in the winter time were offered at his shrine for he was a god who laid some special stress on the fierce impatient side of things as opposed to the Woman s religion which as far as Conradin could observe went to great lengths in the contrary direction And on great festivals powdered nutmeg was strewn in front of his hutch an important feature of the offering being that the nutmeg had to be stolen These festivals were of irregular occurrence and were chiefly appointed to celebrate some passing event On one occasion when missus de Ropp suffered from acute toothache for three days Conradin kept up the festival during the entire three days and almost succeeded in persuading himself that Sredni Vashtar was personally responsible for the toothache If the malady had lasted for another day the supply of nutmeg would have given out The Houdan hen was never drawn into the cult of Sredni Vashtar Conradin had long ago settled that she was an Anabaptist He did not pretend to have the remotest knowledge as to what an Anabaptist was but he privately hoped that it was dashing and not very respectable missus de Ropp was the ground plan on which he based and detested all respectability After a while Conradin s absorption in the tool shed began to attract the notice of his guardian It is not good for him to be pottering down there in all weathers she promptly decided and at breakfast one morning she announced that the Houdan hen had been sold and taken away overnight With her short sighted eyes she peered at Conradin waiting for an outbreak of rage and sorrow which she was ready to rebuke with a flow of excellent precepts and reasoning But Conradin said nothing there was nothing to be said Something perhaps in his white set face gave her a momentary qualm for at tea that afternoon there was toast on the table a delicacy which she usually banned on the ground that it was bad for him also because the making of it gave trouble a deadly offence in the middle class feminine eye I thought you liked toast she exclaimed with an injured air observing that he did not touch it Sometimes said Conradin In the shed that evening there was an innovation in the worship of the hutch god Conradin had been wont to chant his praises to night he asked a boon Do one thing for me Sredni Vashtar The thing was not specified As Sredni Vashtar was a god he must be supposed to know And choking back a sob as he looked at that other empty corner Conradin went back to the world he so hated And every night in the welcome darkness of his bedroom and every evening in the dusk of the tool shed Conradin s bitter litany went up Do one thing for me Sredni Vashtar missus de Ropp noticed that the visits to the shed did not cease and one day she made a further journey of inspection What are you keeping in that locked hutch she asked I believe it s guinea pigs I ll have them all cleared away Conradin shut his lips tight but the Woman ransacked his bedroom till she found the carefully hidden key and forthwith marched down to the shed to complete her discovery It was a cold afternoon and Conradin had been bidden to keep to the house From the furthest window of the dining room the door of the shed could just be seen beyond the corner of the shrubbery and there Conradin stationed himself He saw the Woman enter and then he imagined her opening the door of the sacred hutch and peering down with her short sighted eyes into the thick straw bed where his god lay hidden Perhaps she would prod at the straw in her clumsy impatience And Conradin fervently breathed his prayer for the last time But he knew as he prayed that he did not believe He knew that the Woman would come out presently with that pursed smile he loathed so well on her face and that in an hour or two the gardener would carry away his wonderful god a god no longer but a simple brown ferret in a hutch And he knew that the Woman would triumph always as she triumphed now and that he would grow ever more sickly under her pestering and domineering and superior wisdom till one day nothing would matter much more with him and the doctor would be proved right And in the sting and misery of his defeat he began to chant loudly and defiantly the hymn of his threatened idol Sredni Vashtar went forth His thoughts were red thoughts and his teeth were white His enemies called for peace but he brought them death Sredni Vashtar the Beautiful And then of a sudden he stopped his chanting and drew closer to the window pane The door of the shed still stood ajar as it had been left and the minutes were slipping by They were long minutes but they slipped by nevertheless He watched the starlings running and flying in little parties across the lawn he counted them over and over again with one eye always on that swinging door A sour faced maid came in to lay the table for tea and still Conradin stood and waited and watched Hope had crept by inches into his heart and now a look of triumph began to blaze in his eyes that had only known the wistful patience of defeat Under his breath with a furtive exultation he began once again the paean of victory and devastation And presently his eyes were rewarded out through that doorway came a long low yellow and brown beast with eyes a blink at the waning daylight and dark wet stains around the fur of jaws and throat Conradin dropped on his knees The great polecat ferret made its way down to a small brook at the foot of the garden drank for a moment then crossed a little plank bridge and was lost to sight in the bushes Such was the passing of Sredni Vashtar Tea is ready said the sour faced maid where is the mistress She went down to the shed some time ago said Conradin And while the maid went to summon her mistress to tea Conradin fished a toasting fork out of the sideboard drawer and proceeded to toast himself a piece of bread And during the toasting of it and the buttering of it with much butter and the slow enjoyment of eating it Conradin listened to the noises and silences which fell in quick spasms beyond the dining room door The loud foolish screaming of the maid the answering chorus of wondering ejaculations from the kitchen region the scuttering footsteps and hurried embassies for outside help and then after a lull the scared sobbings and the shuffling tread of those who bore a heavy burden into the house Whoever will break it to the poor child I couldn t for the life of me exclaimed a shrill voice And while they debated the matter among themselves Conradin made himself another piece of toast ADRIAN A CHAPTER IN ACCLIMATIZATION His baptismal register spoke of him pessimistically as John Henry but he had left that behind with the other maladies of infancy and his friends knew him under the front name of Adrian His mother lived in Bethnal Green which was not altogether his fault one can discourage too much history in one s family but one cannot always prevent geography And after all the Bethnal Green habit has this virtue that it is seldom transmitted to the next generation Adrian lived in a roomlet which came under the auspicious constellation of W How he lived was to a great extent a mystery even to himself his struggle for existence probably coincided in many material details with the rather dramatic accounts he gave of it to sympathetic acquaintances All that is definitely known is that he now and then emerged from the struggle to dine at the Ritz or Carlton correctly garbed and with a correctly critical appetite On these occasions he was usually the guest of Lucas Croyden an amiable worldling who had three thousand a year and a taste for introducing impossible people to irreproachable cookery Like most men who combine three thousand a year with an uncertain digestion Lucas was a Socialist and he argued that you cannot hope to elevate the masses until you have brought plovers eggs into their lives and taught them to appreciate the difference between coupe Jacques and Macedoine de fruits His friends pointed out that it was a doubtful kindness to initiate a boy from behind a drapery counter into the blessedness of the higher catering to which Lucas invariably replied that all kindnesses were doubtful Which was perhaps true It was after one of his Adrian evenings that Lucas met his aunt missus Mebberley at a fashionable tea shop where the lamp of family life is still kept burning and you meet relatives who might otherwise have slipped your memory Who was that good looking boy who was dining with you last night she asked He looked much too nice to be thrown away upon you Susan Mebberley was a charming woman but she was also an aunt Who are his people she continued when the protege s name revised version had been given her His mother lives at Beth Lucas checked himself on the threshold of what was perhaps a social indiscretion Beth Where is it It sounds like Asia Minor Is she mixed up with Consular people Oh no Her work lies among the poor This was a side slip into truth The mother of Adrian was employed in a laundry I see said missus Mebberley mission work of some sort And meanwhile the boy has no one to look after him It s obviously my duty to see that he doesn t come to harm Bring him to call on me My dear Aunt Susan expostulated Lucas I really know very little about him He may not be at all nice you know on further acquaintance He has delightful hair and a weak mouth I shall take him with me to Homburg or Cairo It s the maddest thing I ever heard of said Lucas angrily Well there is a strong strain of madness in our family If you haven t noticed it yourself all your friends must have One is so dreadfully under everybody s eyes at Homburg At least you might give him a preliminary trial at Etretat And be surrounded by Americans trying to talk French No thank you I love Americans but not when they try to talk French What a blessing it is that they never try to talk English To morrow at five you can bring your young friend to call on me And Lucas realizing that Susan Mebberley was a woman as well as an aunt saw that she would have to be allowed to have her own way Adrian was duly carried abroad under the Mebberley wing but as a reluctant concession to sanity Homburg and other inconveniently fashionable resorts were given a wide berth and the Mebberley establishment planted itself down in the best hotel at Dohledorf an Alpine townlet somewhere at the back of the Engadine It was the usual kind of resort with the usual type of visitors that one finds over the greater part of Switzerland during the summer season but to Adrian it was all unusual The mountain air the certainty of regular and abundant meals and in particular the social atmosphere affected him much as the indiscriminating fervour of a forcing house might affect a weed that had strayed within its limits He had been brought up in a world where breakages were regarded as crimes and expiated as such it was something new and altogether exhilarating to find that you were considered rather amusing if you smashed things in the right manner and at the recognized hours Susan Mebberley had expressed the intention of showing Adrian a bit of the world the particular bit of the world represented by Dohledorf began to be shown a good deal of Adrian Lucas got occasional glimpses of the Alpine sojourn not from his aunt or Adrian but from the industrious pen of Clovis who was also moving as a satellite in the Mebberley constellation The entertainment which Susan got up last night ended in disaster I thought it would The Grobmayer child a particularly loathsome five year old had appeared as Bubbles during the early part of the evening and been put to bed during the interval Adrian watched his opportunity and kidnapped it when the nurse was downstairs and introduced it during the second half of the entertainment thinly disguised as a performing pig It certainly LOOKED very like a pig and grunted and slobbered just like the real article no one knew exactly what it was but every one said it was awfully clever especially the Grobmayers At the third curtain Adrian pinched it too hard and it yelled Marmar I am supposed to be good at descriptions but don t ask me to describe the sayings and doings of the Grobmayers at that moment it was like one of the angrier Psalms set to Strauss s music We have moved to an hotel higher up the valley Clovis s next letter arrived five days later and was written from the Hotel Steinbock We left the Hotel Victoria this morning It was fairly comfortable and quiet at least there was an air of repose about it when we arrived Before we had been in residence twenty four hours most of the repose had vanished like a dutiful bream as Adrian expressed it However nothing unduly outrageous happened till last night when Adrian had a fit of insomnia and amused himself by unscrewing and transposing all the bedroom numbers on his floor He transferred the bathroom label to the adjoining bedroom door which happened to be that of Frau Hoftath Schilling and this morning from seven o clock onwards the old lady had a stream of involuntary visitors she was too horrified and scandalized it seems to get up and lock her door The would be bathers flew back in confusion to their rooms and of course the change of numbers led them astray again and the corridor gradually filled with panic stricken scantily robed humans dashing wildly about like rabbits in a ferret infested warren It took nearly an hour before the guests were all sorted into their respective rooms and the Frau Hofrath s condition was still causing some anxiety when we left Susan is beginning to look a little worried She can t very well turn the boy adrift as he hasn t got any money and she can t send him to his people as she doesn t know where they are Adrian says his mother moves about a good deal and he s lost her address Probably if the truth were known he s had a row at home So many boys nowadays seem to think that quarrelling with one s family is a recognized occupation Lucas s next communication from the travellers took the form of a telegram from missus Mebberley herself It was sent reply prepaid and consisted of a single sentence In Heaven s name where is Beth THE CHAPLET A strange stillness hung over the restaurant it was one of those rare moments when the orchestra was not discoursing the strains of the Ice cream Sailor waltz Did I ever tell you asked Clovis of his friend the tragedy of music at mealtimes It was a gala evening at the Grand Sybaris Hotel and a special dinner was being served in the Amethyst dining hall The Amethyst dining hall had almost a European reputation especially with that section of Europe which is historically identified with the Jordan Valley Its cooking was beyond reproach and its orchestra was sufficiently highly salaried to be above criticism Thither came in shoals the intensely musical and the almost intensely musical who are very many and in still greater numbers the merely musical who know how Tchaikowsky s name is pronounced and can recognize several of Chopin s nocturnes if you give them due warning these eat in the nervous detached manner of roebuck feeding in the open and keep anxious ears cocked towards the orchestra for the first hint of a recognizable melody Ah yes Pagliacci they murmur as the opening strains follow hot upon the soup and if no contradiction is forthcoming from any better informed quarter they break forth into subdued humming by way of supplementing the efforts of the musicians Sometimes the melody starts on level terms with the soup in which case the banqueters contrive somehow to hum between the spoonfuls the facial expression of enthusiasts who are punctuating potage saint Germain with Pagliacci is not beautiful but it should be seen by those who are bent on observing all sides of life One cannot discount the unpleasant things of this world merely by looking the other way In addition to the aforementioned types the restaurant was patronized by a fair sprinkling of the absolutely nonmusical their presence in the dining hall could only be explained on the supposition that they had come there to dine The earlier stages of the dinner had worn off The wine lists had been consulted by some with the blank embarrassment of a schoolboy suddenly called on to locate a Minor Prophet in the tangled hinterland of the Old Testament by others with the severe scrutiny which suggests that they have visited most of the higher priced wines in their own homes and probed their family weaknesses The diners who chose their wine in the latter fashion always gave their orders in a penetrating voice with a plentiful garnishing of stage directions By insisting on having your bottle pointing to the north when the cork is being drawn and calling the waiter Max you may induce an impression on your guests which hours of laboured boasting might be powerless to achieve For this purpose however the guests must be chosen as carefully as the wine Standing aside from the revellers in the shadow of a massive pillar was an interested spectator who was assuredly of the feast and yet not in it Monsieur Aristide Saucourt was the CHEF of the Grand Sybaris Hotel and if he had an equal in his profession he had never acknowledged the fact In his own domain he was a potentate hedged around with the cold brutality that Genius expects rather than excuses in her children he never forgave and those who served him were careful that there should be little to forgive In the outer world the world which devoured his creations he was an influence how profound or how shallow an influence he never attempted to guess It is the penalty and the safeguard of genius that it computes itself by troy weight in a world that measures by vulgar hundredweights Once in a way the great man would be seized with a desire to watch the effect of his master efforts just as the guiding brain of Krupp s might wish at a supreme moment to intrude into the firing line of an artillery duel And such an occasion was the present For the first time in the history of the Grand Sybaris Hotel he was presenting to its guests the dish which he had brought to that pitch of perfection which almost amounts to scandal Canetons a la mode d Ambleve In thin gilt lettering on the creamy white of the menu how little those words conveyed to the bulk of the imperfectly educated diners And yet how much specialized effort had been lavished how much carefully treasured lore had been ungarnered before those six words could be written In the Department of Deux Sevres ducklings had lived peculiar and beautiful lives and died in the odour of satiety to furnish the main theme of the dish champignons which even a purist for Saxon English would have hesitated to address as mushrooms had contributed their languorous atrophied bodies to the garnishing and a sauce devised in the twilight reign of the Fifteenth Louis had been summoned back from the imperishable past to take its part in the wonderful confection Thus far had human effort laboured to achieve the desired result the rest had been left to human genius the genius of Aristide Saucourt And now the moment had arrived for the serving of the great dish the dish which world weary Grand Dukes and market obsessed money magnates counted among their happiest memories And at the same moment something else happened The leader of the highly salaried orchestra placed his violin caressingly against his chin lowered his eyelids and floated into a sea of melody Hark said most of the diners he is playing The Chaplet They knew it was The Chaplet because they had heard it played at luncheon and afternoon tea and at supper the night before and had not had time to forget Yes he is playing The Chaplet they reassured one another The general voice was unanimous on the subject The orchestra had already played it eleven times that day four times by desire and seven times from force of habit but the familiar strains were greeted with the rapture due to a revelation A murmur of much humming rose from half the tables in the room and some of the more overwrought listeners laid down knife and fork in order to be able to burst in with loud clappings at the earliest permissible moment And the Canetons a la mode d Ambleve In stupefied sickened wonder Aristide watched them grow cold in total neglect or suffer the almost worse indignity of perfunctory pecking and listless munching while the banqueters lavished their approval and applause on the music makers Calves liver and bacon with parsley sauce could hardly have figured more ignominiously in the evening s entertainment And while the master of culinary art leaned back against the sheltering pillar choking with a horrible brain searing rage that could find no outlet for its agony the orchestra leader was bowing his acknowledgments of the hand clappings that rose in a storm around him Turning to his colleagues he nodded the signal for an encore But before the violin had been lifted anew into position there came from the shadow of the pillar an explosive negative Noh Noh You do not play thot again The musician turned in furious astonishment Had he taken warning from the look in the other man s eyes he might have acted differently But the admiring plaudits were ringing in his ears and he snarled out sharply That is for me to decide Noh You play thot never again shouted the CHEF and the next moment he had flung himself violently upon the loathed being who had supplanted him in the world s esteem A large metal tureen filled to the brim with steaming soup had just been placed on a side table in readiness for a late party of diners before the waiting staff or the guests had time to realize what was happening Aristide had dragged his struggling victim up to the table and plunged his head deep down into the almost boiling contents of the tureen At the further end of the room the diners were still spasmodically applauding in view of an encore Whether the leader of the orchestra died from drowning by soup or from the shock to his professional vanity or was scalded to death the doctors were never wholly able to agree Monsieur Aristide Saucourt who now lives in complete retirement always inclined to the drowning theory THE QUEST An unwonted peace hung over the Villa Elsinore broken however at frequent intervals by clamorous lamentations suggestive of bewildered bereavement The Momebys had lost their infant child hence the peace which its absence entailed they were looking for it in wild undisciplined fashion giving tongue the whole time which accounted for the outcry which swept through house and garden whenever they returned to try the home coverts anew Clovis who was temporarily and unwillingly a paying guest at the villa had been dozing in a hammock at the far end of the garden when missus Momeby had broken the news to him We ve lost Baby she screamed Do you mean that it s dead or stampeded or that you staked it at cards and lost it that way asked Clovis lazily He was toddling about quite happily on the lawn said missus Momeby tearfully and Arnold had just come in and I was asking him what sort of sauce he would like with the asparagus I hope he said hollandaise interrupted Clovis with a show of quickened interest because if there s anything I hate And all of a sudden I missed Baby continued missus Momeby in a shriller tone We ve hunted high and low in house and garden and outside the gates and he s nowhere to be seen Is he anywhere to be heard asked Clovis if not he must be at least two miles away But where And how asked the distracted mother Perhaps an eagle or a wild beast has carried him off suggested Clovis There aren t eagles and wild beasts in Surrey said missus Momeby but a note of horror had crept into her voice They escape now and then from travelling shows Sometimes I think they let them get loose for the sake of the advertisement Think what a sensational headline it would make in the local papers Infant son of prominent Nonconformist devoured by spotted hyaena Your husband isn t a prominent Nonconformist but his mother came of Wesleyan stock and you must allow the newspapers some latitude But we should have found his remains sobbed missus Momeby If the hyaena was really hungry and not merely toying with his food there wouldn t be much in the way of remains It would be like the small boy and apple story there ain t going to be no core missus Momeby turned away hastily to seek comfort and counsel in some other direction With the selfish absorption of young motherhood she entirely disregarded Clovis s obvious anxiety about the asparagus sauce Before she had gone a yard however the click of the side gate caused her to pull up sharp Miss Gilpet from the Villa Peterhof had come over to hear details of the bereavement Clovis was already rather bored with the story but missus Momeby was equipped with that merciless faculty which finds as much joy in the ninetieth time of telling as in the first Arnold had just come in he was complaining of rheumatism There are so many things to complain of in this household that it would never have occurred to me to complain of rheumatism murmured Clovis He was complaining of rheumatism continued missus Momeby trying to throw a chilling inflection into a voice that was already doing a good deal of sobbing and talking at high pressure as well She was again interrupted There is no such thing as rheumatism said Miss Gilpet She said it with the conscious air of defiance that a waiter adopts in announcing that the cheapest priced claret in the wine list is no more She did not proceed however to offer the alternative of some more expensive malady but denied the existence of them all missus Momeby s temper began to shine out through her grief I suppose you ll say next that Baby hasn t really disappeared He has disappeared conceded Miss Gilpet but only because you haven t sufficient faith to find him It s only lack of faith on your part that prevents him from being restored to you safe and well But if he s been eaten in the meantime by a hyaena and partly digested said Clovis who clung affectionately to his wild beast theory surely some ill effects would be noticeable Miss Gilpet was rather staggered by this complication of the question I feel sure that a hyaena has not eaten him she said lamely The hyaena may be equally certain that it has You see it may have just as much faith as you have and more special knowledge as to the present whereabouts of the baby missus Momeby was in tears again If you have faith she sobbed struck by a happy inspiration won t you find our little Erik for us I am sure you have powers that are denied to us Rose Marie Gilpet was thoroughly sincere in her adherence to Christian Science principles whether she understood or correctly expounded them the learned in such matters may best decide In the present case she was undoubtedly confronted with a great opportunity and as she started forth on her vague search she strenuously summoned to her aid every scrap of faith that she possessed She passed out into the bare and open high road followed by missus Momeby s warning It s no use going there we ve searched there a dozen times But Rose Marie s ears were already deaf to all things save self congratulation for sitting in the middle of the highway playing contentedly with the dust and some faded buttercups was a white pinafored baby with a mop of tow coloured hair tied over one temple with a pale blue ribbon Taking first the usual feminine precaution of looking to see that no motor car was on the distant horizon Rose Marie dashed at the child and bore it despite its vigorous opposition in through the portals of Elsinore The child s furious screams had already announced the fact of its discovery and the almost hysterical parents raced down the lawn to meet their restored offspring The aesthetic value of the scene was marred in some degree by Rose Marie s difficulty in holding the struggling infant which was borne wrong end foremost towards the agitated bosom of its family Our own little Erik come back to us cried the Momebys in unison as the child had rammed its fists tightly into its eye sockets and nothing could be seen of its face but a widely gaping mouth the recognition was in itself almost an act of faith Is he glad to get back to Daddy and Mummy again crooned missus Momeby the preference which the child was showing for its dust and buttercup distractions was so marked that the question struck Clovis as being unnecessarily tactless Give him a ride on the roly poly suggested the father brilliantly as the howls continued with no sign of early abatement In a moment the child had been placed astride the big garden roller and a preliminary tug was given to set it in motion From the hollow depths of the cylinder came an earsplitting roar drowning even the vocal efforts of the squalling baby and immediately afterwards there crept forth a white pinafored infant with a mop of tow coloured hair tied over one temple with a pale blue ribbon There was no mistaking either the features or the lung power of the new arrival Our own little Erik screamed missus Momeby pouncing on him and nearly smothering him with kisses did he hide in the roly poly to give us all a big fright This was the obvious explanation of the child s sudden disappearance and equally abrupt discovery There remained however the problem of the interloping baby which now sat whimpering on the lawn in a disfavour as chilling as its previous popularity had been unwelcome The Momebys glared at it as though it had wormed its way into their short lived affections by heartless and unworthy pretences Miss Gilpet s face took on an ashen tinge as she stared helplessly at the bunched up figure that had been such a gladsome sight to her eyes a few moments ago When love is over how little of love even the lover understands quoted Clovis to himself Rose Marie was the first to break the silence If that is Erik you have in your arms who is that That I think is for you to explain said missus Momeby stiffly Obviously said Clovis it s a duplicate Erik that your powers of faith called into being The question is What are you going to do with him The ashen pallor deepened in Rose Marie s cheeks missus Momeby clutched the genuine Erik closer to her side as though she feared that her uncanny neighbour might out of sheer pique turn him into a bowl of gold fish I found him sitting in the middle of the road said Rose Marie weakly You can t take him back and leave him there said Clovis the highway is meant for traffic not to be used as a lumber room for disused miracles Rose Marie wept The proverb Weep and you weep alone broke down as badly on application as most of its kind Both babies were wailing lugubriously and the parent Momebys had scarcely recovered from their earlier lachrymose condition Clovis alone maintained an unruffled cheerfulness Must I keep him always asked Rose Marie dolefully Not always said Clovis consolingly he can go into the Navy when he s thirteen Rose Marie wept afresh Of course added Clovis there may be no end of a bother about his birth certificate You ll have to explain matters to the Admiralty and they re dreadfully hidebound It was rather a relief when a breathless nursemaid from the Villa Charlottenburg over the way came running across the lawn to claim little Percy who had slipped out of the front gate and disappeared like a twinkling from the high road And even then Clovis found it necessary to go in person to the kitchen to make sure about the asparagus sauce WRATISLAV The Graefin s two elder sons had made deplorable marriages It was observed Clovis a family habit The youngest boy Wratislav who was the black sheep of a rather greyish family had as yet made no marriage at all There is certainly this much to be said for viciousness said the Graefin it keeps boys out of mischief Does it asked the Baroness Sophie not by way of questioning the statement but with a painstaking effort to talk intelligently It was the one matter in which she attempted to override the decrees of Providence which had obviously never intended that she should talk otherwise than inanely I don t know why I shouldn t talk cleverly she would complain my mother was considered a brilliant conversationalist These things have a way of skipping one generation said the Graefin That seems so unjust said Sophie one doesn t object to one s mother having outshone one as a clever talker but I must admit that I should be rather annoyed if my daughters talked brilliantly Well none of them do said the Graefin consolingly I don t know about that said the Baroness promptly veering round in defence of her offspring Elsa said something quite clever on Thursday about the Triple Alliance Something about it being like a paper umbrella that was all right as long as you didn t take it out in the rain It s not every one who could say that Every one has said it at least every one that I know But then I know very few people I don t think you re particularly agreeable to day I never am Haven t you noticed that women with a really perfect profile like mine are seldom even moderately agreeable I don t think your profile is so perfect as all that said the Baroness It would be surprising if it wasn t My mother was one of the most noted classical beauties of her day These things sometimes skip a generation you know put in the Baroness with the breathless haste of one to whom repartee comes as rarely as the finding of a gold handled umbrella My dear Sophie said the Graefin sweetly that isn t in the least bit clever but you do try so hard that I suppose I oughtn t to discourage you Tell me something has it ever occurred to you that Elsa would do very well for Wratislav It s time he married somebody and why not Elsa Elsa marry that dreadful boy gasped the Baroness Beggars can t be choosers observed the Graefin Elsa isn t a beggar Not financially or I shouldn t have suggested the match But she s getting on you know and has no pretensions to brains or looks or anything of that sort You seem to forget that she s my daughter That shows my generosity But seriously I don t see what there is against Wratislav He has no debts at least nothing worth speaking about But think of his reputation If half the things they say about him are true Probably three quarters of them are But what of it You don t want an archangel for a son in law I don t want Wratislav My poor Elsa would be miserable with him A little misery wouldn t matter very much with her it would go so well with the way she does her hair and if she couldn t get on with Wratislav she could always go and do good among the poor The Baroness picked up a framed photograph from the table He certainly is very handsome she said doubtfully adding even more doubtfully I dare say dear Elsa might reform him The Graefin had the presence of mind to laugh in the right key Three weeks later the Graefin bore down upon the Baroness Sophie in a foreign bookseller s shop in the Graben where she was possibly buying books of devotion though it was the wrong counter for them I ve just left the dear children at the Rodenstahls was the Graefin s greeting Were they looking very happy asked the Baroness Wratislav was wearing some new English clothes so of course he was quite happy I overheard him telling Toni a rather amusing story about a nun and a mousetrap which won t bear repetition Elsa was telling every one else a witticism about the Triple Alliance being like a paper umbrella which seems to bear repetition with Christian fortitude Did they seem much wrapped up in each other To be candid Elsa looked as if she were wrapped up in a horse rug And why let her wear saffron colour I always think it goes with her complexion Unfortunately it doesn t It stays with it Ugh Don t forget you re lunching with me on Thursday The Baroness was late for her luncheon engagement the following Thursday Imagine what has happened she screamed as she burst into the room Something remarkable to make you late for a meal said the Graefin Elsa has run away with the Rodenstahls chauffeur Kolossal Such a thing as that no one in our family has ever done gasped the Baroness Perhaps he didn t appeal to them in the same way suggested the Graefin judicially The Baroness began to feel that she was not getting the astonishment and sympathy to which her catastrophe entitled her At any rate she snapped now she can t marry Wratislav She couldn t in any case said the Graefin he left suddenly for abroad last night For abroad Where For Mexico I believe Mexico But what for Why Mexico The English have a proverb Conscience makes cowboys of us all I didn t know Wratislav had a conscience My dear Sophie he hasn t It s other people s consciences that send one abroad in a hurry Let s go and eat

1868-145473-0009	train-other-500	but the Burgomaster hoped that the resourceful English lady might have something new and tasteful to suggest in the way of loyal greeting The Prince was known to the outside world if at all as an old fashioned reactionary

1868-145473-0011	train-other-500	Lady Barbara discussed the matter with Lester and one or two acquaintances in her little hotel but ideas were difficult to come by
none	none	 Might I suggest something to the Gnaedige Frau 
1868-145473-0012	train-other-500	asked a sallow high cheek boned lady to whom the Englishwoman had spoken once or twice and whom she had set down in her mind as probably a Southern Slav Might I suggest something for the Reception Fest
1868-145473-0013	train-other-500	she went on with a certain shy eagerness Our little child here our baby we will dress him in little white coat with small wings as an Easter angel and he will carry a large white Easter egg
1868-145473-0014	train-other-500	and inside shall be a basket of plover eggs of which the Prince is so fond and he shall give it to his Highness as Easter offering It is so pretty an idea we have seen it done once in Styria
1868-145473-0015	train-other-500	Lady Barbara looked dubiously at the proposed Easter angel a fair wooden faced child of about four years old She had noticed it the day before in the hotel
1868-145473-0016	train-other-500	and wondered rather how such a towheaded child could belong to such a dark visaged couple as the woman and her husband probably she thought an adopted baby especially as the couple were not young

none	none	 We haf some pluffers eggs shall come fresh from Wien 
1868-145473-0018	train-other-500	said the husband The small child and Lady Barbara seemed equally unenthusiastic about the pretty idea Lester was openly discouraging
1868-145473-0019	train-other-500	but when the Burgomaster heard of it he was enchanted The combination of sentiment and plovers eggs appealed strongly to his Teutonic mind
1868-145473-0020	train-other-500	On the eventful day the Easter angel really quite prettily and quaintly dressed was a centre of kindly interest to the gala crowd marshalled to receive his Highness
1868-145473-0021	train-other-500	The mother was unobtrusive and less fussy than most parents would have been under the circumstances
1868-145473-0022	train-other-500	merely stipulating that she should place the Easter egg herself in the arms that had been carefully schooled how to hold the precious burden Then Lady Barbara moved forward
1868-145473-0023	train-other-500	the child marching stolidly and with grim determination at her side It had been promised cakes and sweeties galore if it gave the egg well and truly to the kind old gentleman who was waiting to receive it
1868-145473-0024	train-other-500	Lester had tried to convey to it privately that horrible smackings would attend any failure in its share of the proceedings but it is doubtful if his German caused more than an immediate distress
1868-145473-0025	train-other-500	Lady Barbara had thoughtfully provided herself with an emergency supply of chocolate sweetmeats children may sometimes be time servers but they do not encourage long accounts
1868-145473-0026	train-other-500	As they approached nearer to the princely dais Lady Barbara stood discreetly aside and the stolid faced infant walked forward alone with staggering but steadfast gait
1868-145473-0027	train-other-500	encouraged by a murmur of elderly approval Lester standing in the front row of the onlookers turned to scan the crowd for the beaming faces of the happy parents
none	none	 In a side road which led to the railway station he saw a cab 
1868-145473-0028	train-other-500	entering the cab with every appearance of furtive haste
none	none	 were the dark visaged couple who had been so plausibly eager for the pretty idea 
1868-145473-0029	train-other-500	The sharpened instinct of cowardice lit up the situation to him in one swift flash The blood roared and surged to his head as though thousands of floodgates had been opened in his veins and arteries
1868-145473-0030	train-other-500	and his brain was the common sluice in which all the torrents met He saw nothing but a blur around him Then the blood ebbed away in quick waves till his very heart seemed drained and empty
1868-145473-0031	train-other-500	and he stood nervelessly helplessly dumbly watching the child
none	none	 bearing its accursed burden with slow relentless steps 
1868-145473-0032	train-other-500	nearer and nearer to the group that waited sheep like to receive him A fascinated curiosity compelled Lester to turn his head towards the fugitives
1868-145473-0033	train-other-500	the cab had started at hot pace in the direction of the station The next moment Lester was running running faster than any of those present had ever seen a man run and
1868-145473-0034	train-other-500	he was not running away For that stray fraction of his life some unwonted impulse beset him some hint of the stock he came from and he ran unflinchingly towards danger
1868-145473-0035	train-other-500	He stooped and clutched at the Easter egg as one tries to scoop up the ball in Rugby football What he meant to do with it he had not considered the thing was to get it
1868-145473-0036	train-other-500	But the child had been promised cakes and sweetmeats if it safely gave the egg into the hands of the kindly old gentleman it uttered no scream but it held to its charge with limpet grip
1868-145473-0037	train-other-500	Lester sank to his knees tugging savagely at the tightly clasped burden and angry cries rose from the scandalized onlookers A questioning threatening ring formed round him
1868-145473-0038	train-other-500	then shrank back in recoil as he shrieked out one hideous word Lady Barbara heard the word and saw the crowd race away like scattered sheep saw the Prince forcibly hustled away by his attendants
1868-145473-0039	train-other-500	also she saw her son lying prone in an agony of overmastering terror his spasm of daring shattered by the child s unexpected resistance still clutching frantically as though for safety
none	none	 at that white satin gew gaw 
1868-145473-0040	train-other-500	unable to crawl even from its deadly neighbourhood able only to scream and scream and scream In her brain she was dimly conscious of balancing or striving to balance
1868-145473-0041	train-other-500	the abject shame which had him now in thrall against the one compelling act of courage which had flung him grandly and madly on to the point of danger
1868-145473-0042	train-other-500	It was only for the fraction of a minute that she stood watching the two entangled figures the infant with its woodenly obstinate face
none	none	 and body tense with dogged resistance 
1868-145473-0043	train-other-500	and the boy limp and already nearly dead with a terror that almost stifled his screams and over them the long gala streamers flapping gaily in the sunshine
1868-145473-0044	train-other-500	She never forgot the scene but then it was the last she ever saw
none	none	 Lady Barbara carries her scarred face with its sightless eyes as bravely as ever in the world but at Eastertide her friends are careful to keep from her ears any mention of the children s Easter symbol FILBOID STUDGE THE STORY OF A MOUSE THAT HELPED I want to marry your daughter said Mark Spayley with faltering eagerness I am only an artist with an income of two hundred a year and she is the daughter of an enormously wealthy man so I suppose you will think my offer a piece of presumption Duncan Dullamy the great company inflator showed no outward sign of displeasure As a matter of fact he was secretly relieved at the prospect of finding even a two hundred a year husband for his daughter Leonore A crisis was rapidly rushing upon him from which he knew he would emerge with neither money nor credit all his recent ventures had fallen flat and flattest of all had gone the wonderful new breakfast food Pipenta on the advertisement of which he had sunk such huge sums It could scarcely be called a drug in the market people bought drugs but no one bought Pipenta Would you marry Leonore if she were a poor man s daughter asked the man of phantom wealth Yes said Mark wisely avoiding the error of over protestation And to his astonishment Leonore s father not only gave his consent but suggested a fairly early date for the wedding I wish I could show my gratitude in some way said Mark with genuine emotion I m afraid it s rather like the mouse proposing to help the lion Get people to buy that beastly muck said Dullamy nodding savagely at a poster of the despised Pipenta and you ll have done more than any of my agents have been able to accomplish It wants a better name said Mark reflectively and something distinctive in the poster line Anyway I ll have a shot at it Three weeks later the world was advised of the coming of a new breakfast food heralded under the resounding name of Filboid Studge Spayley put forth no pictures of massive babies springing up with fungus like rapidity under its forcing influence or of representatives of the leading nations of the world scrambling with fatuous eagerness for its possession One huge sombre poster depicted the Damned in Hell suffering a new torment from their inability to get at the Filboid Studge which elegant young fiends held in transparent bowls just beyond their reach The scene was rendered even more gruesome by a subtle suggestion of the features of leading men and women of the day in the portrayal of the Lost Souls prominent individuals of both political parties Society hostesses well known dramatic authors and novelists and distinguished aeroplanists were dimly recognizable in that doomed throng noted lights of the musical comedy stage flickered wanly in the shades of the Inferno smiling still from force of habit but with the fearsome smiling rage of baffled effort The poster bore no fulsome allusions to the merits of the new breakfast food but a single grim statement ran in bold letters along its base They cannot buy it now Spayley had grasped the fact that people will do things from a sense of duty which they would never attempt as a pleasure There are thousands of respectable middle class men who if you found them unexpectedly in a Turkish bath would explain in all sincerity that a doctor had ordered them to take Turkish baths if you told them in return that you went there because you liked it they would stare in pained wonder at the frivolity of your motive In the same way whenever a massacre of Armenians is reported from Asia Minor every one assumes that it has been carried out under orders from somewhere or another no one seems to think that there are people who might LIKE to kill their neighbours now and then And so it was with the new breakfast food No one would have eaten Filboid Studge as a pleasure but the grim austerity of its advertisement drove housewives in shoals to the grocers shops to clamour for an immediate supply In small kitchens solemn pig tailed daughters helped depressed mothers to perform the primitive ritual of its preparation On the breakfast tables of cheerless parlours it was partaken of in silence Once the womenfolk discovered that it was thoroughly unpalatable their zeal in forcing it on their households knew no bounds You haven t eaten your Filboid Studge would be screamed at the appetiteless clerk as he hurried weariedly from the breakfast table and his evening meal would be prefaced by a warmed up mess which would be explained as your Filboid Studge that you didn t eat this morning Those strange fanatics who ostentatiously mortify themselves inwardly and outwardly with health biscuits and health garments battened aggressively on the new food Earnest spectacled young men devoured it on the steps of the National Liberal Club A bishop who did not believe in a future state preached against the poster and a peer s daughter died from eating too much of the compound A further advertisement was obtained when an infantry regiment mutinied and shot its officers rather than eat the nauseous mess fortunately Lord Birrell of Blatherstone who was War Minister at the moment saved the situation by his happy epigram that Discipline to be effective must be optional Filboid Studge had become a household word but Dullamy wisely realized that it was not necessarily the last word in breakfast dietary its supremacy would be challenged as soon as some yet more unpalatable food should be put on the market There might even be a reaction in favour of something tasty and appetizing and the Puritan austerity of the moment might be banished from domestic cookery At an opportune moment therefore he sold out his interests in the article which had brought him in colossal wealth at a critical juncture and placed his financial reputation beyond the reach of cavil As for Leonore who was now an heiress on a far greater scale than ever before he naturally found her something a vast deal higher in the husband market than a two hundred a year poster designer Mark Spayley the brainmouse who had helped the financial lion with such untoward effect was left to curse the day he produced the wonder working poster After all said Clovis meeting him shortly afterwards at his club you have this doubtful consolation that tis not in mortals to countermand success THE MUSIC ON THE HILL Sylvia Seltoun ate her breakfast in the morning room at Yessney with a pleasant sense of ultimate victory such as a fervent Ironside might have permitted himself on the morrow of Worcester fight She was scarcely pugnacious by temperament but belonged to that more successful class of fighters who are pugnacious by circumstance Fate had willed that her life should be occupied with a series of small struggles usually with the odds slightly against her and usually she had just managed to come through winning And now she felt that she had brought her hardest and certainly her most important struggle to a successful issue To have married Mortimer Seltoun Dead Mortimer as his more intimate enemies called him in the teeth of the cold hostility of his family and in spite of his unaffected indifference to women was indeed an achievement that had needed some determination and adroitness to carry through yesterday she had brought her victory to its concluding stage by wrenching her husband away from Town and its group of satellite watering places and settling him down in the vocabulary of her kind in this remote wood girt manor farm which was his country house You will never get Mortimer to go his mother had said carpingly but if he once goes he ll stay Yessney throws almost as much a spell over him as Town does One can understand what holds him to Town but Yessney and the dowager had shrugged her shoulders There was a sombre almost savage wildness about Yessney that was certainly not likely to appeal to town bred tastes and Sylvia notwithstanding her name was accustomed to nothing much more sylvan than leafy Kensington She looked on the country as something excellent and wholesome in its way which was apt to become troublesome if you encouraged it overmuch Distrust of town life had been a new thing with her born of her marriage with Mortimer and she had watched with satisfaction the gradual fading of what she called the Jermyn street look in his eyes as the woods and heather of Yessney had closed in on them yesternight Her will power and strategy had prevailed Mortimer would stay Outside the morning room windows was a triangular slope of turf which the indulgent might call a lawn and beyond its low hedge of neglected fuchsia bushes a steeper slope of heather and bracken dropped down into cavernous combes overgrown with oak and yew In its wild open savagery there seemed a stealthy linking of the joy of life with the terror of unseen things Sylvia smiled complacently as she gazed with a School of Art appreciation at the landscape and then of a sudden she almost shuddered It is very wild she said to Mortimer who had joined her one could almost think that in such a place the worship of Pan had never quite died out The worship of Pan never has died out said Mortimer Other newer gods have drawn aside his votaries from time to time but he is the Nature God to whom all must come back at last He has been called the Father of all the Gods but most of his children have been stillborn Sylvia was religious in an honest vaguely devotional kind of way and did not like to hear her beliefs spoken of as mere aftergrowths but it was at least something new and hopeful to hear Dead Mortimer speak with such energy and conviction on any subject You don t really believe in Pan she asked incredulously I ve been a fool in most things said Mortimer quietly but I m not such a fool as not to believe in Pan when I m down here And if you re wise you won t disbelieve in him too boastfully while you re in his country It was not till a week later when Sylvia had exhausted the attractions of the woodland walks round Yessney that she ventured on a tour of inspection of the farm buildings A farmyard suggested in her mind a scene of cheerful bustle with churns and flails and smiling dairymaids and teams of horses drinking knee deep in duck crowded ponds As she wandered among the gaunt grey buildings of Yessney manor farm her first impression was one of crushing stillness and desolation as though she had happened on some lone deserted homestead long given over to owls and cobwebs then came a sense of furtive watchful hostility the same shadow of unseen things that seemed to lurk in the wooded combes and coppices From behind heavy doors and shuttered windows came the restless stamp of hoof or rasp of chain halter and at times a muffled bellow from some stalled beast From a distant corner a shaggy dog watched her with intent unfriendly eyes as she drew near it slipped quietly into its kennel and slipped out again as noiselessly when she had passed by A few hens questing for food under a rick stole away under a gate at her approach Sylvia felt that if she had come across any human beings in this wilderness of barn and byre they would have fled wraith like from her gaze At last turning a corner quickly she came upon a living thing that did not fly from her Astretch in a pool of mud was an enormous sow gigantic beyond the town woman s wildest computation of swine flesh and speedily alert to resent and if necessary repel the unwonted intrusion It was Sylvia s turn to make an unobtrusive retreat As she threaded her way past rickyards and cowsheds and long blank walls she started suddenly at a strange sound the echo of a boy s laughter golden and equivocal Jan the only boy employed on the farm a towheaded wizen faced yokel was visibly at work on a potato clearing half way up the nearest hill side and Mortimer when questioned knew of no other probable or possible begetter of the hidden mockery that had ambushed Sylvia s retreat The memory of that untraceable echo was added to her other impressions of a furtive sinister something that hung around Yessney Of Mortimer she saw very little farm and woods and trout streams seemed to swallow him up from dawn till dusk Once following the direction she had seen him take in the morning she came to an open space in a nut copse further shut in by huge yew trees in the centre of which stood a stone pedestal surmounted by a small bronze figure of a youthful Pan It was a beautiful piece of workmanship but her attention was chiefly held by the fact that a newly cut bunch of grapes had been placed as an offering at its feet Grapes were none too plentiful at the manor house and Sylvia snatched the bunch angrily from the pedestal Contemptuous annoyance dominated her thoughts as she strolled slowly homeward and then gave way to a sharp feeling of something that was very near fright across a thick tangle of undergrowth a boy s face was scowling at her brown and beautiful with unutterably evil eyes It was a lonely pathway all pathways round Yessney were lonely for the matter of that and she sped forward without waiting to give a closer scrutiny to this sudden apparition It was not till she had reached the house that she discovered that she had dropped the bunch of grapes in her flight I saw a youth in the wood to day she told Mortimer that evening brown faced and rather handsome but a scoundrel to look at A gipsy lad I suppose A reasonable theory said Mortimer only there aren t any gipsies in these parts at present Then who was he asked Sylvia and as Mortimer appeared to have no theory of his own she passed on to recount her finding of the votive offering I suppose it was your doing she observed it s a harmless piece of lunacy but people would think you dreadfully silly if they knew of it Did you meddle with it in any way asked Mortimer I I threw the grapes away It seemed so silly said Sylvia watching Mortimer s impassive face for a sign of annoyance I don t think you were wise to do that he said reflectively I ve heard it said that the Wood Gods are rather horrible to those who molest them Horrible perhaps to those that believe in them but you see I don t retorted Sylvia All the same said Mortimer in his even dispassionate tone I should avoid the woods and orchards if I were you and give a wide berth to the horned beasts on the farm It was all nonsense of course but in that lonely wood girt spot nonsense seemed able to rear a bastard brood of uneasiness Mortimer said Sylvia suddenly I think we will go back to Town some time soon Her victory had not been so complete as she had supposed it had carried her on to ground that she was already anxious to quit I don t think you will ever go back to Town said Mortimer He seemed to be paraphrasing his mother s prediction as to himself Sylvia noted with dissatisfaction and some self contempt that the course of her next afternoon s ramble took her instinctively clear of the network of woods As to the horned cattle Mortimer s warning was scarcely needed for she had always regarded them as of doubtful neutrality at the best her imagination unsexed the most matronly dairy cows and turned them into bulls liable to see red at any moment The ram who fed in the narrow paddock below the orchards she had adjudged after ample and cautious probation to be of docile temper to day however she decided to leave his docility untested for the usually tranquil beast was roaming with every sign of restlessness from corner to corner of his meadow A low fitful piping as of some reedy flute was coming from the depth of a neighbouring copse and there seemed to be some subtle connection between the animal s restless pacing and the wild music from the wood Sylvia turned her steps in an upward direction and climbed the heather clad slopes that stretched in rolling shoulders high above Yessney She had left the piping notes behind her but across the wooded combes at her feet the wind brought her another kind of music the straining bay of hounds in full chase Yessney was just on the outskirts of the Devon and Somerset country and the hunted deer sometimes came that way Sylvia could presently see a dark body breasting hill after hill and sinking again and again out of sight as he crossed the combes while behind him steadily swelled that relentless chorus and she grew tense with the excited sympathy that one feels for any hunted thing in whose capture one is not directly interested And at last he broke through the outermost line of oak scrub and fern and stood panting in the open a fat September stag carrying a well furnished head His obvious course was to drop down to the brown pools of Undercombe and thence make his way towards the red deer s favoured sanctuary the sea To Sylvia s surprise however he turned his head to the upland slope and came lumbering resolutely onward over the heather It will be dreadful she thought the hounds will pull him down under my very eyes But the music of the pack seemed to have died away for a moment and in its place she heard again that wild piping which rose now on this side now on that as though urging the failing stag to a final effort Sylvia stood well aside from his path half hidden in a thick growth of whortle bushes and watched him swing stiffly upward his flanks dark with sweat the coarse hair on his neck showing light by contrast The pipe music shrilled suddenly around her seeming to come from the bushes at her very feet and at the same moment the great beast slewed round and bore directly down upon her In an instant her pity for the hunted animal was changed to wild terror at her own danger the thick heather roots mocked her scrambling efforts at flight and she looked frantically downward for a glimpse of oncoming hounds The huge antler spikes were within a few yards of her and in a flash of numbing fear she remembered Mortimer s warning to beware of horned beasts on the farm And then with a quick throb of joy she saw that she was not alone a human figure stood a few paces aside knee deep in the whortle bushes Drive it off she shrieked But the figure made no answering movement The antlers drove straight at her breast the acrid smell of the hunted animal was in her nostrils but her eyes were filled with the horror of something she saw other than her oncoming death And in her ears rang the echo of a boy s laughter golden and equivocal THE STORY OF saint VESPALUUS Tell me a story said the Baroness staring out despairingly at the rain it was that light apologetic sort of rain that looks as if it was going to leave off every minute and goes on for the greater part of the afternoon What sort of story asked Clovis giving his croquet mallet a valedictory shove into retirement One just true enough to be interesting and not true enough to be tiresome said the Baroness Clovis rearranged several cushions to his personal solace and satisfaction he knew that the Baroness liked her guests to be comfortable and he thought it right to respect her wishes in that particular Have I ever told you the story of Saint Vespaluus he asked You ve told me stories about grand dukes and lion tamers and financiers widows and a postmaster in Herzegovina said the Baroness and about an Italian jockey and an amateur governess who went to Warsaw and several about your mother but certainly never anything about a saint This story happened a long while ago he said in those uncomfortable piebald times when a third of the people were Pagan and a third Christian and the biggest third of all just followed whichever religion the Court happened to profess There was a certain king called Hkrikros who had a fearful temper and no immediate successor in his own family his married sister however had provided him with a large stock of nephews from which to select his heir And the most eligible and royally approved of all these nephews was the sixteen year old Vespaluus He was the best looking and the best horseman and javelin thrower and had that priceless princely gift of being able to walk past a supplicant with an air of not having seen him but would certainly have given something if he had My mother has that gift to a certain extent she can go smilingly and financially unscathed through a charity bazaar and meet the organizers next day with a solicitous had I but known you were in need of funds air that is really rather a triumph in audacity Now Hkrikros was a Pagan of the first water and kept the worship of the sacred serpents who lived in a hallowed grove on a hill near the royal palace up to a high pitch of enthusiasm The common people were allowed to please themselves within certain discreet limits in the matter of private religion but any official in the service of the Court who went over to the new cult was looked down on literally as well as metaphorically the looking down being done from the gallery that ran round the royal bear pit Consequently there was considerable scandal and consternation when the youthful Vespaluus appeared one day at a Court function with a rosary tucked into his belt and announced in reply to angry questionings that he had decided to adopt Christianity or at any rate to give it a trial If it had been any of the other nephews the king would possibly have ordered something drastic in the way of scourging and banishment but in the case of the favoured Vespaluus he determined to look on the whole thing much as a modern father might regard the announced intention of his son to adopt the stage as a profession He sent accordingly for the Royal Librarian The royal library in those days was not a very extensive affair and the keeper of the king s books had a great deal of leisure on his hands Consequently he was in frequent demand for the settlement of other people s affairs when these strayed beyond normal limits and got temporarily unmanageable You must reason with Prince Vespaluus said the king and impress on him the error of his ways We cannot have the heir to the throne setting such a dangerous example But where shall I find the necessary arguments asked the Librarian I give you free leave to pick and choose your arguments in the royal woods and coppices said the king if you cannot get together some cutting observations and stinging retorts suitable to the occasion you are a person of very poor resource So the Librarian went into the woods and gathered a goodly selection of highly argumentative rods and switches and then proceeded to reason with Vespaluus on the folly and iniquity and above all the unseemliness of his conduct His reasoning left a deep impression on the young prince an impression which lasted for many weeks during which time nothing more was heard about the unfortunate lapse into Christianity Then a further scandal of the same nature agitated the Court At a time when he should have been engaged in audibly invoking the gracious protection and patronage of the holy serpents Vespaluus was heard singing a chant in honour of saint Odilo of Cluny The king was furious at this new outbreak and began to take a gloomy view of the situation Vespaluus was evidently going to show a dangerous obstinacy in persisting in his heresy And yet there was nothing in his appearance to justify such perverseness he had not the pale eye of the fanatic or the mystic look of the dreamer On the contrary he was quite the best looking boy at Court he had an elegant well knit figure a healthy complexion eyes the colour of very ripe mulberries and dark hair smooth and very well cared for It sounds like a description of what you imagine yourself to have been like at the age of sixteen said the Baroness My mother has probably been showing you some of my early photographs said Clovis Having turned the sarcasm into a compliment he resumed his story The king had Vespaluus shut up in a dark tower for three days with nothing but bread and water to live on the squealing and fluttering of bats to listen to and drifting clouds to watch through one little window slit The anti Pagan section of the community began to talk portentously of the boy martyr The martyrdom was mitigated as far as the food was concerned by the carelessness of the tower warden who once or twice left a portion of his own supper of broiled meat and fruit and wine by mistake in the prince s cell After the punishment was over Vespaluus was closely watched for any further symptom of religious perversity for the king was determined to stand no more opposition on so important a matter even from a favourite nephew If there was any more of this nonsense he said the succession to the throne would have to be altered For a time all went well the festival of summer sports was approaching and the young Vespaluus was too engrossed in wrestling and foot running and javelin throwing competitions to bother himself with the strife of conflicting religious systems Then however came the great culminating feature of the summer festival the ceremonial dance round the grove of the sacred serpents and Vespaluus as we should say sat it out The affront to the State religion was too public and ostentatious to be overlooked even if the king had been so minded and he was not in the least so minded For a day and a half he sat apart and brooded and every one thought he was debating within himself the question of the young prince s death or pardon as a matter of fact he was merely thinking out the manner of the boy s death As the thing had to be done and was bound to attract an enormous amount of public attention in any case it was as well to make it as spectacular and impressive as possible Apart from his unfortunate taste in religions said the king and his obstinacy in adhering to it he is a sweet and pleasant youth therefore it is meet and fitting that he should be done to death by the winged envoys of sweetness Your Majesty means said the Royal Librarian I mean said the king that he shall be stung to death by bees By the royal bees of course A most elegant death said the Librarian Elegant and spectacular and decidedly painful said the king it fulfils all the conditions that could be wished for The king himself thought out all the details of the execution ceremony Vespaluus was to be stripped of his clothes his hands were to be bound behind him and he was then to be slung in a recumbent position immediately above three of the largest of the royal beehives so that the least movement of his body would bring him in jarring contact with them The rest could be safely left to the bees The death throes the king computed might last anything from fifteen to forty minutes though there was division of opinion and considerable wagering among the other nephews as to whether death might not be almost instantaneous or on the other hand whether it might not be deferred for a couple of hours Anyway they all agreed it was vastly preferable to being thrown down into an evil smelling bear pit and being clawed and mauled to death by imperfectly carnivorous animals It so happened however that the keeper of the royal hives had leanings towards Christianity himself and moreover like most of the Court officials he was very much attached to Vespaluus On the eve of the execution therefore he busied himself with removing the stings from all the royal bees it was a long and delicate operation but he was an expert bee master and by working hard nearly all night he succeeded in disarming all or almost all of the hive inmates I didn t know you could take the sting from a live bee said the Baroness incredulously Every profession has its secrets replied Clovis if it hadn t it wouldn t be a profession Well the moment for the execution arrived the king and Court took their places and accommodation was found for as many of the populace as wished to witness the unusual spectacle Fortunately the royal bee yard was of considerable dimensions and was commanded moreover by the terraces that ran round the royal gardens with a little squeezing and the erection of a few platforms room was found for everybody Vespaluus was carried into the open space in front of the hives blushing and slightly embarrassed but not at all displeased at the attention which was being centred on him He seems to have resembled you in more things than in appearance said the Baroness Don t interrupt at a critical point in the story said Clovis As soon as he had been carefully adjusted in the prescribed position over the hives and almost before the gaolers had time to retire to a safe distance Vespaluus gave a lusty and well aimed kick which sent all three hives toppling one over another The next moment he was wrapped from head to foot in bees each individual insect nursed the dreadful and humiliating knowledge that in this supreme hour of catastrophe it could not sting but each felt that it ought to pretend to Vespaluus squealed and wriggled with laughter for he was being tickled nearly to death and now and again he gave a furious kick and used a bad word as one of the few bees that had escaped disarmament got its protest home But the spectators saw with amazement that he showed no signs of approaching death agony and as the bees dropped wearily away in clusters from his body his flesh was seen to be as white and smooth as before the ordeal with a shiny glaze from the honey smear of innumerable bee feet and here and there a small red spot where one of the rare stings had left its mark It was obvious that a miracle had been performed in his favour and one loud murmur of astonishment or exultation rose from the onlooking crowd The king gave orders for Vespaluus to be taken down to await further orders and stalked silently back to his midday meal at which he was careful to eat heartily and drink copiously as though nothing unusual had happened After dinner he sent for the Royal Librarian What is the meaning of this fiasco he demanded Your Majesty said that official either there is something radically wrong with the bees There is nothing wrong with my bees said the king haughtily they are the best bees Or else said the Librarian there is something irremediably right about Prince Vespaluus If Vespaluus is right I must be wrong said the king The Librarian was silent for a moment Hasty speech has been the downfall of many ill considered silence was the undoing of the luckless Court functionary Forgetting the restraint due to his dignity and the golden rule which imposes repose of mind and body after a heavy meal the king rushed upon the keeper of the royal books and hit him repeatedly and promiscuously over the head with an ivory chessboard a pewter wine flagon and a brass candlestick he knocked him violently and often against an iron torch sconce and kicked him thrice round the banqueting chamber with rapid energetic kicks Finally he dragged him down a long passage by the hair of his head and flung him out of a window into the courtyard below Was he much hurt asked the Baroness More hurt than surprised said Clovis You see the king was notorious for his violent temper However this was the first time he had let himself go so unrestrainedly on the top of a heavy meal The Librarian lingered for many days in fact for all I know he may have ultimately recovered but Hkrikros died that same evening Vespaluus had hardly finished getting the honey stains off his body before a hurried deputation came to put the coronation oil on his head And what with the publicly witnessed miracle and the accession of a Christian sovereign it was not surprising that there was a general scramble of converts to the new religion A hastily consecrated bishop was overworked with a rush of baptisms in the hastily improvised Cathedral of saint Odilo And the boy martyr that might have been was transposed in the popular imagination into a royal boy saint whose fame attracted throngs of curious and devout sightseers to the capital Vespaluus who was busily engaged in organizing the games and athletic contests that were to mark the commencement of his reign had no time to give heed to the religious fervour which was effervescing round his personality the first indication he had of the existing state of affairs was when the Court Chamberlain a recent and very ardent addition to the Christian community brought for his approval the outlines of a projected ceremonial cutting down of the idolatrous serpent grove Your Majesty will be graciously pleased to cut down the first tree with a specially consecrated axe said the obsequious official I ll cut off your head first with any axe that comes handy said Vespaluus indignantly do you suppose that I m going to begin my reign by mortally affronting the sacred serpents It would be most unlucky But your Majesty s Christian principles exclaimed the bewildered Chamberlain I never had any said Vespaluus I used to pretend to be a Christian convert just to annoy Hkrikros He used to fly into such delicious tempers And it was rather fun being whipped and scolded and shut up in a tower all for nothing But as to turning Christian in real earnest like you people seem to do I couldn t think of such a thing And the holy and esteemed serpents have always helped me when I ve prayed to them for success in my running and wrestling and hunting and it was through their distinguished intercession that the bees were not able to hurt me with their stings It would be black ingratitude to turn against their worship at the very outset of my reign I hate you for suggesting it The Chamberlain wrung his hands despairingly But your Majesty he wailed the people are reverencing you as a saint and the nobles are being Christianized in batches and neighbouring potentates of that Faith are sending special envoys to welcome you as a brother There is some talk of making you the patron saint of beehives and a certain shade of honey yellow has been christened Vespaluusian gold at the Emperor s Court You can t surely go back on all this I don t mind being reverenced and greeted and honoured said Vespaluus I don t even mind being sainted in moderation as long as I m not expected to be saintly as well But I wish you clearly and finally to understand that I will NOT give up the worship of the august and auspicious serpents There was a world of unspoken bear pit in the way he uttered those last words and the mulberry dark eyes flashed dangerously A new reign said the Chamberlain to himself but the same old temper Finally as a State necessity the matter of the religions was compromised At stated intervals the king appeared before his subjects in the national cathedral in the character of saint Vespaluus and the idolatrous grove was gradually pruned and lopped away till nothing remained of it But the sacred and esteemed serpents were removed to a private shrubbery in the royal gardens where Vespaluus the Pagan and certain members of his household devoutly and decently worshipped them That possibly is the reason why the boy king s success in sports and hunting never deserted him to the end of his days and that is also the reason why in spite of the popular veneration for his sanctity he never received official canonization It has stopped raining said the Baroness THE WAY TO THE DAIRY The Baroness and Clovis sat in a much frequented corner of the Park exchanging biographical confidences about the long succession of passers by Who are those depressed looking young women who have just gone by asked the Baroness they have the air of people who have bowed to destiny and are not quite sure whether the salute will be returned Those said Clovis are the Brimley Bomefields I dare say you would look depressed if you had been through their experiences I m always having depressing experiences said the Baroness but I never give them outward expression It s as bad as looking one s age Tell me about the Brimley Bomefields Well said Clovis the beginning of their tragedy was that they found an aunt The aunt had been there all the time but they had very nearly forgotten her existence until a distant relative refreshed their memory by remembering her very distinctly in his will it is wonderful what the force of example will accomplish The aunt who had been unobtrusively poor became quite pleasantly rich and the Brimley Bomefields grew suddenly concerned at the loneliness of her life and took her under their collective wings She had as many wings around her at this time as one of those beast things in Revelation So far I don t see any tragedy from the Brimley Bomefields point of view said the Baroness We haven t got to it yet said Clovis The aunt had been used to living very simply and had seen next to nothing of what we should consider life and her nieces didn t encourage her to do much in the way of making a splash with her money Quite a good deal of it would come to them at her death and she was a fairly old woman but there was one circumstance which cast a shadow of gloom over the satisfaction they felt in the discovery and acquisition of this desirable aunt she openly acknowledged that a comfortable slice of her little fortune would go to a nephew on the other side of her family He was rather a deplorable thing in rotters and quite hopelessly top hole in the way of getting through money but he had been more or less decent to the old lady in her unremembered days and she wouldn t hear anything against him At least she wouldn t pay any attention to what she did hear but her nieces took care that she should have to listen to a good deal in that line It seemed such a pity they said among themselves that good money should fall into such worthless hands They habitually spoke of their aunt s money as good money as though other people s aunts dabbled for the most part in spurious currency Regularly after the Derby saint Leger and other notable racing events they indulged in audible speculations as to how much money Roger had squandered in unfortunate betting transactions His travelling expenses must come to a big sum said the eldest Brimley Bomefield one day they say he attends every race meeting in England besides others abroad I shouldn t wonder if he went all the way to India to see the race for the Calcutta Sweepstake that one hears so much about Travel enlarges the mind my dear Christine said her aunt Yes dear aunt travel undertaken in the right spirit agreed Christine but travel pursued merely as a means towards gambling and extravagant living is more likely to contract the purse than to enlarge the mind However as long as Roger enjoys himself I suppose he doesn t care how fast or unprofitably the money goes or where he is to find more It seems a pity that s all The aunt by that time had begun to talk of something else and it was doubtful if Christine s moralizing had been even accorded a hearing It was her remark however the aunt s remark I mean about travel enlarging the mind that gave the youngest Brimley Bomefield her great idea for the showing up of Roger If aunt could only be taken somewhere to see him gambling and throwing away money she said it would open her eyes to his character more effectually than anything we can say My dear Veronique said her sisters we can t go following him to race meetings Certainly not to race meetings said Veronique but we might go to some place where one can look on at gambling without taking part in it Do you mean Monte Carlo they asked her beginning to jump rather at the idea Monte Carlo is a long way off and has a dreadful reputation said Veronique I shouldn t like to tell our friends that we were going to Monte Carlo But I believe Roger usually goes to Dieppe about this time of year and some quite respectable English people go there and the journey wouldn t be expensive If aunt could stand the Channel crossing the change of scene might do her a lot of good And that was how the fateful idea came to the Brimley Bomefields From the very first set off disaster hung over the expedition as they afterwards remembered To begin with all the Brimley Bomefields were extremely unwell during the crossing while the aunt enjoyed the sea air and made friends with all manner of strange travelling companions Then although it was many years since she had been on the Continent she had served a very practical apprenticeship there as a paid companion and her knowledge of colloquial French beat theirs to a standstill It became increasingly difficult to keep under their collective wings a person who knew what she wanted and was able to ask for it and to see that she got it Also as far as Roger was concerned they drew Dieppe blank it turned out that he was staying at Pourville a little watering place a mile or two further west The Brimley Bomefields discovered that Dieppe was too crowded and frivolous and persuaded the old lady to migrate to the comparative seclusion of Pourville You won t find it dull you know they assured her there is a little casino attached to the hotel and you can watch the people dancing and throwing away their money at PETITS CHEVAUX It was just before PETITS CHEVAUX had been supplanted by BOULE Roger was not staying in the same hotel but they knew that the casino would be certain of his patronage on most afternoons and evenings On the first evening of their visit they wandered into the casino after a fairly early dinner and hovered near the tables Bertie van Tahn was staying there at the time and he described the whole incident to me The Brimley Bomefields kept a furtive watch on the doors as though they were expecting some one to turn up and the aunt got more and more amused and interested watching the little horses whirl round and round the board Do you know poor little number eight hasn t won for the last thirty two times she said to Christine I ve been keeping count I shall really have to put five francs on him to encourage him Come and watch the dancing dear said Christine nervously It was scarcely a part of their strategy that Roger should come in and find the old lady backing her fancy at the PETITS CHEVAUX table Just wait while I put five francs on number eight said the aunt and in another moment her money was lying on the table The horses commenced to move round it was a slow race this time and number eight crept up at the finish like some crafty demon and placed his nose just a fraction in front of number three who had seemed to be winning easily Recourse had to be had to measurement and the number eight was proclaimed the winner The aunt picked up thirty five francs After that the Brimley Bomefields would have had to have used concerted force to get her away from the tables When Roger appeared on the scene she was fifty two francs to the good her nieces were hovering forlornly in the background like chickens that have been hatched out by a duck and are despairingly watching their parent disporting herself in a dangerous and uncongenial element The supper party which Roger insisted on standing that night in honour of his aunt and the three Miss Brimley Bomefields was remarkable for the unrestrained gaiety of two of the participants and the funereal mirthlessness of the remaining guests I do not think Christine confided afterwards to a friend who re confided it to Bertie van Tahn that I shall ever be able to touch PATE DE FOIE GRAS again It would bring back memories of that awful evening For the next two or three days the nieces made plans for returning to England or moving on to some other resort where there was no casino The aunt was busy making a system for winning at PETITS CHEVAUX Number eight her first love had been running rather unkindly for her and a series of plunges on number five had turned out even worse Do you know I dropped over seven hundred francs at the tables this afternoon she announced cheerfully at dinner on the fourth evening of their visit Aunt Twenty eight pounds And you were losing last night too Oh I shall get it all back she said optimistically but not here These silly little horses are no good I shall go somewhere where one can play comfortably at roulette You needn t look so shocked I ve always felt that given the opportunity I should be an inveterate gambler and now you darlings have put the opportunity in my way I must drink your very good healths Waiter a bottle of PONTET CANET Ah it s number seven on the wine list I shall plunge on number seven to night It won four times running this afternoon when I was backing that silly number five Number seven was not in a winning mood that evening The Brimley Bomefields tired of watching disaster from a distance drew near to the table where their aunt was now an honoured habituee and gazed mournfully at the successive victories of one and five and eight and four which swept good money out of the purse of seven s obstinate backer The day s losses totalled something very near two thousand francs You incorrigible gamblers said Roger chaffingly to them when he found them at the tables We are not gambling said Christine freezingly we are looking on I DON T think said Roger knowingly of course you re a syndicate and aunt is putting the stakes on for all of you Anyone can tell by your looks when the wrong horse wins that you ve got a stake on Aunt and nephew had supper alone that night or at least they would have if Bertie hadn t joined them all the Brimley Bomefields had headaches The aunt carried them all off to Dieppe the next day and set cheerily about the task of winning back some of her losses Her luck was variable in fact she had some fair streaks of good fortune just enough to keep her thoroughly amused with her new distraction but on the whole she was a loser The Brimley Bomefields had a collective attack of nervous prostration on the day when she sold out a quantity of shares in Argentine rails Nothing will ever bring that money back they remarked lugubriously to one another Veronique at last could bear it no longer and went home you see it had been her idea to bring the aunt on this disastrous expedition and though the others did not cast the fact verbally in her face there was a certain lurking reproach in their eyes which was harder to meet than actual upbraidings The other two remained behind forlornly mounting guard over their aunt until such time as the waning of the Dieppe season should at last turn her in the direction of home and safety They made anxious calculations as to how little good money might with reasonable luck be squandered in the meantime Here however their reckoning went far astray the close of the Dieppe season merely turned their aunt s thoughts in search of some other convenient gambling resort Show a cat the way to the dairy I forget how the proverb goes on but it summed up the situation as far as the Brimley Bomefields aunt was concerned She had been introduced to unexplored pleasures and found them greatly to her liking and she was in no hurry to forgo the fruits of her newly acquired knowledge You see for the first time in her life the old thing was thoroughly enjoying herself she was losing money but she had plenty of fun and excitement over the process and she had enough left to do very comfortably on Indeed she was only just learning to understand the art of doing oneself well She was a popular hostess and in return her fellow gamblers were always ready to entertain her to dinners and suppers when their luck was in Her nieces who still remained in attendance on her with the pathetic unwillingness of a crew to leave a foundering treasure ship which might yet be steered into port found little pleasure in these Bohemian festivities to see good money lavished on good living for the entertainment of a nondescript circle of acquaintances who were not likely to be in any way socially useful to them did not attune them to a spirit of revelry They contrived whenever possible to excuse themselves from participation in their aunt s deplored gaieties the Brimley Bomefield headaches became famous And one day the nieces came to the conclusion that as they would have expressed it no useful purpose would be served by their continued attendance on a relative who had so thoroughly emancipated herself from the sheltering protection of their wings The aunt bore the announcement of their departure with a cheerfulness that was almost disconcerting It s time you went home and had those headaches seen to by a specialist was her comment on the situation The homeward journey of the Brimley Bomefields was a veritable retreat from Moscow and what made it the more bitter was the fact that the Moscow in this case was not overwhelmed with fire and ashes but merely extravagantly over illuminated From mutual friends and acquaintances they sometimes get glimpses of their prodigal relative who has settled down into a confirmed gambling maniac living on such salvage of income as obliging moneylenders have left at her disposal So you need not be surprised concluded Clovis if they do wear a depressed look in public Which is Veronique asked the Baroness The most depressed looking of the three said Clovis THE PEACE OFFERING I want you to help me in getting up a dramatic entertainment of some sort said the Baroness to Clovis You see there s been an election petition down here and a member unseated and no end of bitterness and ill feeling and the County is socially divided against itself I thought a play of some kind would be an excellent opportunity for bringing people together again and giving them something to think of besides tiresome political squabbles The Baroness was evidently ambitious of reproducing beneath her own roof the pacifying effects traditionally ascribed to the celebrated Reel of Tullochgorum We might do something on the lines of Greek tragedy said Clovis after due reflection the Return of Agamemnon for instance The Baroness frowned It sounds rather reminiscent of an election result doesn t it It wasn t that sort of return explained Clovis it was a home coming I thought you said it was a tragedy Well it was He was killed in his bathroom you know Oh now I know the story of course Do you want me to take the part of Charlotte Corday That s a different story and a different century said Clovis the dramatic unities forbid one to lay a scene in more than one century at a time The killing in this case has to be done by Clytemnestra Rather a pretty name I ll do that part I suppose you want to be Aga whatever his name is Dear no Agamemnon was the father of grown up children and probably wore a beard and looked prematurely aged I shall be his charioteer or bath attendant or something decorative of that kind We must do everything in the Sumurun manner you know I don t know said the Baroness at least I should know better if you would explain exactly what you mean by the Sumurun manner Clovis obliged Weird music and exotic skippings and flying leaps and lots of drapery and undrapery Particularly undrapery I think I told you the County are coming The County won t stand anything very Greek You can get over any objection by calling it Hygiene or limb culture or something of that sort After all every one exposes their insides to the public gaze and sympathy nowadays so why not one s outside My dear boy I can ask the County to a Greek play or to a costume play but to a Greek costume play never It doesn t do to let the dramatic instinct carry one too far one must consider one s environment When one lives among greyhounds one should avoid giving life like imitations of a rabbit unless one want s one s head snapped off Remember I ve got this place on a seven years lease And then continued the Baroness as to skippings and flying leaps I must ask Emily Dushford to take a part She s a dear good thing and will do anything she s told or try to but can you imagine her doing a flying leap under any circumstances She can be Cassandra and she need only take flying leaps into the future in a metaphorical sense Cassandra rather a pretty name What kind of character is she She was a sort of advance agent for calamities To know her was to know the worst Fortunately for the gaiety of the age she lived in no one took her very seriously Still it must have been fairly galling to have her turning up after every catastrophe with a conscious air of perhaps another time you ll believe what I say I should have wanted to kill her As Clytemnestra I believe you gratify that very natural wish Then it has a happy ending in spite of it being a tragedy Well hardly said Clovis you see the satisfaction of putting a violent end to Cassandra must have been considerably damped by the fact that she had foretold what was going to happen to her She probably dies with an intensely irritating what did I tell you smile on her lips By the way of course all the killing will be done in the Sumurun manner Please explain again said the Baroness taking out a notebook and pencil Little and often you know instead of one sweeping blow You see you are at your own home so there s no need to hurry over the murdering as though it were some disagreeable but necessary duty And what sort of end do I have I mean what curtain do I get I suppose you rush into your lover s arms That is where one of the flying leaps will come in The getting up and rehearsing of the play seemed likely to cause in a restricted area nearly as much heart burning and ill feeling as the election petition Clovis as adapter and stage manager insisted as far as he was able on the charioteer being quite the most prominent character in the play and his panther skin tunic caused almost as much trouble and discussion as Clytemnestra s spasmodic succession of lovers who broke down on probation with alarming uniformity When the cast was at length fixed beyond hope of reprieve matters went scarcely more smoothly Clovis and the Baroness rather overdid the Sumurun manner while the rest of the company could hardly be said to attempt it at all As for Cassandra who was expected to improvise her own prophecies she appeared to be as incapable of taking flying leaps into futurity as of executing more than a severely plantigrade walk across the stage Woe Trojans woe to Troy was the most inspired remark she could produce after several hours of conscientious study of all the available authorities It s no earthly use foretelling the fall of Troy expostulated Clovis because Troy has fallen before the action of the play begins And you mustn t say too much about your own impending doom either because that will give things away too much to the audience After several minutes of painful brain searching Cassandra smiled reassuringly I know I ll predict a long and happy reign for George the Fifth My dear girl protested Clovis have you reflected that Cassandra specialized in foretelling calamities There was another prolonged pause and another triumphant issue I know I ll foretell a most disastrous season for the foxhounds On no account entreated Clovis do remember that all Cassandra s predictions came true The M F H and the Hunt Secretary are both awfully superstitious and they are both going to be present Cassandra retreated hastily to her bedroom to bathe her eyes before appearing at tea The Baroness and Clovis were by this time scarcely on speaking terms Each sincerely wished their respective role to be the pivot round which the entire production should revolve and each lost no opportunity for furthering the cause they had at heart As fast as Clovis introduced some effective bit of business for the charioteer and he introduced a great many the Baroness would remorselessly cut it out or more often dovetail it into her own part while Clovis retaliated in a similar fashion whenever possible The climax came when Clytemnestra annexed some highly complimentary lines which were to have been addressed to the charioteer by a bevy of admiring Greek damsels and put them into the mouth of her lover Clovis stood by in apparent unconcern while the words Oh lovely stripling radiant as the dawn were transposed into Oh Clytemnestra radiant as the dawn but there was a dangerous glitter in his eye that might have given the Baroness warning He had composed the verse himself inspired and thoroughly carried away by his subject he suffered therefore a double pang in beholding his tribute deflected from its destined object and his words mutilated and twisted into what became an extravagant panegyric on the Baroness s personal charms It was from this moment that he became gentle and assiduous in his private coaching of Cassandra The County forgetting its dissensions mustered in full strength to witness the much talked of production The protective Providence that looks after little children and amateur theatricals made good its traditional promise that everything should be right on the night The Baroness and Clovis seemed to have sunk their mutual differences and between them dominated the scene to the partial eclipse of all the other characters who for the most part seemed well content to remain in the shadow Even Agamemnon with ten years of strenuous life around Troy standing to his credit appeared to be an unobtrusive personality compared with his flamboyant charioteer But the moment came for Cassandra who had been excused from any very definite outpourings during rehearsals to support her role by delivering herself of a few well chosen anticipations of pending misfortune The musicians obliged with appropriately lugubrious wailings and thumpings and the Baroness seized the opportunity to make a dash to the dressing room to effect certain repairs in her make up Cassandra nervous but resolute came down to the footlights and like one repeating a carefully learned lesson flung her remarks straight at the audience I see woe for this fair country if the brood of corrupt self seeking unscrupulous unprincipled politicians here she named one of the two rival parties in the State continue to infest and poison our local councils and undermine our Parliamentary representation if they continue to snatch votes by nefarious and discreditable means A humming as of a great hive of bewildered and affronted bees drowned her further remarks and wore down the droning of the musicians The Baroness who should have been greeted on her return to the stage with the pleasing invocation Oh Clytemnestra radiant as the dawn heard instead the imperious voice of Lady Thistledale ordering her carriage and something like a storm of open discord going on at the back of the room The social divisions in the County healed themselves after their own fashion both parties found common ground in condemning the Baroness s outrageously bad taste and tactlessness She has been fortunate in sub letting for the greater part of her seven years lease THE PEACE OF MOWSLE BARTON Crefton Lockyer sat at his ease an ease alike of body and soul in the little patch of ground half orchard and half garden that abutted on the farmyard at Mowsle Barton After the stress and noise of long years of city life the repose and peace of the hill begirt homestead struck on his senses with an almost dramatic intensity Time and space seemed to lose their meaning and their abruptness the minutes slid away into hours and the meadows and fallows sloped away into middle distance softly and imperceptibly Wild weeds of the hedgerow straggled into the flower garden and wallflowers and garden bushes made counter raids into farmyard and lane Sleepy looking hens and solemn preoccupied ducks were equally at home in yard orchard or roadway nothing seemed to belong definitely to anywhere even the gates were not necessarily to be found on their hinges And over the whole scene brooded the sense of a peace that had almost a quality of magic in it In the afternoon you felt that it had always been afternoon and must always remain afternoon in the twilight you knew that it could never have been anything else but twilight Crefton Lockyer sat at his ease in the rustic seat beneath an old medlar tree and decided that here was the life anchorage that his mind had so fondly pictured and that latterly his tired and jarred senses had so often pined for He would make a permanent lodging place among these simple friendly people gradually increasing the modest comforts with which he would like to surround himself but falling in as much as possible with their manner of living As he slowly matured this resolution in his mind an elderly woman came hobbling with uncertain gait through the orchard He recognized her as a member of the farm household the mother or possibly the mother in law of missus Spurfield his present landlady and hastily formulated some pleasant remark to make to her She forestalled him There s a bit of writing chalked up on the door over yonder What is it She spoke in a dull impersonal manner as though the question had been on her lips for years and had best be got rid of Her eyes however looked impatiently over Crefton s head at the door of a small barn which formed the outpost of a straggling line of farm buildings Martha Pillamon is an old witch was the announcement that met Crefton s inquiring scrutiny and he hesitated a moment before giving the statement wider publicity For all he knew to the contrary it might be Martha herself to whom he was speaking It was possible that missus Spurfield s maiden name had been Pillamon And the gaunt withered old dame at his side might certainly fulfil local conditions as to the outward aspect of a witch It s something about some one called Martha Pillamon he explained cautiously What does it say It s very disrespectful said Crefton it says she s a witch Such things ought not to be written up It s true every word of it said his listener with considerable satisfaction adding as a special descriptive note of her own the old toad And as she hobbled away through the farmyard she shrilled out in her cracked voice Martha Pillamon is an old witch Did you hear what she said mumbled a weak angry voice somewhere behind Crefton s shoulder Turning hastily he beheld another old crone thin and yellow and wrinkled and evidently in a high state of displeasure Obviously this was Martha Pillamon in person The orchard seemed to be a favourite promenade for the aged women of the neighbourhood Tis lies tis sinful lies the weak voice went on Tis Betsy Croot is the old witch She an her daughter the dirty rat I ll put a spell on em the old nuisances As she limped slowly away her eye caught the chalk inscription on the barn door What s written up there she demanded wheeling round on Crefton Vote for Soarker he responded with the craven boldness of the practised peacemaker The old woman grunted and her mutterings and her faded red shawl lost themselves gradually among the tree trunks Crefton rose presently and made his way towards the farm house Somehow a good deal of the peace seemed to have slipped out of the atmosphere The cheery bustle of tea time in the old farm kitchen which Crefton had found so agreeable on previous afternoons seemed to have soured to day into a certain uneasy melancholy There was a dull dragging silence around the board and the tea itself when Crefton came to taste it was a flat lukewarm concoction that would have driven the spirit of revelry out of a carnival It s no use complaining of the tea said missus Spurfield hastily as her guest stared with an air of polite inquiry at his cup The kettle won t boil that s the truth of it Crefton turned to the hearth where an unusually fierce fire was banked up under a big black kettle which sent a thin wreath of steam from its spout but seemed otherwise to ignore the action of the roaring blaze beneath it It s been there more than an hour an boil it won t said missus Spurfield adding by way of complete explanation we re bewitched It s Martha Pillamon as has done it chimed in the old mother I ll be even with the old toad I ll put a spell on her It must boil in time protested Crefton ignoring the suggestions of foul influences Perhaps the coal is damp It won t boil in time for supper nor for breakfast to morrow morning not if you was to keep the fire a going all night for it said missus Spurfield And it didn t The household subsisted on fried and baked dishes and a neighbour obligingly brewed tea and sent it across in a moderately warm condition I suppose you ll be leaving us now that things has turned up uncomfortable missus Spurfield observed at breakfast there are folks as deserts one as soon as trouble comes Crefton hurriedly disclaimed any immediate change of plans he observed however to himself that the earlier heartiness of manner had in a large measure deserted the household Suspicious looks sulky silences or sharp speeches had become the order of the day As for the old mother she sat about the kitchen or the garden all day murmuring threats and spells against Martha Pillamon There was something alike terrifying and piteous in the spectacle of these frail old morsels of humanity consecrating their last flickering energies to the task of making each other wretched Hatred seemed to be the one faculty which had survived in undiminished vigour and intensity where all else was dropping into ordered and symmetrical decay And the uncanny part of it was that some horrid unwholesome power seemed to be distilled from their spite and their cursings No amount of sceptical explanation could remove the undoubted fact that neither kettle nor saucepan would come to boiling point over the hottest fire Crefton clung as long as possible to the theory of some defect in the coals but a wood fire gave the same result and when a small spirit lamp kettle which he ordered out by carrier showed the same obstinate refusal to allow its contents to boil he felt that he had come suddenly into contact with some unguessed at and very evil aspect of hidden forces Miles away down through an opening in the hills he could catch glimpses of a road where motor cars sometimes passed and yet here so little removed from the arteries of the latest civilization was a bat haunted old homestead where something unmistakably like witchcraft seemed to hold a very practical sway Passing out through the farm garden on his way to the lanes beyond where he hoped to recapture the comfortable sense of peacefulness that was so lacking around house and hearth especially hearth Crefton came across the old mother sitting mumbling to herself in the seat beneath the medlar tree Let un sink as swims let un sink as swims she was repeating over and over again as a child repeats a half learned lesson And now and then she would break off into a shrill laugh with a note of malice in it that was not pleasant to hear Crefton was glad when he found himself out of earshot in the quiet and seclusion of the deep overgrown lanes that seemed to lead away to nowhere one narrower and deeper than the rest attracted his footsteps and he was almost annoyed when he found that it really did act as a miniature roadway to a human dwelling A forlorn looking cottage with a scrap of ill tended cabbage garden and a few aged apple trees stood at an angle where a swift flowing stream widened out for a space into a decent sized pond before hurrying away again through the willows that had checked its course Crefton leaned against a tree trunk and looked across the swirling eddies of the pond at the humble little homestead opposite him the only sign of life came from a small procession of dingy looking ducks that marched in single file down to the water s edge There is always something rather taking in the way a duck changes itself in an instant from a slow clumsy waddler of the earth to a graceful buoyant swimmer of the waters and Crefton waited with a certain arrested attention to watch the leader of the file launch itself on to the surface of the pond He was aware at the same time of a curious warning instinct that something strange and unpleasant was about to happen The duck flung itself confidently forward into the water and rolled immediately under the surface Its head appeared for a moment and went under again leaving a train of bubbles in its wake while wings and legs churned the water in a helpless swirl of flapping and kicking The bird was obviously drowning Crefton thought at first that it had caught itself in some weeds or was being attacked from below by a pike or water rat But no blood floated to the surface and the wildly bobbing body made the circuit of the pond current without hindrance from any entanglement A second duck had by this time launched itself into the pond and a second struggling body rolled and twisted under the surface There was something peculiarly piteous in the sight of the gasping beaks that showed now and again above the water as though in terrified protest at this treachery of a trusted and familiar element Crefton gazed with something like horror as a third duck poised itself on the bank and splashed in to share the fate of the other two He felt almost relieved when the remainder of the flock taking tardy alarm from the commotion of the slowly drowning bodies drew themselves up with tense outstretched necks and sidled away from the scene of danger quacking a deep note of disquietude as they went At the same moment Crefton became aware that he was not the only human witness of the scene a bent and withered old woman whom he recognized at once as Martha Pillamon of sinister reputation had limped down the cottage path to the water s edge and was gazing fixedly at the gruesome whirligig of dying birds that went in horrible procession round the pool Presently her voice rang out in a shrill note of quavering rage Tis Betsy Croot adone it the old rat I ll put a spell on her see if I don t Crefton slipped quietly away uncertain whether or no the old woman had noticed his presence Even before she had proclaimed the guiltiness of Betsy Croot the latter s muttered incantation Let un sink as swims had flashed uncomfortably across his mind But it was the final threat of a retaliatory spell which crowded his mind with misgiving to the exclusion of all other thoughts or fancies His reasoning powers could no longer afford to dismiss these old wives threats as empty bickerings The household at Mowsle Barton lay under the displeasure of a vindictive old woman who seemed able to materialize her personal spites in a very practical fashion and there was no saying what form her revenge for three drowned ducks might not take As a member of the household Crefton might find himself involved in some general and highly disagreeable visitation of Martha Pillamon s wrath Of course he knew that he was giving way to absurd fancies but the behaviour of the spirit lamp kettle and the subsequent scene at the pond had considerably unnerved him And the vagueness of his alarm added to its terrors when once you have taken the Impossible into your calculations its possibilities become practically limitless Crefton rose at his usual early hour the next morning after one of the least restful nights he had spent at the farm His sharpened senses quickly detected that subtle atmosphere of things being not altogether well that hangs over a stricken household The cows had been milked but they stood huddled about in the yard waiting impatiently to be driven out afield and the poultry kept up an importunate querulous reminder of deferred feeding time the yard pump which usually made discordant music at frequent intervals during the early morning was to day ominously silent In the house itself there was a coming and going of scuttering footsteps a rushing and dying away of hurried voices and long uneasy stillnesses Crefton finished his dressing and made his way to the head of a narrow staircase He could hear a dull complaining voice a voice into which an awed hush had crept and recognized the speaker as missus Spurfield He ll go away for sure the voice was saying there are those as runs away from one as soon as real misfortune shows itself Crefton felt that he probably was one of those and that there were moments when it was advisable to be true to type He crept back to his room collected and packed his few belongings placed the money due for his lodgings on a table and made his way out by a back door into the yard A mob of poultry surged expectantly towards him shaking off their interested attentions he hurried along under cover of cowstall piggery and hayricks till he reached the lane at the back of the farm A few minutes walk which only the burden of his portmanteaux restrained from developing into an undisguised run brought him to a main road where the early carrier soon overtook him and sped him onward to the neighbouring town At a bend of the road he caught a last glimpse of the farm the old gabled roofs and thatched barns the straggling orchard and the medlar tree with its wooden seat stood out with an almost spectral clearness in the early morning light and over it all brooded that air of magic possession which Crefton had once mistaken for peace The bustle and roar of Paddington Station smote on his ears with a welcome protective greeting Very bad for our nerves all this rush and hurry said a fellow traveller give me the peace and quiet of the country Crefton mentally surrendered his share of the desired commodity A crowded brilliantly over lighted music hall where an exuberant rendering of eighteen twelve was being given by a strenuous orchestra came nearest to his ideal of a nerve sedative THE TALKING OUT OF TARRINGTON Heavens exclaimed the aunt of Clovis here s some one I know bearing down on us I can t remember his name but he lunched with us once in Town Tarrington yes that s it He s heard of the picnic I m giving for the Princess and he ll cling to me like a lifebelt till I give him an invitation then he ll ask if he may bring all his wives and mothers and sisters with him That s the worst of these small watering places one can t escape from anybody I ll fight a rearguard action for you if you like to do a bolt now volunteered Clovis you ve a clear ten yards start if you don t lose time The aunt of Clovis responded gamely to the suggestion and churned away like a Nile steamer with a long brown ripple of Pekingese spaniel trailing in her wake Pretend you don t know him was her parting advice tinged with the reckless courage of the non combatant The next moment the overtures of an affably disposed gentleman were being received by Clovis with a silent upon a peak in Darien stare which denoted an absence of all previous acquaintance with the object scrutinized I expect you don t know me with my moustache said the new comer I ve only grown it during the last two months On the contrary said Clovis the moustache is the only thing about you that seemed familiar to me I felt certain that I had met it somewhere before My name is Tarrington resumed the candidate for recognition A very useful kind of name said Clovis with a name of that sort no one would blame you if you did nothing in particular heroic or remarkable would they And yet if you were to raise a troop of light horse in a moment of national emergency Tarrington s Light Horse would sound quite appropriate and pulse quickening whereas if you were called Spoopin for instance the thing would be out of the question No one even in a moment of national emergency could possibly belong to Spoopin s Horse The new comer smiled weakly as one who is not to be put off by mere flippancy and began again with patient persistence I think you ought to remember my name I shall said Clovis with an air of immense sincerity My aunt was asking me only this morning to suggest names for four young owls she s just had sent her as pets I shall call them all Tarrington then if one or two of them die or fly away or leave us in any of the ways that pet owls are prone to there will be always one or two left to carry on your name And my aunt won t LET me forget it she will always be asking Have the Tarringtons had their mice and questions of that sort She says if you keep wild creatures in captivity you ought to see after their wants and of course she s quite right there I met you at luncheon at your aunt s house once broke in mister Tarrington pale but still resolute My aunt never lunches said Clovis she belongs to the National Anti Luncheon League which is doing quite a lot of good work in a quiet unobtrusive way A subscription of half a crown per quarter entitles you to go without ninety two luncheons This must be something new exclaimed Tarrington It s the same aunt that I ve always had said Clovis coldly I perfectly well remember meeting you at a luncheon party given by your aunt persisted Tarrington who was beginning to flush an unhealthy shade of mottled pink What was there for lunch asked Clovis Oh well I don t remember that How nice of you to remember my aunt when you can no longer recall the names of the things you ate Now my memory works quite differently I can remember a menu long after I ve forgotten the hostess that accompanied it When I was seven years old I recollect being given a peach at a garden party by some Duchess or other I can t remember a thing about her except that I imagine our acquaintance must have been of the slightest as she called me a nice little boy but I have unfading memories of that peach It was one of those exuberant peaches that meet you halfway so to speak and are all over you in a moment It was a beautiful unspoiled product of a hothouse and yet it managed quite successfully to give itself the airs of a compote You had to bite it and imbibe it at the same time To me there has always been something charming and mystic in the thought of that delicate velvet globe of fruit slowly ripening and warming to perfection through the long summer days and perfumed nights and then coming suddenly athwart my life in the supreme moment of its existence I can never forget it even if I wished to And when I had devoured all that was edible of it there still remained the stone which a heedless thoughtless child would doubtless have thrown away I put it down the neck of a young friend who was wearing a very DECOLLETE sailor suit I told him it was a scorpion and from the way he wriggled and screamed he evidently believed it though where the silly kid imagined I could procure a live scorpion at a garden party I don t know Altogether that peach is for me an unfading and happy memory The defeated Tarrington had by this time retreated out of ear shot comforting himself as best he might with the reflection that a picnic which included the presence of Clovis might prove a doubtfully agreeable experience I shall certainly go in for a Parliamentary career said Clovis to himself as he turned complacently to rejoin his aunt As a talker out of inconvenient bills I should be invaluable THE HOUNDS OF FATE In the fading light of a close dull autumn afternoon Martin Stoner plodded his way along muddy lanes and rut seamed cart tracks that led he knew not exactly whither Somewhere in front of him he fancied lay the sea and towards the sea his footsteps seemed persistently turning why he was struggling wearily forward to that goal he could scarcely have explained unless he was possessed by the same instinct that turns a hard pressed stag cliffward in its last extremity In his case the hounds of Fate were certainly pressing him with unrelenting insistence hunger fatigue and despairing hopelessness had numbed his brain and he could scarcely summon sufficient energy to wonder what underlying impulse was driving him onward Stoner was one of those unfortunate individuals who seem to have tried everything a natural slothfulness and improvidence had always intervened to blight any chance of even moderate success and now he was at the end of his tether and there was nothing more to try Desperation had not awakened in him any dormant reserve of energy on the contrary a mental torpor grew up round the crisis of his fortunes With the clothes he stood up in a halfpenny in his pocket and no single friend or acquaintance to turn to with no prospect either of a bed for the night or a meal for the morrow Martin Stoner trudged stolidly forward between moist hedgerows and beneath dripping trees his mind almost a blank except that he was subconsciously aware that somewhere in front of him lay the sea Another consciousness obtruded itself now and then the knowledge that he was miserably hungry Presently he came to a halt by an open gateway that led into a spacious and rather neglected farm garden there was little sign of life about and the farm house at the further end of the garden looked chill and inhospitable A drizzling rain however was setting in and Stoner thought that here perhaps he might obtain a few minutes shelter and buy a glass of milk with his last remaining coin He turned slowly and wearily into the garden and followed a narrow flagged path up to a side door Before he had time to knock the door opened and a bent withered looking old man stood aside in the doorway as though to let him pass in Could I come in out of the rain Stoner began but the old man interrupted him Come in Master Tom I knew you would come back one of these days Stoner lurched across the threshold and stood staring uncomprehendingly at the other Sit down while I put you out a bit of supper said the old man with quavering eagerness Stoner s legs gave way from very weariness and he sank inertly into the arm chair that had been pushed up to him In another minute he was devouring the cold meat cheese and bread that had been placed on the table at his side You m little changed these four years went on the old man in a voice that sounded to Stoner as something in a dream far away and inconsequent but you ll find us a deal changed you will There s no one about the place same as when you left nought but me and your old Aunt I ll go and tell her that you m come she won t be seeing you but she ll let you stay right enough She always did say if you was to come back you should stay but she d never set eyes on you or speak to you again The old man placed a mug of beer on the table in front of Stoner and then hobbled away down a long passage The drizzle of rain had changed to a furious lashing downpour which beat violently against door and windows The wanderer thought with a shudder of what the sea shore must look like under this drenching rainfall with night beating down on all sides He finished the food and beer and sat numbly waiting for the return of his strange host As the minutes ticked by on the grandfather clock in the corner a new hope began to flicker and grow in the young man s mind it was merely the expansion of his former craving for food and a few minutes rest into a longing to find a night s shelter under this seemingly hospitable roof A clattering of footsteps down the passage heralded the old farm servant s return The old missus won t see you Master Tom but she says you are to stay Tis right enough seeing the farm will be yours when she be put under earth I ve had a fire lit in your room Master Tom and the maids has put fresh sheets on to the bed You ll find nought changed up there Maybe you m tired and would like to go there now Without a word Martin Stoner rose heavily to his feet and followed his ministering angel along a passage up a short creaking stair along another passage and into a large room lit with a cheerfully blazing fire There was but little furniture plain old fashioned and good of its kind a stuffed squirrel in a case and a wall calendar of four years ago were about the only symptoms of decoration But Stoner had eyes for little else than the bed and could scarce wait to tear his clothes off him before rolling in a luxury of weariness into its comfortable depths The hounds of Fate seemed to have checked for a brief moment In the cold light of morning Stoner laughed mirthlessly as he slowly realized the position in which he found himself Perhaps he might snatch a bit of breakfast on the strength of his likeness to this other missing ne er do well and get safely away before anyone discovered the fraud that had been thrust on him In the room downstairs he found the bent old man ready with a dish of bacon and fried eggs for Master Tom s breakfast while a hard faced elderly maid brought in a teapot and poured him out a cup of tea As he sat at the table a small spaniel came up and made friendly advances Tis old Bowker s pup explained the old man whom the hard faced maid had addressed as George She was main fond of you never seemed the same after you went away to Australee She died bout a year agone Tis her pup Stoner found it difficult to regret her decease as a witness for identification she would have left something to be desired You ll go for a ride Master Tom was the next startling proposition that came from the old man We ve a nice little roan cob that goes well in saddle Old Biddy is getting a bit up in years though er goes well still but I ll have the little roan saddled and brought round to door I ve got no riding things stammered the castaway almost laughing as he looked down at his one suit of well worn clothes Master Tom said the old man earnestly almost with an offended air all your things is just as you left them A bit of airing before the fire an they ll be all right Twill be a bit of a distraction like a little riding and wild fowling now and agen You ll find the folk around here has hard and bitter minds towards you They hasn t forgotten nor forgiven No one ll come nigh you so you d best get what distraction you can with horse and dog They m good company too Old George hobbled away to give his orders and Stoner feeling more than ever like one in a dream went upstairs to inspect Master Tom s wardrobe A ride was one of the pleasures dearest to his heart and there was some protection against immediate discovery of his imposture in the thought that none of Tom s aforetime companions were likely to favour him with a close inspection As the interloper thrust himself into some tolerably well fitting riding cords he wondered vaguely what manner of misdeed the genuine Tom had committed to set the whole countryside against him The thud of quick eager hoofs on damp earth cut short his speculations The roan cob had been brought up to the side door Talk of beggars on horseback thought Stoner to himself as he trotted rapidly along the muddy lanes where he had tramped yesterday as a down at heel outcast and then he flung reflection indolently aside and gave himself up to the pleasure of a smart canter along the turf grown side of a level stretch of road At an open gateway he checked his pace to allow two carts to turn into a field The lads driving the carts found time to give him a prolonged stare and as he passed on he heard an excited voice call out Tis Tom Prike I knowed him at once showing hisself here agen is he Evidently the likeness which had imposed at close quarters on a doddering old man was good enough to mislead younger eyes at a short distance In the course of his ride he met with ample evidence to confirm the statement that local folk had neither forgotten nor forgiven the bygone crime which had come to him as a legacy from the absent Tom Scowling looks mutterings and nudgings greeted him whenever he chanced upon human beings Bowker s pup trotting placidly by his side seemed the one element of friendliness in a hostile world As he dismounted at the side door he caught a fleeting glimpse of a gaunt elderly woman peering at him from behind the curtain of an upper window Evidently this was his aunt by adoption Over the ample midday meal that stood in readiness for him Stoner was able to review the possibilities of his extraordinary situation The real Tom after four years of absence might suddenly turn up at the farm or a letter might come from him at any moment Again in the character of heir to the farm the false Tom might be called on to sign documents which would be an embarrassing predicament Or a relative might arrive who would not imitate the aunt s attitude of aloofness All these things would mean ignominious exposure On the other hand the alternative was the open sky and the muddy lanes that led down to the sea The farm offered him at any rate a temporary refuge from destitution farming was one of the many things he had tried and he would be able to do a certain amount of work in return for the hospitality to which he was so little entitled Will you have cold pork for your supper asked the hard faced maid as she cleared the table or will you have it hotted up Hot with onions said Stoner It was the only time in his life that he had made a rapid decision And as he gave the order he knew that he meant to stay Stoner kept rigidly to those portions of the house which seemed to have been allotted to him by a tacit treaty of delimitation When he took part in the farm work it was as one who worked under orders and never initiated them Old George the roan cob and Bowker s pup were his sole companions in a world that was otherwise frostily silent and hostile Of the mistress of the farm he saw nothing Once when he knew she had gone forth to church he made a furtive visit to the farm parlour in an endeavour to glean some fragmentary knowledge of the young man whose place he had usurped and whose ill repute he had fastened on himself There were many photographs hung on the walls or stuck in prim frames but the likeness he sought for was not among them At last in an album thrust out of sight he came across what he wanted There was a whole series labelled Tom a podgy child of three in a fantastic frock an awkward boy of about twelve holding a cricket bat as though he loathed it a rather good looking youth of eighteen with very smooth evenly parted hair and finally a young man with a somewhat surly dare devil expression At this last portrait Stoner looked with particular interest the likeness to himself was unmistakable From the lips of old George who was garrulous enough on most subjects he tried again and again to learn something of the nature of the offence which shut him off as a creature to be shunned and hated by his fellow men What do the folk around here say about me he asked one day as they were walking home from an outlying field The old man shook his head They be bitter agen you mortal bitter Aye tis a sad business a sad business And never could he be got to say anything more enlightening On a clear frosty evening a few days before the festival of Christmas Stoner stood in a corner of the orchard which commanded a wide view of the countryside Here and there he could see the twinkling dots of lamp or candle glow which told of human homes where the goodwill and jollity of the season held their sway Behind him lay the grim silent farm house where no one ever laughed where even a quarrel would have seemed cheerful As he turned to look at the long grey front of the gloom shadowed building a door opened and old George came hurriedly forth Stoner heard his adopted name called in a tone of strained anxiety Instantly he knew that something untoward had happened and with a quick revulsion of outlook his sanctuary became in his eyes a place of peace and contentment from which he dreaded to be driven Master Tom said the old man in a hoarse whisper you must slip away quiet from here for a few days Michael Ley is back in the village an he swears to shoot you if he can come across you He ll do it too there s murder in the look of him Get away under cover of night tis only for a week or so he won t be here longer But where am I to go stammered Stoner who had caught the infection of the old man s obvious terror Go right away along the coast to Punchford and keep hid there When Michael s safe gone I ll ride the roan over to the Green Dragon at Punchford when you see the cob stabled at the Green Dragon tis a sign you may come back agen But began Stoner hesitatingly Tis all right for money said the other the old Missus agrees you d best do as I say and she s given me this The old man produced three sovereigns and some odd silver Stoner felt more of a cheat than ever as he stole away that night from the back gate of the farm with the old woman s money in his pocket Old George and Bowker s pup stood watching him a silent farewell from the yard He could scarcely fancy that he would ever come back and he felt a throb of compunction for those two humble friends who would wait wistfully for his return Some day perhaps the real Tom would come back and there would be wild wonderment among those simple farm folks as to the identity of the shadowy guest they had harboured under their roof For his own fate he felt no immediate anxiety three pounds goes but little way in the world when there is nothing behind it but to a man who has counted his exchequer in pennies it seems a good starting point Fortune had done him a whimsically kind turn when last he trod these lanes as a hopeless adventurer and there might yet be a chance of his finding some work and making a fresh start as he got further from the farm his spirits rose higher There was a sense of relief in regaining once more his lost identity and ceasing to be the uneasy ghost of another He scarcely bothered to speculate about the implacable enemy who had dropped from nowhere into his life since that life was now behind him one unreal item the more made little difference For the first time for many months he began to hum a careless lighthearted refrain Then there stepped out from the shadow of an overhanging oak tree a man with a gun There was no need to wonder who he might be the moonlight falling on his white set face revealed a glare of human hate such as Stoner in the ups and downs of his wanderings had never seen before He sprang aside in a wild effort to break through the hedge that bordered the lane but the tough branches held him fast The hounds of Fate had waited for him in those narrow lanes and this time they were not to be denied THE RECESSIONAL Clovis sat in the hottest zone but two of a Turkish bath alternately inert in statuesque contemplation and rapidly manoeuvring a fountain pen over the pages of a note book Don t interrupt me with your childish prattle he observed to Bertie van Tahn who had slung himself languidly into a neighbouring chair and looked conversationally inclined I m writing deathless verse Bertie looked interested I say what a boon you would be to portrait painters if you really got to be notorious as a poetry writer If they couldn t get your likeness hung in the Academy as Clovis Sangrail esquire at work on his latest poem they could slip you in as a Study of the Nude or Orpheus descending into Jermyn Street They always complain that modern dress handicaps them whereas a towel and a fountain pen It was missus Packletide s suggestion that I should write this thing said Clovis ignoring the bypaths to fame that Bertie van Tahn was pointing out to him You see Loona Bimberton had a Coronation Ode accepted by the NEW INFANCY a paper that has been started with the idea of making the NEW AGE seem elderly and hidebound So clever of you dear Loona the Packletide remarked when she had read it of course anyone could write a Coronation Ode but no one else would have thought of doing it Loona protested that these things were extremely difficult to do and gave us to understand that they were more or less the province of a gifted few Now the Packletide has been rather decent to me in many ways a sort of financial ambulance you know that carries you off the field when you re hard hit which is a frequent occurrence with me and I ve no use whatever for Loona Bimberton so I chipped in and said I could turn out that sort of stuff by the square yard if I gave my mind to it Loona said I couldn t and we got bets on and between you and me I think the money s fairly safe Of course one of the conditions of the wager is that the thing has to be published in something or other local newspapers barred but missus Packletide has endeared herself by many little acts of thoughtfulness to the editor of the SMOKY CHIMNEY so if I can hammer out anything at all approaching the level of the usual Ode output we ought to be all right So far I m getting along so comfortably that I begin to be afraid that I must be one of the gifted few It s rather late in the day for a Coronation Ode isn t it said Bertie Of course said Clovis this is going to be a Durbar Recessional the sort of thing that you can keep by you for all time if you want to Now I understand your choice of a place to write it in said Bertie van Tahn with the air of one who has suddenly unravelled a hitherto obscure problem you want to get the local temperature I came here to get freedom from the inane interruptions of the mentally deficient said Clovis but it seems I asked too much of fate Bertie van Tahn prepared to use his towel as a weapon of precision but reflecting that he had a good deal of unprotected coast line himself and that Clovis was equipped with a fountain pen as well as a towel he relapsed pacifically into the depths of his chair May one hear extracts from the immortal work he asked I promise that nothing that I hear now shall prejudice me against borrowing a copy of the SMOKY CHIMNEY at the right moment It s rather like casting pearls into a trough remarked Clovis pleasantly but I don t mind reading you bits of it It begins with a general dispersal of the Durbar participants Back to their homes in Himalayan heights The stale pale elephants of Cutch Behar Roll like great galleons on a tideless sea I don t believe Cutch Behar is anywhere near the Himalayan region interrupted Bertie You ought to have an atlas on hand when you do this sort of thing and why stale and pale After the late hours and the excitement of course said Clovis and I said their HOMES were in the Himalayas You can have Himalayan elephants in Cutch Behar I suppose just as you have Irish bred horses running at Ascot You said they were going back to the Himalayas objected Bertie Well they would naturally be sent home to recuperate It s the usual thing out there to turn elephants loose in the hills just as we put horses out to grass in this country Clovis could at least flatter himself that he had infused some of the reckless splendour of the East into his mendacity Is it all going to be in blank verse asked the critic Of course not Durbar comes at the end of the fourth line That seems so cowardly however it explains why you pitched on Cutch Behar There is more connection between geographical place names and poetical inspiration than is generally recognized one of the chief reasons why there are so few really great poems about Russia in our language is that you can t possibly get a rhyme to names like Smolensk and Tobolsk and Minsk Clovis spoke with the authority of one who has tried Of course you could rhyme Omsk with Tomsk he continued in fact they seem to be there for that purpose but the public wouldn t stand that sort of thing indefinitely The public will stand a good deal said Bertie malevolently and so small a proportion of it knows Russian that you could always have an explanatory footnote asserting that the last three letters in Smolensk are not pronounced It s quite as believable as your statement about putting elephants out to grass in the Himalayan range I ve got rather a nice bit resumed Clovis with unruffled serenity giving an evening scene on the outskirts of a jungle village Where the coiled cobra in the gloaming gloats And prowling panthers stalk the wary goats There is practically no gloaming in tropical countries said Bertie indulgently but I like the masterly reticence with which you treat the cobra s motive for gloating The unknown is proverbially the uncanny I can picture nervous readers of the SMOKY CHIMNEY keeping the light turned on in their bedrooms all night out of sheer sickening uncertainty as to WHAT the cobra might have been gloating about Cobras gloat naturally said Clovis just as wolves are always ravening from mere force of habit even after they ve hopelessly overeaten themselves I ve got a fine bit of colour painting later on he added where I describe the dawn coming up over the Brahma putra river The amber dawn drenched East with sun shafts kissed Stained sanguine apricot and amethyst O er the washed emerald of the mango groves Hangs in a mist of opalescent mauves While painted parrot flights impinge the haze With scarlet chalcedon and chrysoprase I ve never seen the dawn come up over the Brahma putra river said Bertie so I can t say if it s a good description of the event but it sounds more like an account of an extensive jewel robbery Anyhow the parrots give a good useful touch of local colour I suppose you ve introduced some tigers into the scenery An Indian landscape would have rather a bare unfinished look without a tiger or two in the middle distance I ve got a hen tiger somewhere in the poem said Clovis hunting through his notes Here she is The tawny tigress mid the tangled teak Drags to her purring cubs enraptured ears The harsh death rattle in the pea fowl s beak A jungle lullaby of blood and tears Bertie van Tahn rose hurriedly from his recumbent position and made for the glass door leading into the next compartment I think your idea of home life in the jungle is perfectly horrid he said The cobra was sinister enough but the improvised rattle in the tiger nursery is the limit If you re going to make me turn hot and cold all over I may as well go into the steam room at once Just listen to this line said Clovis it would make the reputation of any ordinary poet and overhead The pendulum patient Punkah parent of stillborn breeze Most of your readers will think punkah is a kind of iced drink or half time at polo said Bertie and disappeared into the steam The SMOKY CHIMNEY duly published the Recessional but it proved to be its swan song for the paper never attained to another issue Loona Bimberton gave up her intention of attending the Durbar and went into a nursing home on the Sussex Downs Nervous breakdown after a particularly strenuous season was the usually accepted explanation but there are three or four people who know that she never really recovered from the dawn breaking over the Brahma putra river A MATTER OF SENTIMENT It was the eve of the great race and scarcely a member of Lady Susan s house party had as yet a single bet on It was one of those unsatisfactory years when one horse held a commanding market position not by reason of any general belief in its crushing superiority but because it was extremely difficult to pitch on any other candidate to whom to pin ones faith Peradventure II was the favourite not in the sense of being a popular fancy but by virtue of a lack of confidence in any one of his rather undistinguished rivals The brains of clubland were much exercised in seeking out possible merit where none was very obvious to the naked intelligence and the house party at Lady Susan s was possessed by the same uncertainty and irresolution that infected wider circles It is just the time for bringing off a good coup said Bertie van Tahn Undoubtedly But with what demanded Clovis for the twentieth time The women of the party were just as keenly interested in the matter and just as helplessly perplexed even the mother of Clovis who usually got good racing information from her dressmaker confessed herself fancy free on this occasion Colonel Drake who was professor of military history at a minor cramming establishment was the only person who had a definite selection for the event but as his choice varied every three hours he was worse than useless as an inspired guide The crowning difficulty of the problem was that it could only be fitfully and furtively discussed Lady Susan disapproved of racing She disapproved of many things some people went as far as to say that she disapproved of most things Disapproval was to her what neuralgia and fancy needlework are to many other women She disapproved of early morning tea and auction bridge of ski ing and the two step of the Russian ballet and the Chelsea Arts Club ball of the French policy in Morocco and the British policy everywhere It was not that she was particularly strict or narrow in her views of life but she had been the eldest sister of a large family of self indulgent children and her particular form of indulgence had consisted in openly disapproving of the foibles of the others Unfortunately the hobby had grown up with her As she was rich influential and very very kind most people were content to count their early tea as well lost on her behalf Still the necessity for hurriedly dropping the discussion of an enthralling topic and suppressing all mention of it during her presence on the scene was an affliction at a moment like the present when time was slipping away and indecision was the prevailing note After a lunch time of rather strangled and uneasy conversation Clovis managed to get most of the party together at the further end of the kitchen gardens on the pretext of admiring the Himalayan pheasants He had made an important discovery Motkin the butler who as Clovis expressed it had grown prematurely grey in Lady Susan s service added to his other excellent qualities an intelligent interest in matters connected with the Turf On the subject of the forthcoming race he was not illuminating except in so far that he shared the prevailing unwillingness to see a winner in Peradventure II But where he outshone all the members of the house party was in the fact that he had a second cousin who was head stable lad at a neighbouring racing establishment and usually gifted with much inside information as to private form and possibilities Only the fact of her ladyship having taken it into her head to invite a house party for the last week of May had prevented mister Motkin from paying a visit of consultation to his relative with respect to the big race there was still time to cycle over if he could get leave of absence for the afternoon on some specious excuse Let s jolly well hope he does said Bertie van Tahn under the circumstances a second cousin is almost as useful as second sight That stable ought to know something if knowledge is to be found anywhere said missus Packletide hopefully I expect you ll find he ll echo my fancy for Motorboat said Colonel Drake At this moment the subject had to be hastily dropped Lady Susan bore down upon them leaning on the arm of Clovis s mother to whom she was confiding the fact that she disapproved of the craze for Pekingese spaniels It was the third thing she had found time to disapprove of since lunch without counting her silent and permanent disapproval of the way Clovis s mother did her hair We have been admiring the Himalayan pheasants said missus Packletide suavely They went off to a bird show at Nottingham early this morning said Lady Susan with the air of one who disapproves of hasty and ill considered lying Their house I mean such perfect roosting arrangements and all so clean resumed missus Packletide with an increased glow of enthusiasm The odious Bertie van Tahn was murmuring audible prayers for missus Packletide s ultimate estrangement from the paths of falsehood I hope you don t mind dinner being a quarter of an hour late to night said Lady Susan Motkin has had an urgent summons to go and see a sick relative this afternoon He wanted to bicycle there but I am sending him in the motor How very kind of you Of course we don t mind dinner being put off The assurances came with unanimous and hearty sincerity At the dinner table that night an undercurrent of furtive curiosity directed itself towards Motkin s impassive countenance One or two of the guests almost expected to find a slip of paper concealed in their napkins bearing the name of the second cousin s selection They had not long to wait As the butler went round with the murmured question Sherry he added in an even lower tone the cryptic words Better not missus Packletide gave a start of alarm and refused the sherry there seemed some sinister suggestion in the butler s warning as though her hostess had suddenly become addicted to the Borgia habit A moment later the explanation flashed on her that Better Not was the name of one of the runners in the big race Clovis was already pencilling it on his cuff and Colonel Drake in his turn was signalling to every one in hoarse whispers and dumb show the fact that he had all along fancied B N Early next morning a sheaf of telegrams went Townward representing the market commands of the house party and servants hall It was a wet afternoon and most of Lady Susan s guests hung about the hall waiting apparently for the appearance of tea though it was scarcely yet due The advent of a telegram quickened every one into a flutter of expectancy the page who brought the telegram to Clovis waited with unusual alertness to know if there might be an answer Clovis read the message and gave an exclamation of annoyance No bad news I hope said Lady Susan Every one else knew that the news was not good It s only the result of the Derby he blurted out Sadowa won an utter outsider Sadowa exclaimed Lady Susan you don t say so How remarkable It s the first time I ve ever backed a horse in fact I disapprove of horse racing but just for once in a way I put money on this horse and it s gone and won May I ask said missus Packletide amid the general silence why you put your money on this particular horse None of the sporting prophets mentioned it as having an outside chance Well said Lady Susan you may laugh at me but it was the name that attracted me You see I was always mixed up with the Franco German war I was married on the day that the war was declared and my eldest child was born the day that peace was signed so anything connected with the war has always interested me And when I saw there was a horse running in the Derby called after one of the battles in the Franco German war I said I MUST put some money on it for once in a way though I disapprove of racing And it s actually won There was a general groan No one groaned more deeply than the professor of military history THE SECRET SIN OF SEPTIMUS BROPE Who and what is mister Brope demanded the aunt of Clovis suddenly missus Riversedge who had been snipping off the heads of defunct roses and thinking of nothing in particular sprang hurriedly to mental attention She was one of those old fashioned hostesses who consider that one ought to know something about one s guests and that the something ought to be to their credit I believe he comes from Leighton Buzzard she observed by way of preliminary explanation In these days of rapid and convenient travel said Clovis who was dispersing a colony of green fly with visitations of cigarette smoke to come from Leighton Buzzard does not necessarily denote any great strength of character It might only mean mere restlessness Now if he had left it under a cloud or as a protest against the incurable and heartless frivolity of its inhabitants that would tell us something about the man and his mission in life What does he do pursued missus Troyle magisterially He edits the CATHEDRAL MONTHLY said her hostess and he s enormously learned about memorial brasses and transepts and the influence of Byzantine worship on modern liturgy and all those sort of things Perhaps he is just a little bit heavy and immersed in one range of subjects but it takes all sorts to make a good house party you know You don t find him TOO dull do you Dullness I could overlook said the aunt of Clovis what I cannot forgive is his making love to my maid My dear missus Troyle gasped the hostess what an extraordinary idea I assure you mister Brope would not dream of doing such a thing His dreams are a matter of indifference to me for all I care his slumbers may be one long indiscretion of unsuitable erotic advances in which the entire servants hall may be involved But in his waking hours he shall not make love to my maid It s no use arguing about it I m firm on the point But you must be mistaken persisted missus Riversedge mister Brope would be the last person to do such a thing He is the first person to do such a thing as far as my information goes and if I have any voice in the matter he certainly shall be the last Of course I am not referring to respectably intentioned lovers I simply cannot think that a man who writes so charmingly and informingly about transepts and Byzantine influences would behave in such an unprincipled manner said missus Riversedge what evidence have you that he s doing anything of the sort I don t want to doubt your word of course but we mustn t be too ready to condemn him unheard must we Whether we condemn him or not he has certainly not been unheard He has the room next to my dressing room and on two occasions when I dare say he thought I was absent I have plainly heard him announcing through the wall I love you Florrie Those partition walls upstairs are very thin one can almost hear a watch ticking in the next room Is your maid called Florence Her name is Florinda What an extraordinary name to give a maid I did not give it to her she arrived in my service already christened What I mean is said missus Riversedge that when I get maids with unsuitable names I call them Jane they soon get used to it An excellent plan said the aunt of Clovis coldly unfortunately I have got used to being called Jane myself It happens to be my name She cut short missus Riversedge s flood of apologies by abruptly remarking The question is not whether I m to call my maid Florinda but whether mister Brope is to be permitted to call her Florrie I am strongly of opinion than he shall not He may have been repeating the words of some song said missus Riversedge hopefully there are lots of those sorts of silly refrains with girls names she continued turning to Clovis as a possible authority on the subject You mustn t call me Mary I shouldn t think of doing so Clovis assured her in the first place I ve always understood that your name was Henrietta and then I hardly know you well enough to take such a liberty I mean there s a SONG with that refrain hurriedly explained missus Riversedge and there s Rhoda Rhoda kept a pagoda and Maisie is a daisy and heaps of others Certainly it doesn t sound like mister Brope to be singing such songs but I think we ought to give him the benefit of the doubt I had already done so said missus Troyle until further evidence came my way She shut her lips with the resolute finality of one who enjoys the blessed certainty of being implored to open them again Further evidence exclaimed her hostess do tell me As I was coming upstairs after breakfast mister Brope was just passing my room In the most natural way in the world a piece of paper dropped out of a packet that he held in his hand and fluttered to the ground just at my door I was going to call out to him You ve dropped something and then for some reason I held back and didn t show myself till he was safely in his room You see it occurred to me that I was very seldom in my room just at that hour and that Florinda was almost always there tidying up things about that time So I picked up that innocent looking piece of paper missus Troyle paused again with the self applauding air of one who has detected an asp lurking in an apple charlotte missus Riversedge snipped vigorously at the nearest rose bush incidentally decapitating a Viscountess Folkestone that was just coming into bloom What was on the paper she asked Just the words in pencil I love you Florrie and then underneath crossed out with a faint line but perfectly plain to read Meet me in the garden by the yew There IS a yew tree at the bottom of the garden admitted missus Riversedge At any rate he appears to be truthful commented Clovis To think that a scandal of this sort should be going on under my roof said missus Riversedge indignantly I wonder why it is that scandal seems so much worse under a roof observed Clovis I ve always regarded it as a proof of the superior delicacy of the cat tribe that it conducts most of its scandals above the slates Now I come to think of it resumed missus Riversedge there are things about mister Brope that I ve never been able to account for His income for instance he only gets two hundred a year as editor of the CATHEDRAL MONTHLY and I know that his people are quite poor and he hasn t any private means Yet he manages to afford a flat somewhere in Westminster and he goes abroad to Bruges and those sorts of places every year and always dresses well and gives quite nice luncheon parties in the season You can t do all that on two hundred a year can you Does he write for any other papers queried missus Troyle No you see he specializes so entirely on liturgy and ecclesiastical architecture that his field is rather restricted He once tried the SPORTING AND DRAMATIC with an article on church edifices in famous fox hunting centres but it wasn t considered of sufficient general interest to be accepted No I don t see how he can support himself in his present style merely by what he writes Perhaps he sells spurious transepts to American enthusiasts suggested Clovis How could you sell a transept said missus Riversedge such a thing would be impossible Whatever he may do to eke out his income interrupted missus Troyle he is certainly not going to fill in his leisure moments by making love to my maid Of course not agreed her hostess that must be put a stop to at once But I don t quite know what we ought to do You might put a barbed wire entanglement round the yew tree as a precautionary measure said Clovis I don t think that the disagreeable situation that has arisen is improved by flippancy said missus Riversedge a good maid is a treasure I am sure I don t know what I should do without Florinda admitted missus Troyle she understands my hair I ve long ago given up trying to do anything with it myself I regard one s hair as I regard husbands as long as one is seen together in public one s private divergences don t matter Surely that was the luncheon gong Septimus Brope and Clovis had the smoking room to themselves after lunch The former seemed restless and preoccupied the latter quietly observant What is a lorry asked Septimus suddenly I don t mean the thing on wheels of course I know what that is but isn t there a bird with a name like that the larger form of a lorikeet I fancy it s a lory with one r said Clovis lazily in which case it s no good to you Septimus Brope stared in some astonishment How do you mean no good to me he asked with more than a trace of uneasiness in his voice Won t rhyme with Florrie explained Clovis briefly Septimus sat upright in his chair with unmistakable alarm on his face How did you find out I mean how did you know I was trying to get a rhyme to Florrie he asked sharply I didn t know said Clovis I only guessed When you wanted to turn the prosaic lorry of commerce into a feathered poem flitting through the verdure of a tropical forest I knew you must be working up a sonnet and Florrie was the only female name that suggested itself as rhyming with lorry Septimus still looked uneasy I believe you know more he said Clovis laughed quietly but said nothing How much do you know Septimus asked desperately The yew tree in the garden said Clovis There I felt certain I d dropped it somewhere But you must have guessed something before Look here you have surprised my secret You won t give me away will you It is nothing to be ashamed of but it wouldn t do for the editor of the CATHEDRAL MONTHLY to go in openly for that sort of thing would it Well I suppose not admitted Clovis You see continued Septimus I get quite a decent lot of money out of it I could never live in the style I do on what I get as editor of the CATHEDRAL MONTHLY Clovis was even more startled than Septimus had been earlier in the conversation but he was better skilled in repressing surprise Do you mean to say you get money out of Florrie he asked Not out of Florrie as yet said Septimus in fact I don t mind saying that I m having a good deal of trouble over Florrie But there are a lot of others Clovis s cigarette went out This is VERY interesting he said slowly And then with Septimus Brope s next words illumination dawned on him There are heaps of others for instance Cora with the lips of coral You and I will never quarrel That was one of my earliest successes and it still brings me in royalties And then there is Esmeralda when I first beheld her and Fair Teresa how I love to please her both of those have been fairly popular And there is one rather dreadful one continued Septimus flushing deep carmine which has brought me in more money than any of the others Lively little Lucie With her naughty nez retrousse Of course I loathe the whole lot of them in fact I m rapidly becoming something of a woman hater under their influence but I can t afford to disregard the financial aspect of the matter And at the same time you can understand that my position as an authority on ecclesiastical architecture and liturgical subjects would be weakened if not altogether ruined if it once got about that I was the author of Cora with the lips of coral and all the rest of them Clovis had recovered sufficiently to ask in a sympathetic if rather unsteady voice what was the special trouble with Florrie I can t get her into lyric shape try as I will said Septimus mournfully You see one has to work in a lot of sentimental sugary compliment with a catchy rhyme and a certain amount of personal biography or prophecy They ve all of them got to have a long string of past successes recorded about them or else you ve got to foretell blissful things about them and yourself in the future For instance there is Dainty little girlie Mavis She is such a rara avis All the money I can save is All to be for Mavis mine It goes to a sickening namby pamby waltz tune and for months nothing else was sung and hummed in Blackpool and other popular centres This time Clovis s self control broke down badly Please excuse me he gurgled but I can t help it when I remember the awful solemnity of that article of yours that you so kindly read us last night on the Coptic Church in its relation to early Christian worship Septimus groaned You see how it would be he said as soon as people knew me to be the author of that miserable sentimental twaddle all respect for the serious labours of my life would be gone I dare say I know more about memorial brasses than anyone living in fact I hope one day to publish a monograph on the subject but I should be pointed out everywhere as the man whose ditties were in the mouths of nigger minstrels along the entire coast line of our Island home Can you wonder that I positively hate Florrie all the time that I m trying to grind out sugar coated rhapsodies about her Why not give free play to your emotions and be brutally abusive An uncomplimentary refrain would have an instant success as a novelty if you were sufficiently outspoken I ve never thought of that said Septimus and I m afraid I couldn t break away from the habit of fulsome adulation and suddenly change my style You needn t change your style in the least said Clovis merely reverse the sentiment and keep to the inane phraseology of the thing If you ll do the body of the song I ll knock off the refrain which is the thing that principally matters I believe I shall charge half shares in the royalties and throw in my silence as to your guilty secret In the eyes of the world you shall still be the man who has devoted his life to the study of transepts and Byzantine ritual only sometimes in the long winter evenings when the wind howls drearily down the chimney and the rain beats against the windows I shall think of you as the author of Cora with the lips of coral Of course if in sheer gratitude at my silence you like to take me for a much needed holiday to the Adriatic or somewhere equally interesting paying all expenses I shouldn t dream of refusing Later in the afternoon Clovis found his aunt and missus Riversedge indulging in gentle exercise in the Jacobean garden I ve spoken to mister Brope about F he announced How splendid of you What did he say came in a quick chorus from the two ladies He was quite frank and straightforward with me when he saw that I knew his secret said Clovis and it seems that his intentions were quite serious if slightly unsuitable I tried to show him the impracticability of the course that he was following He said he wanted to be understood and he seemed to think that Florinda would excel in that requirement but I pointed out that there were probably dozens of delicately nurtured pure hearted young English girls who would be capable of understanding him while Florinda was the only person in the world who understood my aunt s hair That rather weighed with him for he s not really a selfish animal if you take him in the right way and when I appealed to the memory of his happy childish days spent amid the daisied fields of Leighton Buzzard I suppose daisies do grow there he was obviously affected Anyhow he gave me his word that he would put Florinda absolutely out of his mind and he has agreed to go for a short trip abroad as the best distraction for his thoughts I am going with him as far as Ragusa If my aunt should wish to give me a really nice scarf pin to be chosen by myself as a small recognition of the very considerable service I have done her I shouldn t dream of refusing I m not one of those who think that because one is abroad one can go about dressed anyhow A few weeks later in Blackpool and places where they sing the following refrain held undisputed sway How you bore me Florrie With those eyes of vacant blue You ll be very sorry Florrie If I marry you Though I m easygoin Florrie This I swear is true I ll throw you down a quarry Florrie If I marry you MINISTERS OF GRACE Although he was scarcely yet out of his teens the Duke of Scaw was already marked out as a personality widely differing from others of his caste and period Not in externals therein he conformed correctly to type His hair was faintly reminiscent of Houbigant and at the other end of him his shoes exhaled the right SOUPCON of harness room his socks compelled one s attention without losing one s respect and his attitude in repose had just that suggestion of Whistler s mother so becoming in the really young It was within that the trouble lay if trouble it could be accounted which marked him apart from his fellows The Duke was religious Not in any of the ordinary senses of the word he took small heed of High Church or Evangelical standpoints he stood outside of all the movements and missions and cults and crusades of the day uncaring and uninterested Yet in a mystical practical way of his own which had served him unscathed and unshaken through the fickle years of boyhood he was intensely and intensively religious His family were naturally though unobtrusively distressed about it I am so afraid it may affect his bridge said his mother The Duke sat in a pennyworth of chair in saint James s Park listening to the pessimisms of Belturbet who reviewed the existing political situation from the gloomiest of standpoints Where I think you political spade workers are so silly said the Duke is in the misdirection of your efforts You spend thousands of pounds of money and Heaven knows how much dynamic force of brain power and personal energy in trying to elect or displace this or that man whereas you could gain your ends so much more simply by making use of the men as you find them If they don t suit your purpose as they are transform them into something more satisfactory Do you refer to hypnotic suggestion asked Belturbet with the air of one who is being trifled with Nothing of the sort Do you understand what I mean by the verb to koepenick That is to say to replace an authority by a spurious imitation that would carry just as much weight for the moment as the displaced original the advantage of course being that the koepenick replica would do what you wanted whereas the original does what seems best in its own eyes I suppose every public man has a double if not two or three said Belturbet but it would be a pretty hard task to koepenick a whole bunch of them and keep the originals out of the way There have been instances in European history of highly successful koepenickery said the Duke dreamily Oh of course there have been False Dimitris and Perkin Warbecks who imposed on the world for a time assented Belturbet but they personated people who were dead or safely out of the way That was a comparatively simple matter It would be far easier to pass oneself of as dead Hannibal than as living Haldane for instance I was thinking said the Duke of the most famous case of all the angel who koepenicked King Robert of Sicily with such brilliant results Just imagine what an advantage it would be to have angels deputizing to use a horrible but convenient word for Quinston and Lord Hugo Sizzle for example How much smoother the Parliamentary machine would work than at present Now you re talking nonsense said Belturbet angels don t exist nowadays at least not in that way so what is the use of dragging them into a serious discussion It s merely silly If you talk to me like that I shall just DO it said the Duke Do what asked Belturbet There were times when his young friend s uncanny remarks rather frightened him I shall summon angelic forces to take over some of the more troublesome personalities of our public life and I shall send the ousted originals into temporary retirement in suitable animal organisms It s not every one who would have the knowledge or the power necessary to bring such a thing off Oh stop that inane rubbish said Belturbet angrily it s getting wearisome Here s Quinston coming he added as there approached along the almost deserted path the well known figure of a young Cabinet Minister whose personality evoked a curious mixture of public interest and unpopularity Hurry along my dear man said the young Duke to the Minister who had given him a condescending nod your time is running short he continued in a provocative strain the whole inept crowd of you will shortly be swept away into the world s waste paper basket You poor little strawberry leafed nonentity said the Minister checking himself for a moment in his stride and rolling out his words spasmodically who is going to sweep us away I should like to know The voting masses are on our side and all the ability and administrative talent is on our side too No power of earth or Heaven is going to move us from our place till we choose to quit it No power of earth or Belturbet saw with bulging eyes a sudden void where a moment earlier had been a Cabinet Minister a void emphasized rather than relieved by the presence of a puffed out bewildered looking sparrow which hopped about for a moment in a dazed fashion and then fell to a violent cheeping and scolding If we could understand sparrow language said the Duke serenely I fancy we should hear something infinitely worse than strawberry leafed nonentity But good Heavens Eugene said Belturbet hoarsely what has become of Why there he is How on earth did he get there And he pointed with a shaking finger towards a semblance of the vanished Minister which approached once more along the unfrequented path The Duke laughed It is Quinston to all outward appearance he said composedly but I fancy you will find on closer investigation that it is an angel understudy of the real article The Angel Quinston greeted them with a friendly smile How beastly happy you two look sitting there he said wistfully I don t suppose you d care to change places with poor little us replied the Duke chaffingly How about poor little me said the Angel modestly I ve got to run about behind the wheels of popularity like a spotted dog behind a carriage getting all the dust and trying to look as if I was an important part of the machine I must seem a perfect fool to you onlookers sometimes I think you are a perfect angel said the Duke The Angel that had been Quinston smiled and passed on his way pursued across the breadth of the Horse Guards Parade by a tiresome little sparrow that cheeped incessantly and furiously at him That s only the beginning said the Duke complacently I ve made it operative with all of them irrespective of parties Belturbet made no coherent reply he was engaged in feeling his pulse The Duke fixed his attention with some interest on a black swan that was swimming with haughty stiff necked aloofness amid the crowd of lesser water fowl that dotted the ornamental water For all its pride of bearing something was evidently ruffling and enraging it in its way it seemed as angry and amazed as the sparrow had been At the same moment a human figure came along the pathway Belturbet looked up apprehensively Kedzon he whispered briefly An Angel Kedzon if I am not mistaken said the Duke Look he is talking affably to a human being That settles it A shabbily dressed lounger had accosted the man who had been Viceroy in the splendid East and who still reflected in his mien some of the cold dignity of the Himalayan snow peaks Could you tell me sir if them white birds is storks or halbatrosses I had an argyment The cold dignity thawed at once into genial friendliness Those are pelicans my dear sir Are you interested in birds If you would join me in a bun and a glass of milk at the stall yonder I could tell you some interesting things about Indian birds Right oh Now the hill mynah for instance The two men disappeared in the direction of the bun stall chatting volubly as they went and shadowed from the other side of the railed enclosure by a black swan whose temper seemed to have reached the limit of inarticulate rage Belturbet gazed in an open mouthed wonder after the retreating couple then transferred his attention to the infuriated swan and finally turned with a look of scared comprehension at his young friend lolling unconcernedly in his chair There was no longer any room to doubt what was happening The silly talk had been translated into terrifying action I think a prairie oyster on the top of a stiffish brandy and soda might save my reason said Belturbet weakly as he limped towards his club It was late in the day before he could steady his nerves sufficiently to glance at the evening papers The Parliamentary report proved significant reading and confirmed the fears that he had been trying to shake off mister Ap Dave the Chancellor whose lively controversial style endeared him to his supporters and embittered him politically speaking to his opponents had risen in his place to make an unprovoked apology for having alluded in a recent speech to certain protesting taxpayers as skulkers He had realized on reflection that they were in all probability perfectly honest in their inability to understand certain legal technicalities of the new finance laws The House had scarcely recovered from this sensation when Lord Hugo Sizzle caused a further flutter of astonishment by going out of his way to indulge in an outspoken appreciation of the fairness loyalty and straightforwardness not only of the Chancellor but of all the members of the Cabinet A wit had gravely suggested moving the adjournment of the House in view of the unexpected circumstances that had arisen Belturbet anxiously skimmed over a further item of news printed immediately below the Parliamentary report Wild cat found in an exhausted condition in Palace Yard Now I wonder which of them he mused and then an appalling idea came to him Supposing he s put them both into the same beast He hurriedly ordered another prairie oyster Belturbet was known in his club as a strictly moderate drinker his consumption of alcoholic stimulants that day gave rise to considerable comment The events of the next few days were piquantly bewildering to the world at large to Belturbet who knew dimly what was happening the situation was fraught with recurring alarms The old saying that in politics it s the unexpected that always happens received a justification that it had hitherto somewhat lacked and the epidemic of startling personal changes of front was not wholly confined to the realm of actual politics The eminent chocolate magnate Sadbury whose antipathy to the Turf and everything connected with it was a matter of general knowledge had evidently been replaced by an Angel Sadbury who proceeded to electrify the public by blossoming forth as an owner of race horses giving as a reason his matured conviction that the sport was after all one which gave healthy open air recreation to large numbers of people drawn from all classes of the community and incidentally stimulated the important industry of horse breeding His colours chocolate and cream hoops spangled with pink stars promised to become as popular as any on the Turf At the same time in order to give effect to his condemnation of the evils resulting from the spread of the gambling habit among wage earning classes who lived for the most part from hand to mouth he suppressed all betting news and tipsters forecasts in the popular evening paper that was under his control His action received instant recognition and support from the Angel proprietor of the EVENING VIEWS the principal rival evening halfpenny paper who forthwith issued an ukase decreeing a similar ban on betting news and in a short while the regular evening Press was purged of all mention of starting prices and probable winners A considerable drop in the circulation of all these papers was the immediate result accompanied of course by a falling off in advertisement value while a crop of special betting broadsheets sprang up to supply the newly created want Under their influence the betting habit became if anything rather wore widely diffused than before The Duke had possibly overlooked the futility of koepenicking the leaders of the nation with excellently intentioned angel under studies while leaving the mass of the people in its original condition Further sensation and dislocation was caused in the Press world by the sudden and dramatic RAPPROCHEMENT which took place between the Angel Editor of the SCRUTATOR and the Angel Editor of the ANGLIAN REVIEW who not only ceased to criticize and disparage the tone and tendencies of each other s publication but agreed to exchange editorships for alternating periods Here again public support was not on the side of the angels constant readers of the SCRUTATOR complained bitterly of the strong meat which was thrust upon them at fitful intervals in place of the almost vegetarian diet to which they had become confidently accustomed even those who were not mentally averse to strong meat as a separate course were pardonably annoyed at being supplied with it in the pages of the SCRUTATOR To be suddenly confronted with a pungent herring salad when one had attuned oneself to tea and toast or to discover a richly truffled segment of PATE DE FOIE dissembled in a bowl of bread and milk would be an experience that might upset the equanimity of the most placidly disposed mortal An equally vehement outcry arose from the regular subscribers of the ANGLIAN REVIEW who protested against being served from time to time with literary fare which no young person of sixteen could possibly want to devour in secret To take infinite precautions they complained against the juvenile perusal of such eminently innocuous literature was like reading the Riot Act on an uninhabited island Both reviews suffered a serious falling off in circulation and influence Peace hath its devastations as well as war The wives of noted public men formed another element of discomfiture which the young Duke had almost entirely left out of his calculations It is sufficiently embarrassing to keep abreast of the possible wobblings and veerings round of a human husband who from the strength or weakness of his personal character may leap over or slip through the barriers which divide the parties for this reason a merciful politician usually marries late in life when he has definitely made up his mind on which side he wishes his wife to be socially valuable But these trials were as nothing compared to the bewilderment caused by the Angel husbands who seemed in some cases to have revolutionized their outlook on life in the interval between breakfast and dinner without premonition or preparation of any kind and apparently without realizing the least need for subsequent explanation The temporary peace which brooded over the Parliamentary situation was by no means reproduced in the home circles of the leading statesmen and politicians It had been frequently and extensively remarked of missus Exe that she would try the patience of an angel now the tables were reversed and she unwittingly had an opportunity for discovering that the capacity for exasperating behaviour was not all on one side And then with the introduction of the Navy Estimates Parliamentary peace suddenly dissolved It was the old quarrel between Ministers and the Opposition as to the adequacy or the reverse of the Government s naval programme The Angel Quinston and the Angel Hugo Sizzle contrived to keep the debates free from personalities and pinpricks but an enormous sensation was created when the elegant lackadaisical Halfan Halfour threatened to bring up fifty thousand stalwarts to wreck the House if the Estimates were not forthwith revised on a Two Power basis It was a memorable scene when he rose in his place in response to the scandalized shouts of his opponents and thundered forth Gentlemen I glory in the name of Apache Belturbet who had made several fruitless attempts to ring up his young friend since the fateful morning in saint James s Park ran him to earth one afternoon at his club smooth and spruce and unruffled as ever Tell me what on earth have you turned Cocksley Coxon into Belturbet asked anxiously mentioning the name of one of the pillars of unorthodoxy in the Anglican Church I don t fancy he BELIEVES in angels and if he finds an angel preaching orthodox sermons from his pulpit while he s been turned into a fox terrier he ll develop rabies in less than no time I rather think it was a fox terrier said the Duke lazily Belturbet groaned heavily and sank into a chair Look here Eugene he whispered hoarsely having first looked well round to see that no one was within hearing range you ve got to stop it Consols are jumping up and down like bronchos and that speech of Halfour s in the House last night has simply startled everybody out of their wits And then on the top of it Thistlebery What has he been saying asked the Duke quickly Nothing That s just what s so disturbing Every one thought it was simply inevitable that he should come out with a great epoch making speech at this juncture and I ve just seen on the tape that he has refused to address any meetings at present giving as a reason his opinion that something more than mere speech making was wanted The young Duke said nothing but his eyes shone with quiet exultation It s so unlike Thistlebery continued Belturbet at least he said suspiciously it s unlike the REAL Thistlebery The real Thistlebery is flying about somewhere as a vocally industrious lapwing said the Duke calmly I expect great things of the Angel Thistlebery he added At this moment there was a magnetic stampede of members towards the lobby where the tape machines were ticking out some news of more than ordinary import COUP D ETAT in the North Thistlebery seizes Edinburgh Castle Threatens civil war unless Government expands naval programme In the babel which ensued Belturbet lost sight of his young friend For the best part of the afternoon he searched one likely haunt after another spurred on by the sensational posters which the evening papers were displaying broadcast over the West End General Baden Baden mobilizes Boy Scouts Another COUP D ETAT feared Is Windsor Castle safe This was one of the earlier posters and was followed by one of even more sinister purport Will the Test match have to be postponed It was this disquietening question which brought home the real seriousness of the situation to the London public and made people wonder whether one might not pay too high a price for the advantages of party government Belturbet questing round in the hope of finding the originator of the trouble with a vague idea of being able to induce him to restore matters to their normal human footing came across an elderly club acquaintance who dabbled extensively in some of the more sensitive market securities He was pale with indignation and his pallor deepened as a breathless newsboy dashed past with a poster inscribed Premier s constituency harried by moss troopers Halfour sends encouraging telegram to rioters Letchworth Garden City threatens reprisals Foreigners taking refuge in Embassies and National Liberal Club This is devils work he said angrily Belturbet knew otherwise At the bottom of saint James s Street a newspaper motor cart which had just come rapidly along Pall Mall was surrounded by a knot of eagerly talking people and for the first time that afternoon Belturbet heard expressions of relief and congratulation It displayed a placard with the welcome announcement Crisis ended Government gives way Important expansion of naval programme There seemed to be no immediate necessity for pursuing the quest of the errant Duke and Belturbet turned to make his way homeward through saint James s Park His mind attuned to the alarums and excursions of the afternoon became dimly aware that some excitement of a detached nature was going on around him In spite of the political ferment which reigned in the streets quite a large crowd had gathered to watch the unfolding of a tragedy that had taken place on the shore of the ornamental water A large black swan which had recently shown signs of a savage and dangerous disposition had suddenly attacked a young gentleman who was walking by the water s edge dragged him down under the surface and drowned him before anyone could come to his assistance At the moment when Belturbet arrived on the spot several park keepers were engaged in lifting the corpse into a punt Belturbet stooped to pick up a hat that lay near the scene of the struggle It was a smart soft felt hat faintly reminiscent of Houbigant More than a month elapsed before Belturbet had sufficiently recovered from his attack of nervous prostration to take an interest once more in what was going on in the world of politics The Parliamentary Session was still in full swing and a General Election was looming in the near future He called for a batch of morning papers and skimmed rapidly through the speeches of the Chancellor Quinston and other Ministerial leaders as well as those of the principal Opposition champions and then sank back in his chair with a sigh of relief Evidently the spell had ceased to act after the tragedy which had overtaken its invoker There was no trace of angel anywhere THE REMOULDING OF GROBY LINGTON A man is known by the company he keeps In the morning room of his sister in law s house Groby Lington fidgeted away the passing minutes with the demure restlessness of advanced middle age About a quarter of an hour would have to elapse before it would be time to say his good byes and make his way across the village green to the station with a selected escort of nephews and nieces He was a good natured kindly dispositioned man and in theory he was delighted to pay periodical visits to the wife and children of his dead brother William in practice he infinitely preferred the comfort and seclusion of his own house and garden and the companionship of his books and his parrot to these rather meaningless and tiresome incursions into a family circle with which he had little in common It was not so much the spur of his own conscience that drove him to make the occasional short journey by rail to visit his relatives as an obedient concession to the more insistent but vicarious conscience of his brother Colonel John who was apt to accuse him of neglecting poor old William s family Groby usually forgot or ignored the existence of his neighbour kinsfolk until such time as he was threatened with a visit from the Colonel when he would put matters straight by a hurried pilgrimage across the few miles of intervening country to renew his acquaintance with the young people and assume a kindly if rather forced interest in the well being of his sister in law On this occasion he had cut matters so fine between the timing of his exculpatory visit and the coming of Colonel John that he would scarcely be home before the latter was due to arrive Anyhow Groby had got it over and six or seven months might decently elapse before he need again sacrifice his comforts and inclinations on the altar of family sociability He was inclined to be distinctly cheerful as he hopped about the room picking up first one object then another and subjecting each to a brief bird like scrutiny Presently his cheerful listlessness changed sharply to an attitude of vexed attention In a scrap book of drawings and caricatures belonging to one of his nephews he had come across an unkindly clever sketch of himself and his parrot solemnly confronting each other in postures of ridiculous gravity and repose and bearing a likeness to one another that the artist had done his utmost to accentuate After the first flush of annoyance had passed away Groby laughed good naturedly and admitted to himself the cleverness of the drawing Then the feeling of resentment repossessed him resentment not against the caricaturist who had embodied the idea in pen and ink but against the possible truth that the idea represented Was it really the case that people grew in time to resemble the animals they kept as pets and had he unconsciously become more and more like the comically solemn bird that was his constant companion Groby was unusually silent as he walked to the train with his escort of chattering nephews and nieces and during the short railway journey his mind was more and more possessed with an introspective conviction that he had gradually settled down into a sort of parrot like existence What after all did his daily routine amount to but a sedate meandering and pecking and perching in his garden among his fruit trees in his wicker chair on the lawn or by the fireside in his library And what was the sum total of his conversation with chance encountered neighbours Quite a spring day isn t it It looks as though we should have some rain Glad to see you about again you must take care of yourself How the young folk shoot up don t they Strings of stupid inevitable perfunctory remarks came to his mind remarks that were certainly not the mental exchange of human intelligences but mere empty parrot talk One might really just as well salute one s acquaintances with Pretty polly Puss puss miaow Groby began to fume against the picture of himself as a foolish feathered fowl which his nephew s sketch had first suggested and which his own accusing imagination was filling in with such unflattering detail I ll give the beastly bird away he said resentfully though he knew at the same time that he would do no such thing It would look so absurd after all the years that he had kept the parrot and made much of it suddenly to try and find it a new home Has my brother arrived he asked of the stable boy who had come with the pony carriage to meet him Yessir came down by the two fifteen Your parrot s dead The boy made the latter announcement with the relish which his class finds in proclaiming a catastrophe My parrot dead said Groby What caused its death The ipe said the boy briefly The ipe queried Groby Whatever s that The ipe what the Colonel brought down with him came the rather alarming answer Do you mean to say my brother is ill asked Groby Is it something infectious Th Colonel s so well as ever he was said the boy and as no further explanation was forthcoming Groby had to possess himself in mystified patience till he reached home His brother was waiting for him at the hall door Have you heard about the parrot he asked at once Pon my soul I m awfully sorry The moment he saw the monkey I d brought down as a surprise for you he squawked out Rats to you sir and the blessed monkey made one spring at him got him by the neck and whirled him round like a rattle He was as dead as mutton by the time I d got him out of the little beggar s paws Always been such a friendly little beast the monkey has should never have thought he d got it in him to see red like that Can t tell you how sorry I feel about it and now of course you ll hate the sight of the monkey Not at all said Groby sincerely A few hours earlier the tragic end which had befallen his parrot would have presented itself to him as a calamity now it arrived almost as a polite attention on the part of the Fates The bird was getting old you know he went on in explanation of his obvious lack of decent regret at the loss of his pet I was really beginning to wonder if it was an unmixed kindness to let him go on living till he succumbed to old age What a charming little monkey he added when he was introduced to the culprit The new comer was a small long tailed monkey from the Western Hemisphere with a gentle half shy half trusting manner that instantly captured Groby s confidence a student of simian character might have seen in the fitful red light in its eyes some indication of the underlying temper which the parrot had so rashly put to the test with such dramatic consequences for itself The servants who had come to regard the defunct bird as a regular member of the household and one who gave really very little trouble were scandalized to find his bloodthirsty aggressor installed in his place as an honoured domestic pet A nasty heathen ipe what don t never say nothing sensible and cheerful same as pore Polly did was the unfavourable verdict of the kitchen quarters One Sunday morning some twelve or fourteen months after the visit of Colonel John and the parrot tragedy Miss Wepley sat decorously in her pew in the parish church immediately in front of that occupied by Groby Lington She was comparatively speaking a new comer in the neighbourhood and was not personally acquainted with her fellow worshipper in the seat behind but for the past two years the Sunday morning service had brought them regularly within each other s sphere of consciousness Without having paid particular attention to the subject she could probably have given a correct rendering of the way in which he pronounced certain words occurring in the responses while he was well aware of the trivial fact that in addition to her prayer book and handkerchief a small paper packet of throat lozenges always reposed on the seat beside her Miss Wepley rarely had recourse to her lozenges but in case she should be taken with a fit of coughing she wished to have the emergency duly provided for On this particular Sunday the lozenges occasioned an unusual diversion in the even tenor of her devotions far more disturbing to her personally than a prolonged attack of coughing would have been As she rose to take part in the singing of the first hymn she fancied that she saw the hand of her neighbour who was alone in the pew behind her make a furtive downward grab at the packet lying on the seat on turning sharply round she found that the packet had certainly disappeared but mister Lington was to all outward seeming serenely intent on his hymnbook No amount of interrogatory glaring on the part of the despoiled lady could bring the least shade of conscious guilt to his face Worse was to follow as she remarked afterwards to a scandalized audience of friends and acquaintances I had scarcely knelt in prayer when a lozenge one of my lozenges came whizzing into the pew just under my nose I turned round and stared but mister Lington had his eyes closed and his lips moving as though engaged in prayer The moment I resumed my devotions another lozenge came rattling in and then another I took no notice for awhile and then turned round suddenly just as the dreadful man was about to flip another one at me He hastily pretended to be turning over the leaves of his book but I was not to be taken in that time He saw that he had been discovered and no more lozenges came Of course I have changed my pew No gentleman would have acted in such a disgraceful manner said one of her listeners and yet mister Lington used to be so respected by everybody He seems to have behaved like a little ill bred schoolboy He behaved like a monkey said Miss Wepley Her unfavourable verdict was echoed in other quarters about the same time Groby Lington had never been a hero in the eyes of his personal retainers but he had shared the approval accorded to his defunct parrot as a cheerful well dispositioned body who gave no particular trouble Of late months however this character would hardly have been endorsed by the members of his domestic establishment The stolid stable boy who had first announced to him the tragic end of his feathered pet was one of the first to give voice to the murmurs of disapproval which became rampant and general in the servants quarters and he had fairly substantial grounds for his disaffection In a burst of hot summer weather he had obtained permission to bathe in a modest sized pond in the orchard and thither one afternoon Groby had bent his steps attracted by loud imprecations of anger mingled with the shriller chattering of monkey language He beheld his plump diminutive servitor clad only in a waistcoat and a pair of socks storming ineffectually at the monkey which was seated on a low branch of an apple tree abstractedly fingering the remainder of the boy s outfit which he had removed just out of has reach The ipe s been an took my clothes whined the boy with the passion of his kind for explaining the obvious His incomplete toilet effect rather embarrassed him but he hailed the arrival of Groby with relief as promising moral and material support in his efforts to get back his raided garments The monkey had ceased its defiant jabbering and doubtless with a little coaxing from its master it would hand back the plunder If I lift you up suggested Groby you will just be able to reach the clothes The boy agreed and Groby clutched him firmly by the waistcoat which was about all there was to catch hold of and lifted him clear of the ground Then with a deft swing he sent him crashing into a clump of tall nettles which closed receptively round him The victim had not been brought up in a school which teaches one to repress one s emotions if a fox had attempted to gnaw at his vitals he would have flown to complain to the nearest hunt committee rather than have affected an attitude of stoical indifference On this occasion the volume of sound which he produced under the stimulus of pain and rage and astonishment was generous and sustained but above his bellowings he could distinctly hear the triumphant chattering of his enemy in the tree and a peal of shrill laughter from Groby When the boy had finished an improvised saint Vitus caracole which would have brought him fame on the boards of the Coliseum and which indeed met with ready appreciation and applause from the retreating figure of Groby Lington he found that the monkey had also discreetly retired while his clothes were scattered on the grass at the foot of the tree They m two ipes that s what they be he muttered angrily and if his judgment was severe at least he spoke under the sting of considerable provocation It was a week or two later that the parlour maid gave notice having been terrified almost to tears by an outbreak of sudden temper on the part of the master anent some underdone cutlets E gnashed is teeth at me e did reely she informed a sympathetic kitchen audience I d like to see im talk like that to me I would said the cook defiantly but her cooking from that moment showed a marked improvement It was seldom that Groby Lington so far detached himself from his accustomed habits as to go and form one of a house party and he was not a little piqued that missus Glenduff should have stowed him away in the musty old Georgian wing of the house in the next room moreover to Leonard Spabbink the eminent pianist He plays Liszt like an angel had been the hostess s enthusiastic testimonial He may play him like a trout for all I care had been Groby s mental comment but I wouldn t mind betting that he snores He s just the sort and shape that would And if I hear him snoring through those ridiculous thin panelled walls there ll be trouble He did and there was Groby stood it for about two and a quarter minutes and then made his way through the corridor into Spabbink s room Under Groby s vigorous measures the musician s flabby redundant figure sat up in bewildered semi consciousness like an ice cream that has been taught to beg Groby prodded him into complete wakefulness and then the pettish self satisfied pianist fairly lost his temper and slapped his domineering visitant on the hand In another moment Spabbink was being nearly stifled and very effectually gagged by a pillow case tightly bound round his head while his plump pyjama d limbs were hauled out of bed and smacked pinched kicked and bumped in a catch as catch can progress across the floor towards the flat shallow bath in whose utterly inadequate depths Groby perseveringly strove to drown him For a few moments the room was almost in darkness Groby s candle had overturned in an early stage of the scuffle and its flicker scarcely reached to the spot where splashings smacks muffled cries and splutterings and a chatter of ape like rage told of the struggle that was being waged round the shores of the bath A few instants later the one sided combat was brightly lit up by the flare of blazing curtains and rapidly kindling panelling When the hastily aroused members of the house party stampeded out on to the lawn the Georgian wing was well alight and belching forth masses of smoke but some moments elapsed before Groby appeared with the half drowned pianist in his arms having just bethought him of the superior drowning facilities offered by the pond at the bottom of the lawn The cool night air sobered his rage and when he found that he was innocently acclaimed as the heroic rescuer of poor Leonard Spabbink and loudly commended for his presence of mind in tying a wet cloth round his head to protect him from smoke suffocation he accepted the situation and subsequently gave a graphic account of his finding the musician asleep with an overturned candle by his side and the conflagration well started Spabbink gave HIS version some days later when he had partially recovered from the shock of his midnight castigation and immersion but the gentle pitying smiles and evasive comments with which his story was greeted warned him that the public ear was not at his disposal He refused however to attend the ceremonial presentation of the Royal Humane Society s life saving medal It was about this time that Groby s pet monkey fell a victim to the disease which attacks so many of its kind when brought under the influence of a northern climate Its master appeared to be profoundly affected by its loss and never quite recovered the level of spirits that he had recently attained In company with the tortoise which Colonel John presented to him on his last visit he potters about his lawn and kitchen garden with none of his erstwhile sprightliness and his nephews and nieces are fairly well justified in alluding to him as Old Uncle Groby ACKNOWLEDGEMENT The Background originally appeared in the LEINSTERS MAGAZINE The Stampeding of Lady Bastable in the DAILY MAIL missus
