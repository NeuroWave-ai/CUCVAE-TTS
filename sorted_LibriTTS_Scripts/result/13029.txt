many elements of beauty at least one peculiarity It viewed art as a reality and one of our most familiar and popular realities as an art This should have made the book either a revelation or utter Greek to most of us and those who read it probably dropped it easily into one or the other of the two categories For myself long a propagandist for its doctrines in another but related field the book came as a great solace In it I found not an appeal to have the art museum used which would have been an old though welcome story not this but much to my surprise the art museum actually at work one of the very wheels on which our culture rolled forward upon its hopeful way I saw among other museums the one whose destinies I was tenderly guiding playing in Lindsay s book the part that is played by the classic myths in Milton or by the dictionary in the writings of the rest of us For once the museum and its contents appeared not as a lovely curiosity but as one of the basic and in a sense humble necessities of life To paraphrase the author s own text the art museum like the furniture in a good movie was actually in motion a character in the play On this point of view as on a pivot turns the whole book In The Art of the Moving Picture the nature and domain of a new Muse is defined She is the first legitimate addition to the family since classic times And as it required trained painters of pictures like Fulton and Morse to visualize the possibility of the steamboat and the telegraph so the bold seer who perceived the true nature of this new star in our nightly heavens it should here be recorded acquired much of the vision of his seeing eye through an early training in art Vachel Lindsay as he himself proudly asserts was a student at the Institute in Chicago for four years spent one more at the League and at Chase s in New York and for four more haunted the Metropolitan Museum lecturing to his fellows on every art there shown from the Egyptian to that of Arthur B Davies Only such a background as this could have evolved the conception of Architecture sculpture and painting in motion and given authenticity to its presentation The validity of Lindsay s analysis is attested by Freeburg s helpful characterization Composition in fluid forms which it seems to have suggested To Lindsay s category one would be tempted to add pattern in motion applying it to such a film as the Caligari which he and I have seen together and discussed during these past few days Pattern in this connection would imply an emphasis on the intrinsic suggestion of the spot and shape apart from their immediate relation to the appearance of natural objects But this is a digression It simply serves to show the breadth and adaptability of Lindsay s method The book was written for a visual minded public and for those who would be its leaders A long long line of picture readers trailing from the dawn of history stimulated all the masterpieces of pictorial art from Altamira to Michelangelo For less than five centuries now Gutenberg has had them scurrying to learn their A B C s but they are drifting back to their old ways again and nightly are forming themselves in cues at the doorways of the Isis the Tivoli and the Riviera the while it is sadly noted that the pictures are driving literature off the parlor table With the creative implications of this new pictorial art with the whole visual minded race clamoring for more what may we not dream in the way of a new renaissance How are we to step in to the possession of such a destiny Are the institutions with a purely literary theory of life going to meet the need Are the art schools and the art museums making themselves ready to assimilate a new art form Or what is the type of institution that will ultimately take the position of leadership in culture through this new universal instrument What possibilities lie in this art once it is understood and developed to plant new conceptions of civic and national idealism How far may it go in cultivating concerted emotion in the now ungoverned crowd Such questions as these can be answered only by minds with the imagination to see art as a reality with faith to visualize for the little mid western home town a new and living Pallas Athena with courage to raze the very houses of the city to make new and greater forums and civic centres For ourselves in Denver we shall try to do justice to the new Muse In the museum which we build we shall provide a shrine for her We shall first endeavor by those simple means which lie to our hands to know the areas of charm and imagination which remain as yet an untilled field of her domain Plowing is a simple art but it requires much sweat This at least we know to the expenditure we cheerfully consent So much for the beginning It would be boastful to describe plans to keep pace with the enlarging of the motion picture field before a real beginning is made But with youth in its favor the Denver Art Museum hopes yet to see this art set in its rightful place with painting sculpture architecture and the handicrafts hopes yet to be an instrument in the great work of making this art real as those others are being even now made real to the expanding vision of an eager people GEORGE WILLIAM EGGERS Director The Denver Art Association DENVER COLORADO New Year s Day nineteen twenty two BOOK I THE GENERAL PHOTOPLAY SITUATION IN AMERICA JANUARY one nineteen twenty two Especially as Viewed from the Heights of the Civic Centre at Denver Colorado and the Denver Art Museum Which Is to Be a Leading Feature of This Civic Centre In the second chapter of book two on page eight the theoretical outline begins with a discussion of the Photoplay of Action I put there on record the first crude commercial films that in any way establish the principle There can never be but one first of anything and if the negatives of these films survive the shrinking and the warping that comes with time they will still be in a certain sense classic and ten years hence or two years hence will still be better remembered than any films of the current releases which come on like newspapers and as George Ade says Nothing is so dead as yesterday s newspaper But the first newspapers and the first imprints of Addison s Spectator and the first Almanacs of Benjamin Franklin and the first broadside ballads and the like are ever collected and remembered And the lists of films given in books two and three of this work are the only critical and carefully sorted lists of the early motion pictures that I happen to know anything about I hope to be corrected if I am too boastful but I boast that my lists must be referred to by all those who desire to study these experiments in their beginnings So I let them remain as still vivid in the memory of all true lovers of the photoplay who have watched its growth fascinated from the first But I would add to the list of Action Films of chapter two the recent popular example Douglas Fairbanks in The Three Musketeers That is perhaps the most literal Chase Picture that was ever really successful in the commercial world The story is cut to one episode The whole task of the four famous swordsmen of Dumas is to get the Queen s token that is in the hands of Buckingham in England and return with it to Paris in time for the great ball It is one long race with the Cardinal s guards who are at last left behind It is the same plot as Reynard the Fox John Masefield s poem Reynard successfully eluding the huntsmen and the dogs If that poem is ever put on in an Art Museum film it will have to be staged like one of AEsop s Fables with a man acting the Fox for the children s delight And I earnestly urge all who would understand the deeper significance of the chase picture or the Action Picture to give more thought to Masefield s poem than to Fairbanks marvellous acting in the school of the younger Salvini The Mood of the intimate photoplay chapter three still remains indicated in the current films by the acting of Lillian Gish and Mary Pickford when they are not roused up by their directors to turn handsprings to keep the people staring Mary Pickford in particular has been stimulated to be over athletic and in all her career she has been given just one chance to be her more delicate self and that was in the almost forgotten film A Romance of the Redwoods This is one of the serious commercial attempts that should be revived and studied in spite of its crudities of plot by our Art Museums There is something of the grandeur of the redwoods in it in contrast to the sustained Botticelli grace of Our Mary I am the one poet who has a right to claim for his muses Blanche Sweet Mary Pickford and Mae Marsh I am the one poet who wrote them songs when they were Biograph heroines before their names were put on the screen or the name of their director Woman s clubs are always asking me for bits of delicious gossip about myself to fill up literary essays Now there s a bit There are two things to be said for those poems First they were heartfelt Second any one could improve on them In the fourth chapter of book two I discourse elaborately and formally on The Motion Picture of Fairy Splendor And to this carefully balanced technical discourse I would add the informal word this New Year s Day that this type is best illustrated by such fairy tales as have been most ingratiatingly retold in the books of Padraic Colum and dazzlingly illustrated by Willy Pogany The Colum Pogany School of Thought is one which the commercial producers have not yet condescended to illustrate in celluloid and it remains a special province for the Art Museum Film Fairy tales need not be more than one tenth of a reel long Some of the best fairy tales in the whole history of man can be told in a breath And the best motion picture story for fifty years may turn out to be a reel ten minutes long Do not let the length of the commercial film tyrannize over your mind O young art museum photoplay director Remember the brevity of Lincoln s Gettysburg address And so my commentary New Year s Day nineteen twenty two proceeds using for points of more and more extensive departure the refrains and old catch phrases of books two and three Chapter V The Picture of Crowd Splendor being the type illustrated by Griffith s Intolerance Chapter VI The Picture of Patriotic Splendor which was illustrated by all the War Films the one most recently approved and accepted by the public being The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse Chapter VII The Picture of Religious Splendor which has no examples that remain in the memory with any sharpness in nineteen twenty two except The Faith Healer founded on the play by William Vaughn Moody the poet with much of the directing and scenario by missus William Vaughn Moody and a more talked of commercial film The Miracle Man But not until the religious film is taken out of the commercial field and allowed to develop unhampered under the Church and the Art Museum will the splendid religious and ritualistic opportunity be realized Chapter VIII Sculpture in Motion being a continuation of the argument of chapter two The Photoplay of Action Like the Action Film this aspect of composition is much better understood by the commercial people than some other sides of the art Some of the best of the William S Hart productions show appreciation of this quality by the director the photographer and the public Not only is the man but the horse allowed to be moving bronze and not mere cowboy pasteboard Many of the pictures of Charles Ray make the hero quite a bronze looking sculpturesque person despite his yokel raiment Chapter IX Painting in Motion being a continuation on a higher terrace of chapter three The Intimate Photoplay Charlie Chaplin has intimate and painter s qualities in his acting and he makes himself into a painting or an etching in the midst of furious slapstick But he has been in no films that were themselves paintings The argument of this chapter has been carried much further in Freeburg s book The Art of Photoplay Making Chapter X Furniture Trappings and Inventions in Motion being a continuation of the chapter on Fairy Splendor In this field we find one of the worst failures of the commercial films and their utterly unimaginative corporation promoters Again I must refer them to such fairy books as those of Padraic Colum where neither sword nor wing nor boat is found to move except for a fairy reason I have just returned this very afternoon from a special showing of the famous imported film The Cabinet of doctor Caligari Some of the earnest spirits of the Denver Art Association finding it was in storage in the town had it privately brought forth to study it with reference to its bearing on their new policies What influence it will have in that most vital group time will show Meanwhile it is a marvellous illustration of the meaning of this chapter and the chapter on Fairy Splendor though it is a diabolical not a beneficent vitality that is given to inanimate things The furniture trappings and inventions are in motion to express the haunted mind as in Griffith s Avenging Conscience described pages one hundred twenty one through one hundred thirty two The two should be shown together in the same afternoon in the Art Museum study rooms Caligari is undoubtedly the most important imported film since that work of D Annunzio Cabiria described pages fifty five through fifty seven But it is the opposite type of film Cabiria is all out doors and splendor on the Mediterranean scale In general imported films do not concern Americans for we have now a vast range of technique All we lack is the sense to use it The cabinet of Caligari is indeed a cabinet and the feeling of being in a cell and smothered by all the oppressions of a weary mind does not desert the spectator for a minute The play is more important technically than in its subject matter and mood It proves in a hundred new ways the resources of the film in making all the inanimate things which on the spoken stage cannot act at all the leading actors in the films But they need not necessarily act to a diabolical end An angel could have as well been brought from the cabinet as a murderous somnambulist and every act of his could have been a work of beneficence and health and healing I could not help but think that the ancient miracle play of the resurrection of Osiris could have been acted out with similar simple means with a mummy case and great sarcophagus The wings of Isis and Nephthys could have been spread over the sky instead of the oppressive walls of the crooked city Lights instead of shadows could have been made actors and real hieroglyphic inscriptions instead of scrawls As it was the alleged insane man was more sensible than most motion picture directors for his scenery acted with him and not according to accident or silly formula I make these points as an antidote to the general description of this production by those who praise it They speak of the scenery as grotesque strained and experimental and the plot as sinister But this does not get to the root of the matter There is rather the implication in most of the criticisms and praises that the scenery is abstract Quite the contrary is the case Indoors looks like indoors Streets are always streets roofs are always roofs The actors do not move about in a kind of crazy geometry as I was led to believe The scenery is oppressive but sane and the obsession is for the most part expressed in the acting and plot The fair looks like a fair and the library looks like a library There is nothing experimental about any of the setting nothing unconsidered or strained or over considered It seems experimental because it is thrown into contrast with extreme commercial formulas in the regular line of the movie trade But compare The Cabinet of doctor Caligari with a book of Rackham or Du Lac or Duerer or Rembrandt s etchings and doctor Caligari is more realistic And Eggers insists the whole film is replete with suggestions of the work of Pieter Breughel the painter Hundreds of indoor stories will be along such lines once the merely commercial motive is eliminated and the artist is set free This film is an extraordinary variation of the intimate as expounded in chapter three It is drawing in motion instead of painting in motion Because it was drawing instead of painting literary minded people stepped to the hasty conclusion it was experimental Half tone effects are for the most part eliminated Line is dominant everywhere It is the opposite of vast conceptions like Theodora which are architecture in motion All the architecture of the Caligari film seems pasteboard The whole thing happens in a cabinet It is the most overwhelming contrast to Griffith s Intolerance that could be in any way imagined It contains one may say all the effects left out of Intolerance The word cabinet is a quadruple pun Not only does it mean a mystery box and a box holding a somnambulist but a kind of treasury of tiny twisted thoughts There is not one line or conception in it on the grand scale or even the grandiose It is a devil s toy house One feels like a mouse in a mouse trap so small one cannot turn around In Intolerance Griffith hurls nation at nation race at race century against century and his camera is not only a telescope across the plains of Babylon but across the ages Griffith is in Intolerance the ungrammatical Byron of the films but certainly as magnificent as Byron and since he is the first of his kind I for one am willing to name him with Marlowe But for technical study for Art Schools The Cabinet of doctor Caligari is more profitable It shows how masterpieces can be made with the second hand furniture of any attic But I hope fairy tales not diabolical stories will come from these attics Fairy tales are inherent in the genius of the motion picture and are a thousand times hinted at in the commercial films though the commercial films are not willing to stop to tell them Lillian Gish could be given wings and a wand if she only had directors and scenario writers who believed in fairies And the same can most heartily be said of Mae Marsh Chapter XI Architecture in Motion being a continuation of the argument about the Splendor Pictures in chapters five six and seven This is an element constantly re illustrated in a magnificent but fragmentary way by the News Films Any picture of a seagull flying so close to the camera that it becomes as large as a flying machine or any flying machine made by man and photographed in epic flight captures the eye because it is architecture and in motion motion which is the mysterious fourth dimension of its grace and glory So likewise and in kind any picture of a tossing ship The most superb example of architecture in motion in the commercial history of the films is the march of the moving war towers against the walls of Babylon in Griffith s Intolerance But Griffith is the only person so far who has known how to put a fighting soul into a moving tower The only real war that has occurred in the films with the world s greatest war going on outside was Griffith s War Against Babylon The rest was news Chapter XII Thirty Differences between the Photoplays and the Stage The argument of the whole of the nineteen fifteen edition has been accepted by the studios the motion picture magazines and the daily motion picture columns throughout the land I have read hundreds of editorials and magazines and scarcely one that differed from it in theory Most of them read like paraphrases of this work And of all arguments made the one in this chapter is the one oftenest accepted in its entirety The people who dominate the films are obviously those who grew up with them from the very beginning and the merely stage actors who rushed in with the highest tide of prosperity now have to take second rank if they remain in the films But most of these have gone back to the stage by this time with their managers as well and certainly this chapter is abundantly proved out Chapter XIII Hieroglyphics One of the implications of this chapter and the one preceding is that the fewer words printed on the screen the better and that the ideal film has no words printed on it at all but is one unbroken sheet of photography This is admitted in theory in all the studios now though the only film of the kind ever produced of general popular success was The Old Swimmin Hole acted by Charles Ray If I remember there was not one word on the screen after the cast of characters was given The whole story was clearly and beautifully told by Photoplay Hieroglyphics For this feature alone despite many defects of the film it should be studied in every art school in America Meanwhile Title writing remains a commercial necessity In this field there is but one person who has won distinction Anita Loos She is one of the four or five important and thoroughly artistic brains in the photoplay game Among them is the distinguished John Emerson In combination with John Emerson director producer et cetera she has done so many other things well her talents as a title writer are incidental but certainly to be mentioned in this place The outline we are discussing continues through Book III More Personal Speculations and Afterthoughts Not Brought Forward so Dogmatically Chapter XIV The Orchestra Conversation and the Censorship In this chapter on page one hundred eighty nine I suggest suppressing the orchestra entirely and encouraging the audience to talk about the film No photoplay people have risen to contradict this theory but it is a chapter that once caused me great embarrassment With Christopher Morley the well known author of Shandygaff and other temperance literature I was trying to prove out this chapter As soon as the orchestra stopped while the show rolled on in glory I talked about the main points in this book illustrating it by the film before us Almost everything that happened was a happy illustration of my ideas But there were two shop girls in front of us awfully in love with a certain second rate actor who insisted on kissing the heroine every so often and with her apparent approval Every time we talked about that those shop girls glared at us as though we were robbing them of their time and money Finally one of them dragged the other out into the aisle and dashed out of the house with her dear chum saying so all could hear Well come on Terasa we might as well go if these two talking pests are going to keep this up behind us The poor girl s voice trembled She was in tears She was gone before we could apologize or offer flowers So I say in applying this chapter in our present stage of civilization sit on the front seat where no one can hear your whisperings but Mary Pickford on the screen She is but a shadow there and will not mind Chapter XV The Substitute for the Saloon I leave this argument as a monument just as it was written in nineteen fourteen and fifteen It indicates a certain power of forecasting on the part of the writer We drys have certainly won a great victory Some of the photoplay people agree with this temperance sermon and some of them do not The wets make one mistake above all They do not realize that the drys can still keep on voting dry with intense conviction and great battle cries and still have a sense of humor

none	none	 On Coming Forth by Day This is the second Egyptian chapter It has its direct relation to the Hieroglyphic chapter page one hundred seventy one I note that I say here it costs a dime to go to the show Well now it costs around thirty cents to go to a good show in a respectable suburb sometimes fifty cents But we will let that dime remain there as a matter of historic interest and pass on to higher themes Certainly the Hieroglyphic chapter is in words of one syllable and any kindergarten teacher can understand it Chapter nineteen adds a bit to the idea I do not know how warranted I am in displaying Egyptian learning Newspaper reporters never tire of getting me to talk about hieroglyphics in their relation to the photoplays and always give me respectful headlines on the theme I can only say that up to this hour every time I have toured art museums I have begun with the Egyptian exhibit and if my patient guest was willing lectured on every period on to the present time giving a little time to the principal exhibits in each room but I have always found myself returning to Egypt as a standard It seems my natural classic land of art So when I took up hieroglyphics more seriously last summer I found them extraordinarily easy as though I were looking at a movie in a book I think Egyptian picture writing came easy because I have analyzed so many hundreds of photoplay films merely for recreation and the same style of composition is in both Any child who reads one can read the other But of course the literal translation must be there at hand to correct all wrong guesses I figure that in just one thousand years I can read hieroglyphics without a pony But meanwhile I tour museums and I ride Pharaoh s horse and suggest to all photoplay enthusiasts they do the same I recommend these two books most heartily Elementary Egyptian Grammar by Margaret A Murray London Bernard Quaritch eleven Grafton Street Bond Street W and the three volumes of the Book of the Dead which are indeed the Papyrus of Ani referred to in this chapter pages two hundred fifty five two hundred fifty eight It is edited translated and reproduced in fac simile by the keeper of the Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities in the British Museum Professor E A Wallis Budge published by G P Putnam s Sons New York and Philip Lee Warner London This book is certainly the greatest motion picture I ever attended I have gone through it several times and it is the only book one can read twelve hours at a stretch on the Pullman when he is making thirty six hour and forty eight hour jumps from town to town American civilization grows more hieroglyphic every day The cartoons of Darling the advertisements in the back of the magazines and on the bill boards and in the street cars the acres of photographs in the Sunday newspapers make us into a hieroglyphic civilization far nearer to Egypt than to England Let us then accept for our classic land for our standard of form the country naturally our own Hieroglyphics are so much nearer to the American mood than the rest of the Egyptian legacy that Americans seldom get as far as the Hieroglyphics to discover how congenial they are Seeing the mummies good Americans flee But there is not a man in America writing advertisements or making cartoons or films but would find delightful the standard books of Hieroglyphics sent out by the British Museum once he gave them a chance They represent that very aspect of visual life which Europe understands so little in America and which has been expanding so enormously even the last year Hallowe en for instance lasts a whole week now with mummers on the streets every night October twenty five thirty one Chapter XX The Prophet Wizard Who do we mean by The Prophet Wizard We mean not only artists such as are named in this chapter but dreamers and workers like Johnny Appleseed or Abraham Lincoln The best account of Johnny Appleseed is in Harper s Monthly for November eighteen seventy one People do not know Abraham Lincoln till they have visited the grave of Anne Rutledge at Petersburg Illinois then New Old Salem a mile away New Old Salem is a prophet s hill on the edge of the Sangamon with lovely woods all around Here a brooding soul could be born and here the dreamer Abraham Lincoln spent his real youth I do not call him a dreamer in a cheap and sentimental effort to describe a man of aspiration Lincoln told and interpreted his visions like Joseph and Daniel in the Old Testament revealing them to the members of his cabinet in great trials of the Civil War People who do not see visions and dream dreams in the good Old Testament sense have no right to leadership in America I would prefer photoplays filled with such visions and oracles to the state papers written by practical men As it is we are ruled indirectly by photoplays owned and controlled by men who should be in the shoe string and hook and eye trade Apparently their digestions are good they are in excellent health and they keep out of jail Chapter XXI The Acceptable Year of the Lord If I may be pardoned for referring again to the same book I assumed in The Golden Book of Springfield Illinois that the Acceptable Year of the Lord would come for my city beginning November one twenty eighteen and that up to that time amid much of joy there would also be much of thwarting and tribulation But in the beginning of that mystic November the Soul of My City named Avanel would become as much a part of the city as Pallas Athena was Athens and indeed I wrote into the book much of the spirit of the photoplay outlined pages one hundred forty seven through one hundred fifty But in The Golden Book I changed the lady the city worshipped from a golden image into a living breathing young girl descendant of that great American Daniel Boone and her name obviously Avanel Boone With her tribe she incarnates all the mystic ideals of the Boones of Kentucky All this but a prelude to saying that I have just passed through the city of Santa Fe New Mexico It is a Santa Fe full of the glory of the New Architecture of which I have spoken and the issuing of a book of cowboy songs collected and many of them written by N Howard Thorp a citizen of Santa Fe and thrilling with the issuing of a book of poems about the Glory of New Mexico This book is called Red Earth It is by Alice Corbin Henderson And Santa Fe is full of the glory of a magnificent State Capitol that is an art gallery of the whole southwest and the glories of the studio of William Penhallow Henderson who has painted our New Arabia more splendidly than it was ever painted before with the real character thereof and no theatricals This is just the kind of a town I hoped for when I wrote my first draft of The Art of the Moving Picture Here now is literature and art When they become one art as of old in Egypt we will have New Mexico Hieroglyphics from the Hendersons and their kind and their surrounding Indian pupils a basis for the American Motion Picture more acceptable and more patriotic and more organic for us than the Egyptian And I come the same month to Denver and find a New Art Museum projected which I hope has much indeed to do with the Acceptable Year of the Lord when films as vital as the Santa Fe songs and pictures and architecture can be made and in common spirit with them in this New Arabia George W Eggers the director of the newly projected Denver Art Museum assures me that a photoplay policy can be formulated amid the problems of such an all around undertaking as building a great Art Museum in Denver He expects to give the photoplay the attention a new art deserves especially when it affects almost every person in the whole country So I prophesy Denver to be the Museum and Art school capital of New Arabia as Santa Fe is the artistic architectural and song capital at this hour And I hope it may become the motion picture capital of America from the standpoint of pure art not manufacture What do I mean by New Arabia When I was in London in the fall of nineteen twenty the editor of The Landmark the organ of The English Speaking Union asked me to draw my map of the United States I marked out the various regions under various names For instance I called the coast states Washington Oregon and California New Italy The reasons may be found in the chapter in this book on California Then I named the states just west of the Middle West and east of New Italy New Arabia These states are New Mexico Arizona Utah Colorado Wyoming Idaho and Montana These are the states which carry the Rocky Mountains north toward the Aurora Borealis and south toward the tropics Here individualism Andrew Jacksonism will forever prevail and American standardization can never prevail In cabins that cannot be reached by automobile and deserts that cannot be crossed by boulevards the John the Baptists the hermits and the prophets can strengthen their souls Here are lonely places as sweet for the spirit as was little old New Salem Illinois one hundred years ago or the wilderness in which walked Johnny Appleseed Now it is the independence of Spirit of this New Arabia that I hope the Denver Art Museum can interpret in its photoplay films and send them on circuits to the Art Museums springing up all over America where sculpture architecture and painting are now constantly sent on circuit Let that already established convention the circuit exhibition be applied to this new art And after Denver has shown the way I devoutly hope that Great City of Los Angeles may follow her example Consider O Great City of Los Angeles now almost the equal of New York in power and splendor consider what it would do for the souls of all your film artists if you projected just such a museum as Denver is now projecting Your fate is coming toward you Denver is halfway between Chicago with the greatest art institute in the country and Los Angeles the natural capital of the photoplay The art museums of America should rule the universities and the photoplay studios as well In the art museums should be set the final standards of civic life rather than in any musty libraries or routine classrooms And the great weapon of the art museums of all the land should be the hieroglyphic of the future the truly artistic photoplay And now for book two at length It is a detailed analysis of the films first proclaimed in nineteen fifteen and never challenged or overthrown and for the most part accepted intact by the photoplay people and the critics and the theorists as well BOOK II THE UNCHALLENGED OUTLINE OF PHOTOPLAY CRITICAL METHOD CHAPTER I THE POINT OF VIEW 
4331_88349_000006_000000	train-clean-360	While there is a great deal of literary reference in all the following argument I realize looking back over many attempts to paraphrase it for various audiences that its appeal is to those who spend the best part of their student life in classifying and judging and producing works of sculpture painting and architecture 
4331_88349_000006_000001	train-clean-360	I find the eyes of all others wandering when I make talks upon the plastic artist s point of view 
4331_88349_000007_000000	train-clean-360	This book tries to find that fourth dimension of architecture painting and sculpture which is the human soul in action that arrow with wings which is the flash of fire from the film or the heart of man or Pygmalion s image when it becomes a woman 
4331_88349_000008_000000	train-clean-360	The nineteen fifteen edition was used by Victor O Freeburg as one of the text books in the Columbia University School of Journalism in his classes in photoplay writing 
none	none	I was invited several times to address those classes on my yearly visits to New York I have addressed many other academic classes the invitation being based on this book 
4331_88349_000008_000003	train-clean-360	Now I realize that those who approach the theory from the general University standpoint or from the history of the drama had best begin with Freeburg s book for he is not only learned in both matters but presents the special analogies with skill 
none	none	Freeburg has an excellent education in the history of music and some of the happiest passages in his work relate the photoplay to the musical theory of the world as my book relates it to the general Art Museum point of view of the world Emphatically my book belongs in the Art Institutes as a beginning or in such religious and civic bodies as think architecturally 
4331_88349_000008_000006	train-clean-360	From there it must work its way out 
4331_88349_000008_000007	train-clean-360	Of course those bodies touch on a thousand others 
4331_88349_000009_000000	train-clean-360	The work is being used as one basis of the campaign for the New Denver Art Museum and I like to tell the story of how George W Eggers of Denver first began to apply the book when the Director of the Art Institute Chicago that it may not seem to the merely University type of mind a work of lost abstractions 
4331_88349_000009_000001	train-clean-360	One of the most gratifying recognitions I ever received was the invitation to talk on the films in Fullerton Hall Chicago Art Institute 
4331_88349_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Then there came invitations to speak at Chicago University and before the Fortnightly Club Chicago all around nineteen sixteen seventeen 
none	none	One difficulty was getting the film to prove my case from out the commercial whirl 
4331_88349_000009_000004	train-clean-360	I talked at these three and other places but hardly knew how to go about crossing the commercial bridge 
none	none	At last with the cooperation of Director Eggers we staged in the sacred precincts of Fullerton Hall Mae Marsh in The Wild Girl of the Sierras The film was in battered condition and was turned so fast I could not talk with it satisfactorily and fulfil the well known principles of chapter fourteen But at least I had converted one Art Institute Director to the idea that an ex student of the Institute could not only write a book about painting in motion but the painting could be shown in an Art Museum as promise of greater things in this world 
4331_88349_000009_000007	train-clean-360	It took a deal of will and breaking of precedent on the part of all concerned to show this film The Wild Girl of the Sierras and I retired from the field a long time But now this same Eggers is starting in Denver an Art Museum from its very foundations but on the same constructive scale 
4331_88349_000009_000008	train-clean-360	So this enterprise in my fond and fatuous fancy is associated with the sweet Mae Marsh as The Wild Girl of the Sierras one of the loveliest bits of poetry ever put into screen or fable 
4331_88349_000010_000000	train-clean-360	For about one year off and on I had the honor to be the photoplay critic of The New Republic this invitation also based on the first edition of this book 
none	none	Looking back upon that experience I am delighted to affirm that not only The New Republic constituency but the world of the college and the university where I moved at that time while at loss for a policy were not only willing but eager to take the films with seriousness 
4331_88349_000011_000000	train-clean-360	But when I was through with all these dashes into the field and went back to reciting verses again no one had given me any light as to who should make the disinterested non commercial film for these immediate times the film that would class in our civilization with The New Republic or The Atlantic Monthly or the poems of Edwin Arlington Robinson 
none	none	That is the production not for the trade but for the soul Anita Loos that good crusader came out several years ago with the flaming announcement that there was now hope since a school of films had been heavily endowed for the University of Rochester 
4331_88349_000011_000002	train-clean-360	The school was to be largely devoted to producing music for the photoplay in defiance of chapter fourteen 
none	none	But incidentally there were to be motion pictures made to fit good music 
4331_88349_000011_000004	train-clean-360	Neither music nor films have as yet shaken the world 
none	none	I liked this Rochester idea 
4331_88349_000012_000001	train-clean-360	I felt that once it was started the films would take their proper place and dominate the project disinterested non commercial films to be classed with the dramas so well stimulated by the great drama department under Professor Baker of Harvard 
4331_88349_000013_000000	train-clean-360	As I look back over this history I see that the printed page had counted too much and the real forces of the visible arts in America had not been definitely enlisted 
4331_88349_000013_000001	train-clean-360	They should take the lead 
none	none	I would suggest as the three people to interview first on building any Art Museum Photoplay project Victor Freeburg with his long experience of teaching the subject in Columbia and John Emerson and Anita Loos who are as brainy as people dare to be and still remain in the department store film business 
4331_88349_000013_000003	train-clean-360	No three people would more welcome opportunities to outline the idealistic possibilities of this future art 
4331_88349_000013_000004	train-clean-360	And a well known American painter was talking to me of a midnight scolding Charlie Chaplin gave to some Los Angeles producer in a little restaurant preaching the really beautiful film and denouncing commerce like a member of Coxey s illustrious army 
none	none	And I have heard rumors from all sides that Charlie Chaplin has a soul He is the comedian most often proclaimed an artist by the fastidious and most often forgiven for his slapstick 
4331_88349_000013_000007	train-clean-360	He is praised for a kind of O Henry double meaning to his antics 
4331_88349_000013_000008	train-clean-360	He is said to be like one of O Henry s misquotations of the classics 
4331_88349_000013_000009	train-clean-360	He looks to me like that artist Edgar Poe if Poe had been obliged to make millions laugh 
4331_88349_000013_000010	train-clean-360	I do not like Chaplin s work but I have to admit the good intentions and the enviable laurels 
none	none	Let all the Art Museums invite him in as tentative adviser if not a chastened performer Let him be given as good a chance as Mae Marsh was given by Eggers in Fullerton Hall Only let him come in person not in film till we hear him speak and consider his suggestions and make sure he has eaten of the mystic Amaranth Apples of Johnny Appleseed CHAPTER II THE PHOTOPLAY OF ACTION Let us assume friendly reader that it is eight o clock in the evening when you make yourself comfortable in your den to peruse this chapter I want to tell you about the Action Film the simplest the type most often seen In the mind of the habitue of the cheaper theatre it is the only sort in existence It dominates the slums is announced there by red and green posters of the melodrama sort and retains its original elements more deftly handled in places more expensive The story goes at the highest possible speed to be still credible When it is a poor thing which is the case too often the saint Vitus dance destroys the pleasure value The rhythmic quality of the picture motions is twitched to death In the bad photoplay even the picture of an express train more than exaggerates itself Yet when the photoplay chooses to behave it can reproduce a race far more joyously than the stage On that fact is based the opportunity of this form Many Action Pictures are indoors but the abstract theory of the Action Film is based on the out of door chase You remember the first one you saw where the policeman pursues the comical tramp over hill and dale and across the town lots You remember that other where the cowboy follows the horse thief across the desert spies him at last and chases him faster faster faster and faster and finally catches him If the film was made in the days before the National Board of Censorship it ends with the cowboy cheerfully hanging the villain all details given to the last kick of the deceased One of the best Action Pictures is an old Griffith Biograph recently reissued the story entitled Man s Genesis In the time when cave men gorillas had no weapons Weak Hands impersonated by Robert Harron invents the stone club He vanquishes his gorilla like rival Brute Force impersonated by Wilfred Lucas Strange but credible manners and customs of the cave men are detailed They live in picturesque caves Their half monkey gestures are wonderful to see But these things are beheld on the fly It is the chronicle of a race between the brain of Weak Hands and the body of the other symbolized by the chasing of poor Weak Hands in and out among the rocks until the climax Brain desperately triumphs Weak Hands slays Brute Force with the startling invention He wins back his stolen bride Lily White impersonated by Mae Marsh It is a Griffith masterpiece and every actor does sound work The audience mechanical Americans fond of crawling on their stomachs to tinker their automobiles are eager over the evolution of the first weapon from a stick to a hammer They are as full of curiosity as they could well be over the history of Langley or the Wright brothers The dire perils of the motion pictures provoke the ingenuity of the audience not their passionate sympathy When in the minds of the deluded producers the beholders should be weeping or sighing with desire they are prophesying the next step to one another in worldly George Ade slang This is illustrated in another good Action Photoplay the dramatization of The Spoilers The original novel was written by Rex Beach The gallant William Farnum as Glenister dominates the play He has excellent support Their team work makes them worthy of chronicle Thomas Santschi as McNamara Kathlyn Williams as Cherry Malotte Bessie Eyton as Helen Chester Frank Clark as Dextry Wheeler Oakman as Bronco Kid and Jack mc donald as Slapjack There are in The Spoilers inspiriting ocean scenes and mountain views There are interesting sketches of mining camp manners and customs There is a well acted love interest in it and the element of the comradeship of loyal pals But the chase rushes past these things to the climax as in a policeman picture it whirls past blossoming gardens and front lawns till the tramp is arrested The difficulties are commented on by the people in the audience as rah rah boys on the side lines comment on hurdles cleared or knocked over by the men running in college field day The sudden cut backs into side branches of the story are but hurdles also not plot complications in the stage sense This is as it should be The pursuit progresses without saint Vitus dance or hysteria to the end of the film There the spoilers are discomfited the gold mine is recaptured the incidental girls are won in a flash by the rightful owners These shows work like the express elevators in the Metropolitan Tower The ideal is the maximum of speed in descending or ascending not to be jolted into insensibility There are two girl parts as beautifully thought out as the parts of ladies in love can be expected to be in Action Films But in the end the love is not much more romantic in the eye of the spectator than it would be to behold a man on a motorcycle with the girl of his choice riding on the same machine behind him And the highest type of Action Picture romance is not attained by having Juliet triumph over the motorcycle handicap It is not achieved by weaving in a Sherlock Holmes plot Action Picture romance comes when each hurdle is a tableau when there is indeed an art gallery beauty in each one of these swift glimpses when it is a race but with a proper and golden linked grace from action to action and the goal is the most beautiful glimpse in the whole reel In the Action Picture there is no adequate means for the development of any full grown personal passion The distinguished character study that makes genuine the personal emotions in the legitimate drama has no chance People are but types swiftly moved chessmen More elaborate discourse on this subject may be found in chapter twelve on the differences between the films and the stage But here briefly the Action Pictures are falsely advertised as having heart interest or abounding in tragedy But though the actors glower and wrestle and even if they are the most skilful lambasters in the profession the audience gossips and chews gum Why does the audience keep coming to this type of photoplay if neither lust love hate nor hunger is adequately conveyed Simply because such spectacles gratify the incipient or rampant speed mania in every American To make the elevator go faster than the one in the Metropolitan Tower is to destroy even this emotion To elaborate unduly any of the agonies or seductions in the hope of arousing lust love hate or hunger is to produce on the screen a series of misplaced figures of the order Frankenstein How often we have been horrified by these galvanized and ogling corpses These are the things that cause the outcry for more censors It is not that our moral codes are insulted but what is far worse our nervous systems are temporarily racked to pieces These wriggling half dead men these over bloody burglars are public nuisances no worse and no better than dead cats being hurled about by street urchins The cry for more censors is but the cry for the man with the broom Sometimes it is a matter as simple as when a child is scratching with a pin on a slate While one would not have the child locked up by the chief of police after five minutes of it almost every one wants to smack him till his little jaws ache It is the very cold bloodedness of the proceeding that ruins our kindness of heart And the best Action Film is impersonal and unsympathetic even if it has no scratching pins Because it is cold blooded it must take extra pains to be tactful Cold blooded means that the hero as we see him on the screen is a variety of amiable or violent ghost Nothing makes his lack of human charm plainer than when we as audience enter the theatre at the middle of what purports to be the most passionate of scenes when the goal of the chase is unknown to us and the alleged situation appeals on its magnetic merits Here is neither the psychic telepathy of Forbes Robertson s Caesar nor the fire breath of E H Sothern s Don Quixote The audience is not worked up into the deadly still mob unity of the speaking theatre We late comers wait for the whole reel to start over and the goal to be indicated in the preliminary before we can get the least bit wrought up The prize may be a lady s heart the restoration of a lost reputation or the ownership of the patent for a churn In the more effective Action Plays it is often what would be secondary on the stage the recovery of a certain glove spade bull calf or rock quarry And to begin we are shown a clean cut picture of said glove spade bull calf or rock quarry Then when these disappear from ownership or sight the suspense continues till they are again visible on the screen in the hands of the rightful owner In brief the actors hurry through what would be tremendous passions on the stage to recover something that can be really photographed For instance there came to our town long ago a film of a fight between Federals and Confederates with the loss of many lives all for the recapture of a steam engine that took on more personality in the end than private or general on either side alive or dead It was based on the history of the very engine photographed or else that engine was given in replica The old locomotive was full of character and humor amidst the tragedy leaking steam at every orifice The original is in one of the Southern Civil War museums This engine in its capacity as a principal actor is going to be referred to more than several times in this work The highest type of Action Picture gives us neither the quality of Macbeth or Henry Fifth the Comedy of Errors or the Taming of the Shrew It gives us rather that fine and special quality that was in the ink bottle of Robert Louis Stevenson that brought about the limitations and the nobility of the stories of Kidnapped Treasure Island and the New Arabian Nights This discussion will be resumed on another plane in the eighth chapter Sculpture in Motion Having read thus far why not close the book and go round the corner to a photoplay theatre Give the preference to the cheapest one The Action Picture will be inevitable Since this chapter was written Charlie Chaplin and Douglas Fairbanks have given complete department store examples of the method especially Chaplin in the brilliantly constructed Shoulder Arms and Fairbanks in his one great piece of acting in The Three Musketeers CHAPTER III THE INTIMATE PHOTOPLAY Let us take for our platform this sentence THE MOTION PICTURE ART IS A GREAT HIGH ART NOT A PROCESS OF COMMERCIAL MANUFACTURE The people I hope to convince of this are one The great art museums of America including the people who support them in any way the people who give the current exhibitions there or attend them the art school students in the corridors below coming on in the same field two the departments of English of the history of the drama of the practice of the drama and the history and practice of art in that amazingly long list of our colleges and universities to be found for instance in the World Almanac three the critical and literary world generally Somewhere in this enormous field piled with endowments mountain high it should be possible to establish the theory and practice of the photoplay as a fine art Readers who do not care for the history of any art readers who have neither curiosity nor aspiration in regard to any of the ten or eleven muses who now dance around Apollo such shabby readers had best lay the book down now Shabby readers do not like great issues My poor little sermon is concerned with a great issue the clearing of the way for a critical standard whereby the ultimate photoplay may be judged I cannot teach office boys ways to make quick money in the movies That seems to be the delicately implied purpose of the mass of books on the photoplay subject They are indeed a sickening array Freeburg s book is one of the noble exceptions And I have paid tribute elsewhere to John Emerson and Anita Loos They have written a crusading book and many crusading articles After five years of exceedingly lonely art study in which I had always specialized in museum exhibits prowling around like a lost dog I began to intensify my museum study and at the same time shout about what I was discovering From nineteen hundred and five on I did orate my opinions to a group of advanced students We assembled weekly for several winters in the Metropolitan Museum New York for the discussion of the masterpieces in historic order from Egypt to America From that standpoint the work least often found hardest to make least popular in the street may be in the end the one most treasured in a world museum as a counsellor and stimulus of mankind Throughout this book I try to bring to bear the same simple standards of form composition mood and motive that we used in finding the fundamental exhibits the standards which are taken for granted in art histories and schools radical or conservative anywhere Again we assume it is eight o clock in the evening friend reader when the chapter begins Just as the Action Picture has its photographic basis or fundamental metaphor in the long chase down the highway so the Intimate Film has its photographic basis in the fact that any photoplay interior has a very small ground plan and the cosiest of enclosing walls Many a worth while scene is acted out in a space no bigger than that which is occupied by an office boy s stool and hat If there is a table in this room it is often so near it is half out of the picture or perhaps it is against the front line of the triangular ground plan Only the top of the table is seen and nothing close up to us is pictured below that We in the audience are privileged characters Generally attending the show in bunches of two or three we are members of the household on the screen Sometimes we are sitting on the near side of the family board Or we are gossiping whispering neighbors of the shoemaker we will say with our noses pressed against the pane of a metaphoric window Take for contrast the old fashioned stage production showing the room and work table of a shoemaker As it were the whole side of the house has been removed The shop is as big as a banquet hall There is something essentially false in what we see no matter how the stage manager fills in with old boxes broken chairs and the like But the photoplay interior is the size such a work room should be And there the awl and pegs and bits of leather speaking the silent language of picture writing can be clearly shown They are sometimes like the engine in chapter two the principal actors Though the Intimate and friendly Photoplay may be carried out of doors to the row of loafers in front of the country store or the gossiping streets of the village it takes its origin and theory from the snugness of the interior The restless reader replies that he has seen photoplays that showed ballrooms that were grandiose not the least cosy These are to be classed as out of door scenery so far as theory goes and are to be discussed under the head of Splendor Pictures Masses of human beings pour by like waves the personalities of none made plain The only definite people are the hero and heroine in the foreground and maybe one other Though these three be in ball costume the little triangle they occupy next to the camera is in sort an interior while the impersonal guests behind them conform to the pageant principles of out of doors and the dancers are to the main actor as is the wind shaken forest to the charcoal burner or the bending grain to the reaper The Intimate Motion Picture is the world s new medium for studying not the great passions such as black hate transcendent love devouring ambition but rather the half relaxed or gently restrained moods of human creatures It gives also our idiosyncrasies It is gossip in extremis It is apt to chronicle our petty little skirmishes rather than our feuds In it Colin Clout and his comrades return The Intimate Photoplay should not crowd its characters It should not choke itself trying to dramatize the whole big bloody plot of Lorna Doone or any other novel with a dozen leading people Yet some gentle episode from the John Ridd farm some half chapter when Lorna and the Doones are almost forgotten would be fitting Let the duck yard be parading its best and Annie among the milk pails her work for the evening well nigh done The Vicar of Wakefield has his place in this form The Intimate and friendly Motion Picture might very well give humorous moments in the lives of the great King Alfred burning the cakes and other legendary incidents of him Plato s writings give us glimpses of Socrates in between the long dialogues And there are intimate scraps in Plutarch Prospective author producer do you remember Landor s Imaginary Conversations and Lang s Letters to Dead Authors Can you not attain to that informal understanding in pictorial delineations of such people The photoplay has been unjust to itself in comedies The late John Bunny s important place in my memory comes from the first picture in which I saw him It is a story of high life below stairs The hero is the butler at a governor s reception John Bunny s work as this man is a delightful piece of acting The servants are growing tipsier downstairs but the more afraid of the chief functionary every time he appears frozen into sobriety by his glance At the last moment this god of the basement catches them at their worst and gives them a condescending but forgiving smile The lid comes off completely He himself has been imbibing His surviving dignity in waiting on the governor s guests is worthy of the stage of Goldsmith and Sheridan This film should be reissued in time as a Bunny memorial So far as my experience has gone the best of the comedians is Sidney Drew He could shine in the atmosphere of Pride and Prejudice or Cranford But the best things I have seen of his are far from such I beg the pardon of Miss Jane Austen and missus Gaskell while I mention Who s Who in Hogg s Hollow and A Regiment of Two Over these I rejoiced like a yokel with a pocketful of butterscotch and peanuts The opportunities to laugh on a higher plane than this to laugh like Olympians are seldom given us in this world The most successful motion picture drama of the intimate type ever placed before mine eyes was Enoch Arden produced by Cabanne Lillian Gish takes the part of Annie Alfred Paget impersonates Enoch Arden and Wallace Reid takes the part of Philip Ray The play is in four reels of twenty minutes each It should have been made into three reels by shortening every scene just a bit Otherwise it is satisfying and I and my friends have watched it through many times as it has returned to Springfield The mood of the original poem is approximated The story is told with fireside friendliness The pale Lillian Gish surrounded by happy children gives us many a genre painting on the theme of domesticity It is a photographic rendering in many ways as fastidious as Tennyson s versification The scenes on the desert island are some of them commonplace The shipwreck and the like remind one of other photoplays but the rest of the production has a mood of its own Seen several months ago it fills my eye imagination and eye memory more than that particular piece of Tennyson s fills word imagination and word memory Perhaps this is because it is pleasing to me as a theorist It is a sound example of the type of film to which this chapter is devoted If you cannot get your local manager to bring Enoch Arden reread that poem of Tennyson s and translate it in your own mind s eye into a gallery of six hundred delicately toned photographs hung in logical order most of them cosy interior scenes some of the faces five feet from chin to forehead in the more personal episodes yet exquisitely fair Fill in the out of door scenes and general gatherings with the appointments of an idyllic English fisher village and you will get an approximate conception of what we mean by the Intimate and friendly Motion Picture or the Intimate Picture as I generally call it for convenience It is a quality not a defect of all photoplays that human beings tend to become dolls and mechanisms and dolls and mechanisms tend to become human But the haughty who scorn the moving pictures cannot rid themselves of the feeling that they are being seduced into going into some sort of a Punch and Judy show And they think that of course one should not take seriously anything so cheap in price and so appealing to the cross roads taste But it is very well to begin in the Punch and Judy show state of mind and reconcile ourselves to it and then like good democrats await discoveries Punch and Judy is the simplest form of marionette performance and the marionette has a place in every street in history just as the dolls house has its corner in every palace and cottage The French in particular have had their great periods of puppet shows and the Italian tradition survived in America s Little Italy in New York for many a day and I will mention in passing that one of Pavlowa s unforgettable dance dramas is The Fairy Doll Prospective author producer why not spend a deal of energy on the photoplay successors of the puppet plays We have the queen of the marionettes already without the play One description of the Intimate and friendly Comedy would be the Mary Pickford kind of a story None has as yet appeared But we know the Mary Pickford mood When it is gentlest most roguish most exalted it is a prophecy of what this type should be not only in the actress but in the scenario and setting Mary Pickford can be a doll a village belle or a church angel Her powers as a doll are hinted at in the title of the production Such a Little Queen I remember her when she was a village belle in that film that came out before producers or actors were known by name It was sugar sweet It was called What the Daisy Said If these productions had conformed to their titles sincerely with the highest photoplay art we would have had two more examples for this chapter Why do the people love Mary Not on account of the Daniel Frohman style of handling her appearances He presents her to us in what are almost the old fashioned stage terms the productions energetic and full of painstaking detail but dominated by a dream that is a theatrical hybrid It is neither good moving picture nor good stage play Yet Mary could be cast as a cloudy Olympian or a church angel if her managers wanted her to be such She herself was transfigured in the Dawn of Tomorrow but the film version of that play was merely a well mounted melodrama Why do the people love Mary Because of a certain aspect of her face in her highest mood Botticelli painted her portrait many centuries ago when by some necromancy she appeared to him in this phase of herself There is in the Chicago Art Institute at the top of the stairs on the north wall a noble copy of a fresco by that painter the copy by missus MacMonnies It is very near the Winged Victory of Samothrace In the picture the muses sit enthroned The loveliest of them all is a startling replica of Mary The people are hungry for this fine and spiritual thing that Botticelli painted in the faces of his muses and heavenly creatures Because the mob catch the very glimpse of it in Mary s face they follow her night after night in the films They are never quite satisfied with the plays because the managers are not artists enough to know they should sometimes put her into sacred pictures and not have her always the village hoyden in plays not even hoydenish But perhaps in this argument I have but betrayed myself as Mary s infatuated partisan So let there be recorded here the name of another actress who is always in the intimate and friendly mood and adapted to close up interiors Marguerite Clark She is endowed by nature to act in the same film the eight year old village pet the irrepressible sixteen year old and finally the shining bride of twenty But no production in which she acts that has happened to come under my eye has done justice to these possibilities The transitions from one of these stages to the other are not marked by the producer with sufficient delicate graduation emphasis and contrast Her plots have been but sugared nonsense or swashbuckling ups and downs She shines in a bevy of girls She has sometimes been given the bevy But it is easier to find performers who fit this chapter than to find films Having read so far it is probably not quite nine o clock in the evening Go around the corner to the nearest theatre You will not be apt to find a pure example of the Intimate and friendly Moving Picture but some one or two scenes will make plain the intent of the phrase Imagine the most winsome tableau that passes before you extended logically through one or three reels with no melodramatic interruptions or awful smashes For a further discussion of these smashes and other items in this chapter read the ninth chapter entitled Painting in Motion CHAPTER IV THE MOTION PICTURE OF FAIRY SPLENDOR Again kind reader let us assume it is eight o clock in the evening for purposes of future climax which you no doubt anticipate Just as the Action Motion Picture has its photographic basis in the race down the high road just as the Intimate Motion Picture has its photographic basis in the close up interior scene so the Photoplay of Splendor in its four forms is based on the fact that the kinetoscope can take in the most varied of out of door landscapes It can reproduce fairy dells It can give every ripple of the lily pond It can show us cathedrals within and without It can take in the panorama of cyclopaean cloud bending forest storm hung mountain In like manner it can put on the screen great impersonal mobs of men It can give us tremendous armies moving as oceans move The pictures of Fairy Splendor Crowd Splendor Patriotic Splendor and Religious Splendor are but the embodiments of these backgrounds And a photographic corollary quite useful in these four forms is that the camera has a kind of Hallowe en witch power This power is the subject of this chapter The world old legends and revelations of men in connection with the lovely out of doors or lonely shrines or derived from inspired crusading humanity moving in masses can now be fitly retold Also the fairy wand can do its work the little dryad can come from the tree And the spirits that guard the Republic can be seen walking on the clouds above the harvest fields But we are concerned with the humblest voodooism at present Perhaps the world s oldest motion picture plot is a tale in Mother Goose It ends somewhat in this fashion The old lady said to the cat Cat cat kill rat Rat will not gnaw rope Rope will not hang butcher Butcher will not kill ox Ox will not drink water Water will not quench fire Fire will not burn stick Stick will not beat dog Dog will not bite pig Pig will not jump over the stile And I cannot get home to night By some means the present writer does not remember the cat was persuaded to approach the rat The rest was like a tale of European diplomacy The rat began to gnaw the rope The rope began to hang the butcher The butcher began to kill the ox The ox began to drink the water The water began to quench the fire The fire began to burn the stick The stick began to beat the dog The dog began to bite the pig The frightened little pig jumped over the stile And the old lady was able to get home that night Put yourself back to the state of mind in which you enjoyed this bit of verse Though the photoplay fairy tale may rise to exquisite heights it begins with pictures akin to this rhyme Mankind in his childhood has always wanted his furniture to do such things Arthur names his blade Excalibur It becomes a person The man in the Arabian tale speaks to the magic carpet It carries him whithersoever he desires This yearning for personality in furniture begins to be crudely worked upon in the so called trick scenes The typical commercialized comedy of this sort is Moving Day Lyman H Howe among many excellent reels of a different kind has films allied to Moving Day But let us examine at this point as even more typical an old Pathe Film from France The representatives of the moving firm are sent for They appear in the middle of the room with an astonishing jump They are told that this household desires to have its goods and hearthstone gods transplanted two streets east The agents salute They disappear Yet their wireless orders are obeyed with a military crispness The books and newspapers climb out of the window They go soberly down the street In their wake are the dishes from the table Then the more delicate porcelains climb down the shelves and follow Then follow the hobble de hoy kitchen dishes then the chairs then the clothing and the carpets from over the house The most joyous and curious spectacle is to behold the shoes walking down the boulevard from father s large boots to those of the youngest child They form a complete satire of the family yet have a masterful air of their own as though they were the most important part of a human being The new apartment is shown Everything enters in procession In contrast to the general certainty of the rest one or two pieces of furniture grow confused trying to find their places A plate in leaping upon a high shelf misses and falls broken The broom and dustpan sweep up the pieces and consign them to the dustbin Then the human family comes in delighted to find everything in order The moving agents appear and salute They are paid their fee They salute again and disappear with another gigantic leap The ability to do this kind of a thing is fundamental in the destinies of the art Yet this resource is neglected because its special province is not understood People do not like to be tricked the manager says Certainly they become tired of mere contraptions But they never grow weary of imagination There is possible many a highly imaginative fairy tale on this basis if we revert to the sound principles of the story of the old lady and the pig Moving Day is at present too crassly material It has not the touch of the creative imagination We are overwhelmed with a whole van of furniture Now the mechanical or non human object beginning with the engine in the second chapter is apt to be the hero in most any sort of photoplay while the producer remains utterly unconscious of the fact Why not face this idiosyncrasy of the camera and make the non human object the hero indeed Not by filling the story with ropes buckets fire brands and sticks but by having these four unique Make the fire the loveliest of torches the water the most graceful of springs Let the rope be the humorist Let the stick be the outstanding hero the D Artagnan of the group full of queer gestures and hoppings about Let him be both polite and obdurate Finally let him beat the dog most heroically Then after the purely trick picture is disciplined till it has fewer tricks and those more human and yet more fanciful the producer can move on up into the higher realms of the fairy tale carrying with him this riper workmanship Mabel Taliaferro s Cinderella seen long ago is the best film fairy tale the present writer remembers It has more of the fireside wonder spirit and Hallowe en witch spirit than the Cinderella of Mary Pickford There is a Japanese actor Sessue Hayakawa who takes the leading part with Blanche Sweet in The Clew and is the hero in the film version of The Typhoon He looks like all the actors in the old Japanese prints He has a general dramatic equipment which enables him to force through the stubborn screen such stagy plays as these that are more worth while in the speaking theatre But he has that atmosphere of pictorial romance which would make him a valuable man for the retelling of the old Japanese legends of Kwannon and other tales that are rich unused moving picture material tales such as have been hinted at in the gleaming English of Lafcadio Hearn The Japanese genius is eminently pictorial Rightly viewed every Japanese screen or bit of lacquer is from the Ancient Asia Columbus set sail to find It would be a noble thing if American experts in the Japanese principles of decoration of the school of Arthur W Dow should tell stories of old Japan with the assistance of such men as Sessue Hayakawa Such things go further than peace treaties Dooming a talent like that of mister Hayakawa to the task of interpreting the Japanese spy does not conduce to accord with Japan however the technique may move us to admiration Let such of us as are at peace get together and tell the tales of our happy childhood to one another This chapter is ended You will of course expect to be exhorted to visit some photoplay emporium But you need not look for fairy tales They are much harder to find than they should be But you can observe even in the advertisements and cartoons the technical elements of the story of the old lady and the pig And you can note several other things that show how much more quickly than on the stage the borderline of All Saints Day and Hallowe en can be crossed Note how easily memories are called up and appear in the midst of the room In any plays whatever you will find these apparitions and recollections The dullest hero is given glorious visualizing power Note the fadeaway at the beginning and the end of the reel whereby all things emerge from the twilight and sink back into the twilight at last These are some of the indestructible least common denominators of folk stories old and new When skilfully used they can all exercise a power over the audience such as the crystal has over the crystal gazer But this discussion will be resumed on another plane in the tenth chapter Furniture Trappings and Inventions in Motion CHAPTER V THE PICTURE OF CROWD SPLENDOR Henceforth the reader will use his discretion as to when he will read the chapter 
25-88353-0001	train-other-500	and when he will go to the picture show to verify it The shoddiest silent drama may contain noble views of the sea This part is almost sure to be good It is a fundamental resource
none	none	 A special development of this aptitude in the hands of an expert gives the sea of humanity not metaphorically but literally the whirling of dancers in ballrooms handkerchief waving masses of people in balconies hat waving political ratification meetings 
25-88353-0002	train-other-500	ragged glowering strikers and gossiping dickering people in the marketplace Only Griffith and his close disciples can do these as well as almost any manager can reproduce the ocean
25-88353-0003	train-other-500	Yet the sea of humanity is dramatically blood brother to the Pacific Atlantic or Mediterranean
none	none	 It takes this new invention the kinetoscope 
25-88353-0004	train-other-500	to bring us these panoramic drama elements By the law of compensation while the motion picture is shallow in showing private passion it is powerful in conveying the passions of masses of men Bernard Shaw
none	none	 in a recent number of the Metropolitan 
25-88353-0005	train-other-500	answered several questions in regard to the photoplay Here are two bits from his discourse Strike the dialogue from Moliere s Tartuffe and what audience would bear its mere stage business
none	none	 Imagine the scene in which Iago poisons Othello s mind against Desdemona conveyed in dumb show 
25-88353-0006	train-other-500	What becomes of the difference between Shakespeare and Sheridan Knowles in the film Or between Shakespeare s Lear and any one else s Lear No it seems to me that all the interest lies in the new opening
none	none	 for the mass of dramatic talent 
25-88353-0007	train-other-500	formerly disabled by incidental deficiencies of one sort or another that do not matter in the picture theatre
none	none	 Failures of the spoken drama may become the stars of the picture palace And there are the authors with imagination visualization and first rate verbal gifts 
25-88353-0008	train-other-500	who can write novels and epics but cannot for the life of them write plays Well the film lends itself admirably to the succession of events proper to narrative and epic but physically
25-88353-0009	train-other-500	impracticable on the stage Paradise Lost would make a far better film than Ibsen s John Gabriel Borkman though Borkman is a dramatic masterpiece and Milton could not write an effective play
25-88353-0010	train-other-500	Note in especial what Shaw says about narrative epic and Paradise Lost He has in mind no doubt the pouring hosts of demons and angels This is
25-88353-0011	train-other-500	one kind of a Crowd Picture
none	none	 There is another sort to be seen where George Beban 
25-88353-0012	train-other-500	impersonates The Italian in a film of that title by Thomas H Ince and G Gardener Sullivan The first part taken ostensibly in Venice delineates the festival spirit of the people on the bridges
25-88353-0013	train-other-500	and in gondolas It gives out the atmosphere of town crowd happiness
none	none	 Then comes the vineyard the crowd sentiment of 
25-88353-0014	train-other-500	a merry grape harvest then the
none	none	 massed emotion of many people embarking on an Atlantic liner 
25-88353-0015	train-other-500	telling good by to their kindred on the piers then the drama of arrival in New York The wonder of the steerage people pouring down their proper gangway is contrasted with the conventional
none	none	 at home ness of the first class passengers above Then we behold the seething human cauldron of the East Side then the jolly little wedding dance then the life of the East Side from the policeman to the peanut man and including the bar tender for the crowd is treated on two separate occasions It is hot weather The mobs of children follow the ice wagon for chips of ice 
25-88353-0016	train-other-500	They besiege the fountain end of the street sprinkling wagon quite closely rejoicing to have their clothes soaked They gather round the fire plug that is turned on for their benefit and again become wet as drowned rats Passing through these crowds
none	none	 are George Beban 
25-88353-0017	train-other-500	and Clara Williams as The Italian and his sweetheart They owe the force of their acting to the fact that they express each mass of humanity in turn Their child is born It does not flourish
25-88353-0018	train-other-500	It represents in an acuter way another phase of the same child struggle with the heat that the gamins indicate in their pursuit of the water cart Then a deeper matter
none	none	 The hero represents in a fashion the adventures of the whole Italian race coming to America its natural southern gayety set in contrast to the 
25-88353-0019	train-other-500	drab East Side The gondolier becomes boot black The grape gathering peasant girl becomes the suffering slum mother They are not specialized characters like Pendennis or Becky Sharp in the Novels of Thackeray
none	none	 Omitting the last episode the entrance into the house of Corrigan The Italian is a strong piece of work Another kind of Crowd Picture is The Battle 
25-88353-0020	train-other-500	an old Griffith Biograph first issued in nineteen eleven before Griffith s name or that of any actor in films was advertised Blanche Sweet is the leading lady and Charles H West the leading man
25-88353-0021	train-other-500	The psychology of a bevy of village lovers is conveyed in a lively sweet hearting dance Then the boy and his comrades go forth to war The lines pass between hand waving crowds of friends
none	none	 from the entire neighborhood 
25-88353-0022	train-other-500	These friends give the sense of patriotism in mass Then as the consequence of this feeling as the special agents to express it the soldiers are in battle By the fortunes of war
25-88353-0023	train-other-500	the onset is unexpectedly near to the house where once was the dance The boy is at first a coward He enters the old familiar door He appeals to the girl to hide him
25-88353-0024	train-other-500	and for the time breaks her heart He goes forth a fugitive not only from battle but from her terrible girlish anger But later he rallies He
25-88353-0025	train-other-500	brings a train of powder wagons through fires built in his path by the enemy s scouts He loses every one of his men and all but the last wagon which he drives himself His return with that ammunition saves the hard fought day
none	none	 And through all this 
25-88353-0026	train-other-500	glimpses of the battle are given with a splendor that only Griffith has attained Blanche Sweet
none	none	 stands as the representative of the bevy of girls in the house of the dance 
25-88353-0027	train-other-500	and the whole body social of the village How the costumes flash and the handkerchiefs wave around her
none	none	 In the battle the hero represents the cowardice that all the men are resisting within themselves When he returns he is the incarnation of the hardihood they have all hoped to display 
25-88353-0028	train-other-500	Only the girl knows he was first a failure The wounded general honors him as the hero above all Now she is radiant she cannot help but be triumphant
25-88353-0029	train-other-500	though the side of the house is blown out by a shell and the dying are everywhere This one reel work of art has been reissued of late by the Biograph Company
25-88353-0030	train-other-500	It should be kept in the libraries of the Universities as a standard One reel films are unfortunate in this sense that in order to see a favorite the student must wait
25-88353-0031	train-other-500	through five other reels of a mixed programme that usually is bad That is the reason one reel masterpieces seldom appear now The producer in a mood to make a special effort
none	none	 wants to feel that he has the entire evening and that nothing before or after is going to be a bore or destroy the impression So at present the painstaking films are apt to be five or six reels 
25-88353-0032	train-other-500	of twenty minutes each These have the advantage that if they please at all one can see them again at once without
none	none	 sitting through irrelevant slapstick work put there to fill out the time But now having the whole evening to work in the producer takes too much time for his good ideas 
25-88353-0033	train-other-500	I shall reiterate throughout this work the necessity for restraint A one hour programme is long enough for any one If the observer is pleased he will sit it through again and take another hour
25-88353-0034	train-other-500	There is not a good film in the world but is the better for being seen in immediate succession to itself Six reel programmes are a weariness to the flesh The best of the old one reel Biographs of Griffith
25-88353-0035	train-other-500	contained more in twenty minutes than these ambitious incontinent six reel displays give us in two hours
none	none	 It would pay a manager to hang out a sign This show is only twenty minutes long 
25-88353-0036	train-other-500	but it is Griffith s great film The Battle
none	none	 But I am digressing 
25-88353-0037	train-other-500	To continue the contrast between private passion in the theatre and crowd passion in the photoplay let us turn to Shaw again Consider his illustration of Iago Othello and Lear These parts as he implies
25-88353-0038	train-other-500	would fall flat in motion pictures The minor situations of dramatic intensity might in many cases be built up The crisis would inevitably fail Iago and Othello and Lear
none	none	 whatever their offices in their governments 
25-88353-0039	train-other-500	are essentially private persons individuals in extremis If you go to a motion picture and feel yourself suddenly gripped by the highest dramatic tension as on the old stage and reflect afterward that it was a fight between only
none	none	 two or three men in a room otherwise empty 
25-88353-0040	train-other-500	stop to analyze what they stood for
none	none	 They were probably representatives of groups or races 
25-88353-0041	train-other-500	that had been pursuing each other earlier in the film Otherwise the conflict however violent appealed mainly to the sense of speed So
25-88353-0042	train-other-500	in The Birth of a Nation which could better be called The Overthrow of Negro Rule the Ku Klux Klan dashes down the road as powerfully as Niagara pours over the cliff Finally the white girl Elsie Stoneman
25-88353-0043	train-other-500	impersonated by Lillian Gish is rescued by the Ku Klux Klan from the mulatto politician Silas Lynch impersonated by George Seigmann The lady is brought forward as a typical helpless white maiden
none	none	 The white leader colonel Ben Cameron 
25-88353-0044	train-other-500	impersonated by Henry B Walthall enters not as an individual but as representing the whole Anglo Saxon Niagara He has the mask of the Ku Klux Klan on his face
25-88353-0045	train-other-500	till the crisis has passed The wrath of the Southerner against the blacks and their Northern organizers has been piled up through many previous scenes
none	none	 As a result this rescue is a real climax 
25-88353-0046	train-other-500	something the photoplays that trace strictly personal hatreds cannot achieve The Birth of a Nation is a Crowd Picture in a triple sense On the films as in the audience
25-88353-0047	train-other-500	it turns the crowd into a mob that is either for or against the Reverend Thomas Dixon s poisonous hatred of the negro Griffith is a chameleon in interpreting his authors Wherever the scenario shows traces of The Clansman
25-88353-0048	train-other-500	the original book by Thomas Dixon it is bad Wherever it is unadulterated Griffith which is half the time it is good The Reverend Thomas Dixon is a rather stagy Simon Legree in his avowed views a
none	none	 deal like the gentleman with the spiritual 
25-88353-0049	train-other-500	hydrophobia in the latter end of Uncle Tom s Cabin Unconsciously mister Dixon has done his best to prove that Legree was not a fictitious character
none	none	 Joel Chandler Harris Harry Stillwell Edwards George W Cable Thomas Nelson Page James Lane Allen and Mark Twain are Southern men in mister Griffith s class 
25-88353-0050	train-other-500	I recommend their works to him as a better basis for future Southern scenarios The Birth of a Nation has been very properly denounced for its Simon Legree qualities by Francis Hackett Jane Addams and others
25-88353-0051	train-other-500	But it is still true that it is a wonder in its Griffith sections In its handling of masses of men it further illustrates the principles that made notable the old one reel Battle film described in the beginning of this chapter
25-88353-0052	train-other-500	The Battle in the end is greater because of its self possession and concentration all packed into twenty minutes When in The Birth of a Nation Lincoln
none	none	 impersonated by Joseph Henabery 
25-88353-0053	train-other-500	goes down before the assassin it is a master scene He falls as the representative of the government and a thousand high and noble crowd aspirations The mimic audience in the restored Ford s Theatre rises in panic
25-88353-0054	train-other-500	This crowd is interpreted in especial for us
none	none	 by the two young people 
25-88353-0055	train-other-500	in the seats nearest and the freezing horror of the treason sweeps from the Ford s Theatre audience to the real audience beyond them The real crowd touched with terror beholds its natural face
25-88353-0056	train-other-500	in the glass Later
none	none	 come the pictures of the rioting negroes in the streets of the Southern town

none	none	 entitled The Substitute for the Saloon CHAPTER VI PATRIOTIC SPLENDOR The Patriotic Picture need not necessarily be in terms of splendor It generally is Beginning the chronicle is one that waves no banners The Typhoon a film produced by Thomas H Ince is a story of the Japanese love of Nippon in which a very little of the landscape of the nation is shown and that in the beginning The hero acted by Sessue Hayakawa living in the heart of Paris represents the far off Empire He is making a secret military report He is a responsible member of a colony of Japanese gentlemen The bevy of them appear before or after his every important action He still represents this crowd when alone The unfortunate Parisian heroine unable to fathom the mystery of the fanatical hearts of the colony ventures to think that her love for the Japanese hero and his equally great devotion to her is the important human relation on the horizon She flouts his obscure work pits her charms against it In the end there is a quarrel The irresistible meets the immovable and in madness or half by accident he kills the girl The youth is protected by the colony for he alone can make the report He is the machine like representative of the Japanese patriotic formula till the document is complete A new arrival in the colony who obviously cannot write the book confesses the murder and is executed The other high fanatic dies soon after of a broken heart with the completed manuscript volume in his hand The one impression of the play is that Japanese patriotism is a peculiar and fearful thing The particular quality of the private romance is but vaguely given for such things in their rise and culmination can only be traced by the novelist or by the gentle alternations of silence and speech on the speaking stage aided by the hot blood of players actually before us Here as in most photoplays the attempted lover conversations in pantomime are but indifferent things The details of the hero s last quarrel with the heroine and the precise thoughts that went with it are muffled by the inability to speak The power of the play is in the adequate style the man represents the colony Sessue Hayakawa should give us Japanese tales more adapted to the films We should have stories of Iyeyasu and Hideyoshi written from the ground up for the photoplay theatre We should have the story of the Forty seven Ronin not a Japanese stage version but a work from the source material We should have legends of the various clans picturizations of the code of the Samurai The Typhoon is largely indoors But the Patriotic Motion Picture is generally a landscape This is for deeper reasons than that it requires large fields in which to manoeuvre armies Flags are shown for other causes than that they are the nominal signs of a love of the native land In a comedy of the history of a newspaper the very columns of the publication are actors and may be photographed oftener than the human hero And in the higher realms this same tendency gives particular power to the panorama and trappings It makes the natural and artificial magnificence more than a narrative more than a color scheme something other than a drama In a photoplay by a master when the American flag is shown the thirteen stripes are columns of history and the stars are headlines The woods and the templed hills are their printing press almost in a literal sense Going back to the illustration of the engine in chapter two the non human thing is a personality even if it is not beautiful When it takes on the ritual of decorative design this new vitality is made seductive and when it is an object of nature this seductive ritual becomes a new pantheism The armies upon the mountains they are defending are rooted in the soil like trees They resist invasion with the same elementary stubbornness with which the oak resists the storm or the cliff resists the wave Let the reader consider Antony and Cleopatra the Cines film It was brought to America from Italy by George Klein This and several ambitious spectacles like it are direct violations of the foregoing principles True it glorifies Rome It is equivalent to waving the Italian above the Egyptian flag quite slowly for two hours From the stage standpoint the magnificence is thoroughgoing Viewed as a circus the acting is elephantine in its grandeur All that is needed is pink lemonade sold in the audience The famous Cabiria a tale of war between Rome and Carthage by D Annunzio is a prime example of a success where Antony and Cleopatra and many European films founded upon the classics have been failures With obvious defects as a producer D Annunzio appreciates spectacular symbolism He has an instinct for the strange and the beautifully infernal as they are related to decorative design Therefore he is able to show us Carthage indeed He has an Italian patriotism that amounts to frenzy So Rome emerges body and soul from the past in this spectacle He gives us the cruelty of Baal the intrepidity of the Roman legions Everything Punic or Italian in the middle distance or massed background speaks of the very genius of the people concerned and actively generates their kind of lightning The principals do not carry out the momentum of this immense resource The half a score of leading characters with the costumes gestures and aspects of gods are after all works of the taxidermist They are stuffed gods They conduct a silly nickelodeon romance while Carthage rolls on toward her doom They are like sparrows fighting for grain on the edge of the battle The doings of his principals are sufficiently evident to be grasped with a word or two of printed insert on the films But he sentimentalizes about them He adds side elaborations of the plot that would require much time to make clear and a hard working novelist to make interesting We are sentenced to stop and gaze long upon this array of printing in the darkness just at the moment the tenth wave of glory seems ready to sweep in But one hundred words cannot be a photoplay climax The climax must be in a tableau that is to the eye as the rising sun itself that follows the thousand flags of the dawn In the New York performance and presumably in other large cities there was also an orchestra Behold then one layer of great photoplay one layer of bad melodrama one layer of explanation and a final cement of music It is as though in an art museum there should be a man at the door selling would be masterly short stories about the paintings and a man with a violin playing the catalogue But for further discourse on the orchestra read the fourteenth chapter I left Cabiria with mixed emotions And I had to forget the distressful eye strain Few eyes submit without destruction to three hours of film But the mistakes of Cabiria are those of the pioneer work of genius It has in it twenty great productions It abounds in suggestions Once the classic rules of this art unit are established men with equal genius with D Annunzio and no more devotion will give us the world s masterpieces As it is the background and mass movements must stand as monumental achievements in vital patriotic splendor D Annunzio is Griffith s most inspired rival in these things He lacks Griffith s knowledge of what is photoplay and what is not He lacks Griffith s simplicity of hurdle race plot He lacks his avalanche like action The Italian needs the American s health and clean winds He needs his foregrounds leading actors and types of plot But the American has never gone as deep as the Italian into landscapes that are their own tragedians and into Satanic and celestial ceremonials Judith of Bethulia and The Battle Hymn of the Republic have impressed me as the two most significant photoplays I have ever encountered They may be classed with equal justice as religious or patriotic productions But for reasons which will appear The Battle Hymn of the Republic will be classed as a film of devotion and Judith as a patriotic one The latter was produced by D W Griffith and released by the Biograph Company in nineteen fourteen The original stage drama was once played by the famous Boston actress Nance O Neil It is the work of Thomas Bailey Aldrich The motion picture scenario when Griffith had done with it had no especial Aldrich flavor though it contained several of the characters and events as Aldrich conceived them It was principally the old apocryphal story plus the genius of Griffith and that inner circle of players whom he has endowed with much of his point of view This is his cast of characters Judith Blanche Sweet Holofernes Henry Walthall His servant J J Lance Captain of the Guards H Hyde Judith s maid Miss Bruce General of the Jews C H Mailes Priests Messrs Oppleman and Lestina Nathan Robert Harron Naomi Mae Marsh Keeper of the slaves for Holofernes Alfred Paget The Jewish mother Lillian Gish The Biograph Company advertises the production with the following Barnum and Bailey enumeration In four parts Produced in California Most expensive Biograph ever produced More than one thousand people and about three hundred horsemen The following were built expressly for the production a replica of the ancient city of Bethulia the mammoth wall that protected Bethulia a faithful reproduction of the ancient army camps embodying all their barbaric splendor and dances chariots battering rams scaling ladders archer towers and other special war paraphernalia of the period The following spectacular effects the storming of the walls of the city of Bethulia the hand to hand conflicts the death defying chariot charges at break neck speed the rearing and plunging horses infuriated by the din of battle the wonderful camp of the terrible Holofernes equipped with rugs brought from the far East the dancing girls in their exhibition of the exquisite and peculiar dances of the period the routing of the command of the terrible Holofernes and the destruction of the camp by fire And overshadowing all the heroism of the beautiful Judith This advertisement should be compared with the notice of Your Girl and Mine transcribed in the seventeenth chapter But there is another point of view by which this Judith of Bethulia production may be approached however striking the advertising notice There are four sorts of scenes alternated one the particular history of Judith two the gentle courtship of Nathan and Naomi types of the inhabitants of Bethulia three pictures of the streets with the population flowing like a sluggish river four scenes of raid camp and battle interpolated between these tying the whole together The real plot is the balanced alternation of all the elements So many minutes of one then so many minutes of another As was proper very little of the tale was thrown on the screen in reading matter and no climax was ever a printed word but always an enthralling tableau The particular history of Judith begins with the picture of her as the devout widow She is austerely garbed at prayer for her city in her own quiet house Then later she is shown decked for the eyes of man in the camp of Holofernes where all is Assyrian glory Judith struggles between her unexpected love for the dynamic general and the resolve to destroy him that brought her there In either type of scene the first gray and silver the other painted with Paul Veronese splendor Judith moves with a delicate deliberation Over her face the emotions play like winds on a meadow lake Holofernes is the composite picture of all the Biblical heathen chieftains His every action breathes power He is an Assyrian bull a winged lion and a god at the same time and divine honors are paid to him every moment Nathan and Naomi are two Arcadian lovers In their shy meetings they express the life of the normal Bethulia They are seen among the reapers outside the city or at the well near the wall or on the streets of the ancient town They are generally doing the things the crowd behind them is doing meanwhile evolving their own little heart affair Finally when the Assyrian comes down like a wolf on the fold the gentle Naomi becomes a prisoner in Holofernes camp She is in the foreground a representative of the crowd of prisoners Nathan is photographed on the wall as the particular defender of the town in whom we are most interested The pictures of the crowd s normal activities avoid jerkiness and haste They do not abound in the boresome self conscious quietude that some producers have substituted for the usual twitching Each actor in the assemblies has a refreshing equipment in gentle gesticulation for the manners and customs of Bethulia must needs be different from those of America Though the population moves together as a river each citizen is quite preoccupied To the furthest corner of the picture they are egotistical as human beings The elder goes by in theological conversation with his friend He thinks his theology is important The mother goes by all absorbed in her child To her it is the only child in the world Alternated with these scenes is the terrible rush of the Assyrian army on to exploration battle and glory The speed of their setting out becomes actual because it is contrasted with the deliberation of the Jewish town At length the Assyrians are along those hills and valleys and below the wall of defence The population is on top of the battlements beating them back the more desperately because they are separated from the water supply the wells in the fields where once the lovers met In a lull in the siege by a connivance of the elders Judith is let out of a little door in the wall And while the fortune of her people is most desperate she is shown in the quiet shelter of the tent of Holofernes Sinuous in grace tranced passionately in love she has forgotten her peculiar task She is in a sense Bethulia itself the race of Israel made over into a woman while Holofernes is the embodiment of the besieging army Though in a quiet tent and on the terms of love it is the essential warfare of the hot Assyrian blood and the pure and peculiar Jewish thoroughbredness Blanche Sweet as Judith is indeed dignified and ensnaring the more so because in her abandoned quarter of an hour the Jewish sanctity does not leave her And her aged woman attendant coming in and out sentinel and conscience with austere face and lifted finger symbolizes the fire of Israel that shall yet awaken within her When her love for her city and God finally becomes paramount she shakes off the spell of the divine honors which she has followed all the camp in according to that living heathen deity Holofernes and by the very transfiguration of her figure and countenance we know that the deliverance of Israel is at hand She beheads the dark Assyrian Soon she is back in the city by way of the little gate by which she emerged The elders receive her and her bloody trophy The people who have been dying of thirst arise in a final whirlwind of courage Bereft of their military genius the Assyrians flee from the burning camp Naomi is delivered by her lover Nathan This act is taken by the audience as a type of the setting free of all the captives Then we have the final return of the citizens to their town As for Judith hers is no crass triumph She is shown in her gray and silvery room in her former widow s dress but not the same woman There is thwarted love in her face The sword of sorrow is there But there is also the prayer of thanksgiving She goes forth She is hailed as her city s deliverer She stands among the nobles like a holy candle Providing the picture may be preserved in its original delicacy it has every chance to retain a place in the affections of the wise if a humble pioneer of criticism may speak his honest mind Though in this story the archaic flavor is well preserved the way the producer has pictured the population at peace in battle in despair in victory gives me hope that he or men like unto him will illustrate the American patriotic crowd prophecies We must have Whitmanesque scenarios based on moods akin to that of the poem By Blue Ontario s Shore The possibility of showing the entire American population its own face in the Mirror Screen has at last come Whitman brought the idea of democracy to our sophisticated literati but did not persuade the democracy itself to read his democratic poems Sooner or later the kinetoscope will do what he could not bring the nobler side of the equality idea to the people who are so crassly equal The photoplay penetrates in our land to the haunts of the wildest or the dullest The isolated prospector rides twenty miles to see the same film that is displayed on Broadway There is not a civilized or half civilized land but may read the Whitmanesque message in time if once it is put on the films with power Photoplay theatres are set up in ports where sailors revel in heathen towns where gentlemen adventurers are willing to make one last throw with fate On the other hand as a recorder Whitman approaches the wildest rawest American material and conquers it at the same time keeping his nerves in the state in which Swinburne wrote Only the Song of Secret Bird or Lanier composed The Ballad of Trees and The Master J W Alexander s portrait of Whitman in the Metropolitan Museum New York is not too sophisticated The out of door profoundness of this poet is far richer than one will realize unless he has just returned from some cross country adventure afoot Then if one reads breathlessly by the page and the score of pages there is a glory transcendent For films of American patriotism to parallel the splendors of Cabiria and Judith of Bethulia and to excel them let us have Whitmanesque scenarios based on moods like that of By Blue Ontario s Shore The Salute au Monde and The Passage to India Then the people s message will reach the people at last The average Crowd Picture will cling close to the streets that are and the usual Patriotic Picture will but remind us of nationality as it is at present conceived and aflame and the Religious Picture will for the most part be close to the standard orthodoxies The final forms of these merge into each other though they approach the heights by different avenues We Americans should look for the great photoplay of to morrow that will mark a decade or a century that prophesies of the flags made one the crowds in brotherhood CHAPTER VII RELIGIOUS SPLENDOR As far as the photoplay is concerned religious emotion is a form of crowd emotion In the most conventional and rigid church sense this phase can be conveyed more adequately by the motion picture than by the stage There is little of course for the anti ritualist in the art world anywhere The thing that makes cathedrals real shrines in the eye of the reverent traveller makes them with their religious processions and the like impressive in splendor films For instance I have long remembered the essentials of the film The Death of Thomas Becket It may not compare in technique with some of our present moving picture achievements but the idea must have been particularly adapted to the film medium The story has stayed in my mind with great persistence not only as a narrative but as the first hint to me that orthodox religious feeling has here an undeveloped field Green tells the story in this way in his History of the English People Four knights of the King s court stirred to outrage by a passionate outburst of their master s wrath crossed the sea and on the twenty ninth of December forced their way into the Archbishop s palace After a stormy parley with him in his chamber they withdrew to arm Thomas was hurried by his clerks into the cathedral but as he reached the steps leading from the transept into the choir his pursuers burst in from the cloisters Where cried Reginald Fitzurse is the traitor Thomas Becket Here am I no traitor but a priest of God he replied And again descending the steps he placed himself with his back against a pillar and fronted his foes The brutal murder was received with a thrill of horror throughout Christendom Miracles were wrought at the martyr s tomb et cetera It is one of the few deaths in moving pictures that have given me the sense that I was watching a tragedy Most of them affect one if they have any effect like exhibits in an art gallery as does Josef Israels oil painting Alone in the World We admire the technique and as for emotion we feel the picturesqueness only But here the church procession the robes the candles the vaulting overhead the whole visualized cathedral mood has the power over the reverent eye it has in life and a touch more It is not a private citizen who is struck down Such a taking off would have been but nominally impressive no matter how well acted Private deaths in the films to put it another way are but narrative statements It is not easy to convey their spiritual significance Take for instance the death of John Goderic in the film version of Gilbert Parker s The Seats of the Mighty The major leaves this world in the first third of the story The photoplay use of his death is that he may whisper in the ear of Robert Moray to keep certain letters of La Pompadour well hidden The fact that it is the desire of a dying man gives sharpness to his request Later in the story Moray is hard pressed by the villain for those same papers Then the scene of the death is flashed for an instant on the screen representing the hero s memory of the event It is as though he should recollect and renew a solemn oath The documents are more important than John Goderic His departure is but one of their attributes So it is in any film There is no emotional stimulation in the final departure of a non public character to bring tears such tears as have been provoked by the novel or the stage over the death of Sidney Carton or Faust s Marguerite or the like All this to make sharper the fact that the murder of Becket the archbishop is a climax The great Church and hierarchy are profaned The audience feels the same thrill of horror that went through Christendom We understand why miracles were wrought at the martyr s tomb In the motion pictures the entrance of a child into the world is a mere family episode not a climax when it is the history of private people For instance several little strangers come into the story of Enoch Arden They add beauty and are links in the chain of events Still they are only one of many elements of idyllic charm in the village of Annie Something that in real life is less valuable than a child is the goal of each tiny tableau some coming or departure or the like that affects the total plot But let us imagine a production that would chronicle the promise to Abraham and the vision that came with it Let the film show the final gift of Isaac to the aged Sarah even the boy who is the beginning of a race that shall be as the stars of heaven and the sands of the sea for multitude This could be made a pageant of power and glory The crowd emotions patriotic fires and religious exaltations on which it turns could be given in noble procession and the tiny fellow on the pillow made the mystic centre of the whole The story of the coming of Samuel the dedicated little prophet might be told on similar terms The real death in the photoplay is the ritualistic death the real birth is the ritualistic birth and the cathedral mood of the motion picture which goes with these and is close to these in many of its phases is an inexhaustible resource The film corporations fear religious questions lest offence be given to this sect or that So let such denominations as are in the habit of cooperating themselves take over this medium not gingerly but whole heartedly as in mediaeval time the hierarchy strengthened its hold on the people with the marvels of Romanesque and Gothic architecture This matter is further discussed in the seventeenth chapter entitled Progress and Endowment But there is a field wherein the commercial man will not be accused of heresy or sacrilege which builds on ritualistic birth and death and elements akin thereto This the established producer may enter without fear Which brings us to The Battle Hymn of the Republic issued by the American Vitagraph Company in nineteen eleven This film should be studied in the High Schools and Universities till the canons of art for which it stands are established in America The director was Larry Trimble All honor to him The patriotism of The Battle Hymn of the Republic if taken literally deals with certain aspects of the Civil War But the picture is transfigured by so marked a devotion that it is the main illustration in this work of the religious photoplay The beginning shows President Lincoln in the White House brooding over the lack of response to his last call for troops He is impersonated by Ralph Ince He and Julia Ward Howe are looking out of the window on a recruiting headquarters that is not busy missus Howe is impersonated by Julia S Gordon Another scene shows an old mother in the West refusing to let her son enlist This woman is impersonated by missus Maurice The father has died in the war The sword hangs on the wall Later Julia Ward Howe is shown in her room asleep at midnight then rising in a trance and writing the Battle Hymn at a table by the bed The pictures that might possibly have passed before her mind during the trance are thrown upon the screen The phrases they illustrate are not in the final order of the poem but in the possible sequence in which they went on the paper in the first sketch The dream panorama is not a literal discussion of abolitionism or states rights It illustrates rather the Hebraic exultation applied to all lands and times Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord a gracious picture of the nativity Edith Storey impersonates Mary the Virgin I have seen him in the watchfires of a hundred circling camps and They have builded him an altar in the evening dews and damps for these are given symbolic pageants of the Holy Sepulchre crusaders Then there is a visible parable showing a marketplace in some wicked capital neither Babylon Tyre nor Nineveh but all of them in essential character First come spectacles of rejoicing cruelty and waste Then from Heaven descend flood and fire brimstone and lightning It is like the judgment of the Cities of the Plain Just before the overthrow the line is projected upon the screen He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword Then the heavenly host becomes gradually visible upon the air marching toward the audience almost crossing the footlights and blowing their solemn trumpets With this picture the line is given us to read Our God is marching on This host appears in the photoplay as often as the refrain sweeps into the poem The celestial company its imperceptible emergence its spiritual power when in the ascendant is a thing never to be forgotten a tableau that proves the motion picture a great religious instrument Then comes a procession indeed It is as though the audience were standing at the side of the throne at Doomsday looking down the hill of Zion toward the little earth There is a line of those who are to be judged leaders from the beginning of history barbarians with their crude weapons classic characters Caesar and his rivals for fame mediaeval figures including Dante meditating later figures Richelieu Napoleon Many people march toward the strange glorifying eye of the camera growing larger than men filling the entire field of vision disappearing when they are almost upon us The audience weighs the worth of their work to the world as the men themselves with downcast eyes seem to be doing also The most thrilling figure is Tolstoi in his peasant smock coming after the bitter egotists and conquerors The impersonation is by Edward Thomas I shall never forget that presence marching up to the throne invisible with bowed head This procession is to illustrate the line He is sifting out the hearts of men before his Judgment Seat Later Lincoln is pictured on the steps of the White House It is a quaint tableau in the spirit of the old fashioned Rogers group Yet it is masterful for all that Lincoln is taking the chains from a cowering slave This tableau is to illustrate the line Let the hero born of woman crush the serpent with his heel Now it is the end of the series of visions It is morning in missus Howe s room She rises She is filled with wonder to find the poem on her table Written to the rousing glory tune of John Brown s Body the song goes over the North like wildfire The far off home of the widow is shown She and the boy read the famous chant in the morning news column She takes the old sword from the wall She gives it to her son and sends him to enlist with her blessing In the next picture Lincoln and missus Howe are looking out of the window where was once the idle recruiting tent A new army is pouring by singing the words that have rallied the nation Ritualistic birth and death have been discussed This film might be said to illustrate ritualistic birth death and resurrection The writer has seen hundreds of productions since this one He has described it from memory It came out in a time when the American people paid no attention to the producer or the cast It may have many technical crudities by present day standards But the root of the matter is there And Springfield knew it It was brought back to our town many times It was popular in both the fashionable picture show houses and the cheapest dirtiest hole in the town It will soon be reissued by the Vitagraph Company Every student of American Art should see this film The same exultation that went into it the faculty for commanding the great spirits of history and making visible the unseen powers of the air should be applied to Crowd Pictures which interpret the non sectarian prayers of the broad human race The pageant of Religious Splendor is the final photoplay form in the classification which this work seeks to establish Much of what follows will be to reenforce the heads of these first discourses Further comment on the Religious Photoplay may be found in the eleventh chapter entitled Architecture in Motion CHAPTER VIII SCULPTURE IN MOTION The outline is complete Now to reenforce it Pictures of Action Intimacy and Splendor are the foundation colors in the photoplay as red blue and yellow are the basis of the rainbow Action Films might be called the red section Intimate Motion Pictures being colder and quieter might be called blue and Splendor Photoplays called yellow since that is the hue of pageants and sunshine Another way of showing the distinction is to review the types of gesture The Action Photoplay deals with generalized pantomime the gesture of the conventional policeman in contrast with the mannerism of the stereotyped preacher The Intimate Film gives us more elusive personal gestures the difference between the table manners of two preachers in the same restaurant or two policemen A mark of the Fairy Play is the gesture of incantation the sweep of the arm whereby Mab would transform a prince into a hawk The other Splendor Films deal with the total gestures of crowds the pantomime of a torch waving mass of men the drill of an army on the march or the bending of the heads of a congregation receiving the benediction Another way to demonstrate the thesis is to use the old classification of poetry dramatic lyric epic The Action Play is a narrow form of the dramatic The Intimate Motion Picture is an equivalent of the lyric In the seventeenth chapter it is shown that one type of the Intimate might be classed as imagist And obviously the Splendor Pictures are the equivalent of the epic But perhaps the most adequate way of showing the meaning of this outline is to say that the Action Film is sculpture in motion the Intimate Photoplay is painting in motion and the Fairy Pageant along with the rest of the Splendor Pictures may be described as architecture in motion This chapter will discuss the bearing of the phrase sculpture in motion It will relate directly to chapter two First gentle and kindly reader let us discuss sculpture in its most literal sense after that less realistically but perhaps more adequately Let us begin with Annette Kellerman in Neptune s Daughter This film has a crude plot constructed to show off Annette s various athletic resources It is good photography and a big idea so far as the swimming episodes are concerned An artist haunted by picture conceptions equivalent to the musical thoughts back of Wagner s Rhine maidens could have made of Annette in her mermaid s dress a notable figure Or a story akin to the mermaid tale of Hans Christian Andersen or Matthew Arnold s poem of the forsaken merman could have made this picturesque witch of the salt water truly significant and still retained the most beautiful parts of the photoplay as it was exhibited It is an exceedingly irrelevant imagination that shows her in other scenes as a duellist for instance because forsooth she can fence As a child of the ocean half fish half woman she is indeed convincing Such mermaids as this have haunted sailors and lured them on the rocks to their doom from the day the siren sang till the hour the Lorelei sang no more The scene with the baby mermaid when she swims with the pretty creature on her back is irresistible Why are our managers so mechanical Why do they flatten out at the moment the fancy of the tiniest reader of fairy tales begins to be alive Most of Annette s support were stage dummies Neptune was a lame Santa Claus with cotton whiskers But as for the bearing of the film on this chapter the human figure is within its rights whenever it is as free from self consciousness as was the life radiating Annette in the heavenly clear waters of Bermuda On the other hand Neptune and his pasteboard diadem and wooden pointed pitchfork should have put on his dressing gown and retired As a toe dancer in an alleged court scene on land Annette was a mere simperer Possibly Pavlowa as a swimmer in Bermuda waters would have been as much of a mistake Each queen to her kingdom For living moving sculpture the human eye requires a costume and a part in unity with the meaning of that particular figure There is the Greek dress of Mordkin in the arrow dance There is Annette s breast covering of shells and wonderful flowing mermaid hair clothing her as the midnight does the moon The new costume freedom of the photoplay allows such limitation of clothing as would be probable when one is honestly in touch with wild nature and preoccupied with vigorous exercise Thus the cave man and desert island narratives though seldom well done when produced with verisimilitude give an opportunity for the native human frame in the logical wrappings of reeds and skins But those who in a silly hurry seek excuses are generally merely ridiculous like the barefoot man who is terribly tender about walking on the pebbles or the wild man who is white as celery or grass under a board There is no short cut to vitality A successful literal use of sculpture is in the film Oil and Water Blanche Sweet is the leader of the play within a play which occupies the first reel Here the Olympians and the Muses with a grace that we fancy was Greek lead a dance that traces the story of the spring summer and autumn of life Finally the supple dancers turn gray and old and die but not before they have given us a vision from the Ionian islands The play might have been inspired from reading Keats Lamia but is probably derived from the work of Isadora Duncan This chapter has hereafter only a passing word or two on literal sculptural effects It has more in mind the carver s attitude toward all that passes before the eye The sculptor George Gray Barnard is responsible for none of the views in this discourse but he has talked to me at length about his sense of discovery in watching the most ordinary motion pictures and his delight in following them with their endless combinations of masses and flowing surfaces The little far away people on the old fashioned speaking stage do not appeal to the plastic sense in this way They are by comparison mere bits of pasteboard with sweet voices while on the other hand the photoplay foreground is full of dumb giants The bodies of these giants are in high sculptural relief Where the lights are quite glaring and the photography is bad many of the figures are as hard in their impact on the eye as lime white plaster casts no matter what the clothing There are several passages of this sort in the otherwise beautiful Enoch Arden where the shipwrecked sailor is depicted on his desert island in the glaring sun What materials should the photoplay figures suggest There are as many possible materials as there are subjects for pictures and tone schemes to be considered But we will take for illustration wood bronze and marble since they have been used in the old sculptural art There is found in most art shows a type of carved wood gargoyle where the work and the subject are at one not only in the color of the wood but in the way the material masses itself in bulk betrays its qualities We will suppose a moving picture humorist who is in the same mood as the carver He chooses a story of quaint old ladies street gamins and fat aldermen Imagine the figures with the same massing and interplay suddenly invested with life yet giving to the eye a pleasure kindred to that which is found in carved wood and bringing to the fancy a similar humor Or there is a type of Action Story where the mood of the figures is that of bronze with the aesthetic resources of that metal its elasticity its emphasis on the tendon ligament and bone rather than on the muscle and an attribute that we will call the panther like quality Hermon A MacNeil has a memorable piece of work in the yard of the architect Shaw at Lake Forest Illinois It is called The Sun Vow A little Indian is shooting toward the sun while the old warrior crouching immediately behind him follows with his eye the direction of the arrow Few pieces of sculpture come readily to mind that show more happily the qualities of bronze as distinguished from other materials To imagine such a group done in marble carved wood or Della Robbia ware is to destroy the very image in the fancy The photoplay of the American Indian should in most instances be planned as bronze in action The tribes should not move so rapidly that the panther like elasticity is lost in the riding running and scalping On the other hand the aborigines should be far from the temperateness of marble mister Edward S Curtis the super photographer has made an Ethnological collection of photographs of our American Indians This work of a life time a supreme art achievement shows the native as a figure in bronze mister Curtis photoplay The Land of the Head Hunters World Film Corporation a romance of the Indians of the North West abounds in noble bronzes I have gone through my old territories as an art student in the Chicago Art Institute and the Metropolitan Museum of late in special excursions looking for sculpture painting and architecture that might be the basis for the photoplays of the future The Bacchante of Frederick MacMonnies is in bronze in the Metropolitan Museum and in bronze replica in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts There is probably no work that more rejoices the hearts of the young art students in either city The youthful creature illustrates a most joyous leap into the air She is high on one foot with the other knee lifted She holds a bunch of grapes full arm s length Her baby clutched in the other hand is reaching up with greedy mouth toward the fruit The bacchante body is glistening in the light This is joy in bronze as the Sun Vow is power in bronze This special story could not be told in another medium I have seen in Paris a marble copy of this Bacchante It is as though it were done in soap On the other hand many of the renaissance Italian sculptors have given us children in marble in low relief dancing like lilies in the wind They could not be put into bronze The plot of the Action Photoplay is literally or metaphorically a chase down the road or a hurdle race It might be well to consider how typical figures for such have been put into carved material There are two bronze statues that have their replicas in all museums They are generally one on either side of the main hall towering above the second story balustrade First the statue of Gattamelata a Venetian general by Donatello The original is in Padua Then there is the figure of Bartolommeo Colleoni The original is in Venice It is by Verrocchio and Leopardi These equestrians radiate authority There is more action in them than in any cowboy hordes I have ever beheld zipping across the screen Look upon them and ponder long prospective author producer Even in a simple chase picture the speed must not destroy the chance to enjoy the modelling If you would give us mounted legions destined to conquer let any one section of the film if it is stopped and studied be grounded in the same bronze conception The Assyrian commanders in Griffith s Judith would without great embarrassment stand this test But it may not be the pursuit of an enemy we have in mind It may be a spring celebration horsemen in Arcadia going to some happy tournament Where will we find our precedents for such a cavalcade Go to any museum Find the Parthenon room High on the wall is the copy of the famous marble frieze of the young citizens who are in the procession in praise of Athena Such a rhythm of bodies and heads and the feet of proud steeds and above all the profiles of thoroughbred youths no city has seen since that day The delicate composition relations ever varying ever refreshing amid the seeming sameness of formula of rider behind rider have been the delight of art students the world over and shall so remain No serious observer escapes the exhilaration of this company Let it be studied by the author producer though it be but an idyl in disguise that his scenario calls for merry young farmers hurrying to the State Fair parade boys making all speed to the political rally Buy any three moving picture magazines you please Mark the illustrations that are massive in high relief with long lines in their edges Cut out and sort some of these I have done it on the table where I write After throwing away all but the best specimens I have four different kinds of sculpture First behold the inevitable cowboy He is on a ramping horse filling the entire outlook The steed rears while facing us The cowboy waves his hat There is quite such an animal by Frederick MacMonnies wrought in bronze set up on a gate to a park in Brooklyn It is not the identical color of the photoplay animal but the bronze elasticity is the joy in both Here is a scene of a masked monk carrying off a fainting girl The hero intercepts him The figures of the lady and the monk are in sufficient sculptural harmony to make a formal sculptural group for an art exhibition The picture of the hero strong with well massed surfaces is related to both The fact that he is in evening dress does not alter his monumental quality All three are on a stone balcony that relates itself to the general largeness of spirit in the group and the semi classic dress of the maiden No doubt the title is The Morning Following the Masquerade Ball This group could be made in unglazed clay in four colors Here is an American lieutenant with two ladies The three are suddenly alert over the approach of the villain who is not yet in the picture In costume it is an everyday group but those three figures are related to one another and the trees behind them in simple sculptural terms The lieutenant as is to be expected looks forth in fierce readiness One girl stands with clasped hands The other points to the danger The relations of these people to one another may seem merely dramatic to the superficial observer but the power of the group is in the fact that it is monumental I could imagine it done in four different kinds of rare tropical wood carved unpolished Here is a scene of storm and stress in an office where the hero is caught with seemingly incriminating papers The table is in confusion The room is filling with people led by one accusing woman Is this also sculpture Yes The figures are in high relief Even the surfaces of the chairs and the littered table are massive and the eye travels without weariness as it should do in sculpture from the hero to the furious woman then to the attorney behind her then to the two other revilers then to the crowd in three loose rhythmic ranks The eye makes this journey not from space to space or fabric to fabric but first of all from mass to mass It is sculpture but it is the sort that can be done in no medium but the moving picture itself and therefore it is one goal of this argument But there are several other goals One of the sculpturesque resources of the photoplay is that the human countenance can be magnified many times till it fills the entire screen Some examples are in rather low relief portraits approximating certain painters But if they are on sculptural terms and are studies of the faces of thinking men let the producer make a pilgrimage to Washington for his precedent There in the rotunda of the capitol is the face of Lincoln by Gutzon Borglum It is one of the eminently successful attempts to get at the secret of the countenance by enlarging it much and concentrating the whole consideration there The photoplay producer seemingly without taking thought is apt to show a sculptural sense in giving us Newfoundland fishermen clad in oilskins The background may have an unconscious Winslow Homer reminiscence In the foreground our hardy heroes fill the screen and dripping with sea water become wave beaten granite yet living creatures none the less Imagine some one chapter from the story of Little Em ly in David Copperfield retold in the films Show us Ham Peggotty and old mister Peggotty in colloquy over their nets There are many powerful bronze groups to be had from these two on to the heroic and unselfish death of Ham rescuing his enemy in storm and lightning I have seen one rich picture of alleged cannibal tribes It was a comedy about a missionary But the aborigines were like living ebony and silver That was long ago Such things come too much by accident The producer is not sufficiently aware that any artistic element in his list of productions that is allowed to go wild that has not had full analysis reanalysis and final conservation wastes his chance to attain supreme mastery Open your history of sculpture and dwell upon those illustrations which are not the normal reposeful statues but the exceptional such as have been listed for this chapter Imagine that each dancing galloping or fighting figure comes down into the room life size Watch it against a dark curtain Let it go through a series of gestures in harmony with the spirit of the original conception and as rapidly as possible not to lose nobility If you have the necessary elasticity imagine the figures wearing the costumes of another period yet retaining in their motions the same essential spirit Combine them in your mind with one or two kindred figures enlarged till they fill the end of the room You have now created the beginning of an Action Photoplay in your own fancy Do this with each most energetic classic till your imagination flags I do not want to be too dogmatic but it seems to me this is one way to evolve real Action Plays It would perhaps be well to substitute this for the usual method of evolving them from old stage material or newspaper clippings There is in the Metropolitan Museum a noble modern group the Mares of Diomedes by the aforementioned Gutzon Borglum It is full of material for the meditations of a man who wants to make a film of a stampede The idea is that Hercules riding his steed bareback guides it in a circle He is fascinating the horses he has been told to capture They are held by the mesmerism of the circular path and follow him round and round till they finally fall from exhaustion Thus the Indians of the West capture wild ponies and Borglum a far western man imputes the method to Hercules The bronze group shows a segment of this circle The whirlwind is at its height The mares are wild to taste the flesh of Hercules Whoever is to photograph horses let him study the play of light and color and muscle texture in this bronze And let no group of horses ever run faster than these of Borglum An occasional hint of a Michelangelo figure or gesture appears for a flash in the films Young artist in the audience does it pass you by Open your history of sculpture again and look at the usual list of Michelangelo groups Suppose the seated majesty of Moses should rise what would be the quality of the action Suppose the sleeping figures of the Medician tombs should wake or those famous slaves should break their bands or David again hurl the stone Would not their action be as heroic as their quietness Is it not possible to have a Michelangelo of photoplay sculpture Should we not look for him in the fulness of time His figures might come to us in the skins of the desert island solitary or as cave men and women or as mermaids and mermen and yet have a force and grandeur akin to that of the old Italian Rodin s famous group of the citizens of Calais is an example of the expression of one particular idea by a special technical treatment The producer who tells a kindred story to that of the siege of Calais and the final going of these humble men to their doom will have a hero tale indeed It will be not only sculpture in action but a great Crowd Picture It begins to be seen that the possibilities of monumental achievement in the films transcend the narrow boundaries of the Action Photoplay Why not conceptions as heroic as Rodin s Hand of God where the first pair are clasped in the gigantic fingers of their maker in the clay from which they came Finally I desire in moving pictures not the stillness but the majesty of sculpture I do not advocate for the photoplay the mood of the Venus of Milo But let us turn to that sister of hers the great Victory of Samothrace that spreads her wings at the head of the steps of the Louvre and in many an art gallery beside When you are appraising a new film ask yourself Is this motion as rapid as godlike as the sweep of the wings of the Samothracian Let her be the touchstone of the Action Drama for nothing can be more swift than the winged Gods nothing can be more powerful than the oncoming of the immortals CHAPTER IX PAINTING IN MOTION This chapter is founded on the delicate effects that may be worked out from cosy interior scenes close to the camera It relates directly to chapter three While the Intimate and friendly Motion Picture may be in high sculptural relief its characteristic manifestations are in low relief The situations show to better advantage when they seem to be paintings rather than monumental groups Turn to your handful of motion picture magazines and mark the illustrations that look the most like paintings Cut them out Winnow them several times I have before me as a final threshing from such an experiment five pictures Each one approximates a different school Here is a colonial Virginia maiden by the hearth of the inn Bending over her in a cherishing way is the negro maid On the other side the innkeeper shows a kindred solicitude A dishevelled traveller sleeps huddled up in the corner The costume of the man fades into the velvety shadows of the wall His face is concealed His hair blends with the soft background The clothing of the other three makes a patch of light gray Added to this is the gayety of special textures the turban of the negress a trimming on the skirt of the heroine the silkiness of the innkeeper s locks the fabric of the broom in the hearthlight the pattern of the mortar lines round the bricks of the hearth The tableau is a satisfying scheme in two planes and many textures Here is another sort of painting The young mother in her pretty bed is smiling on her infant The cot and covers and flesh tints have gentle scales of difference all within one tone of the softest gray Her hair is quite dark It relates to the less luminous black of the coat of the physician behind the bed and the dress of the girl friend bending over her The nurse standing by the doctor is a figure of the same gray white as the bed Within the pattern of the velvety blacks there are as many subtle gradations as in the pattern of the gray whites The tableau is a satisfying scheme in black and gray with practically one non obtrusive texture throughout Here is a picture of an Englishman and his wife in India It might be called sculptural but for the magnificence of the turban of the rajah who converses with them the glitter of the light round his shoulders and the scheme of shadow out of which the three figures rise The arrangement remotely reminds one of several of Rembrandt s semi oriental musings Here is a picture of Mary Pickford as Fanchon the Cricket She is in the cottage with the strange old mother I have seen a painting in this mood by the Greek Nickolas Gysis The Intimate and friendly Moving Picture the photoplay of painting in motion need not be indoors as long as it has the native heath mood It is generally keyed to the hearthstone and keeps quite close to it But how well I remember when the first French photoplays began to come Though unintelligent in some respects the photography and subject matter of many of them made one think of that painter of gentle out of door scenes Jean Charles Cazin Here is our last clipping which is also in a spirit allied to Cazin The heroine accompanied by an aged shepherd and his dog are in the foreground The sheep are in the middle distance on the edge of the river There is a noble hill beyond the gently flowing water Here is intimacy and friendliness in the midst of the big out of doors If these five photo paintings were on good paper enlarged to twenty by twenty four inches they would do to frame and hang on the wall of any study for a month or so And after the relentless test of time I would venture that some one of the five would prove a permanent addition to the household gods Hastily made photographs selected from the films are often put in front of the better theatres to advertise the show Of late they are making them two by three feet and sometimes several times larger Here is a commercial beginning of an art gallery but not enough pains are taken to give the selections a complete art gallery dignity Why not have the most beautiful scenes in front of the theatres instead of those alleged to be the most thrilling Why not rest the fevered and wandering eye rather than make one more attempt to take it by force Let the reader supply another side of the argument by looking at the illustrations in any history of painting Let him select the pictures that charm him most and think of them enlarged and transferred bodily to one corner of the room as he has thought of the sculpture Let them take on motion without losing their charm of low relief or their serene composition within the four walls of the frame As for the motion let it be a further extension of the drawing Let every gesture be a bolder but not less graceful brush stroke The Metropolitan Museum has a Van Dyck that appeals equally to one s sense of beauty and one s feeling for humor It is a portrait of James Stuart Duke of Lennox and I cannot see how the author producer photographer can look upon it without having it set his imagination in a glow Every small town dancing set has a James like this The man and the greyhound are the same witless breed the kind that achieve a result by their clean limbed elegance alone Van Dyck has painted the two with what might be called a greyhound brush stroke a style of handling that is nothing but courtly convention and strut to the point of genius He is as far from the meditative spirituality of Rembrandt as could well be imagined Conjure up a scene in the hereditary hall after a hunt or golf tournament in which a man like this Duke of Lennox has a noble parley with his lady or dancing partner she being a sweet and stupid swan or a white rabbit by the same sign that he is a noble and stupid greyhound Be it an ancient or modern episode the story could be told in the tone and with well nigh the brushwork of Van Dyck Then there is a picture my teachers Chase and Henri were never weary of praising the Girl with the Parrot by Manet Here continence in nervous force expressed by low relief and restraint in tone is carried to its ultimate point I should call this an imagist painting made before there were such people as imagist poets It is a perpetual sermon to those that would thresh around to no avail be they orators melodramatists or makers of photoplays with an alleged heart interest Let us consider Gilbert Stuart s portrait of Washington This painter s notion of personal dignity has far more of the intellectual quality than Van Dyck He loves to give us stately able fairly conscientious gentry rather than overdone royalty His work represents a certain mood in design that in architecture is called colonial Such portraits go with houses like Mount Vernon Let the photographer study the flat blacks in the garments Let him note the transparent impression of the laces and flesh tints that seem to be painted on glass observing especially the crystalline whiteness of the wigs Let him inspect also the silhouette like outlines noting the courtly self possession they convey Then let the photographer the producer and the author be they one man or six men stick to this type of picturization through one entire production till any artist in the audience will say This photoplay was painted by a pupil of Gilbert Stuart and the layman will say It looks like those stately days And let us not have battle but a Mount Vernon fireside tale Both the Chicago and New York museums contain many phases of one same family group painted by George de Forest Brush There is a touch of the hearthstone priestess about the woman The force of sex has turned to the austere comforting passion of motherhood From the children under the wings of this spirit come special delicate powers of life There is nothing tense or restless about them yet they embody action the beating of the inner fire without which all outer action is mockery Hearthstone tales keyed to the mood and using the brush stroke that delineates this especial circle would be unmistakable in their distinction Charles W Hawthorne has pictures in Chicago and New York that imply the Intimate and friendly Photoplay The Trousseau in the Metropolitan Museum shows a gentle girl an unfashionable home body with a sweetly sheltered air Behind her glimmers the patient mother s face The older woman is busy about fitting the dress The picture is a tribute to the qualities of many unknown gentlewomen Such an illumination as this on faces so innocently eloquent is the light that should shine on the countenance of the photoplay actress who really desires greatness in the field of the Intimate Motion Picture There is in Chicago Hawthorne s painting of Sylvia a little girl standing with her back to a mirror a few blossoms in one hand and a vase of flowers on the mirror shelf It is as sound a composition as Hawthorne ever produced The painting of the child is another tribute to the physical spiritual textures from which humanity is made Ah you producer who have grown squeaky whipping your people into what you called action consider the dynamics of these figures that would be almost motionless in real life Remember there must be a spirit action under the other or all is dead Yet that soul may be the muse of Comedy If Hawthorne and his kind are not your fashion turn to models that have their feet on the earth always yet successfully aspire Key some of your intimate humorous scenes to the Dutch Little Masters of Painting such pictures as Gerard Terburg s Music Lesson in the Chicago Art Institute The thing is as well designed as a Dutch house wind mill or clock And it is more elegant than any of these There is humor enough in the picture to last one reel through The society dame of the period in her pretty raiment fingers the strings of her musical instrument while the master stands by her with the baton The painter has enjoyed the satire from her elegant little hands to the teacher s well combed locks It is very plain that she does not want to study music with any sincerity and he does not desire to develop the ability of this particular person There may be a flirtation in the background Yet these people are not hollow as gourds and they are not caricatured The Dutch Little Masters have indulged in numberless characterizations of mundane humanity But they are never so preoccupied with the story that it is an anecdote rather than a picture It is first of all a piece of elegant painting fabric Next it is a scrap of Dutch philosophy or aspiration Let Whistler turn over in his grave while we enlist him for the cause of democracy One view of the technique of this man might summarize it thus fastidiousness in choice of subject the picture well within the frame low relief a Velasquez study of tones and a Japanese study of spaces Let us dear and patient reader particularly dwell upon the spacing A Whistler or a good Japanese print might be described as a kaleidoscope suddenly arrested and transfixed at the moment of most exquisite relations in the pieces of glass An Intimate Play of a kindred sort would start to turning the kaleidoscope again losing fine relations only to gain those which are more exquisite and novel All motion pictures might be characterized as space measured without sound plus time measured without sound This description fits in a special way the delicate form of the Intimate Motion Picture and there can be studied out free from irrelevant issues As to space measured without sound Suppose it is a humorous characterization of comfortable family life founded on some Dutch Little Master The picture measures off its spaces in harmony The triangle occupied by the little child s dress is in definite relation to the triangle occupied by the mother s costume To these two patterns the space measured off by the boy s figure is adjusted and all of them are as carefully related to the shapes cut out of the background by the figures No matter how the characters move about in the photoplay these pattern shapes should relate to one another in a definite design The exact tone value of each one and their precise nearness or distance to one another have a deal to do with the final effect We go to the photoplay to enjoy right and splendid picture motions to feel a certain thrill when the pieces of kaleidoscope glass slide into new places Instead of moving on straight lines as they do in the mechanical toy they progress in strange curves that are part of the very shapes into which they fall Consider first came the photograph Then motion was added to the photograph We must use this order in our judgment If it is ever to evolve into a national art it must first be good picture then good motion Belasco s attitude toward the stage has been denounced by the purists because he makes settings too large a portion of his story telling and transforms his theatre into the paradise of the property man But this very quality of the well spaced setting if you please has made his chance for the world s moving picture anthology As reproduced by Jesse K Lasky the Belasco production is the only type of the old line drama that seems really made to be the basis of a moving picture play Not always but as a general rule Belasco suffers less detriment in the films than other men Take for instance the Belasco Lasky production of The Rose of the Rancho with Bessie Barriscale as the heroine It has many highly modelled action tableaus and others that come under the classification of this chapter When I was attending it not long ago here in my home town the fair companion at my side said that one scene looked like a painting by Sorolla y Bastida the Spaniard It is the episode where the Rose sends back her servant to inquire the hero s name As a matter of fact there were Sorollas and Zuloagas all through the piece The betrothal reception with flying confetti was a satisfying piece of Spanish splendor It was space music indeed space measured without sound Incidentally the cast is to be congratulated on its picturesque acting especially Miss Barriscale in her impersonation of the Rose It is harder to grasp the other side of the paradox picture motions considered as time measured without sound But think of a lively and humoresque clock that does not tick and takes only an hour to record a day Think of a noiseless electric vehicle where you are looking out of the windows going down the smooth boulevard of Wonderland Consider a film with three simple time elements one that of the pursuer two the pursued three the observation vehicle of the camera following the road and watching both of them now faster now slower than they as the photographer overtakes the actors or allows them to hurry ahead The plain chase is a bore because there are only these three time elements But the chase principle survives in every motion picture and we simply need more of this sort of time measurement better considered The more the non human objects the human actors and the observer move at a varying pace the greater chances there are for what might be called time and space music No two people in the same room should gesture at one mechanical rate or lift their forks or spoons keeping obviously together Yet it stands to reason that each successive tableau should be not only a charming picture but the totals of motion should be an orchestration of various speeds of abrupt graceful and seemingly awkward progress worked into a silent symphony Supposing it is a fisher maiden s romance In the background the waves toss in one tempo Owing to the sail the boat rocks in another In the foreground the tree alternately bends and recovers itself in the breeze making more opposition than the sail In still another time unit the smoke rolls from the chimney making no resistance to the wind In another unit the lovers pace the sand Yet there is one least common multiple in which all move This the producing genius should sense and make part of the dramatic structure and it would have its bearing on the periodic appearance of the minor and major crises Films like this you say would be hard to make Yes Here is the place to affirm that the one reel Intimate Photoplay will no doubt be the form in which this type of time and space music is developed The music of silent motion is the most abstract of moving picture attributes and will probably remain the least comprehended Like the quality of Walter Pater s Marius the Epicurean or that of Shelley s Hymn to Intellectual Beauty it will not satisfy the sudden and the brash The reader will find in his round of the picture theatres many single scenes and parts of plays that elucidate the title of this chapter Often the first two thirds of the story will fit it well Then the producers finding that for reasons they do not understand with the best and most earnest actors they cannot work the three reels into an emotional climax introduce some stupid disaster and rescue utterly irrelevant to the character parts and the paintings that have preceded Whether the alleged thesis be love hate or ambition cottage charm daisy dell sweetness or the ivy beauty of an ancient estate the resource for the final punch seems to be something like a train wreck But the transfiguration of the actors not their destruction or rescue is the goal The last moment of the play is great not when it is a grandiose salvation from a burning house that knocks every delicate preceding idea in the head but a tableau that is as logical as the awakening of the Sleeping Beauty after the hero has explored all the charmed castle CHAPTER X FURNITURE TRAPPINGS AND INVENTIONS IN MOTION The Action Pictures are sculpture in motion the Intimate Pictures paintings in motion the Splendor Pictures many and diverse It seems far fetched perhaps to complete the analogy and say they are architecture in motion yet patient reader unless I am mistaken that assumption can be given a value in time without straining your imagination Landscape gardening mural painting church building and furniture making as well are some of the things that come under the head of architecture They are discussed between the covers of any architectural magazine There is a particular relation in the photoplay between Crowd Pictures and landscape conceptions between Patriotic Films and mural paintings between Religious Films and architecture And there is just as much of a relation between Fairy Tales and furniture which same is discussed in this chapter Let us return to Moving Day chapter four This idea has been represented many times with a certain sameness because the producers have not thought out the philosophy behind it A picture that is all action is a plague one that is all elephantine and pachydermatous pageant is a bore and most emphatically a film that is all mechanical legerdemain is a nuisance The possible charm in a so called trick picture is in eliminating the tricks giving them dignity till they are no longer such but thoughts in motion and made visible In Moving Day the shoes are the most potent They go through a drama that is natural to them To march without human feet inside is but to exaggerate themselves It would not be amusing to have them walk upside down for instance As long as the worn soles touch the pavement we unconsciously conjure up the character of the absent owners about whom the shoes are indeed gossiping So let the remainder of the furniture keep still while the shoes do their best Let us call to mind a classic fairy tale involving shoes that are magical The Seven Leagued Boots for example or The Enchanted Moccasins or the footwear of Puss in Boots How gorgeous and embroidered any of these should be and at a crisis what sly antics they should be brought to play without fidgeting all over the shop Cinderella s Slipper is not sufficiently the heroine in moving pictures of that story It should be the tiny leading lady of the piece in the same sense the mighty steam engine is the hero of the story in chapter two The peasants when they used to tell the tale by the hearth fire said the shoe was made of glass This was in mediaeval Europe at a time when glass was much more of a rarity The material was chosen to imply a sort of jewelled strangeness from the start When Cinderella loses it in her haste it should flee at once like a white mouse to hide under the sofa It should be pictured there with special artifice so that the sensuous little foot of every girl child in the audience will tingle to wear it It should move a bit when the prince comes frantically hunting his lady and peep out just in time for that royal personage to spy it Even at the coronation it should be the centre of the ritual more gazed at than the crown and on as dazzling a cushion The final taking on of the slipper by the lady should be as stately a ceremony as the putting of the circlet of gold on her aureole hair So much for Cinderella But there are novel stories that should be evolved by preference about new sorts of magic shoes We have not exhausted Moving Day The chairs kept still through the Cinderella discourse Now let them take their innings Instead of having all of them dance about invest but one with an inner life Let its special attributes show themselves but gradually reaching their climax at the highest point of excitement in the reel and being an integral part of that enthusiasm Perhaps though we be inventing a new fairy tale it will resemble the Siege Perilous in the Arthurian story the chair where none but the perfect knight could sit A dim row of flaming swords might surround it When the soul entitled to use this throne appears the swords might fade away and the gray cover hanging in slack folds roll back because of an inner energy and the chair might turn from gray to white and with a subtle change of line become a throne The photoplay imagination which is able to impart vital individuality to furniture will not stop there Let the buildings emanate conscious life The author producer photographer or one or all three will make into a personality some place akin to the House of the Seven Gables till the ancient building dominates the fancy as it does in Hawthorne s tale There are various ways to bring about this result by having its outlines waver in the twilight by touches of phosphorescence or by the passing of inexplicable shadows or the like It depends upon what might be called the genius of the building There is the Poe story of The Fall of the House of Usher where with the death of the last heir the castle falls crumbling into the tarn There are other possible tales on such terms never yet imagined to be born to morrow Great structures may become in sort villains as in the old Bible narrative of the origin of the various languages The producer can show the impious Babel Tower going higher and higher into the sky fascinating and tempting the architects till a confusion of tongues turns those masons into quarrelling mobs that become departing caravans leaving her blasted and forsaken a symbol of every Babylon that rose after her There are fables where the rocks and the mountains speak Emerson has given us one where the Mountain and the Squirrel had a quarrel The Mountain called the Squirrel Little Prig And then continues a clash of personalities more possible to illustrate than at first appears Here we come to the second stage of the fairy tale where the creature seems so unmanageable in his physical aspect that some actor must be substituted who will embody the essence of him To properly illustrate the quarrel of the Mountain and the Squirrel the steep height should quiver and heave and then give forth its personality in the figure of a vague smoky giant capable of human argument but with oak roots in his hair and Bun perhaps become a jester in squirrel s dress Or it may be our subject matter is a tall Dutch clock Father Time himself might emerge therefrom Or supposing it is a chapel in a knight s adventure An angel should step from the carving by the door a design that is half angel half flower But let the clock first tremble a bit Let the carving stir a little and then let the spirit come forth that there may be a fine relation between the impersonator and the thing represented A statue too often takes on life by having the actor abruptly substituted The actor cannot logically take on more personality than the statue has He can only give that personality expression in a new channel In the realm of letters a real transformation scene rendered credible to the higher fancy by its slow cumulative movement is the tale of the change of the dying Rowena to the living triumphant Ligeia in Poe s story of that name Substitution is not the fairy story It is transformation transfiguration that is the fairy story be it a divine or a diabolical change There is never more than one witch in a forest one Siege Perilous at any Round Table But she is indeed a witch and the other is surely a Siege Perilous We might define Fairy Splendor as furniture transfigured for without transfiguration there is no spiritual motion of any kind But the phrase furniture in motion serves a purpose It gets us back to the earth for a reason Furniture is architecture and the fairy tale picture should certainly be drawn with architectural lines The normal fairy tale is a sort of tiny informal child s religion the baby s secular temple and it should have for the most part that touch of delicate sublimity that we see in the mountain chapel or grotto or fancy in the dwellings of Aucassin and Nicolette When such lines are drawn by the truly sophisticated producer there lies in them the secret of a more than ritualistic power Good fairy architecture amounts to an incantation in itself If it is a grown up legend it must be more than monumental in its lines like the great stone face of Hawthorne s tale Even a chair can reach this estate For instance let it be the throne of Wodin illustrating some passage in Norse mythology If this throne has a language it speaks with the lightning if it shakes with its threat it moves the entire mountain range beneath it Let the wizard author producer climb up from the tricks of Moving Day to the foot hills where he can see this throne against the sky as a superarchitect would draw it But even if he can give this vision in the films his task will not be worth while if he is simply a teller of old stories Let us have magic shoes about which are more golden dreams than those concerning Cinderella Let us have stranger castles than that of Usher more dazzling chairs than the Siege Perilous Let us have the throne of Liberty not the throne of Wodin There is one outstanding photoplay that I always have in mind when I think of film magic It illustrates some principles of this chapter and chapter four as well as many others through the book It is Griffith s production of The Avenging Conscience It is also an example of that rare thing a use of old material that is so inspired that it has the dignity of a new creation The raw stuff of the plot is pieced together from the story of The Tell tale Heart and the poem Annabel Lee It has behind it in the further distance Poe s conscience stories of The Black Cat and William Wilson I will describe the film here at length and apply it to whatever chapters it illustrates An austere and cranky bachelor well impersonated by Spottiswoode Aitken brings up his orphan nephew with an awkward affection The nephew is impersonated by Henry B Walthall The uncle has an ambition that the boy will become a man of letters In his attempts at literature the youth is influenced by Poe This brings about the Poe quality of his dreams at the crisis The uncle is silently exasperated when he sees his boy s writing time broken into and wasted as he thinks by an affair with a lovely Annabel Blanche Sweet The intimacy and confidence of the lovers has progressed so far that it is a natural thing for the artless girl to cross the gardens and after hesitation knock at the door She wants to know what has delayed her boy She is all in a flutter on account of the overdue appointment to go to a party together The scene of the pretty hesitancy on the step her knocking and the final impatient tapping with her foot is one of the best illustrations of the intimate mood in photoplay episodes On the girl s entrance the uncle overwhelms her and the boy by saying she is pursuing his nephew like a common woman of the town The words actually burst through the film not as a melodramatic but as an actual insult This is a thing almost impossible to do in the photoplay This outrage in the midst of an atmosphere of chivalry is one of Griffith s master moments It accounts for the volcanic fury of the nephew that takes such trouble to burn itself out afterwards It is not easy for the young to learn that they must let those people flay them for an hour who have made every sacrifice for them through a life time This scene of insult and the confession scene later in this film moved me as similar passages in high drama would do and their very rareness even in the hands of photoplay masters indicates that such purely dramatic climaxes cannot be the main asset of the moving picture Over and over with the best talent and producers they fail The boy and girl go to the party in spite of the uncle It is while on the way that the boy looks on the face of a stranger who afterwards mixes up in his dream as the detective There is a mistake in the printing here There are several minutes of a worldly wise oriental dance to amuse the guests while the lovers are alone at another end of the garden It is possibly the aptest contrast with the seriousness of our hero and heroine But the social affair could have had a better title than the one that is printed on the film An Old fashioned Sweetheart Party Possibly the dance was put in after the title The lovers part forever The girl s pride has had a mortal wound About this time is thrown on the screen the kind of a climax quite surely possible to the photoplay It reminds one not of the mood of Poe s verse but of the spirit of the paintings of George Frederick Watts It is allied in some way in my mind with his Love and Life though but a single draped figure within doors and Love and Life are undraped figures climbing a mountain The boy having said good by remembers the lady Annabel It is a crisis after the event In his vision she is shown in a darkened passageway all in white looking out of the window upon the moonlit sky Simple enough in its elements this vision is shown twice in glory The third replica has not the same glamour The first two are transfigurations into divinity The phrase thrown on the screen is The moon never beams without bringing me dreams of the beautiful Annabel Lee And the sense of loss goes through and through one like a flight of arrows Another noble picture more realistic more sculpturesque is of Annabel mourning on her knees in her room Her bended head makes her akin to Niobe all tears The boy meditating on a park path is meanwhile watching the spider in his web devour the fly Then he sees the ants in turn destroy the spider These pictures are shown on so large a scale that the spiderweb fills the end of the theatre Then the ant tragedy does the same They can be classed as particularly apt hieroglyphics in the sense of chapter thirteen Their horror and decorative iridescence are of the Poe sort It is the first hint of the Poe hieroglyphic we have had except the black patch over the eye of the uncle along with his jaundiced cadaverous face The boy meditates on how all nature turns on cruelty and the survival of the fittest He passes just now an Italian laborer impersonated by George Seigmann This laborer enters later into his dream He finally goes to sleep in his chair the resolve to kill his uncle rankling in his heart The audience is not told that a dream begins To understand that one must see the film through twice But it is perfectly legitimate to deceive us Through our ignorance we share the young man s hallucinations entering into them as imperceptibly as he does We think it is the next morning Poe would start the story just here and here the veritable Poe esque quality begins After debate within himself as to means the nephew murders his uncle and buries him in the thick wall of the chimney The Italian laborer witnesses the death struggle through the window While our consciences are aching and the world crashes round us he levies black mail Then for due compensation the Italian becomes an armed sentinel The boy fears detection Yet the foolish youth thinks he will be happy But every time he runs to meet his sweetheart he is appalled by hallucinations over her shoulder The cadaverous ghost of the uncle is shown on the screen several times It is an appearance visible to the young man and the audience only Later the ghost is implied by the actions of the guilty one We merely imagine it This is a piece of sound technique We no more need a dray full of ghosts than a dray full of jumping furniture The village in general has never suspected the nephew Only two people suspect him the broken hearted girl and an old friend of his father This gentleman puts a detective on the trail The detective is impersonated by Ralph Lewis The gradual breakdown of the victim is traced by dramatic degrees This is the second case of the thing I have argued as being generally impossible in a photoplay chronicle of a private person and which the considerations of chapter twelve indicate as exceptional We trace the innermost psychology of one special citizen step by step to the crisis and that path is actually the primary interest of the story The climax is the confession to the detective With this self exposure the direct Poe quality of the technique comes to an end Moreover Poe would end the story here But the Poe dream is set like a dark jewel in a gold ring of which more anon Let us dwell upon the confession The first stage of this conscience climax is reached by the dramatization of The Tell tale Heart reminiscence in the memory of the dreaming man The episode makes a singular application of the theories with which this chapter begins For furniture in motion we have the detective s pencil For trappings and inventions in motion we have his tapping shoe and the busy clock pendulum Because this scene is so powerful the photoplay is described in this chapter rather than any other though the application is more spiritual than literal The half mad boy begins to divulge that he thinks that the habitual ticking of the clock is satanically timed to the beating of the dead man s heart Here more unearthliness hovers round a pendulum than any merely mechanical trick movements could impart Then the merest commonplace of the detective tapping his pencil in the same time the boy trying in vain to ignore it increases the strain till the audience has well nigh the hallucinations of the victim Then the bold tapping of the detective s foot who would do all his accusing without saying a word and the startling coincidence of the owl hoot hooting outside the window to the same measure bring us close to the final breakdown These realistic material actors are as potent as the actual apparitions of the dead man that preceded them Those visions prepared the mind to invest trifles with significance The pencil and the pendulum conducting themselves in an apparently everyday fashion satisfy in a far nobler way the thing in the cave man attending the show that made him take note in other centuries of the rope that began to hang the butcher the fire that began to burn the stick and the stick that began to beat the dog Now the play takes a higher demoniacal plane reminiscent of Poe s Bells The boy opens the door He peers into the darkness There he sees them They are the nearest to the sinister Poe quality of any illustrations I recall that attempt it They are neither man nor woman they are neither brute nor human they are ghouls The scenes are designed with the architectural dignity that the first part of this chapter has insisted wizard trappings should take on Now it is that the boy confesses and the Poe story ends Then comes what the photoplay people call the punch It is discussed at the end of chapter nine It is a kind of solar plexus blow to the sensibilities certainly by this time an unnecessary part of the film Usually every soul movement carefully built up to where the punch begins is forgotten in the material smash or rescue It is not so bad in this case but it is a too conventional proceeding for Griffith The boy flees interminably to a barn too far away There is a siege by a posse led by the detective It is veritable border warfare The Italian leads an unsuccessful rescue party The unfortunate youth finally hangs himself The beautiful Annabel bursts through the siege a moment too late then heart broken kills herself These things are carried out by good technicians But it would have been better to have had the suicide with but a tiny part of the battle and the story five reels long instead of six This physical turmoil is carried into the spiritual world only by the psychic momentum acquired through the previous confession scene The one thing with intrinsic pictorial heart power is the death of Annabel by jumping off the sea cliff Then comes the awakening To every one who sees the film for the first time it is like the forgiveness of sins The boy finds his uncle still alive In revulsion from himself he takes the old man into his arms The uncle has already begun to be ashamed of his terrible words and has prayed for a contrite heart The radiant Annabel is shown in the early dawn rising and hurrying to her lover in spite of her pride She will bravely take back her last night s final word She cannot live without him The uncle makes amends to the girl The three are in the inconsistent but very human mood of sweet forgiveness for love s sake that sometimes overtakes the bitterest of us after some crisis in our days The happy pair are shown walking through the hills Thrown upon the clouds for them are the moods of the poet lover s heart They look into the woods and see his fancies of Spring the things that he will some day write These pageants might be longer They furnish the great climax They make a consistent parallel and contrast with the ghoul visions that end with the confession to the detective They wipe that terror from the mind They do not represent Poe The rabbits the leopard the fairies Cupid and Psyche in the clouds and the little loves from the hollow trees are contributions to the original poetry of the eye Finally the central part of this production of the Avenging Conscience is no dilution of Poe but an adequate interpretation a story he might have written Those who have the European respect for Poe s work will be most apt to be satisfied with this section including the photographic texture which may be said to be an authentic equivalent of his prose How often Poe has been primly patronized for his majestic quality the wizard power which looms above all his method and subject matter and furnishes the only reason for its existence For Griffith to embroider this Poe Interpretation in the centre of a fairly consistent fabric and move on into a radiant climax of his own that is in organic relation to the whole is an achievement indeed The final criticism is that the play is derivative It is not built from new material in all its parts as was the original story One must be a student of Poe to get its ultimate flavor But in reading Poe s own stories one need not be a reader of any one special preceding writer to get the strange and solemn exultation of that literary enchanter He is the quintessence of his own lonely soul Though the wizard element is paramount in the Poe episode of this film the appeal to the conscience is only secondary to this It is keener than in Poe owing to the human elements before and after The Chameleon producer approximates in The Avenging Conscience the type of mystic teacher discussed in the twentieth chapter The Prophet Wizard CHAPTER XI ARCHITECTURE IN MOTION This chapter is a superstructure upon the foundations of chapters five six and seven I have said that it is a quality not a defect of the photoplays that while the actors tend to become types and hieroglyphics and dolls on the other hand dolls and hieroglyphics and mechanisms tend to become human By an extension of this principle non human tones textures lines and spaces take on a vitality almost like that of flesh and blood It is partly for this reason that some energy is hereby given to the matter of reenforcing the idea that the people with the proper training to take the higher photoplays in hand are not veteran managers of vaudeville circuits but rather painters sculptors and architects preferably those who are in the flush of their first reputation in these crafts Let us imagine the centres of the experimental drama such as the Drama League the Universities and the stage societies calling in people of these professions and starting photoplay competitions and enterprises Let the thesis be here emphasized that the architects above all are the men to advance the work in the ultra creative photoplay But few architects you say are creative even in their own profession Let us begin with the point of view of the highly trained pedantic young builder the type that in the past few years has honored our landscape with those paradoxical memorials of Abraham Lincoln the railsplitter memorials whose Ionic columns are straight from Paris Pericles is the real hero of such a man not Lincoln So let him for the time surrender completely to that great Greek He is worthy of a monument nobler than any America has set up to any one The final pictures may be taken in front of buildings with which the architect or his favorite master has already edified this republic or if the war is over before some surviving old world models But whatever the method let him study to express at last the thing that moves within him as a creeping fire which Americans do not yet understand and the loss of which makes the classic in our architecture a mere piling of elegant stones upon one another In the arrangement of crowds and flow of costuming and study of tableau climaxes let the architect bring an illusion of that delicate flowering that brilliant instant of time before the Peloponnesian war It does not seem impossible when one remembers the achievements of the author of Cabiria in approximating Rome and Carthage Let the principal figure of the pageant be the virgin Athena walking as a presence visible only to us yet among her own people and robed and armed and panoplied the guardian of Pericles appearing in those streets that were herself Let the architect show her as she came only in a vision to Phidias while the dramatic writers and mathematicians and poets and philosophers go by The crowds should be like pillars of Athens and she like a great pillar The crowds should be like the tossing waves of the Ionic Sea and Athena like the white ship upon the waves The audiences in the tragedies should be shown like wheat fields on the hill sides always stately yet blown by the wind and Athena the one sower and reaper Crowds should descend the steps of the Acropolis nymphs and fauns and Olympians carved as it were from the marble yet flowing like a white cataract down into the town bearing with them Athena their soul All this in the Photoplay of Pericles No civic or national incarnation since that time appeals to the poets like the French worship of the Maid of Orleans In Percy MacKaye s book The Present Hour he says on the French attitude toward the war Half artist and half anchorite Part siren and part Socrates Her face alluring fair yet recondite Smiled through her salons and academies Lightly she wore her double mask Till sudden at war s kindling spark Her inmost self in shining mail and casque Blazed to the world her single soul Jeanne d Arc To make a more elaborate showing of what is meant by architecture in motion let us progress through the centuries and suppose that the builder has this enthusiasm for France that he is slowly setting about to build a photoplay around the idea of the Maid First let him take the mural painting point of view Bear in mind these characteristics of that art it is wall painting that is an organic part of the surface on which it appears it is on the same lines as the building and adapted to the colors and forms of the structure of which it is a part The wall splendors of America that are the most scattered about in inexpensive copies are the decorations of the Boston Public Library Note the pillar like quality of Sargent s prophets the solemn dignity of Abbey s Holy Grail series the grand horizontals and perpendiculars of the work of Puvis de Chavannes The last is the orthodox mural painter of the world but the other two will serve the present purpose also These architectural paintings if they were dramatized still retaining their powerful lines would be three exceedingly varied examples of what is meant by architecture in motion The visions that appear to Jeanne d Arc might be delineated in the mood of some one of these three painters The styles will not mix in the same episode A painter from old time we mention here not because he was orthodox but because of his genius for the drawing of action and because he covered tremendous wall spaces with Venetian tone and color is Tintoretto If there is a mistrust that the mural painting standard will tend to destroy the sense of action Tintoretto will restore confidence in that regard As the Winged Victory represents flying in sculpture so his work is the extreme example of action with the brush The Venetians called him the furious painter One must understand a man through his admirers So explore Ruskin s sayings on Tintoretto I have a dozen moving picture magazine clippings which are in their humble way first or second cousins of mural paintings I will describe but two since the method of selection has already been amply indicated and the reader can find his own examples For a Crowd Picture for instance here is a scene at a masquerade ball The glitter of the costumes is an extension of the glitter of the candelabra overhead The people are as it were chandeliers hung lower down The lines of the candelabra relate to the very ribbon streamers of the heroine and the massive wood work is the big brother of the square shouldered heroes in the foreground though one is a clown one is a Russian Duke and one is Don Caesar De Bazan The building is the father of the people These relations can be kept in the court scenes of the production of Jeanne d Arc Here is a night picture from a war story in which the light is furnished by two fires whose coals and brands are hidden by earth heaped in front The sentiment of tenting on the old camp ground pervades the scene The far end of the line of those keeping bivouac disappears into the distance and the depths of the ranks behind them fade into the thick shadows The flag a little above the line catches the light One great tree overhead spreads its leafless half lit arms through the gloom Behind all this is unmitigated black The composition reminds one of a Hiroshige study of midnight These men are certainly a part of the architecture of out of doors and mysterious as the vault of Heaven This type of a camp fire is possible in our Jeanne d Arc These pictures new and old great and unknown indicate some of the standards of judgment and types of vision whereby our conception of the play is to be evolved By what means shall we block it in Our friend Tintoretto made use of methods which are here described from one of his biographers W Roscoe Osler They have been much enlarged upon in the different biographies as the means whereby Tintoretto obtained his power They constituted however his habitual method of determining the effect and general grouping of his compositions He moulded with extreme care small models of his figures in wax and clay Titian and other painters as well as Tintoretto employed this method as the means of determining the light and shade of their design Afterwards the later stages of their work were painted from the life But in Tintoretto s compositions the position and arrangement of his figures as he began to dwell upon his great conceptions were such as to render the study from the living model a matter of great difficulty and at times an impossibility He modelled his sculptures imparting to his models a far more complete character than had been customary These firmly moulded figures sometimes draped sometimes free he suspended in a box made of wood or of cardboard for his smaller work in whose walls he made an aperture to admit a lighted candle He sits moving the light about amidst his assemblage of figures Every aspect of sublimity of light suitable to a Madonna surrounded with angels or a heavenly choir finds its miniature response among the figures as the light moves This was the method by which in conjunction with a profound study of outward nature sympathy with the beauty of different types of face and varieties of form with the many changing hues of the Venetian scene with the great laws of color and a knowledge of literature and history he was able to shadow forth his great imagery of the intuitional world This method of Tintoretto suggests several possible derivatives in the preparation of motion pictures Let the painters and sculptors be now called upon for painting models and sculptural models while the architect already present supplies the architectural models all three giving us visible scenarios to furnish the cardinal motives for the acting from which the amateur photoplay company of the university can begin their interpretation For episodes that follow the precedent of the simple Action Film tiny wax models of the figures toned and costumed to the heart s delight would tell the high points of the story Let them represent perhaps seven crucial situations from the proposed photoplay Let them be designed as uniquely in their dresses as are the Russian dancers dresses by Leon Bakst Then to alternate with these seven little paintings of episodes designed in blacks whites and grays each representing some elusive point in the intimate aspects of the story Let there be a definite system of space and texture relations retained throughout the set The models for the splendor scenes would of course be designed by the architect and these other scenes alternated with and subordinated to his work The effects which he would conceive would be on a grander scale The models for these might be mere extensions of the methods of those others but in the typical and highest let us imagine ourselves going beyond Tintoretto in preparation Let the principal splendor moods and effects be indicated by actual structures such miniatures as architects offer along with their plans of public buildings but transfigured beyond that standard by the light of inspiration combined with experimental candle light spot light sunlight or torchlight They must not be conceived as stage arrangements of wax figures with harmonious and fitting backgrounds but as backgrounds that clamor for utterance through the figures in front of them as Athens finds her soul in the Athena with which we began These three sorts of models properly harmonized should have with them a written scenario constructed to indicate all the scenes between The scenario will lead up to these models for climaxes and hold them together in the celestial hurdle race We have in our museums some definite architectural suggestions as to the style of these models There are in Blackstone Hall in the Chicago Art Institute several great Romanesque and Gothic portals pillars and statues that might tell directly upon certain settings of our Jeanne d Arc pageant They are from Notre Dame du Port at Clermont Ferrand the Abbey church of saint Gilles the Abbey of Charlieu the Cathedral of Amiens Notre Dame at Paris the Cathedral of Bordeaux and the Cathedral of Rheims Perhaps the object I care for most in the Metropolitan Museum New York is the complete model of Notre Dame Paris by M Joly Why was this model of Notre Dame made with such exquisite pains Certainly not as a matter of mere information or cultivation I venture the first right these things have to be taken care of in museums is to stimulate to new creative effort I went to look over the Chicago collection with a friend and poet Arthur Davison Ficke He said something to this effect The first thing I see when I look at these fragments is the whole cathedral in all its original proportions Then I behold the mediaeval marketplace hunched against the building burying the foundations the life of man growing rank and weedlike around it Then I see the bishop coming from the door with his impressive train But a crusade may go by on the way to the Holy Land A crusade may come home battered and in rags I get the sense of life as of a rapid in a river flowing round a great rock The cathedral stands for the age long meditation of the ascetics in the midst of battling tribes This brooding architecture has a blood brotherhood with the meditating saint seeing Jeanne d Arc There is in the Metropolitan Museum a large and famous canvas painted by the dying Bastien Lepage Jeanne Listening to the Voices It is a picture of which the technicians and the poets are equally enamored The tale of Jeanne d Arc could be told carrying this particular peasant girl through the story And for a piece of architectural pageantry akin to the photoplay ballroom scene already described yet far above it there is nothing more apt for our purpose than the painting by Boutet de Monvel filling the space at the top of the stair at the Chicago Art Institute Though the Bastien Lepage is a large painting this is many times the size It shows Joan s visit at the court of Chinon It is big without being empty It conveys a glitter which expresses one of the things that is meant by the phrase Splendor Photoplay But for moving picture purposes it is the Bastien Lepage Joan that should appear here set in dramatic contrast to the Boutet de Monvel Court Two valuable neighbors to whom I have read this chapter suggest that the whole Boutet de Monvel illustrated child s book about our heroine could be used on this grand scale for a background The Inness room at the Chicago Art Institute is another school for the meditative producer if he would evolve his tribute to France on American soil Though no photoplay tableau has yet approximated the brush of Inness why not attempt to lead Jeanne through an Inness landscape The Bastien Lepage trees are in France But here is an American world in which one could see visions and hear voices Where is the inspired camera that will record something of what Inness beheld Thus much for the atmosphere and trappings of our Jeanne d Arc scenario Where will we get our story It should of course be written from the ground up for this production but as good Americans we would probably find a mass of suggestions in Mark Twain s Joan of Arc Quite recently a moving picture company sent its photographers to Springfield Illinois and produced a story with our city for a background using our social set for actors Backed by the local commercial association for whose benefit the thing was made the resources of the place were at the command of routine producers Springfield dressed its best and acted with fair skill The heroine was a charming debutante the hero the son of Governor Dunne The Mine Owner s Daughter was at best a mediocre photoplay But this type of social artistic event that happened once may be attempted a hundred times each time slowly improving Which brings us to something that is in the end very far from The Mine Owner s Daughter By what scenario method the following film or series of films is to be produced I will not venture to say No doubt the way will come if once the dream has a sufficient hold I have long maintained that my home town should have a goddess like Athena The legend should be forthcoming The producer while not employing armies should use many actors and the tale be told with the same power with which the productions of Judith of Bethulia and The Battle Hymn of the Republic were evolved While the following story may not be the form which Springfield civic religion will ultimately take it is here recorded as a second cousin of the dream that I hope will some day be set forth Late in an afternoon in October a light is seen in the zenith like a dancing star The clouds form round it in the approximation of a circle Now there becomes visible a group of heads and shoulders of presences that are looking down through the ring of clouds watching the star like giant children that peep down a well The jewel descends by four sparkling chains so far away they look to be dewy threads of silk As the bright mystery grows larger it appears to be approaching the treeless hill of Washington Park a hill that is surrounded by many wooded ridges The people come running from everywhere to watch Here indeed will be a Crowd Picture with as many phases as a stormy ocean Flying machines appear from the Fair Ground north of the city and circle round and round as they go up trying to reach the slowly descending plummet At last while the throng cheers one bird man has attained it He brings back his message that the gift is an image covered loosely with a wrapping that seems to be of spun gold Now the many aviators whirl round the descending wonder like seagulls playing about a ship s mast Soon amid an awestruck throng the image is on the hillock The golden chains and the giant children holding them there above have melted into threads of mist and nothingness The shining wrapping falls away The people look upon a seated statue of marble and gold There is a branch of wrought gold maple leaves in her hands Then beside the image is a fluttering transfigured presence of which the image seems to be a representation This spirit carrying a living maple branch in her hand says to the people Men and Women of Springfield this carving is the Lady Springfield sent by your Lord from Heaven Build no canopy over her Let her ever be under the prairie sky Do her perpetual honor The messenger who is the soul and voice of Springfield fades into the crowd to emerge on great and terrible occasions This is only one story Round this public event let the photoplay romancer weave what tales of private fortune he will narratives bound up with the events of that October day as the story of Nathan and Naomi is woven into Judith of Bethulia Henceforth the city officers are secular priests of Our Lady Springfield Their failure in duty is a profanation of her name A yearly pledge of the first voters is taken in her presence like the old Athenian oath of citizenship The seasonal pageants march to the statue s feet scattering flowers The important outdoor festivals are given on the edge of her hill All the roads lead to her footstool Pilgrims come from the Seven Seas to look upon her face that is carved by Invisible Powers Moreover the living messenger that is her actual soul appears in dreams or visions of the open day when the days are dark for the city when her patriots are irresolute and her children are put to shame This spirit with the maple branch rallies them leads them to victories like those that were won of old in the name of Jeanne d Arc or Pallas Athena herself CHAPTER XII THIRTY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PHOTOPLAYS AND THE STAGE 
2624-88360-0000	train-other-500	The stage is dependent upon three lines of tradition first that of Greece and Rome that came down through the French Second the English style ripened from the miracle play and the Shakespearian stage And third the Ibsen precedent from Norway
2624-88360-0001	train-other-500	now so firmly established it is classic These methods are obscured by the commercialized dramas but they are behind them all Let us discuss for illustration the Ibsen tradition Ibsen is generally the vitriolic foe of pageant
2624-88360-0002	train-other-500	He must be read aloud He stands for the spoken word for the iron power of life that may be concentrated in a phrase like the All or nothing of Brand Though Peer Gynt has its spectacular side Ibsen generally comes in through the ear alone
2624-88360-0003	train-other-500	He can be acted in essentials from end to end with one table and four chairs in any parlor The alleged punch with which the movie culminates has occurred three or ten years before the Ibsen curtain goes up
2624-88360-0004	train-other-500	At the close of every act of the dramas of this Norwegian one might inscribe on the curtain This the magnificent moving picture cannot achieve Likewise after every successful film described in this book
2624-88360-0005	train-other-500	could be inscribed This the trenchant Ibsen cannot do But a photoplay of Ghosts came to our town The humor of the prospect was the sort too deep for tears My pastor and I
none	none	 reread the William Archer translation 
2624-88360-0006	train-other-500	that we might be alert for every antithesis Together we went to the services Since then the film has been furiously denounced by the literati Floyd Dell s discriminating assault upon it is quoted in Current Opinion October nineteen fifteen
2624-88360-0007	train-other-500	and Margaret Anderson prints a denunciation of it in a recent number of The Little Review
none	none	 But it is not such a bad film in itself 
2624-88360-0008	train-other-500	It is not Ibsen It should be advertised The Iniquities of the Fathers an American drama of Eugenics in a Palatial Setting Henry Walthall as Alving afterward as his son
2624-88360-0009	train-other-500	shows the men much as Ibsen outlines their characters Of course the only way to be Ibsen is to be so precisely In the new plot all is open as the day
2624-88360-0010	train-other-500	The world is welcome and generally present when the man or his son go forth to see the elephant and hear the owl Provincial hypocrisy is not implied
none	none	 But Ibsen can scarcely exist without an atmosphere of secrecy 
2624-88360-0011	train-other-500	for his human volcanoes to burst through in the end Mary Alden as missus Alving shows in her intelligent and sensitive countenance that she has a conception of that character She does not always have the chance to act the woman written in her face
2624-88360-0012	train-other-500	the tart thinking handsome creature that Ibsen prefers Nigel Debrullier looks the buttoned up Pastor Manders even to caricature But the crawling bootlicking carpenter Jacob Engstrand is changed into a respectable guileless man with an income
2624-88360-0013	train-other-500	And his wife and daughter are helpless conventional upper class rabbits They do not remind one of the saucy originals The original Ibsen drama is the result of mixing up five particular characters through three acts
2624-88360-0014	train-other-500	There is not a situation but would go to pieces if one personality were altered Here are two sadly tampered with Engstrand and his daughter Here is the mother who is only referred to in Ibsen
2624-88360-0015	train-other-500	Here is the elder Alving who disappears before the original play starts So the twenty great Ibsen situations in the stage production are gone One new crisis has an Ibsen irony and psychic tension
2624-88360-0016	train-other-500	The boy is taken with the dreaded intermittent pains in the back of his head He is painting the order that is to make him famous the King s portrait While the room empties of people he writhes on the floor
none	none	 If this were all it would have been one more moving picture failure to put through a tragic scene 
2624-88360-0017	train-other-500	But the thing is reiterated in tableau symbol He is looking sideways in terror A hairy arm with clutching demon claws comes thrusting in toward the back of his neck He writhes in deadly fear The audience
2624-88360-0018	train-other-500	is appalled for him This visible clutch of heredity is the nearest equivalent that is offered for the whispered refrain Ghosts in the original masterpiece This hand should
2624-88360-0019	train-other-500	also be reiterated as a refrain three times at least before this tableau each time more dreadful and threatening It appears but the once and has no chance to become a part of the accepted hieroglyphics of the piece as it should be
2624-88360-0020	train-other-500	to realize its full power The father s previous sins have been acted out The boy s consequent struggle with the malady has been traced step by step so the play should end here It would then be a rough equivalent of the Ibsen irony in a contrary medium
none	none	 Instead of that it wanders on through paraphrases of scraps of the play sometimes literal then quite alien on to the alleged 
2624-88360-0021	train-other-500	motion picture punch when the Doctor is the god from the machine There is no doctor on the stage in the original Ghosts But there is a physician in the Doll s House a scientific quietly moving oracle crisp Spartan sophisticated
2624-88360-0022	train-other-500	Is this photoplay physician such a one The boy and his half sister are in their wedding clothes in the big church Pastor Manders is saying the ceremony The audience and building are indeed showy
2624-88360-0023	train-other-500	The doctor charges up the aisle at the moment people are told to speak or forever hold their peace He has tact He simply breaks up the marriage right there He does not tell the guests why But he takes the wedding party into the pastor s study
none	none	 and there blazes at the bride and groom the long suppressed truth that they are brother and sister 
2624-88360-0024	train-other-500	Always an orotund man he has the Chautauqua manner indeed in this exigency He brings to one s mind the tearful book much loved in childhood Parted at the Altar or Why Was it Thus
2624-88360-0025	train-other-500	And four able actors have the task of telling the audience by facial expression only that they have been struck by moral lightning They stand in a row facing the people endeavoring to make the crisis of an alleged Ibsen play out of a crashing melodrama
none	none	 The final death of young Alving is depicted with an approximation of Ibsen s mood But the only ways to suggest such feelings in silence do not convey them in full to the audience but merely narrate them 
2624-88360-0026	train-other-500	Wherever in Ghosts we have quiet voices that are like the slow drip of hydrochloric acid in the photoplay we have no quiet gestures that will do trenchant work Instead
2624-88360-0027	train-other-500	there are endless writhings and rushings about done with a deal of skill but destructive of the last remnants of Ibsen Up past the point of the clutching hand this film is the prime example for study for the person who would know once for all
2624-88360-0028	train-other-500	the differences between the photoplays and the stage dramas Along with it might be classed missus Fiske s decorative moving picture Tess in which there is every determination to convey the original missus Fiske illusion without her voice and breathing presence
2624-88360-0029	train-other-500	To people who know her well it is a surprisingly good tintype of our beloved friend for the family album The relentless Thomas Hardy is nowhere to be found There are two moments of dramatic life set among many of delicious pictorial quality
2624-88360-0030	train-other-500	when Tess baptizes her child and when she smooths its little grave with a wavering hand But in the stage version the dramatic poignancy begins with the going up of the curtain and lasts till it descends The prime example of complete failure
2624-88360-0031	train-other-500	is Sarah Bernhardt s Camille It is indeed a tintype of the consumptive heroine with every group entire and taken at full length Much space is occupied by the floor and the overhead portions of the stage setting It lasts as long as would the spoken performance
2624-88360-0032	train-other-500	and wherever there is a dialogue we must imagine said conversation if we can It might be compared to watching Camille from the top gallery through smoked glass with one s ears stopped with cotton
2624-88360-0033	train-other-500	It would be well for the beginning student to find some way to see the first two of these three or some other attempts to revamp the classic for instance missus Fiske s painstaking reproduction of Vanity Fair
2624-88360-0034	train-other-500	bearing in mind the list of differences which this chapter now furnishes There is no denying that many stage managers who have taken up photoplays are struggling with the Shakespearian French and Norwegian traditions in the new medium
2624-88360-0035	train-other-500	Many of the moving pictures discussed in this book are rewritten stage dramas and one Judith of Bethulia is a pronounced success But in order to be real photoplays the stage dramas must be overhauled indeed turned inside out and upside down
2624-88360-0036	train-other-500	The successful motion picture expresses itself through mechanical devices that are being evolved every hour Upon those many new bits of machinery are founded novel methods of combination in another field of logic not dramatic logic but tableau logic But the old line managers
2624-88360-0037	train-other-500	taking up photoplays begin by making curious miniatures of stage presentations They try to have most things as before Later they take on the moving picture technique in a superficial way but they and the host of talented actors in the prime of life and Broadway success
2624-88360-0038	train-other-500	retain the dramatic state of mind It is a principle of criticism the world over that the distinctions between the arts must be clearly marked even by those who afterwards mix those arts
2624-88360-0039	train-other-500	Take for instance the perpetual quarrel between the artists and the half educated about literary painting Whistler fought that battle in England He tried to beat it into the head of John Bull that a painting is one thing a mere illustration for a story another thing
2624-88360-0040	train-other-500	But the novice is always stubborn To him Hindu and Arabic are both foreign languages therefore just alike The book illustration may be said to come in through the ear by reading the title aloud in imagination
2624-88360-0041	train-other-500	And the other is effective with no title at all The scenario writer who will study to the bottom of the matter in Whistler s Gentle Art of Making Enemies will be equipped to welcome the distinction between the old fashioned stage where the word rules and the photoplay
2624-88360-0042	train-other-500	where splendor and ritual are all It is not the same distinction but a kindred one But let us consider the details of the matter The stage has its exits and entrances at the side and back The standard photoplays
2624-88360-0043	train-other-500	have their exits and entrances across the imaginary footlight line even in the most stirring mob and battle scenes In Judith of Bethulia though the people seem to be coming from everywhere and going everywhere when we watch close we see that the individuals enter at the near right hand corner
2624-88360-0044	train-other-500	and exit at the near left hand corner or enter at the near left hand corner and exit at the near right hand corner Consider the devices whereby the stage actor holds the audience as he goes out at the side and back He sighs gestures howls and strides
none	none	 With what studious preparation he ripens his quietness if he goes out that way In the new contraption the moving picture the hero or villain in exit strides past the nose of the camera growing much bigger than a human being marching toward us as though he would step on our heads disappearing when largest There is an explosive power about the mildest motion picture exit be the actor skilful or the reverse 
2624-88360-0045	train-other-500	The people left in the scene are pygmies compared with each disappearing cyclops Likewise when the actor enters again his mechanical importance is overwhelming Therefore for his first entrance the motion picture star does not require the preparations that are made on the stage
none	none	 The support does not need to warm the spectators to the problem then talk them into surrender When the veteran stage producer as a beginning photoplay producer tries to give us a dialogue in the motion pictures he makes it so dull no one follows He does not realize 
2624-88360-0046	train-other-500	that his camera born opportunity to magnify persons and things instantly to interweave them as actors on one level to alternate scenes at the slightest whim
none	none	 are the big substitutes for dialogue 
2624-88360-0047	train-other-500	By alternating scenes rapidly flash after flash cottage field mountain top field mountain top cottage we have a conversation between three places rather than three persons By alternating the picture of a man
2624-88360-0048	train-other-500	and the check he is forging we have his soliloquy When two people talk to each other it is by lifting and lowering objects rather than their voices The collector presents a bill the adventurer shows him the door
none	none	 The boy plucks a rose the girl accepts it 
2624-88360-0049	train-other-500	Moving objects not moving lips make the words of the photoplay The old fashioned stage producer feeling he is getting nowhere but still helpless puts the climax of some puzzling lip debate often the climax of the whole film as a sentence on the screen
2624-88360-0050	train-other-500	Sentences should be used to show changes of time and place and a few such elementary matters before the episode is fully started The climax of a motion picture scene cannot be one word or fifty words
2624-88360-0051	train-other-500	As has been discussed in connection with Cabiria the crisis must be an action sharper than any that has gone before in organic union with a tableau more beautiful than any that has preceded the breaking of the tenth wave upon the sand
2624-88360-0052	train-other-500	Such remnants of pantomimic dialogue as remain in the main chase of the photoplay film are but guide posts in the race toward the goal They should not be elaborate toll gates of plot to be laboriously lifted and lowered while the horses stop mid career
2624-88360-0053	train-other-500	The Venus of Milo that comes directly to the soul through the silence requires no quotation from Keats to explain her though Keats is the equivalent in verse Her setting in the great French Museum is enough We do not know that her name is Venus
2624-88360-0054	train-other-500	She is thought by many to be another statue of Victory We may some day evolve scenarios that will require nothing more than a title thrown upon the screen at the beginning they come to the eye so perfectly This is not the only possible sort
2624-88360-0055	train-other-500	but the self imposed limitation in certain films might give them a charm akin to that of the Songs without Words
none	none	 The stage audience is a unit of three hundred or a thousand 
2624-88360-0056	train-other-500	In the beginning of the first act there is much moving about and extra talk on the part of the actors to hold the crowd while it is settling down
none	none	 and enable the late comer to be in his seat before the vital part of the story starts 
2624-88360-0057	train-other-500	If he appears later he is glared at In the motion picture art gallery on the other hand the audience is around two hundred and these are not a unit and the only crime is to obstruct the line of vision The high school girls can do a moderate amount of giggling without breaking the spell
2624-88360-0058	train-other-500	There is no spell in the stage sense to break People can climb over each other s knees to get in or out If the picture is political they murmur war cries to one another If the film suggests what some of the neighbors have been doing they can regale each other with the richest sewing society report
2624-88360-0059	train-other-500	The people in the motion picture audience total about two hundred any time but they come in groups of two or three at no specified hour The newcomers do not as in Vaudeville make themselves part of a jocular army Strictly as individuals they judge the panorama
2624-88360-0060	train-other-500	If they disapprove there is grumbling under their breath but no hissing I have never heard an audience in a photoplay theatre clap its hands even when the house was bursting with people Yet they often see the film through twice
none	none	 When they have had enough they stroll home 
2624-88360-0061	train-other-500	They manifest their favorable verdict by sending some other member of the family to see the picture If the people so delegated are likewise satisfied they may ask the man at the door if he is going to bring it back That is the moving picture kind of cheering
2624-88360-0062	train-other-500	It was a theatrical sin when the old fashioned stage actor was rendered unimportant by his scenery But the motion picture actor is but the mood of the mob or the landscape or the department store behind him reduced to a single hieroglyphic
2624-88360-0063	train-other-500	The stage interior is large The motion picture interior is small The stage out of door scene is at best artificial and little and is generally at rest or its movement is tainted with artificiality The waves dash but not dashingly
2624-88360-0064	train-other-500	the water flows but not flowingly The motion picture out of door scene is as big as the universe And only pictures of the Sahara are without magnificent motion

2624-88360-0074	train-other-500	The display of the name of the corporation is no substitute for giving the glory to the producer An artistic photoplay is not the result of a military efficiency system It is not a factory made staple article but the product of the creative force of one soul

2624-88360-0078	train-other-500	And this rule may apply to the stage But by comparison to motion picture performers stage actors are their own managers for they have an approximate notion of how they look in the eye of the audience which is but the human eye They can hear and gauge their own voices They have the same ears as their listeners

cannot but respect My neighbor classes this discussion of hieroglyphics as a fanciful flight rather than a sober argument I submit the verdict then struggle against it while you read The invention of the photoplay is as great a step as was the beginning of picture writing in the stone age And the cave men and women of our slums seem to be the people most affected by this novelty which is but an expression of the old in that spiral of life which is going higher while seeming to repeat the ancient phase There happens to be here on the table a book on Egypt by Rawlinson that I used to thumb long ago A footnote says The font of hieroglyphic type used in this work contains eight hundred forms But there are many other forms beside There is more light on Egypt in later works than in Rawlinson but the statement quoted will serve for our text Several complex methods of making visible scenarios are listed in this work Here is one that is mechanically simple Let the man searching for tableau combinations even if he is of the practical commercial type prepare himself with eight hundred signs from Egypt He can construct the outlines of his scenarios by placing these little pictures in rows It may not be impractical to cut his hundreds of them from black cardboard and shuffle them on his table every morning The list will contain all elementary and familiar things Let him first give the most literal meaning to the patterns Then if he desires to rise above the commercial field let him turn over each cardboard making the white undersurface uppermost and there write a more abstract meaning of the hieroglyphic one that has a fairly close relation to his way of thinking about the primary form From a proper balance of primary and secondary meanings photoplays with souls could come Not that he must needs become an expert Egyptologist Yet it would profit any photoplay man to study to think like the Egyptians the great picture writing people There is as much reason for this course as for the Bible student s apprenticeship in Hebrew Hieroglyphics can prove their worth even without the help of an Egyptian history Humorous and startling analogies can be pointed out by opening the Standard Dictionary page fifty nine Look under the word alphabet There is the diagram of the evolution of inscriptions from the Egyptian and Phoenician idea of what letters should be on through the Greek and Roman systems In the Egyptian row is the picture of a throne Illustration that has its equivalent in the Roman letter C And a throne has as much place in what might be called the moving picture alphabet as the letter C has in ours There are sometimes three thrones in this small town of Springfield in an evening When you see one flashed on the screen you know instantly you are dealing with royalty or its implications The last one I saw that made any particular impression was when Mary Pickford acted in Such a Little Queen I only wished then that she had a more convincing throne Let us cut one out of black cardboard Turning the cardboard over to write on it the spirit meaning we inscribe some such phrase as The Throne of Wisdom or The Throne of Liberty Here is the hieroglyphic of a hand Illustration Roman equivalent the letter D The human hand magnified till it is as big as the whole screen is as useful in the moving picture alphabet as the letter D in the printed alphabet This hand may open a lock It may pour poison in a bottle It may work a telegraph key Then turning the white side of the cardboard uppermost we inscribe something to the effect that this hand may write on the wall as at the feast of Belshazzar Or it may represent some such conception as Rodin s Hand of God discussed in the Sculpture in motion chapter Here is a duck Illustration Roman equivalent the letter Z In the motion pictures this bird a somewhat z shaped animal suggests the finality of Arcadian peace It is the last and fittest ornament of the mill pond Nothing very terrible can happen with a duck in the foreground There is no use turning it over It would take Maeterlinck or Swedenborg to find the mystic meaning of a duck A duck looks to me like a caricature of an alderman Here is a sieve Illustration Roman equivalent H A sieve placed on the kitchen table close up suggests domesticity hired girl humors broad farce We will expect the bride to make her first cake or the flour to begin to fly into the face of the intrusive ice man But as to the other side of the cardboard the sieve has its place in higher symbolism It has been recorded by many a sage and singer that the Almighty Powers sift men like wheat Here is the picture of a bowl Illustration Roman equivalent the letter K A bowl seen through the photoplay window on the cottage table suggests Johnny s early supper of bread and milk But as to the white side of the cardboard out of a bowl of kindred form Omar may take his moonlit wine or the higher gods may lift up the very wine of time to the lips of men as Swinburne sings in Atalanta in Calydon Here is a lioness Illustration Roman equivalent the letter L The lion or lioness creeps through the photoplay jungle to give the primary picture word of terror in this new universal alphabet The present writer has seen several valuable lions unmistakably shot and killed in the motion pictures and charged up to profit and loss just as steam engines or houses are sometimes blown up or burned down But of late there is a disposition to use the trained lion or lioness for all sorts of effects No doubt the king and queen of beasts will become as versatile and humbly useful as the letter L itself that is in the commonplace routine photoplay We turn the cardboard over and the lion becomes a resource of glory and terror a symbol of cruel persecutions or deathless courage sign of the zodiac that Poe in Ulalume calls the Lair of the Lion Here is an owl Illustration Roman equivalent the letter M The only use of the owl I can record is to be inscribed on the white surface In The Avenging Conscience as described in chapter ten the murderer marks the ticking of the heart of his victim while watching the swinging of the pendulum of the old clock then in watching the tapping of the detective s pencil on the table then in the tapping of his foot on the floor Finally a handsome owl is shown in the branches outside hoot hooting in time with the action of the pencil and the pendulum and the dead man s heart But here is a wonderful thing an actual picture that has lived on retaining its ancient imitative sound and form Illustration the letter N the drawing of a wave with the sound of a wave still within it One could well imagine the Nile in the winds of the dawn making such a sound NN N N lapping at the reeds upon its banks Certainly the glittering water scenes are a dominant part of moving picture Esperanto On the white reverse of the symbol the spiritual meaning of water will range from the metaphor of the purity of the dew to the sea as a sign of infinity Here is a window with closed shutters Illustration Latin equivalent the letter P It is a reminder of the technical outline of this book The Intimate Photoplay as I have said is but a window where we open the shutters and peep into some one s cottage As to the soul meaning in the opening or closing of the shutters it ranges from Noah s opening the hatches to send forth the dove to the promises of blessing when the Windows of Heaven should be opened Here is the picture of an angle Illustration Latin equivalent Q This is another reminder of the technical outline The photoplay interior as has been reiterated is small and three cornered Here the heroine does her plotting flirting and primping et cetera I will leave the spiritual interpretation of the angle to Emerson Swedenborg or Maeterlinck Here is the picture of a mouth Illustration Latin equivalent the letter R If we turn from the dictionary to the monuments we will see that the Egyptians used all the human features in their pictures We do not separate the features as frequently as did that ancient people but we conventionalize them as often Nine tenths of the actors have faces as fixed as the masks of the Greek chorus they have the hero mask with the protruding chin the villain frown the comedian grin the fixed innocent girl simper These formulas have their place in the broad effects of Crowd Pictures and in comedies Then there are sudden abandonments of the mask Griffith s pupils Henry Walthall and Blanche Sweet seem to me to be the greatest people in the photoplays for one reason their faces are as sensitive to changing emotion as the surfaces of fair lakes in the wind There is a passage in Enoch Arden where Annie impersonated by Lillian Gish another pupil of Griffith is waiting in suspense for the return of her husband She changes from lips of waiting with a touch of apprehension to a delighted laugh of welcome her head making a half turn toward the door The audience is so moved by the beauty of the slow change they do not know whether her face is the size of the screen or the size of a postage stamp As a matter of fact it fills the whole end of the theatre Thus much as to faces that are not hieroglyphics Yet fixed facial hieroglyphics have many legitimate uses For instance in The Avenging Conscience as the play works toward the climax and the guilty man is breaking down the eye of the detective is thrown on the screen with all else hid in shadow a watching relentless eye And this suggests a special talisman of the old Egyptians a sign called the Eyes of Horus meaning the all beholding sun Here is the picture of an inundated garden Illustration Latin equivalent the letter S In our photoplays the garden is an ever present resource and at an instant s necessity suggests the glory of nature or sweet privacy and kindred things The Egyptian lotus garden had to be inundated to be a success Ours needs but the hired man with the hose who sometimes supplies broad comedy But we turn over the cardboard for the deeper meaning of this hieroglyphic Our gardens can as of old run the solemn range from those of Babylon to those of the Resurrection If there is one sceptic left as to the hieroglyphic significance of the photoplay let him now be discomfited by page fifty nine Standard Dictionary The last letter in this list is a lasso Illustration The equivalent of the lasso in the Roman alphabet is the letter T The crude and facetious would be apt to suggest that the equivalent of the lasso in the photoplay is the word trouble possibly for the hero but probably for the villain We turn to the other side of the symbol The noose may stand for solemn judgment and the hangman it may also symbolize the snare of the fowler temptation Then there is the spider web close kin representing the cruelty of evolution in The Avenging Conscience This list is based on the rows of hieroglyphics most readily at hand Any volume on Egypt such as one of those by Maspero has a multitude of suggestions for the man inclined to the idea If this system of pasteboard scenarios is taken literally I would like to suggest as a beginning rule that in a play based on twenty hieroglyphics nineteen should be the black realistic signs with obvious meanings and only one of them white and inexplicably strange It has been proclaimed further back in this treatise that there is only one witch in every wood And to illustrate further there is but one scarlet letter in Hawthorne s story of that name but one wine cup in all of Omar one Bluebird in Maeterlinck s play I do not insist that the prospective author producer adopt the hieroglyphic method as a routine if he but consents in his meditative hours to the point of view that it implies The more fastidious photoplay audience that uses the hieroglyphic hypothesis in analyzing the film before it will acquire a new tolerance and understanding of the avalanche of photoplay conceptions and find a promise of beauty in what have been properly classed as mediocre and stereotyped productions The nineteenth chapter has a discourse on the Book of the Dead As a connecting link with that chapter the reader will note that one of the marked things about the Egyptian wall paintings pictures on the mummy case wrappings papyrus inscriptions and architectural conceptions is that they are but enlarged hieroglyphics while the hieroglyphics are but reduced fac similes of these So when a few characters are once understood the highly colored Egyptian wall paintings of the same things are understood The hieroglyphic of Osiris is enlarged when they desire to represent him in state The hieroglyphic of the soul as a human headed hawk may be in a line of writing no taller than the capitals of this book Immediately above may be a big painting of the soul the same hawk placed with the proper care with reference to its composition on the wall a pure decoration The transition from reduction to enlargement and back again is as rapid in Egypt as in the photoplay It follows among other things that in Egypt as in China and Japan literary style and mere penmanship and brushwork are to be conceived as inseparable No doubt the Egyptian scholar was the man who could not only compose a poem but write it down with a brush Talent for poetry deftness in inscribing and skill in mural painting were probably gifts of the same person The photoplay goes back to this primitive union in styles The stages from hieroglyphics through Phoenician and Greek letters to ours are of no particular interest here But the fact that hieroglyphics can evolve is important Let us hope that our new picture alphabets can take on richness and significance as time goes on without losing their literal values They may develop into something more all pervading yet more highly wrought than any written speech Languages when they evolve produce stylists and we will some day distinguish the different photoplay masters as we now delight in the separate tang of O Henry and Mark Twain and Howells When these are ancient times we will have scholars and critics learned in the flavors of early moving picture traditions with their histories of movements and schools their grammars and anthologies Now some words as to the Anglo Saxon language and its relation to pictures In England and America our plastic arts are but beginning Yesterday we were preeminently a word civilization England built her mediaeval cathedrals but they left no legacy among craftsmen Art had to lean on imported favorites like Van Dyck till the days of Sir Joshua Reynolds and the founding of the Royal Society Consider that the friends of Reynolds were of the circle of Doctor Johnson Literary tradition had grown old Then England had her beginning of landscape gardening Later she saw the rise of Constable Ruskin and Turner and their iridescent successors Still to day in England the average leading citizen matches word against word using them as algebraic formulas rather than picture against picture when he arranges his thoughts under the eaves of his mind To step into the Art world is to step out of the beaten path of British dreams Shakespeare is still king not Rossetti nor yet Christopher Wren Moreover it was the book reading colonial who led our rebellion against the very royalty that founded the Academy The public speaking American wrote the Declaration of Independence It was not the work of the painting or cathedral building Englishman We were led by Patrick Henry the orator Benjamin Franklin the printer The more characteristic America became the less she had to do with the plastic arts The emigrant train carried many a Bible and Dictionary packed in beside the guns and axes It carried the Elizabethan writers AEsop s Fables Blackstone s Commentaries the revised statutes of Indiana Bunyan s Pilgrim s Progress Parson Weems Life of Washington But obviously there was no place for the Elgin marbles Giotto s tower could not be loaded in with the dried apples and the seedcorn Yesterday morning though our arts were growing every day we were still more of a word civilization than the English Our architectural painting and sculptural history is concerned with men now living or their immediate predecessors And even such work as we have is pretty largely a cult by the wealthy This is the more a cause for misgiving because in a democracy the arts like the political parties are not founded till they have touched the county chairman the ward leader the individual voter The museums in a democracy should go as far as the public libraries Every town has its library There are not twenty Art museums in the land Here then comes the romance of the photoplay A tribe that has thought in words since the days that it worshipped Thor and told legends of the cunning of the tongue of Loki suddenly begins to think in pictures The leaders of the people and of culture scarcely know the photoplay exists But in the remote villages the players mentioned in this work are as well known and as fairly understood in their general psychology as any candidates for president bearing political messages There is many a babe in the proletariat not over four years old who has received more pictures into its eye than it has had words enter its ear The young couple go with their first born and it sits gaping on its mother s knee Often the images are violent and unseemly a chaos of rawness and squirm but scattered through the experience is a delineation of the world Pekin and China Harvard and Massachusetts Portland and Oregon Benares and India become imaginary playgrounds By the time the hopeful has reached its geography lesson in the public school it has travelled indeed Almost any word that means a picture in the text of the geography or history or third reader is apt to be translated unconsciously into moving picture terms In the next decade simply from the development of the average eye cities akin to the beginnings of Florence will be born among us as surely as Chaucer came upon the first ripening of the English tongue after Caedmon and Beowulf Sculptors painters architects and park gardeners who now have their followers by the hundreds will have admirers by the hundred thousand The voters will respond to the aspirations of these artists as the back woodsmen followed Poor Richard s Almanac or the trappers in their coon skin caps were fired to patriotism by Patrick Henry This ends the second section of the book Were it not for the passage on The Battle Hymn of the Republic the chapters thus far might be entitled an open letter to Griffith and the producers and actors he has trained Contrary to my prudent inclinations he is the star of the piece except on one page where he is the villain This stardom came about slowly In making the final revision looking up the producers of the important reels especially those from the beginning of the photoplay business numbers of times the photoplays have turned out to be the work of this former leading man of Nance O Neil No one can pretend to a full knowledge of the films They come faster than rain in April It would take a man every day of the year working day and night to see all that come to Springfield But in the photoplay world as I understand it D W Griffith is the king figure So far in this work I have endeavored to keep to the established dogmas of Art I hope that the main lines of the argument will appeal to the people who have classified and related the beautiful works of man that have preceded the moving pictures Let the reader make his own essay on the subject for the local papers and send the clipping to me The next photoplay book that may appear from this hand may be construed to meet his point of view It will try to agree or disagree in clear language Many a controversy must come before a method of criticism is fully established BOOK III MORE PERSONAL SPECULATIONS AND AFTERTHOUGHTS NOT BROUGHT FORWARD SO DOGMATICALLY At this point I climb from the oracular platform and go down through my own chosen underbrush for haphazard adventure I renounce the platform Whatever it may be that I find pawpaw or may apple or spray of willow if you do not want it throw it over the edge of the hill without ado to the birds or squirrels or kine and do not include it in your controversial discourse It is not a part of the dogmatic system of photoplay criticism CHAPTER XIV THE ORCHESTRA CONVERSATION AND THE CENSORSHIP Whenever the photoplay is mixed in the same programme with vaudeville the moving picture part of the show suffers The film is rushed through it is battered it flickers more than commonly it is a little out of focus The house is not built for it The owner of the place cannot manage an art gallery with a circus on his hands It takes more brains than one man possesses to pick good vaudeville talent and bring good films to the town at the same time The best motion picture theatres are built for photoplays alone But they make one mistake Almost every motion picture theatre has its orchestra pianist or mechanical piano The perfect photoplay gathering place would have no sound but the hum of the conversing audience If this is too ruthless a theory let the music be played at the intervals between programmes while the advertisements are being flung upon the screen the lights are on and the people coming in If there is something more to be done on the part of the producer to make the film a telling one let it be a deeper study of the pictorial arrangement with the tones more carefully balanced the sculpture vitalized This is certainly better than to have a raw thing bullied through with a music programme furnished to bridge the weak places in the construction A picture should not be released till it is completely thought out A producer with this goal before him will not have the time or brains to spare to write music that is as closely and delicately related to the action as the action is to the background And unless the tunes are at one with the scheme they are an intrusion Perhaps the moving picture maker has a twin brother almost as able in music who possesses the faculty of subordinating his creations to the work of his more brilliant coadjutor How are they going to make a practical national distribution of the accompaniment In the metropolitan theatres Cabiria carried its own musicians and programme with a rich if feverish result In The Birth of a Nation music was used that approached imitative sound devices Also the orchestra produced a substitute for old fashioned stage suspense by long drawn out syncopations The finer photoplay values were thrown askew Perhaps these two performances could be successfully vindicated in musical policy But such a defence proves nothing in regard to the typical film Imagine either of these put on in Rochester Illinois population one hundred souls The reels run through as well as on Broadway or Michigan Avenue but the local orchestra cannot play the music furnished in annotated sheets as skilfully as the local operator can turn the reel or watch the motor turn it The big social fact about the moving picture is that it is scattered like the newspaper Any normal accompaniment thereof must likewise be adapted to being distributed everywhere The present writer has seen here in his home place population sixty thousand all the films discussed in this book but Cabiria and The Birth of a Nation It is a photoplay paradise the spoken theatre is practically banished Unfortunately the local moving picture managers think it necessary to have orchestras The musicians they can secure make tunes that are most squalid and horrible With fathomless imbecility hoochey koochey strains are on the air while heroes are dying The Miserere is in our ears when the lovers are reconciled Ragtime is imposed upon us while the old mother prays for her lost boy Sometimes the musician with this variety of sympathy abandons himself to thrilling improvisation My thoughts on this subject began to take form several years ago when the film this book has much praised The Battle Hymn of the Republic came to town The proprietor of one theatre put in front of his shop a twenty foot sign The Battle Hymn of the Republic by Harriet Beecher Stowe brought back by special request He had probably read Julia Ward Howe s name on the film forty times before the sign went up His assistant I presume his daughter played In the Shade of the Old Apple Tree hour after hour while the great film was rolling by Many old soldiers were coming to see it I asked the assistant why she did not play and sing the Battle Hymn She said they just couldn t find it Are the distributors willing to send out a musician with each film Many of the Springfield producers are quite able and enterprising but to ask for music with photoplays is like asking the man at the news stand to write an editorial while he sells you the paper The picture with a great orchestra in a far off metropolitan Opera House may be classed by fanatic partisanship with Grand Opera But few can get at it It has nothing to do with Democracy Of course people with a mechanical imagination and no other kind begin to suggest the talking moving picture at this point or the phonograph or the mechanical piano Let us discuss the talking moving picture only That disposes of the others If the talking moving picture becomes a reliable mirror of the human voice and frame it will be the basis of such a separate art that none of the photoplay precedents will apply It will be the phonoplay not the photoplay It will be unpleasant for a long time This book is a struggle against the non humanness of the undisciplined photograph Any film is correct realistic forceful many times before it is charming The actual physical storage battery of the actor is many hundred miles away As a substitute the human quality must come in the marks of the presence of the producer The entire painting must have his brushwork If we compare it to a love letter it must be in his handwriting rather than worked on a typewriter If he puts his autograph into the film it is after a fierce struggle with the uncanny scientific quality of the camera s work His genius and that of the whole company of actors is exhausted in the task The raw phonograph is likewise unmagnetic Would you set upon the shoulders of the troupe of actors the additional responsibility of putting an adequate substitute for human magnetism in the phonographic disk The voice that does not actually bleed that contains no heart beats fails to meet the emergency Few people have wept over a phonographic selection from Tristan and Isolde They are moved at the actual performance Why Look at the opera singer after the last act His eyes are burning His face is flushed His pulse is high Reaching his hotel room he is far more weary than if he had sung the opera alone there He has given out of his brain fire and blood beat the same magnetism that leads men in battle To speak of it in the crassest terms this resource brings him a hundred times more salary than another man with just as good a voice can command The output that leaves him drained at the end of the show cannot be stored in the phonograph machine That device is as good in the morning as at noon It ticks like a clock To perfect the talking moving picture human magnetism must be put into the mirror screen and into the clock Not only is this imperative but clock and mirror must be harmonized one gently subordinated to the other Both cannot rule In the present talking moving picture the more highly developed photoplay is dragged by the hair in a dead faint in the wake of the screaming savage phonograph No talking machine on the market reproduces conversation clearly unless it be elaborately articulated in unnatural tones with a stiff interval between each question and answer Real dialogue goes to ruin The talking moving picture came to our town We were given for one show a line of minstrels facing the audience with the interlocutor repeating his immemorial question and the end man giving the immemorial answer Then came a scene in a blacksmith shop where certain well differentiated rackets were carried over the footlights No one heard the blacksmith unless he stopped to shout straight at us The phonoplay can quite possibly reach some divine goal but it will be after the speaking powers of the phonograph excel the photographing powers of the reel and then the pictures will be brought in as comment and ornament to the speech The pictures will be held back by the phonograph as long as it is more limited in its range The pictures are at present freer and more versatile without it If the phonoplay is ever established since it will double the machinery it must needs double its prices It will be the illustrated phonograph in a more expensive theatre The orchestra is in part a blundering effort by the local manager to supply the human magnetic element which he feels lacking in the pictures on which the producer has not left his autograph But there is a much more economic and magnetic accompaniment the before mentioned buzzing commentary of the audience There will be some people who disturb the neighbors in front but the average crowd has developed its manners in this particular and when the orchestra is silent murmurs like a pleasant brook Local manager why not an advertising campaign in your town that says Beginning Monday and henceforth ours shall be known as the Conversational Theatre At the door let each person be handed the following card You are encouraged to discuss the picture with the friend who accompanies you to this place Conversation of course must be sufficiently subdued not to disturb the stranger who did not come with you to the theatre If you are so disposed consider your answers to these questions What play or part of a play given in this theatre did you like most to day What the least What is the best picture you have ever seen anywhere What pictures seen here this month shall we bring back Here give a list of the recent productions with squares to mark by the Australian ballot system approved or disapproved The cards with their answers could be slipped into the ballot box at the door as the crowd goes out It may be these questions are for the exceptional audiences in residence districts Perhaps with most crowds the last interrogation is the only one worth while But by gathering habitually the answers to that alone the place would get the drift of its public realize its genius and become an art gallery the people bestowing the blue ribbons The photoplay theatres have coupon contests and balloting already the most popular young lady money prizes to the best vote getter in the audience et cetera Why not ballot on the matter in hand If the cards are sent out by the big producers a referendum could be secured that would be invaluable in arguing down to rigid censorship and enable them to make their own private censorship more intelligent Various styles of experimental cards could be tried till the vital one is found There is growing up in this country a clan of half formed moving picture critics The present stage of their work is indicated by the eloquent notice describing Your Girl and Mine in the chapter on Progress and Endowment The metropolitan papers give their photoplay reporters as much space as the theatrical critics Here in my home town the twelve moving picture places take one half a page of chaotic notices daily The country is being badly led by professional photoplay news writers who do not know where they are going but are on the way But they aptly describe the habitual attendants as moving picture fans The fan at the photoplay as at the baseball grounds is neither a low brow nor a high brow He is an enthusiast who is as stirred by the charge of the photographic cavalry as by the home runs that he watches from the bleachers In both places he has the privilege of comment while the game goes on In the photoplay theatre it is not so vociferous but as keenly felt Each person roots by himself He has his own judgment and roasts the umpire who is the keeper of the local theatre or the producer as the case may be If these opinions of the fan can be collected and classified an informal censorship is at once established The photoplay reporters can then take the enthusiasts in hand and lead them to a realization of the finer points in awarding praise and blame Even the sporting pages have their expert opinions with due influence on the betting odds Out of the work of the photoplay reporters let a superstructure of art criticism be reared in periodicals like The Century Harper s Scribner s The Atlantic The Craftsman and the architectural magazines These are our natural custodians of art They should reproduce the most exquisite tableaus and be as fastidious in their selection of them as they are in the current examples of the other arts Let them spread the news when photoplays keyed to the Rembrandt mood arrive The reporters for the newspapers should get their ideas and refreshment in such places as the Ryerson Art Library of the Chicago Art Institute They should begin with such books as Richard Muther s History of Modern Painting John C Van Dyke s Art for Art s Sake Marquand and Frothingham s History of Sculpture A D F Hamlin s History of Architecture They should take the business of guidance in this new world as a sacred trust knowing they have the power to influence an enormous democracy The moving picture journals and the literati are in straits over the censorship question The literati side with the managers on the principles of free speech and a free press But few of the aesthetically super wise are persistent fans They rave for freedom but are not as a general thing living back in the home town They do not face the exigency of having their summer and winter amusement spoiled day after day Extremists among the pious are railing against the moving pictures as once they railed against novels They have no notion that this institution is penetrating to the last backwoods of our civilization where its presence is as hard to prevent as the rain But some of us are destined to a reaction almost as strong as the obsession The religionists will think they lead it They will be self deceived Moving picture nausea is already taking hold of numberless people even when they are in the purely pagan mood Forced by their limited purses their inability to buy a Ford car and the like they go in their loneliness to film after film till the whole world seems to turn on a reel When they are again at home they see in the dark an imaginary screen with tremendous pictures whirling by at a horribly accelerated pace a photoplay delirium tremens Faster and faster the reel turns in the back of their heads When the moving picture sea sickness is upon one nothing satisfies but the quietest out of doors the companionship of the gentlest of real people The non movie life has charms such as one never before conceived The worn citizen feels that the cranks and legislators can do what they please to the producers He is through with them The moving picture business men do not realize that they have to face these nervous conditions in their erstwhile friends They flatter themselves they are being pursued by some reincarnations of Anthony Comstock There are several reasons why photoplay corporations are callous along with the sufficient one that they are corporations First they are engaged in a financial orgy Fortunes are being found by actors and managers faster than they were dug up in eighteen forty nine and eighteen fifty in California Forty niner lawlessness of soul prevails They talk each other into a lordly state of mind All is dash and experiment Look at the advertisements in the leading moving picture magazines They are like the praise of oil stock or Peruna They bawl about films founded upon little classics They howl about plots that are ostensibly from the soberest of novels whose authors they blasphemously invoke They boo and blow about twisted callous scenarios that are bad imitations of the world s most beloved lyrics The producers do not realize the mass effect of the output of the business It appears to many as a sea of unharnessed photography sloppy conceptions set forth with sharp edges and irrelevant realism The jumping twitching cold blooded devices day after day create the aforesaid sea sickness that has nothing to do with the questionable subject When on top of this we come to the picture that is actually insulting we are up in arms indeed It is supplied by a corporation magnate removed from his audience in location fortune interest and mood an absentee landlord I was trying to convert a talented and noble friend to the films The first time we went there was a prize fight between a black and a white man not advertised used for a filler I said it was queer and would not happen again The next time my noble friend was persuaded to go there was a cock fight incidental to a Cuban romance The third visit we beheld a lady who was dying for five minutes rolling her eyes about in a way that was fearful to see The convert was not made It is too easy to produce an unprovoked murder an inexplicable arson neither led up to nor followed by the ordinary human history of such acts and therefore as arbitrary as the deeds of idiots or the insane A villainous hate an alleged love a violent death are flashed at us without being in any sort of tableau logic The public is ceaselessly played upon by tactless devices Therefore it howls just as children in the nursery do when the awkward governess tries the very thing the diplomatic governess in reasonable time may bring about The producer has the man in the audience who cares for the art peculiarly at his mercy Compare him with the person who wants to read a magazine for an evening He can look over all the periodicals in the local book store in fifteen minutes He can select the one he wants take this bit of printed matter home go through the contents find the three articles he prefers get an evening of reading out of them and be happy Every day as many photoplays come to our town as magazines come to the book store in a week or a month There are good ones and bad ones buried in the list There is no way to sample the films One has to wait through the first third of a reel before he has an idea of the merits of a production his ten cents is spent and much of his time is gone It would take five hours at least to find the best film in our town for one day Meanwhile nibbling and sampling the seeker would run such a gantlet of plot and dash and chase that his eyes and patience would be exhausted Recently there returned to the city for a day one of Griffith s best Biographs The Last Drop of Water It was good to see again In order to watch this one reel twice I had to wait through five others of unutterable miscellany Since the producers and theatre managers have us at their mercy they are under every obligation to consider our delicate susceptibilities granting the proposition that in an ideal world we will have no legal censorship As to what to do in this actual nation let the reader follow what John Collier has recently written in The Survey Collier was the leading force in founding the National Board of Censorship As a member of that volunteer extra legal board which is independent and high minded yet accepted by the leading picture companies he is able to discuss legislation in a manner which the present writer cannot hope to match Read John Collier But I wish to suggest that the ideal censorship is that to which the daily press is subject the elastic hand of public opinion if the photoplay can be brought as near to newspaper conditions in this matter as it is in some others How does public opinion grip the journalist The editor has a constant report from his constituency A popular scoop sells an extra at once An attack on the wrong idol cancels fifty subscriptions People come to the office to do it and say why If there is a piece of real news on the second page and fifty letters come in about it that night next month when that character of news reappears it gets the front page Some human peculiarities are not mentioned some phrases not used The total attribute of the blue pencil man is diplomacy But while the motion pictures come out every day they get their discipline months afterwards in the legislation that insists on everything but tact A tentative substitute for the letters that come to the editor the personal call and cancelled subscription and the rest is the system of balloting on the picture especially the answer to the question What picture seen here this month or this week shall we bring back Experience will teach how to put the queries By the same system the public might dictate its own cut outs Let us have a democracy and a photoplay business working in daily rhythm CHAPTER XV THE SUBSTITUTE FOR THE SALOON This is a special commentary on 
25-88353-0000	train-other-500	chapter five The Picture of Crowd Splendor
5672_88363_000002_000001	train-clean-360	It refers as well to every other type of moving picture that gets into the slum 
none	none	But the masses have an extraordinary affinity for the Crowd Photoplay As has been said before the mob comes nightly to behold its natural face in the glass Politicians on the platform have swayed the mass below them 
5672_88363_000002_000005	train-clean-360	But now to speak in an Irish way the crowd takes the platform and looking down sees itself swaying 
none	none	The slums are an astonishing assembly of cave men crawling out of their shelters to exhibit for the first time in history a common interest on a tremendous scale in an art form 
5672_88363_000002_000007	train-clean-360	Below the cliff caves were bar rooms in endless lines 
5672_88363_000002_000008	train-clean-360	There are almost as many bar rooms to day yet this new thing breaks the lines as nothing else ever did 
none	none	Often when a moving picture house is set up the saloon on the right hand or the left declares bankruptcy Why do men prefer the photoplay to the drinking place 
5672_88363_000003_000001	train-clean-360	For no pious reason surely 
5672_88363_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Now they have fire pouring into their eyes instead of into their bellies 
5672_88363_000003_000003	train-clean-360	Blood is drawn from the guts to the brain 
none	none	Though the picture be the veriest mess the light and movement cause the beholder to do a little reptilian thinking 
5672_88363_000003_000005	train-clean-360	After a day s work a street sweeper enters the place heavy as King Log 
none	none	A ditch digger goes in sick and surly It is the state of the body when many men drink themselves into insensibility But here the light is as strong in the eye as whiskey in the throat Along with the flare shadow and mystery they face the existence of people places costumes utterly novel Immigrants are prodded by these swords of darkness and light to guess at the meaning of the catch phrases and headlines that punctuate the play They strain to hear their neighbors whisper or spell them out 
5672_88363_000004_000000	train-clean-360	The photoplays have done something to reunite the lower class families No longer is the fire escape the only summer resort for big and little folks 
5672_88363_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Here is more fancy and whim than ever before blessed a hot night Here under the wind of an electric fan they witness everything from a burial in Westminster to the birthday parade of the ruler of the land of Swat 
none	none	The usual saloon equipment to delight the eye is one so called leg picture of a woman a photograph of a prize fighter and some colored portraits of goats to advertise various brands of beer Many times no doubt these boys and young men have found visions of a sordid kind while gazing on the actress the fighter or the goats But what poor material they had in the wardrobes of memory for the trimmings and habiliments of vision to make this lady into Freya this prize fighter into Thor these goats into the harnessed steeds that drew his chariot Man s dreams are rearranged and glorified memories How could these people reconstruct the torn carpets and tin cans and waste paper of their lives into mythology How could memories of Ladies Entrance squalor be made into Castles in Granada or Carcassonne The things they drank to see and saw but grotesquely and paid for terribly now roll before them with no after pain or punishment The mumbled conversation the sociability for which they leaned over the tables they have here in the same manner with far more to talk about They come they go home men and women together as casually and impulsively as the men alone ever entered a drinking place but discoursing now of far off mountains and star crossed lovers 
5672_88363_000005_000008	train-clean-360	As Padraic Colum says in his poem on the herdsman 
5672_88363_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 With thoughts on white ships And the King of Spain s Daughter 
none	none	This is why the saloon on the right hand and on the left in the slum is apt to move out when the photoplay moves in But let us go to the other end of the temperance argument 
5672_88363_000008_000001	train-clean-360	I beg to be allowed to relate a personal matter 
none	none	For some time I was a field worker for the Anti Saloon League of Illinois being sent every Sunday to a new region to make the yearly visit on behalf of the league Such a visitor is apt to speak to one church in a village and two in the country on each excursion being met at the station by some leading farmer citizen of the section and driven to these points by him 
5672_88363_000008_000004	train-clean-360	The talk with this man was worth it all to me 
none	none	The agricultural territory of the United States is naturally dry This is because the cross roads church is the only communal institution and the voice of the cross roads pastor is for teetotalism The routine of the farm hand while by no means ideal in other respects keeps him from craving drink as intensely as other toilers do A day s work in the open air fills his veins at nightfall with an opiate of weariness instead of a high strung nervousness The strong men of the community are church elders not through fanaticism but by right of leadership 
5672_88363_000009_000005	train-clean-360	Through their office they are committed to prohibition 
none	none	So opposition to the temperance movement is scattering The Anti Saloon League has organized these leaders into a nation wide machine It sees that they get their weekly paper instructing them in the tactics whereby local fights have been won A subscription financing the State League is taken once a year It counts on the regular list of church benevolences The state officers come in to help on the critical local fights Any country politician fears their non partisan denunciation as he does political death The local machines thus backed are incurable mugwumps hold the balance of power work in both parties and have voted dry the agricultural territory of the United States everywhere by the township county or state unit The only institutions that touch the same territory in a similar way are the Chautauquas in the prosperous agricultural centres These too by the same sign are emphatically anti saloon in their propaganda serving to intellectualize and secularize the dry sentiment without taking it out of the agricultural caste There is a definite line between our farm civilization and the rest 
5672_88363_000011_000001	train-clean-360	When a county goes dry it is generally in spite of the county seat 
none	none	Such temperance people as are in the court house town represent the church vote which is even then in goodly proportion a retired farmer vote 
5672_88363_000011_000003	train-clean-360	The larger the county seat the larger the non church going population and the more stubborn the fight 
none	none	The majority of miners and factory workers are on the wet side everywhere The irritation caused by the gases in the mines by the dirty work in the blackness by the squalor in which the company houses are built turns men to drink for reaction and lamplight and comradeship The similar fevers and exasperations of factory life lead the workers to unstring their tense nerves with liquor The habit of snuggling up close in factories conversing often bench by bench machine by machine inclines them to get together for their pleasures at the bar In industrial America there is an anti saloon minority in moral sympathy with the temperance wave brought in by the farmers 
5672_88363_000011_000009	train-clean-360	But they are outstanding groups 
5672_88363_000011_000010	train-clean-360	Their leadership seldom dries up a factory town or a mining region with all the help the Anti Saloon League can give 
none	none	In the big cities the temperance movement is scarcely understood The choice residential districts are voted dry for real estate reasons 
5672_88363_000012_000002	train-clean-360	The men who do this drink freely at their own clubs or parties 
none	none	The temperance question would be fruitlessly argued to the end of time were it not for the massive agricultural vote rolling and roaring round each metropolis reawakening the town churches whose vote is a pitiful minority but whose spokesmen are occasionally strident There is a prophecy abroad that prohibition will be the issue of a national election If the question is squarely put there are enough farmers and church people to drive the saloon out of legal existence 
5672_88363_000013_000002	train-clean-360	The women s vote a little more puritanical than the men s vote will make the result sure 
none	none	As one anxious for this victory I have often speculated on the situation when all America is nominally dry at the behest of the American farmer the American preacher and the American woman When the use of alcohol is treason what will become of those all but unbroken lines of slum saloons No lesser force than regular troops could dislodge them with yesterday s intrenchment The entrance of the motion picture house into the arena is indeed striking the first enemy of King Alcohol with real power where that king has deepest hold If every one of those saloon doors is nailed up by the Chautauqua orators the photoplay archway will remain open The people will have a shelter where they can readjust themselves that offers a substitute for many of the lines of pleasure in the groggery 
5672_88363_000014_000003	train-clean-360	And a whole evening costs but a dime apiece 
none	none	Several rounds of drinks are expensive but the people can sit through as many repetitions of this programme as they desire for one entrance fee The dominant genius of the moving picture place is not a gentleman with a red nose and an eye like a dead fish but some producer who with all his faults has given every person in the audience a seven leagued angel and demon telescope 
5672_88363_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Since I have announced myself a farmer and a puritan let me here list the saloon evils not yet recorded in this chapter 
none	none	They are separate from the catalogue of the individualistic woes of the drunkard that are given in the Scripture 
5672_88363_000015_000002	train-clean-360	The shame of the American drinking place is the bar tender who dominates its thinking 
none	none	His cynical and hardened soul wipes out a portion of the influence of the public school the library the self respecting newspaper A stream rises no higher than its source and through his dead fish eye and dead fish brain the group of tired men look upon all the statesmen and wise ones of the land Though he says worse than nothing his furry tongue by endless reiteration is the American slum oracle At the present the bar tender handles the neighborhood group the ultimate unit in city politics So good citizen welcome the coming of the moving picture man as a local social force Whatever his private character the mere formula of his activities makes him a better type He may not at first sway his group in a directly political way but he will make himself the centre of more social ideals than the bar tender ever entertained And he is beginning to have as intimate a relation to his public as the bar tender In many cases he stands under his arch in the sheltered lobby and is on conversing terms with his habitual customers the length of the afternoon and evening Voting the saloon out of the slums by voting America dry does not as of old promise to be a successful operation that kills the patient In the past some of the photoplay magazines have contained denunciations of the temperance people for refusing to say anything in behalf of the greatest practical enemy of the saloon 
5672_88363_000017_000002	train-clean-360	But it is not too late for the dry forces to repent 
none	none	The Anti Saloon League officers and the photoplay men should ask each other to dinner More moving picture theatres in doubtful territory will help make dry voters 
5672_88363_000017_000005	train-clean-360	And wet territory voted dry will bring about a greatly accelerated patronage of the photoplay houses There is every strategic reason why these two forces should patch up a truce 
none	none	Meanwhile the cave man reader of picture writing is given a chance to admit light into his mind whatever he puts to his lips Let us look for the day be it a puritan triumph or not when the sons and the daughters of the slums shall prophesy the young men shall see visions the old men dream dreams CHAPTER XVI CALIFORNIA AND AMERICA 
7059_88364_000003_000000	train-clean-100	The moving picture captains of industry like the California gold finders of eighteen forty nine making colossal fortunes in two or three years have the same glorious irresponsibility and occasional need of the sheriff 
none	none	They are Californians more literally than this 
7059_88364_000003_000002	train-clean-100	Around Los Angeles the greatest and most characteristic moving picture colonies are being built 
7059_88364_000003_000003	train-clean-100	Each photoplay magazine has its California letter telling of the putting up of new studios and the transfer of actors with much slap you on the back personal gossip 
7059_88364_000003_000004	train-clean-100	This is the outgrowth of the fact that every type of the photoplay but the intimate is founded on some phase of the out of doors 
7059_88364_000003_000005	train-clean-100	Being thus dependent the plant can best be set up where there is no winter 
7059_88364_000003_000006	train-clean-100	Besides this the Los Angeles region has the sea the mountains the desert and many kinds of grove and field Landscape and architecture are sub tropical 
7059_88364_000003_000007	train-clean-100	But for a description of California ask any traveller or study the background of almost any photoplay 
7059_88364_000004_000000	train-clean-100	If the photoplay is the consistent utterance of its scenes if the actors are incarnations of the land they walk upon as they should be California indeed stands a chance to achieve through the films an utterance of her own 
7059_88364_000004_000001	train-clean-100	Will this land furthest west be the first to capture the inner spirit of this newest and most curious of the arts 
7059_88364_000004_000002	train-clean-100	It certainly has the opportunity that comes with the actors producers and equipment 
7059_88364_000004_000003	train-clean-100	Let us hope that every region will develop the silent photographic pageant in a local form as outlined in the chapter on Progress and Endowment 
7059_88364_000004_000004	train-clean-100	Already the California sort in the commercial channels has become the broadly accepted if mediocre national form People who revere the Pilgrim Fathers of sixteen twenty have often wished those gentlemen had moored their bark in the region of Los Angeles rather than Plymouth Rock that Boston had been founded there 
7059_88364_000004_000005	train-clean-100	At last that landing is achieved 
7059_88364_000005_000000	train-clean-100	Patriotic art students have discussed with mingled irony and admiration the Boston domination of the only American culture of the nineteenth century namely literature 
7059_88364_000005_000001	train-clean-100	Indianapolis has had her day since then Chicago is lifting her head 
7059_88364_000005_000002	train-clean-100	Nevertheless Boston still controls the text book in English and dominates our high schools 
7059_88364_000005_000003	train-clean-100	Ironic feelings in this matter on the part of western men are based somewhat on envy and illegitimate cussedness but are also grounded in the honest hope of a healthful rivalry 
none	none	They want new romanticists and artists as indigenous to their soil as was Hawthorne to witch haunted Salem or Longfellow to the chestnuts of his native heath 
7059_88364_000005_000005	train-clean-100	Whatever may be said of the patriarchs from Oliver Wendell Holmes to Amos Bronson Alcott they were true sons of the New England stone fences and meeting houses 
7059_88364_000005_000006	train-clean-100	They could not have been born or nurtured anywhere else on the face of the earth 
none	none	Some of us view with a peculiar thrill the prospect that Los Angeles may become the Boston of the photoplay Perhaps it would be better to say the Florence because California reminds one of colorful Italy more than of any part of the United States 
7059_88364_000006_000002	train-clean-100	Yet there is a difference 
7059_88364_000007_000000	train-clean-100	The present day man in the street man about town Californian has an obvious magnificence about him that is allied to the eucalyptus tree the pomegranate 
7059_88364_000007_000001	train-clean-100	California is a gilded state 
7059_88364_000007_000002	train-clean-100	It has not the sordidness of gold as has Wall Street but it is the embodiment of the natural ore that the ragged prospector finds 
7059_88364_000007_000003	train-clean-100	The gold of California is the color of the orange the glitter of dawn in the Yosemite the hue of the golden gate that opens the sunset way to mystic and terrible Cathay and Hindustan 
none	none	The enemy of California says the state is magnificent but thin 
7059_88364_000008_000001	train-clean-100	He declares it is as though it were painted on a Brobdingnagian piece of gilt paper and he who dampens his finger and thrusts it through finds an alkali valley on the other side the lonely prickly pear and a heap of ashes from a deserted camp fire 
7059_88364_000008_000002	train-clean-100	He says the citizens of this state lack the richness of an aesthetic and religious tradition 
7059_88364_000008_000003	train-clean-100	He says there is no substitute for time 
7059_88364_000008_000004	train-clean-100	But even these things make for coincidence 
none	none	This apparent thinness California has in common with the routine photoplay which is at times as shallow in its thought as the shadow it throws upon the screen This newness California has in common with all photoplays 
7059_88364_000008_000007	train-clean-100	It is thrillingly possible for the state and the art to acquire spiritual tradition and depth together 
7059_88364_000009_000000	train-clean-100	Part of the thinness of California is not only its youth but the result of the physical fact that the human race is there spread over so many acres of land 
none	none	They try not only to count their mines and enumerate their palm trees but they count the miles of their sea coast and the acres under cultivation and the height of the peaks and revel in large statistics and the bigness generally and forget how a few men rattle around in a great deal of scenery 
7059_88364_000009_000002	train-clean-100	They shout their statistics across the Rockies and the deserts to New York 
none	none	The Mississippi Valley is non existent to the Californian 
7059_88364_000009_000004	train-clean-100	His fellow feeling is for the opposite coast line 
none	none	Through the geographical accident of separation by mountain and desert from the rest of the country he becomes a mere shouter hurrahing so assiduously that all variety in the voice is lost 
7059_88364_000009_000006	train-clean-100	Then he tries gestures and becomes flamboyant rococo 
7059_88364_000010_000000	train-clean-100	These are the defects of the motion picture qualities also 
none	none	Its panoramic tendency runs wild 
7059_88364_000010_000002	train-clean-100	As an institution it advertises itself with the sweeping gesture 
7059_88364_000010_000003	train-clean-100	It has the same passion for coast line 
none	none	These are not the sins of New England 
7059_88364_000010_000005	train-clean-100	When in the hands of masters they become sources of strength they will be a different set of virtues from those of New England 
7059_88364_000011_000000	train-clean-100	There is no more natural place for the scattering of confetti than this state except the moving picture scene itself 
7059_88364_000011_000001	train-clean-100	Both have a genius for gardens and dancing and carnival 
none	none	When the Californian relegates the dramatic to secondary scenes both in his life and his photoplay and turns to the genuinely epic and lyric he and this instrument may find their immortality together as New England found its soul in the essays of Emerson Tide upon tide of Spring comes into California through all four seasons Fairy beauty overwhelms the lumbering grand stand players The tiniest garden is a jewelled pathway of wonder 
7059_88364_000012_000004	train-clean-100	But the Californian cannot shout orange blossoms orange blossoms heliotrope heliotrope He cannot boom forth roseleaves roseleaves so that he does their beauties justice 
7059_88364_000012_000005	train-clean-100	Here is where the photoplay can begin to give him a more delicate utterance 
7059_88364_000012_000006	train-clean-100	And he can go on into stranger things and evolve all the Splendor Films into higher types for the very name of California is splendor 
7059_88364_000012_000007	train-clean-100	The California photo playwright can base his Crowd Picture upon the city worshipping mobs of San Francisco 
7059_88364_000012_000008	train-clean-100	He can derive his Patriotic and Religious Splendors from something older and more magnificent than the aisles of the Romanesque namely the groves of the giant redwoods

7059_88364_000013_000001	train-clean-100	Our mechanical East is reproved our tension is relaxed our ugliness is challenged every time we look upon those garden paths and forests 
7059_88364_000014_000000	train-clean-100	It is possible for Los Angeles to lay hold of the motion picture as our national text book in Art as Boston appropriated to herself the guardianship of the national text books of Literature 
none	none	If California has a shining soul and not merely a golden body let her forget her seventeen year old melodramatics and turn to her poets who understand the heart underneath the glory

7299-88365-0000	train-other-500	PROGRESS AND ENDOWMENT The moving picture goes almost as far as journalism into the social fabric in some ways further in others Soon no doubt many a little town will have its photographic news press
7299-88365-0001	train-other-500	We have already the weekly world news films from the big centres With local journalism will come devices for advertising home enterprises Some staple products will be made attractive
7299-88365-0002	train-other-500	by having film actors show their uses The motion pictures will be in the public schools to stay Text books in geography history zoology botany physiology and other sciences
7299-88365-0003	train-other-500	will be illustrated by standardized films Along with these changes there will be available at certain centres collections of films equivalent to the Standard Dictionary and the Encyclopaedia Britannica
7299-88365-0004	train-other-500	And sooner or later we will have a straight out capture of a complete film expression by the serious forces of civilization The merely impudent motion picture will be relegated to the leisure hours with yellow journalism
7299-88365-0005	train-other-500	Photoplay libraries are inevitable as active if not as multitudinous as the book circulating libraries The oncoming machinery and expense of the motion picture is immense Where will the money come from No one knows
7299-88365-0006	train-other-500	What the people want they will get The race of man cannot afford automobiles but has them nevertheless We cannot run away into non automobile existence or non steam engine or non movie life long at a time
7299-88365-0007	train-other-500	We must conquer this thing While the more stately scientific and educational aspects just enumerated are slowly on their way the artists must be up and about their ameliorative work
7299-88365-0008	train-other-500	Every considerable effort to develop a noble idiom will count in the final result
none	none	 as the writers of early English 
7299-88365-0009	train-other-500	made possible the language of the Bible Shakespeare and Milton We are perfecting a medium to be used as long as Chinese ideographs have been It will no doubt like the Chinese language
7299-88365-0010	train-other-500	record in the end massive and classical treatises imperial chronicles law codes traditions and religious admonitions
none	none	 All this by the motion picture as a recording instrument 
7299-88365-0011	train-other-500	not necessarily the photoplay a much more limited thing a form of art What shall be done in especial by this generation of idealists whose flags rise and go down
7299-88365-0012	train-other-500	whose battle line wavers and breaks a thousand times What is the high quixotic splendid call We know of a group of public spirited people who advocate in endowed films safety first
7299-88365-0013	train-other-500	another that champions total abstinence Often their work seems lost in the mass of commercial production but it is a good beginning
none	none	 Such citizens take an established studio for a specified time 
7299-88365-0014	train-other-500	and at the end put on the market a production that backs up their particular idea There are certain terms between the owners of the film and the proprietors of the studio for the division of the income the profits of the cult being spent on further propaganda
7299-88365-0015	train-other-500	The product need not necessarily be the type outlined in chapter two The Photoplay of Action Often some other sort might establish the cause more deeply
7299-88365-0016	train-other-500	But most of the propaganda films are of the action variety because of the dynamic character of the people who produce them Fired by fanatic zeal the auto speeds faster the rescuing hero runs harder
7299-88365-0017	train-other-500	the stern policeman and sheriff become more jumpy all that the audience may be converted Here if anywhere meditation on the actual resources of charm and force in the art is a fitting thing
7299-88365-0018	train-other-500	The crusader should realize that it is not a good Action Play nor even a good argument unless it is indeed the Winged Victory sort The gods are not always on the side of those who throw fits
7299-88365-0019	train-other-500	There is here appended a newspaper description of a crusading film that despite the implications of the notice has many passages of charm It is two thirds Action Photoplay one third Intimate and friendly The notice does not imply
7299-88365-0020	train-other-500	that at times the story takes pains to be gentle This bit of writing is all too typical of film journalism
7299-88365-0021	train-other-500	Not only as an argument for suffrage but as a play with a story a punch and a mission Your Girl and Mine is produced under the direction of the National Woman s Suffrage Association at the Capitol to day
7299-88365-0022	train-other-500	Olive Wyndham forsook the legitimate stage for the time to pose as the heroine of the play Katherine Kaelred leading lady of Joseph and his Brethren took the part of a woman lawyer battling for the right
7299-88365-0023	train-other-500	Sydney Booth of the Yellow Ticket company posed as the hero of the experiment John Charles and Katharine Henry played the villain and the honest working girl About three hundred secondaries were engaged along with the principals
7299-88365-0024	train-other-500	It is melodrama of the most thrilling sort in spite of the fact that there is a moral concealed in the very title of the play
7299-88365-0025	train-other-500	But who is worried by a moral in a play which has an exciting hand to hand fight between a man and a woman in one of the earliest acts when the quick march of events ranges from a wedding to a murder
7299-88365-0026	train-other-500	and an automobile abduction scene that breaks all former speed records The Cause comes in most symbolically and poetically a symbolic figure that fades out at critical periods in the plot doctor Anna Howard Shaw
7299-88365-0027	train-other-500	the famous suffrage leader appears personally in the film Your Girl and Mine is a big play with a big mission built on a big scale It is a whole evening s entertainment and a very interesting evening at that
7299-88365-0028	train-other-500	Here endeth the newspaper notice Compare it with the Biograph advertisement of Judith in chapter six There is nothing in the film that rasps like this account of it The clipping serves to give the street atmosphere
7299-88365-0029	train-other-500	through which our Woman s Suffrage Joan of Arcs move to conquest and glory with unstained banners The obvious amendments to the production as an instrument of persuasion are two Firstly there should be five reels instead of six
7299-88365-0030	train-other-500	every scene shortened a bit to bring this result Secondly the lieutenant governor of the state who is the Rudolf Rassendyll of the production
none	none	 does not enter the story soon enough and is too James K Hacketty all at once 
7299-88365-0031	train-other-500	We are jerked into admiration of him rather than ensnared But after that the gentleman behaves more handsomely than any of the distinguished lieutenant governors in real life the present writer happens to remember
7299-88365-0032	train-other-500	The figure of Aunt Jane the queenly serious woman of affairs is one to admire and love Her effectiveness without excess or strain is in itself an argument for giving woman the vote
7299-88365-0033	train-other-500	The newspaper notice does not state the facts in saying the symbolical figure fades out at critical periods in the plot On the contrary she appears at critical periods clothed in white solemn and royal
7299-88365-0034	train-other-500	She comes into the groups with an adequate allurement pointing the moral of each situation while she shines brightest The two children for whom the contest is fought are winsome little girls By the side of their mother in the garden
7299-88365-0035	train-other-500	or in the nursery they are a potent argument for the natural rights of femininity The film is by no means ultra aesthetic The implications of the clipping are correct to that degree
7299-88365-0036	train-other-500	But the resources of beauty within the ready command of the advising professional producer are used by the women for all they are worth It could not be asked of them that they evolve technical novelties
7299-88365-0037	train-other-500	Yet the figures of Aunt Jane and the Goddess of Suffrage are something new in their fashion Aunt Jane is a spiritual sister to that unprecedented woman Jane Addams who went to the Hague conference for Peace in the midst of war
none	none	 which heroic action 
7299-88365-0038	train-other-500	the future will not forget Aunt Jane does justice to that breed of women amid the sweetness and flowers and mere scenario perils of the photoplay story The presence of the Votes for Women figure is the beginning of a line of
7299-88365-0039	train-other-500	photoplay goddesses that serious propaganda in the new medium will make part of the American Spiritual Hierarchy
none	none	 In the imaginary film of Our Lady Springfield 
7299-88365-0040	train-other-500	described in the chapter on Architecture in Motion a kindred divinity is presumed to stand by the side of the statue when it first reaches the earth
7299-88365-0041	train-other-500	High minded graduates of university courses in sociology and schools of philanthropy devout readers of The Survey The Chicago Public The Masses The New Republic La Follette s
7299-88365-0042	train-other-500	are going to advocate increasingly their varied and sometimes contradictory causes in films These will generally be produced by heroic exertions in the studio and much passing of the subscription paper outside Then there are endowments already in existence
7299-88365-0043	train-other-500	that will no doubt be diverted to the photoplay channel In every state house and in Washington D C increasing quantities of dead printed matter have been turned out year after year They have served to kindle various furnaces and feed the paper mills a second time
7299-88365-0044	train-other-500	Many of these routine reports will remain in innocuous desuetude But one fourth of them perhaps are capable of being embodied in films If they are scientific demonstrations
none	none	 they can be made into realistic motion picture records If they are exhortations they can be transformed into plays with a moral 
7299-88365-0045	train-other-500	brothers of the film Your Girl and Mine The appropriations for public printing should include such work hereafter The scientific museums distribute routine pamphlets that would set the whole world right on certain points if they were but read by said world
7299-88365-0046	train-other-500	Let them be filmed and started Whatever the congressman is permitted to frank to his constituency let him send in the motion picture form when it is the expedient and expressive way When men work for the high degrees in the universities
7299-88365-0047	train-other-500	they labor on a piece of literary conspiracy called a thesis which no one outside the university hears of again The gist of this research work that is dead to the democracy through the university merits of thoroughness
7299-88365-0048	train-other-500	moderation of statement and final touch of discovery would have a chance to live and grip the people in a motion picture transcript if not a photoplay It would be University Extension
none	none	 The relentless fire of criticism which the heads of the departments would pour on the production before they allowed it to pass would result in a standardization of the sense of scientific fact over the land Suppose the film has the coat of arms of the University of Chicago along with the name of the young graduate whose thesis it is 
7299-88365-0049	train-other-500	He would have a chance to reflect credit on the university even as much as a foot ball player Large undertakings might be under way like those described in the chapter on Architecture in Motion
7299-88365-0050	train-other-500	But these would require much more than the ordinary outlay for thesis work less perhaps than is taken for Athletics Lyman Howe and several other world explorers have already set the pace in the more human side of the educative film
7299-88365-0051	train-other-500	The list of mister Howe s offerings from the first would reveal many a one that would have run the gantlet of a university department He points out a new direction for old energies whereby professors may become citizens
7299-88365-0052	train-other-500	Let the cave man reader of picture writing be allowed to ponder over scientific truth He is at present the victim of the alleged truth of the specious and sentimental variety of photograph
7299-88365-0053	train-other-500	It gives the precise edges of the coat or collar of the smirking masher and the exact fibre in the dress of the jumping jack The eye grows weary of sharp points and hard edges that mean nothing
7299-88365-0054	train-other-500	All this idiotic precision is going to waste It should be enlisted in the cause of science and abated everywhere else The edges in art are as mysterious as in science they are exact
7299-88365-0055	train-other-500	Some of the higher forms of the Intimate Moving Picture play should be endowed by local coteries representing their particular region Every community of fifty thousand has its group of the cultured who have heretofore studied
7299-88365-0056	train-other-500	and imitated things done in the big cities Some of these coteries will in exceptional cases become creative and begin to express their habitation and name The Intimate Photoplay is capable of that delicacy and that informality
7299-88365-0057	train-other-500	which should characterize neighborhood enterprises The plays could be acted by the group who season after season have secured the opera house for the annual amateur show Other dramatic ability could be found in the high schools
7299-88365-0058	train-other-500	There is enough talent in any place to make an artistic revolution if once that region is aflame with a common vision The spirit that made the Irish Players all so racy of the soil can also move the company of local photoplayers in Topeka or
7299-88365-0059	train-other-500	Indianapolis or Denver Then let them speak for their town not only in great occasional enterprises but steadily in little fancies genre pictures developing a technique that will finally make magnificence possible
7299-88365-0060	train-other-500	There was given not long ago at the Illinois Country Club here a performance of The Yellow Jacket by the Coburn Players It at once seemed an integral part of this chapter The two flags used for a chariot the bamboo poles for oars
7299-88365-0061	train-other-500	the red sack for a decapitated head et cetera were all convincing through a direct resemblance as well as the passionate acting They suggest a possible type of hieroglyphics to be developed by the leader of the local group
7299-88365-0062	train-other-500	Let the enthusiast study this westernized Chinese play for primitive representative methods It can be found in book form a most readable work
none	none	 It is by G C Hazelton junior and J H Benrimo 
7299-88365-0063	train-other-500	The resemblance between the stage property and the thing represented is fairly close The moving flags on each side of the actor suggest the actual color and progress of the chariot and abstractly suggest its magnificence
7299-88365-0064	train-other-500	The red sack used for a bloody head has at least the color and size of one The dressed up block of wood used for a child is the length of an infant of the age described and wears the general costume thereof
7299-88365-0065	train-other-500	The farmer s hoe though exaggerated is still an agricultural implement The evening s list of properties is economical filling one wagon rather than three Photographic realism is splendidly put to rout by powerful representation
7299-88365-0066	train-other-500	When the villager desires to embody some episode that if realistically given would require a setting beyond the means of the available endowment and does not like the near Egyptian method let him evolve his near Chinese set of symbols
7299-88365-0067	train-other-500	The Yellow Jacket was written after long familiarity with the Chinese Theatre in San Francisco The play is a glory to that city as well as to Hazelton and Benrimo But every town in the United States has something as striking as the Chinese Theatre
7299-88365-0068	train-other-500	to the man who keeps the eye of his soul open It has its Ministerial Association its boys secret society its red eyed political gang its grubby Justice of the Peace court its free school for the teaching of Hebrew
7299-88365-0069	train-other-500	its snobbish chapel its fire engine house its milliner s shop All these could be made visible in photoplays as flies are preserved in amber Edgar Lee Masters looked about him and discovered the village graveyard
7299-88365-0070	train-other-500	and made it as wonderful as Noah s Ark or Adam naming the animals by supplying honest inscriptions to the headstones Such stories can be told by the Chinese theatrical system as well As many different films could be included under the general title
7299-88365-0071	train-other-500	Seven Old Families and Why they Went to Smash Or a less ominous series would be Seven Victorious Souls For there are triumphs every day under the drab monotony of an apparently defeated town conquests worthy of the waving of sun banners
7299-88365-0072	train-other-500	Above all The Yellow Jacket points a moral for this chapter because there was conscience behind it First the rectitude of the Chinese actors of San Francisco who kept the dramatic tradition alive a tradition that was bequeathed from the ancient generations
7299-88365-0073	train-other-500	Then the artistic integrity of the men who readapted the tradition for western consumption and their religious attitude that kept the high teaching and devout feeling for human life intact in the play Then the zeal of the Drama League that indorsed it for the country
7299-88365-0074	train-other-500	Then the earnest work of the Coburn Players who embodied it devoutly so that the whole company became dear friends forever By some such ladder of conscience as this can the local scenario be endowed written acted
7299-88365-0075	train-other-500	filmed and made a real part of the community life The Yellow Jacket was a drama not a photoplay This chapter does not urge that it be readapted for a photoplay in San Francisco or anywhere else
7299-88365-0076	train-other-500	But a kindred painting in motion something as beautiful and worthy and intimate in strictly photoplay terms might well be the flower of the work of the local groups of film actors Harriet Monroe s magazine Poetry Chicago
7299-88365-0077	train-other-500	has given us a new sect the Imagists Ezra Pound Richard Aldington John Gould Fletcher Amy Lowell F S Flint D H Lawrence and others They are gathering followers and imitators
7299-88365-0078	train-other-500	To these followers I would say the Imagist impulse need not be confined to verse Why would you be imitators of these leaders when you might be creators in a new medium There is a clear parallelism between their point of view in verse
7299-88365-0079	train-other-500	and the Intimate and friendly Photoplay especially when it is developed from the standpoint of the last part of chapter nine space measured without sound plus time measured without sound
7299-88365-0080	train-other-500	There is no clan to day more purely devoted to art for art s sake than the Imagist clan An Imagist film would offer a noble challenge to the overstrained emotion the over loaded splendor the mere repetition
7299-88365-0081	train-other-500	of what are at present the finest photoplays Now even the masterpieces are incontinent Except for some of the old one reel Biographs of Griffith s beginning there is nothing of Doric restraint from the best to the worst
7299-88365-0082	train-other-500	Read some of the poems of the people listed above then imagine the same moods in the films Imagist photoplays would be Japanese prints taking on life animated Japanese paintings
7299-88365-0083	train-other-500	Pompeian mosaics in kaleidoscopic but logical succession Beardsley drawings made into actors and scenery Greek vase paintings in motion Scarcely a photoplay but hints at the Imagists in one scene
7299-88365-0084	train-other-500	Then the illusion is lost in the next turn of the reel Perhaps it would be a sound observance to confine this form of motion picture to a half reel or quarter reel just as the Imagist poem is generally a half or quarter page A series of them
7299-88365-0085	train-other-500	could fill a special evening The Imagists are colorists Some people do not consider that photographic black white and gray are color But here for instance are seven colors which the Imagists might use
none	none	 one The whiteness of swans in the light 
7299-88365-0086	train-other-500	two The whiteness of swans in a gentle shadow three The color of a sunburned man in the light four His color in a gentle shadow five His color in a deeper shadow six The blackness of black velvet in the light
7299-88365-0087	train-other-500	seven The blackness of black velvet in a deep shadow And to use these colors with definite steps from one to the other does not militate against an artistic mystery of edge and softness in the flow of line
7299-88365-0088	train-other-500	There is a list of possible Imagist textures which is only limited by the number of things to be seen in the world Probably only seven or ten would be used in one scheme and the same list kept through one production
7299-88365-0089	train-other-500	The Imagist photoplay will put discipline into the inner ranks of the enlightened and remind the sculptors painters and architects of the movies that there is a continence even beyond sculpture and that seas of realism
7299-88365-0090	train-other-500	may not have the power of a little well considered elimination The use of the scientific film by established institutions like schools and state governments has been discussed
7299-88365-0091	train-other-500	Let the Church also in her own way avail herself of the motion picture whole heartedly as in mediaeval time she took over the marvel of Italian painting There was a stage in her history when religious representation was by Byzantine mosaics noble in color
7299-88365-0092	train-other-500	having an architectural use but curious indeed to behold from the standpoint of those who crave a sensitive emotional record
none	none	 The first paintings of Cimabue and Giotto 
7299-88365-0093	train-other-500	giving these formulas a touch of life were hailed with joy by all Italy
none	none	 Now the Church Universal has an opportunity to establish her new painters if she will 
7299-88365-0094	train-other-500	She has taken over in the course of history for her glory miracle plays Romanesque and Gothic architecture stained glass windows and the music of saint Cecilia s organ Why not this new splendor
7299-88365-0095	train-other-500	The Cathedral of saint John the Divine on Morningside Heights should establish in its crypt motion pictures as thoroughly considered as the lines of that building if possible designed by the architects thereof with the same sense of permanency
none	none	 This chapter does not advocate that the Church lay hold of the photoplays as one more medium for reillustrating the stories of the Bible as they are given in the Sunday school papers It is not pietistic simpering that will feed the spirit of Christendom 
7299-88365-0096	train-other-500	but a steady church patronage of the most skilful and original motion picture artists Let the Church follow the precedent which finally gave us Fra Angelico Botticelli Andrea del Sarto Leonardo da Vinci Raphael Michelangelo Correggio Titian
none	none	 Paul Veronese Tintoretto and the rest 
7299-88365-0097	train-other-500	Who will endow the successors of the present woman s suffrage film and other great crusading films Who will see that the public documents and university researches take on the form of motion pictures
7299-88365-0098	train-other-500	Who will endow the local photoplay and the Imagist photoplay
none	none	 Who will take the first great measures to insure motion picture splendors in the church Things such as these come on the winds of to morrow But let the crusader look about him and where it is possible put in the diplomatic word and cooeperate with the Gray Norns CHAPTER XVIII ARCHITECTS AS CRUSADERS Many a worker sees his future America as a Utopia in which his own profession achieving dictatorship alleviates the ills of men The militarist grows dithyrambic in showing how war makes for the blessings of peace The economic teacher argues that if we follow his political economy none of us will have to economize The church fanatic says if all churches will merge with his organization none of them will have to try to behave again They will just naturally be good The physician hopes to abolish the devil by sanitation We have our Utopias Despite levity the present writer thinks that such hopes are among the most useful things the earth possesses A normal man in the full tide of his activities finds that a world machinery could logically be built up by his profession At least in the heyday of his working hours his vocation satisfies his heart So he wants the entire human race to taste that satisfaction Approximate Utopias have been built from the beginning Many civilizations have had some dominant craft to carry them the major part of the way The priests have made India The classical student has preserved Old China to its present hour of new life The samurai knights have made Japan Sailors have evolved the British Empire One of the enticing future Americas is that of the architect Let the architect appropriate the photoplay as his means of propaganda and begin From its intrinsic genius it can give his profession a start beyond all others in dominating this land Or such is one of many speculations of the present writer The photoplay can speak the language of the man who has a mind World s Fair size That we are going to have successive generations of such builders may be reasonably implied from past expositions Beginning with Philadelphia in eighteen seventy six and going on to San Francisco and San Diego in nineteen fifteen nothing seems to stop us from the habit Let us enlarge this proclivity into a national mission in as definite a movement as thoroughly thought out as the evolution of the public school system the formation of the Steel Trust and the like After duly weighing all the world s fairs let our architects set about making the whole of the United States into a permanent one Supposing the date to begin the erection be nineteen thirty Till that time there should be tireless if indirect propaganda that will further the architectural state of mind and later bring about the elucidation of the plans while they are being perfected For many years this America founded on the psychology of the Splendor Photoplay will be evolving It might be conceived as a going concern at a certain date within the lives of men now living but it should never cease to develop To make films of a more beautiful United States is as practical and worth while a custom as to make military spy maps of every inch of a neighbor s territory putting in each fence and cross roads Those who would satisfy the national pride with something besides battle flags must give our people an objective as shining and splendid as war when it is most glittering something Napoleonic and with no outward pretence of excessive virtue We want a substitute as dramatic internationally yet world winning friend making If America is to become the financial centre through no fault of her own that fact must have a symbol other than guns on the sea coast If it is inexpedient for the architectural patriarchs and their young hopefuls to take over the films bodily let a board of strategy be formed who make it their business to eat dinner with the scenario writers producers and owners conspiring with them in some practical way Why should we not consider ourselves a deathless Panama Pacific Exposition on a coast to coast scale Let Chicago be the transportation building Denver the mining building Let Kansas City be the agricultural building and Jacksonville Florida the horticultural building and so around the states Even as in mediaeval times men rode for hundreds of miles through perils to the permanent fairs of the free cities the world travellers will attend this exhibit and many of them will in the end become citizens Our immigration will be something more than tide upon tide of raw labor The Architects would send forth publicity films which are not only delineations of a future Cincinnati Cleveland or saint Louis but whole counties and states and groups of states could be planned at one time with the development of their natural fauna flora and forestry Wherever nature has been rendered desolate by industry or mere haste there let the architect and park architect proclaim the plan Wherever she is still splendid and untamed let her not be violated America is in the state of mind where she must visualize herself again If it is not possible to bring in the New Jerusalem to day by public act with every citizen eating bread and honey under his vine and fig tree owning forty acres and a mule singing hymns and saying prayers all his leisure hours it is still reasonable to think out tremendous things the American people can do in the light of what they have done without sacrificing any of their native cussedness or kick It was sprawling Chicago that in eighteen ninety three achieved the White City The automobile routes bind the states together closer than muddy counties were held in eighteen ninety three A Permanent World s Fair may be a phrase distressing to the literal mind Perhaps it would be better to say An Architect s America Let each city take expert counsel from the architectural demigods how to tear out the dirty core of its principal business square and erect a combination of civic centre and permanent and glorious bazaar Let the public debate the types of state flower tree and shrub that are expedient the varieties of villages and middle sized towns farm homes and connecting parkways Sometimes it seems to me the American expositions are as characteristic things as our land has achieved They went through without hesitation The difficulties of one did not deter the erection of the next The United States may be in many things slack Often the democracy looks hopelessly shoddy But it cannot be denied that our people have always risen to the dignity of these great architectural projects Once the population understand they are dealing with the same type of idea on a grander scale they will follow to the end We are not proposing an economic revolution or that human nature be suddenly altered If California can remain in the World s Fair state of mind for four or five years and finally achieve such a splendid result all the states can undertake a similar project conjointly and because of the momentum of a nation moving together remain in that mind for the length of the life of a man Here we have this great instrument the motion picture the fourth largest industry in the United States attended daily by ten million people and in ten days by a hundred million capable of interpreting the largest conceivable ideas that come within the range of the plastic arts and those ideas have not been supplied It is still the plaything of newly rich vaudeville managers The nation goes daily through intrinsic interest in the device and is dosed with such continued stories as the Adventures of Kathlyn What Happened to Mary and the Million Dollar Mystery stretched on through reel after reel week after week Kathlyn had no especial adventures Nothing in particular happened to Mary The million dollar mystery was why did the millionaires who owned such a magnificent instrument descend to such silliness and impose it on the people Why cannot our weekly story be henceforth some great plan that is being worked out whose history will delight us For instance every stage of the building of the Panama Canal was followed with the greatest interest in the films But there was not enough of it to keep the films busy The great material projects are often easier to realize than the little moral reforms Beautiful architectural undertakings while appearing to be material and succeeding by the laws of American enterprise bring with them the healing hand of beauty Beauty is not directly pious but does more civilizing in its proper hour than many sermons or laws The world seems to be in the hands of adventurers Why not this for the adventure of the American architects If something akin to this plan does not come to pass through photoplay propaganda it means there is no American builder with the blood of Julius Caesar in his veins If there is the old brute lust for empire left in any builder let him awake The world is before him As for the other Utopians the economist the physician the puritan as soon as the architects have won over the photoplay people let these others take sage counsel and ensnare the architects Is there a reform worth while that cannot be embodied and enforced by a builder s invention A mere city plan carried out or the name or intent of a quasi public building and the list of offices within it may bring about more salutary economic change than all the debating and voting imaginable So without too much theorizing why not erect our new America and move into it CHAPTER XIX ON COMING FORTH BY DAY If he will be so indulgent with his author let the reader approach the photoplay theatre as though for the first time having again a new point of view Here the poorest can pay and enter from the glaring afternoon into the twilight of an Ali Baba s cave The dime is the single open sesame required The half light wherein the audience is seated by which they can read in an emergency is as bright and dark as that of some candle lit churches It reveals much in the faces and figures of the audience that cannot be seen by common day Hard edges are the main things that we lose The gain is in all the delicacies of modelling tone relations form and color A hundred evanescent impressions come and go There is often a tenderness of appeal about the most rugged face in the assembly 
5672_88367_000003_000009	train-clean-360	Humanity takes on its sacred aspect 
none	none	It is a crude mind that would insist that these appearances are not real that the eye does not see them when all eyes behold them To say dogmatically that any new thing seen by half light is an illusion is like arguing that a discovery by the telescope or microscope is unreal If the appearances are beautiful besides they are not only facts but assets in our lives Book reading is not done in the direct noon sunlight 
5672_88367_000004_000001	train-clean-360	We retire to the shaded porch 
5672_88367_000004_000002	train-clean-360	It takes two more steps toward quietness of light to read the human face and figure 
none	none	Many great paintings and poems are records of things discovered in this quietness of light It is indeed ironical in our Ali Baba s cave to see sheer everydayness and hardness upon the screen the audience dragged back to the street they have escaped One of the inventions to bring the twilight of the gathering into brotherhood with the shadows on the screen is a simple thing known to the trade as the fadeaway that had its rise in a commonplace fashion as a method of keeping the story from ending with the white glare of the empty screen As a result of the device the figures in the first episode emerge from the dimness and in the last one go back into the shadow whence they came as foam returns to the darkness of an evening sea 
5672_88367_000005_000003	train-clean-360	In the imaginative pictures the principle begins to be applied more largely till throughout the fairy story the figures float in and out from the unknown as fancies should 
none	none	This method in its simplicity counts more to keep the place an Ali Baba s cave than many a more complicated procedure In luxurious scenes it brings the soft edges of Correggio and in solemn ones a light and shadow akin to the effects of Rembrandt 
5672_88367_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Now we have a darkness on which we can paint an unspoiled twilight 
5672_88367_000006_000001	train-clean-360	We need not call it the Arabian s cave 
none	none	There is a tomb we might have definitely in mind an Egyptian burying place where with a torch we might enter read the inscriptions and see the illustrations from the Book of the Dead on the wall or finding that ancient papyrus in the mummy case unroll it and show it to the eager assembly and have the feeling of return Man is an Egyptian first before he is any other type of civilized being 
5672_88367_000006_000004	train-clean-360	The Nile flows through his heart 
none	none	So let this cave be Egypt let us incline ourselves to revere the unconscious memories that echo within us when we see the hieroglyphics of Osiris and Isis Egypt was our long brooding youth 
5672_88367_000006_000007	train-clean-360	We built the mysteriousness of the Universe into the Pyramids carved it into every line of the Sphinx 
none	none	We thought always of the immemorial The reel now before us is the mighty judgment roll dealing with the question of our departure in such a way that any man who beholds it will bear the impress of the admonition upon his heart forever Those Egyptian priests did no little thing when amid their superstitions they still proclaimed the Judgment Let no one consider himself ready for death till like the men by the Nile he can call up every scene face with courage every exigency of the ordeal There is one copy of the Book of the Dead of especial interest made for the Scribe Ani with exquisite marginal drawings Copies may be found in our large libraries The particular fac simile I had the honor to see was in the Lenox Library New York several years ago Ani according to the formula of the priesthood goes through the adventures required of a shade before he reaches the court of Osiris All the Egyptian pictures on tomb wall and temple are but enlarged picture writing made into tableaus Through such tableaus Ani moves The Ani manuscript has so fascinated some of the Egyptologists that it is copied in figures fifteen feet high on the walls of two of the rooms of the British Museum And you can read the story eloquently told in Maspero Ani knocks at many doors in the underworld Monstrous gatekeepers are squatting on their haunches with huge knives to slice him if he cannot remember their names or give the right password or by spells the priests have taught him convince the sentinels that he is Osiris himself To further the illusion the name of Osiris is inscribed on his breast While he is passing these perils his little wife is looking on by a sort of clairvoyant sympathy though she is still alive She is depicted mourning him and embracing his mummy on earth at the same time she accompanies him through the shadows Ani ploughs and sows and reaps in the fields of the underworld 
5672_88367_000010_000001	train-clean-360	He is carried past a dreadful place on the back of the cow Hathor 
none	none	After as many adventures as Browning s Childe Roland he steps into the judgment hall of the gods 
5672_88367_000010_000003	train-clean-360	They sit in majestic rows 
none	none	He makes the proper sacrifices and advances to the scales of justice There he sees his own heart weighed against the ostrich feather of Truth by the jackal god Anubis who has already presided at his embalming His own soul in the form of a human headed hawk watches the ceremony His ghost which is another entity looks through the door with his little wife Both of them watch with tense anxiety The fate of every phase of his personality depends upon the purity of his heart Lying in wait behind Anubis is a monster part crocodile part lion part hippopotamus This terror will eat the heart of Ani if it is found corrupt 
5672_88367_000011_000002	train-clean-360	At last he is declared justified 
none	none	Thoth the ibis headed God of Writing records the verdict on his tablet The justified Ani moves on past the baffled devourer with the mystic presence of his little wife rejoicing at his side They go to the awful court of Osiris 
5672_88367_000011_000006	train-clean-360	She makes sacrifice with him there 
none	none	The God of the Dead is indeed a strange deity a seated semi animated mummy with all the appurtenances of royalty and with the four sons of Horus on a lotus before him and his two wives Isis and Nephthys standing behind his throne with their hands on his shoulders The justified soul now boards the boat in which the sun rides as it journeys through the night He rises a glorious boatman in the morning working an oar to speed the craft through the high ocean of the noon sky Henceforth he makes the eternal round with the sun Therefore in Ancient Egypt the roll was called not the Book of the Dead but The Chapters on Coming Forth by Day This book on motion pictures does not profess to be an expert treatise on Egyptology as well The learned folk are welcome to amend the modernisms that have crept into it But the fact remains that something like this story in one form or another held Egypt spell bound for many hundred years 
5672_88367_000013_000003	train-clean-360	It was the force behind every mummification 
none	none	It was the reason for the whole Egyptian system of life death and entombment for the man not embalmed could not make the journey So the explorer finds the Egyptian with a roll of this papyrus as a guide book on his mummy breast The soul needed to return for refreshment periodically to the stone chamber and the mummy mutilated or destroyed could not entertain the guest Egypt cried out through thousands of years for the ultimate resurrection of the whole man his coming forth by day We need not fear that a story that so dominated a race will be lost on modern souls when vividly set forth Is it too much to expect that some American prophet wizard of the future will give us this film in the spirit of an Egyptian priest 
5672_88367_000015_000000	train-clean-360	The Greeks the wisest people in our limited system of classics bowed down before the Egyptian hierarchy 
none	none	That cult must have had a fine personal authority and glamour to master such men The unseen mysteries were always on the Egyptian heart as a burden and a consolation and though there may have been jugglers in the outer courts of these temples as there have been in the courts of all temples no mere actor could make an Egyptian priest of himself Their very alphabet has a regal enchantment in its lines and the same aesthetic mystical power remains in their pylons and images under the blaze of the all revealing noonday sun Here is a nation America going for dreams into caves as shadowy as the tomb of Queen Thi There they find too often not that ancient priestess and ruler nor any of her kin nor yet Ani the scribe nor yet any of the kings but shabby rags of fancy or circuses that were better in the street Because ten million people daily enter into the cave something akin to Egyptian wizardry certain national rituals will be born By studying the matter of being an Egyptian priest for a little while the author producer may learn in the end how best to express and satisfy the spirit hungers that are peculiarly American It is sometimes out of the oldest dream that the youngest vision is born CHAPTER XX THE PROPHET WIZARD The whirlwind of cowboys and Indians with which the photoplay began came about because this instrument in asserting its genius was feeling its way toward the most primitive forms of life it could find Now there is a tendency for even wilder things We behold the half draped figures living in tropical islands or our hairy fore fathers acting out narratives of the stone age The moving picture conventionality permits an abbreviation of drapery If the primitive setting is convincing the figure in the grass robe or buffalo hide at once has its rights over the healthful imagination There is in this nation of moving picture goers a hunger for tales of fundamental life that are not yet told The cave man longs with an incurable homesickness for his ancient day One of the fine photoplays of primeval life is the story called Man s Genesis described in chapter two We face the exigency the world over of vast instruments like national armies being played against each other as idly and aimlessly as the checker men on the cracker barrels of corner groceries And this invention the kinetoscope which affects or will affect as many people as the guns of Europe is not yet understood in its powers particularly those of bringing back the primitive in a big rich way The primitive is always a new and higher beginning to the man who understands it Not yet has the producer learned that the feeling of the crowd is patriarchal splendid He imagines the people want nothing but a silly lark All this apparatus and opportunity and no immortal soul Yet by faith and a study of the signs we proclaim that this lantern of wizard drama is going to give us in time the visible things in the fulness of their primeval force and some that have been for a long time invisible To speak in a metaphor we are going to have the primitive life of Genesis then all that evolution after Exodus Leviticus Numbers Deuteronomy Joshua Judges and on to a new revelation of saint John In this adolescence of Democracy the history of man is to be retraced the same round on a higher spiral of life Our democratic dream has been a middle class aspiration built on a bog of toil soddened minds The piles beneath the castle of our near democratic arts were rotting for lack of folk imagination The Man with the Hoe had no spark in his brain But now a light is blazing We can build the American soul broad based from the foundations We can begin with dreams the veriest stone club warrior can understand and as far as an appeal to the eye can do it lead him in fancy through every phase of life to the apocalyptic splendors This progress according to the metaphor of this chapter will be led by prophet wizards These were the people that dominated the cave men of old But what more specifically are prophet wizards Let us consider two kinds of present day people scientific inventors on the one hand and makers of art and poetry and the like on the other The especial producers of art and poetry that we are concerned with in this chapter we will call prophet wizards men like Albert Duerer Rembrandt Blake Elihu Vedder Watts Rossetti Tennyson Coleridge Poe Maeterlinck Yeats Francis Thompson They have a certain unearthly fascination in some one or many of their works A few other men might be added to the list Most great names are better described under other categories though as much beloved in their own way But these are especially adapted to being set in opposition to a list of mechanical inventors that might be called realists by contrast the Wright brothers and H Pierpont Langley Thomas A Edison Charles Steinmetz John Hays Hammond Hudson Maxim Graham Bell The prophet wizards are of various schools But they have a common tendency and character in bringing forth a type of art peculiarly at war with the realistic civilization science has evolved It is one object of this chapter to show that when it comes to a clash between the two forces the wizards should rule and the realists should serve them The two functions go back through history sometimes at war other days in alliance The poet and the scientist were brethren in the centuries of alchemy Tennyson bearing in mind such a period took the title of Merlin in his veiled autobiography Merlin and the Gleam Wizards and astronomers were one when the angels sang in Bethlehem Peace on Earth Good Will to Men There came magicians saying Where is he that is born king of the Jews for we have seen his star in the east and have come to worship him The modern world in its gentler moments seems to take a peculiar thrill of delight from these travellers perhaps realizing what has been lost from parting with such gentle seers and secular diviners Every Christmas half the magazines set them forth in richest colors riding across the desert following the star to the same manger where the shepherds are depicted Those wizard kings whatever useless charms and talismans they wore stood for the unknown quantity in spiritual life A magician is a man who lays hold on the unseen for the mere joy of it who steals if necessary the holy bread and the sacred fire He is often of the remnant of an ostracized and disestablished priesthood He is a free lance in the soul world owing final allegiance to no established sect The fires of prophecy are as apt to descend upon him as upon members of the established faith He loves the mysterious for the beauty of it the wildness and the glory of it and not always to compel stiff necked people to do right It seems to me that the scientific and poetic functions of society should make common cause again if they are not as in Merlin s time combined in one personality They must recognize that they serve the same society but with the understanding that the prophetic function is the most important the wizard vocation the next and the inventors and realists genius important indeed but the third consideration The war between the scientists and the prophet wizards has come about because of the half defined ambition of the scientists to rule or ruin They give us the steam engine the skyscraper the steam heat the flying machine the elevated railroad the apartment house the newspaper the breakfast food the weapons of the army the weapons of the navy and think that they have beautified our existence Moreover some one rises at this point to make a plea for the scientific imagination He says the inventor scientists have brought us the mystery of electricity which is no hocus pocus but a special manifestation of the Immanent God within us and about us He says the student in the laboratory brought us the X ray the wireless telegraph the mystery of radium the mystery of all the formerly unharnessed power of God which man is beginning to gather into the hollow of his hand The one who pleads for the scientific imagination points out that Edison has been called the American Wizard All honor to Edison and his kind And I admit specifically that Edison took the first great mechanical step to give us the practical kinetoscope and make it possible that the photographs even of inanimate objects thrown upon the mirror screen may become celestial actors But the final phase of the transfiguration is not the work of this inventor or any other As long as the photoplays are in the hands of men like Edison they are mere voodooism We have nothing but Moving Day as heretofore described It is only in the hands of the prophetic photo playwright and allied artists that the kinetoscope reels become as mysterious and dazzling to the thinking spirit as the wheels of Ezekiel in the first chapter of his prophecy One can climb into the operator s box and watch the sword like stream of light till he is as dazzled in flesh and spirit as the moth that burns its wings in the lamp But this is while a glittering vision and not a mere invention is being thrown upon the screen The scientific man can explain away the vision as a matter of the technique of double exposure double printing trick turning or stopping down And having reduced it to terms and shown the process he expects us to become secular and casual again But of course the sun itself is a mere trick of heat and light a dynamo an incandescent globe to the man in the laboratory To us it must be a fire upon the altar Transubstantiation must begin Our young magicians must derive strange new pulse beats from the veins of the earth from the sap of the trees from the lightning of the sky as well as the alchemical acids metals and flames Then they will kindle the beginning mysteries for our cause They will build up a priesthood that is free yet authorized to freedom It will be established and disestablished according to the intrinsic authority of the light revealed Now for a closer view of this vocation The picture of Religious Splendor has its obvious form in the delineation of Biblical scenes which in the hands of the best commercial producers can be made as worth while as the work of men like Tissot Such films are by no means to be thought of lightly This sort of work will remain in the minds of many of the severely orthodox as the only kind of a religious picture worthy of classification But there are many further fields Just as the wireless receiving station or the telephone switchboard become heroes in the photoplay so Aaron s rod that confounded the Egyptians the brazen serpent that Moses up lifted in the wilderness the ram s horn that caused the fall of Jericho the mantle of Elijah descending upon the shoulders of Elisha from the chariot of fire can take on a physical electrical power and a hundred times spiritual meaning that they could not have in the dead stage properties of the old miracle play or the realism of the Tissot school The waterfall and the tossing sea are dramatis personae in the ordinary film romance So the Red Sea overwhelming Pharaoh the fires of Nebuchadnezzar s furnace sparing and sheltering the three holy children can become celestial actors And winged couriers can appear in the pictures with missions of import just as an angel descended to Joshua saying As captain of the host of the Lord am I now come The pure mechanic does not accept the doctrine Your alleged supernatural appearance he says is based on such a simple fact as this two pictures can be taken on one film But the analogy holds Many primitive peoples are endowed with memories that are double photographs The world faiths based upon centuries of these appearances are none the less to be revered because machine ridden men have temporarily lost the power of seeing their thoughts as pictures in the air and for the time abandoned the task of adding to tradition Man will not only see visions again but machines themselves in the hands of prophets will see visions In the hands of commercial men they are seeing alleged visions and the term vision is a part of moving picture studio slang unutterably cheapening religion and tradition When Confucius came he said one of his tasks was the rectification of names The leaders of this age should see that this word vision comes to mean something more than a piece of studio slang If it is the conviction of serious minds that the mass of men shall never again see pictures out of Heaven except through such mediums as the kinetoscope lens let all the higher forces of our land courageously lay hold upon this thing that saves us from perpetual spiritual blindness When the thought of primitive man embodied in misty forms on the landscape reached epic proportions in the Greek he saw the Olympians more plainly than he beheld the Acropolis Myron Polykleitos Phidias Scopas Lysippus Praxiteles discerned the gods and demigods so clearly they afterward cut them from the hard marble without wavering Our guardian angels of to day must be as clearly seen and nobly hewn A double mental vision is as fundamental in human nature as the double necessity for air and light It is as obvious as that a thing can be both written and spoken We have maintained that the kinetoscope in the hands of artists is a higher form of picture writing In the hands of prophet wizards it will be a higher form of vision seeing I have said that the commercial men are seeing alleged visions Take for instance the large Italian film that attempts to popularize Dante Though it has a scattering of noble passages and in some brief episodes it is an enhancement of Gustave Dore taking it as a whole it is a false thing It is full of apparitions worked out with mechanical skill yet Dante s soul is not back of the fires and swords of light It gives to the uninitiated an outline of the stage paraphernalia of the Inferno It has an encyclopaedic value If Dante himself had been the high director in the plenitude of his resources it might still have had that hollowness A list of words making a poem and a set of apparently equivalent pictures forming a photoplay may have an entirely different outcome It may be like trying to see a perfume or listen to a taste Religion that comes in wholly through the eye has a new world in the films whose relation to the old is only discovered by experiment and intuition patience and devotion But let us imagine the grandson of an Italian immigrant to America a young seer trained in the photoplay technique by the high American masters knowing all the moving picture resources as Dante knew Italian song and mediaeval learning Assume that he has a genius akin to that of the Florentine Let him be a Modernist Catholic if you will Let him begin his message in the timber lands of Minnesota or the forests of Alaska In midway of this our mortal life I found me in a gloomy wood astray Then let him paint new pictures of just punishment beyond the grave and merciful rehabilitation and great reward Let his Hell Purgatory and Paradise be built of those things which are deepest and highest in the modern mind yet capable of emerging in picture writing form Men are needed therefore they will come And lest they come weeping accursed and alone let us ask how shall we recognize them There is no standard by which to discern the true from the false prophet except the mood that is engendered by contemplating the messengers of the past Every man has his own roll call of noble magicians selected from the larger group But here are the names with which this chapter began with some words on their work Albert Duerer is classed as a Renaissance painter Yet his art has its dwelling place in the early Romanesque savageness and strangeness And the reader remembers Duerer s brooding muse called Melancholia that so obsessed Kipling in The Light that Failed But the wonder quality went into nearly all the Duerer wood cuts and etchings Rembrandt is a prophet wizard not only in his shadowy portraits but in his etchings of holy scenes even his simplest cobweb lines become incantations Other artists in the high tides of history have had kindred qualities but coming close to our day Elihu Vedder the American the illustrator of the Rubaiyat found it a poem questioning all things and his very illustrations answer in a certain fashion with winds of infinity and bring the songs of Omar near to the Book of Job Vedder s portraits of Lazarus and Samson are conceptions that touch the hem of the unknown George Frederick Watts was a painter of portraits of the soul itself as in his delineations of Burne Jones and Morris and Tennyson It is a curious thing that two prophet wizards have combined pictures and song Blake and Rossetti whatever the failure of their technique never lacked in enchantment Students of the motion picture side of poetry would naturally turn to such men for spiritual precedents Blake that strange Londoner in his book of Job is the paramount example of the enchanter doing his work with the engraving tool in his hand Rossetti s Dante s Dream is a painting on the edge of every poet s paradise As for the poetry of these two men there are Blake s Songs of Innocence and Rossetti s Blessed Damozel and his Burden of Nineveh As for the other poets we have Coleridge the author of Christabel that piece of winter witchcraft Kubla Khan that oriental dazzlement and the Ancient Mariner that most English of all this list of enchantments Of Tennyson s work besides Merlin and the Gleam there are the poems when the mantle was surely on his shoulders The Lady of Shalott The Lotus Eaters Sir Galahad and saint Agnes Eve Edgar Poe always a magician blends this power with the prophetical note in the poem The Haunted Palace and in the stories of William Wilson The Black Cat and The Tell tale Heart This prophet wizard side of a man otherwise a wizard only has been well illustrated in The Avenging Conscience photoplay From Maeterlinck we have The Bluebird and many another dream I devoutly hope I will never see in the films an attempt to paraphrase this master But some disciple of his should conquer the photoplay medium giving us great original works Yeats has bestowed upon us The Land of Heart s Desire The Secret Rose and many another piece of imaginative glory Let us hope that we may be spared any attempts to hastily paraphrase his wonders for the motion pictures But the man that reads Yeats will be better prepared to do his own work in the films or to greet the young new masters when they come Finally Francis Thompson in The Hound of Heaven has written a song that the young wizard may lean upon forevermore for private guidance It is composed of equal parts of wonder and conscience With this poem in his heart the roar of the elevated railroad will be no more in his ears and he will dream of palaces of righteousness and lead other men to dream of them till the houses of mammon fade away CHAPTER XXI THE ACCEPTABLE YEAR OF THE LORD Without airing my private theology I earnestly request the most sceptical reader of this book to assume that miracles in a Biblical sense have occurred Let him take it for granted in the fashion of the strictly aesthetic commentator who writes in sympathy with a Fra Angelico painting or as that great modernist Paul Sabatier does as he approaches the problems of faith in the life of saint Francis Let him also assume for the length of time that he is reading this chapter if no longer that miracles in a Biblical sense as vivid and as real to the body of the Church will again occur two thousand years in the future events as wonderful as those others twenty centuries back Let us anticipate that many of these will be upon American soil Particularly as sons and daughters of a new country it is a spiritual necessity for us to look forward to traditions because we have so few from the past identified with the six feet of black earth beneath us The functions of the prophet whereby he definitely painted future sublimities have been too soon abolished in the minds of the wise Mere forecasting is left to the weather bureau so far as a great section of the purely literary and cultured are concerned The term prophet has survived in literature to be applied to men like Carlyle fiery spiritual leaders who speak with little pretence of revealing to morrow But in the street definite forecasting of future events is still the vulgar use of the term Dozens of sober historians predicted the present war with a clean cut story that was carried out with much faithfulness of detail considering the thousand interests involved They have been called prophets in a congratulatory secular tone by the man in the street These felicitations come because well authorized merchants in futures have been put out of countenance from the days of Jonah and Balaam till now It is indeed a risky vocation Yet there is an undeniable line of successful forecasting by the hardy to be found in the Scripture and in history In direct proportion as these men of fiery speech were free from sheer silliness their outlook has been considered and debated by the gravest people round them The heart of man craves the seer Take for instance the promise of the restoration of Jerusalem in glory that fills the latter part of the Old Testament It moves the Jewish Zionist the true race Jew to this hour He is even now endeavoring to fulfil the prophecy Consider the words of John the Baptist One mightier than I cometh the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire A magnificent foreshadowing being both a spiritual insight and the statement of a great definite event The heeded seers of the civilization of this our day have been secular in their outlook Perhaps the most striking was Karl Marx in the middle of the capitalistic system tracing its development from feudalism and pointing out as inevitable long before they came such modern institutions as the Steel Trust and the Standard Oil Company It remains to be seen whether the Marxian prophecy of the international alliance of workingmen that is obscured by the present conflict in Europe and other of his forecastings will be ultimately verified There have been secular teachers like Darwin who by a scientific reconstruction of the past have implied an evolutionary future based on the biological outlook Deductions from the teachings of Darwin are said to control those who mould the international doings of Germany and Japan There have been inventor seers like Jules Verne In Twenty Thousand Leagues under the Sea he dimly discerned the submarine There is a type of social prophet allied to Verne Edward Bellamy in Looking Backward reduced the world to a matter of pressing the button turning on the phonograph It was a combination of glorified department store and Coney Island on a cooperative basis A seventeen year old boy from the country making his first visit to the Woolworth building in New York and riding in the subway when it is not too crowded might be persuaded by an eloquent city relative that this is Bellamy s New Jerusalem A soul with a greater insight is H G Wells But he too in spite of his humanitarian heart has in a great mass of his work the laboratory imagination Serious Americans pronounce themselves beneficiaries of Wells works and I confess myself edified and thoroughly grateful Nevertheless one smells chemicals in the next room when he reads most of Wells prophecies The X ray has moved that Englishman s mind more dangerously than moonlight touches the brain of the chanting witch One striking and typical story is The Food of the Gods It is not only a fine speculation but a great parable The reader may prefer other tales Many times Wells has gone into his laboratory to invent our future in the same state of mind in which an automobile manufacturer works out an improvement in his car His disposition has greatly mellowed of late in this respect but underneath he is the same Wells Citizens of America wise or foolish when they look into the coming days have the submarine mood of Verne the press the button complacency of Bellamy the wireless telegraph enthusiasm of Wells If they express hopes that can be put into pictures with definite edges they order machinery piled to the skies They see the redeemed United States running deftly in its jewelled sockets ticking like a watch This their own chosen outlook wearies the imaginations of our people they do not know why It gives no full orbed apocalyptic joy Only to the young mechanical engineer does such a hope express real Utopia He can always keep ahead of the devices that herald its approach No matter what day we attain and how busy we are adjusting ourselves he can be moving on inventing more to morrows ruling the age not being ruled by it Because this Utopia is in the air a goodly portion of the precocious boys turn to mechanical engineering Youths with this bent are the most healthful and inspiring young citizens we have They and their like will fulfil a multitude of the hopes of men like Verne Bellamy and Wells But if every mechanical inventor on earth voiced his dearest wish and lived to see it worked out the real drama of prophecy and fulfilment as written in the imagination of the human race would remain uncompleted As missus Browning says in Lady Geraldine s Courtship If we trod the deeps of ocean if we struck the stars in rising If we wrapped the globe intensely with one hot electric breath Twere but power within our tether no new spirit power comprising And in life we were not greater men nor bolder men in death saint John beheld the New Jerusalem coming down out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband not equipped as a touring car varnished for its owner It is my hope that the moving picture prophet wizards will set before the world a new group of pictures of the future The chapter on The Architect as a Crusader endeavors to show how by proclaiming that America will become a permanent World s Fair she can be made so within the lives of men now living if courageous architects have the campaign in hand There are other hopes that look a long way further They peer as far into the coming day as the Chinese historian looks into the past And then they are but halfway to the millennium Any standard illustrator could give us Verne or Bellamy or Wells if he did his best But we want pictures beyond the skill of any delineator in the old mediums yet within the power of the wizard photoplay producer Oh you who are coming to morrow show us everyday America as it will be when we are only halfway to the millennium yet thousands of years in the future Tell what type of honors men will covet what property they will still be apt to steal what murders they will commit what the law court and the jail will be or what will be the substitutes how the newspaper will appear the office the busy street Picture to America the lovers in her half millennium when usage shall have become iron handed once again when noble sweethearts must break beautiful customs for the sake of their dreams Show us the gantlet of strange courtliness they must pass through before they reach one another obstacles brought about by the immemorial distinctions of scholarship gowns or service badges Make a picture of a world where machinery is so highly developed it utterly disappeared long ago Show us the antique United States with ivy vines upon the popular socialist churches and weather beaten images of socialist saints in the niches of the doors Show us the battered fountains the brooding universities the dusty libraries Show us houses of administration with statues of heroes in front of them and gentle banners flowing from their pinnacles Then paint pictures of the oldest trees of the time and tree revering ceremonies with unique costumes and a special priesthood Show us the marriage procession the christening the consecration of the boy and girl to the state Show us the political processions and election riots Show us the people with their graceful games their religious pantomimes Show us impartially the memorial scenes to celebrate the great men and women and the funerals of the poor And then moving on toward the millennium itself show America after her victories have been won and she has grown old as old as the Sphinx Then give us the Dragon and Armageddon and the Lake of Fire Author producer photographer who would prophesy read the last book in the Bible not to copy it in form and color but that its power and grace and terror may enter into you Delineate in your own way as you are led on your own Patmos the picture of our land redeemed After fasting and prayer let the Spirit conduct you till you see in definite line and form the throngs of the brotherhood of man the colonnades where the arts are expounded the gardens where the children dance That which man desires that will man become He largely fulfils his own prediction and vision Let him therefore have a care how he prophesies and prays We shall have a tin heaven and a tin earth if the scientists are allowed exclusive command of our highest hours Let us turn to Luke iv seventeen And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esaias And when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the Gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the broken hearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord And he closed the book and he gave it again to the minister and sat down And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him And he began to say unto them This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears And all bare him witness and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of his mouth And they said Is not this Joseph s son I am moved to think Christ fulfilled that prophecy because he had read it from childhood It is my entirely personal speculation not brought forth dogmatically that Scripture is not so much inspired as it is curiously and miraculously inspiring If the New Isaiahs of this time will write their forecastings in photoplay hieroglyphics the children in times to come having seen those films from infancy or their later paraphrases in more perfect form can rise and say This day is this Scripture fulfilled in your ears But without prophecy there is no fulfilment without Isaiah there is no Christ America is often shallow in her dreams because she has no past in the European and Asiatic sense Our soil has no Roman coin or buried altar or Buddhist tope For this reason multitudes of American artists have moved to Europe and only the most universal of wars has driven them home Year after year Europe drained us of our beauty lovers our highest painters and sculptors and the like They have come pouring home confused expatriates trying to adjust themselves It is time for the American craftsman and artist to grasp the fact that we must be men enough to construct a to morrow that grows rich in forecastings in the same way that the past of Europe grows rich in sweet or terrible legends as men go back into it Scenario writers producers photoplay actors endowers of exquisite films sects using special motion pictures for a predetermined end all you who are taking the work as a sacred trust I bid you God speed Let us resolve that whatever America s to morrow may be she shall have a day that is beautiful and not crass spiritual not material Let us resolve that she shall dream dreams deeper than the sea and higher than the clouds of heaven that she shall come forth crowned and transfigured with her statesmen and wizards and saints and sages about her with magic behind her and miracle before her Pray that you be delivered from the temptation to cynicism and the timidities of orthodoxy Pray that the workers in this your glorious new art be delivered from the mere lust of the flesh and pride of life Let your spirits outflame your burning bodies Consider what it will do to your souls if you are true to your trust Every year despite earthly sorrow and the punishment of your mortal sins despite all weakness and all of Time s revenges upon you despite Nature s reproofs and the whips of the angels new visions will come new prophecies will come You will be seasoned spirits in the eyes of the wise The record of your ripeness will be found in your craftsmanship You will be God s thoroughbreds It has come then this new weapon of men and the face of the whole earth changes In after centuries its beginning will be indeed remembered It has come this new weapon of men and by faith and a study of the signs we proclaim that it will go on and on in immemorial wonder VACHEL LINDSAY SPRINGFIELD ILLINOIS Nov one nineteen fifteen END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ART OF THE
