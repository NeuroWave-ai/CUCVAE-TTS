9022_282357_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Early in eighteen forty nine the sleepy quiet of Victoria Vancouver Island was disturbed by the arrival of straggling groups of ragged nondescript wanderers who were neither trappers nor settlers 
9022_282357_000015_000001	train-clean-360	They carried blanket packs on their backs and leather bags belted securely round the waist close to their pistols 
9022_282357_000015_000002	train-clean-360	They did not wear moccasins after the fashion of trappers but heavy knee high hobnailed boots 
9022_282357_000015_000003	train-clean-360	In place of guns over their shoulders they had picks and hammers and such stout sticks as mountaineers use in climbing 
9022_282357_000015_000004	train-clean-360	They did not forgather with the Indians 
9022_282357_000015_000005	train-clean-360	They shunned the Indians and had little to say to any one 
9022_282357_000015_000006	train-clean-360	They volunteered little information as to whence they had come or whither they were going 
9022_282357_000015_000007	train-clean-360	They sought out Roderick Finlayson chief trader for the Hudson s Bay Company 
none	none	They wanted provisions from the company yes rice flour ham salt pepper sugar and tobacco and at the smithy they demanded shovels picks iron ladles and wire screens It was only when they came to pay that Finlayson felt sure of what he had already guessed 
9022_282357_000015_000010	train-clean-360	They unstrapped those little leather bags round under their cartridge belts and produced in tiny gold nuggets the price of what they had bought 
9022_282357_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Finlayson did not know exactly what to do 
none	none	The fur trader hated the miner 
9022_282357_000016_000002	train-clean-360	The miner wherever he went sounded the knell of fur trading and the trapper did not like to have his game preserve overrun by fellows who scared off all animals from traps set fire going to clear away underbrush and owned responsibility to no authority 
9022_282357_000016_000003	train-clean-360	No doubt these men were argonauts drifted up from the gold diggings of California no doubt they were searching for new mines but who had ever heard of gold in Vancouver Island or in New Caledonia as the mainland was named 
9022_282357_000016_000004	train-clean-360	If there had been gold would not the company have found it 
none	none	Finlayson probably thought the easiest way to get rid of the unwelcome visitors was to let them go on into the dangers of the wilds and then spread the news of the disappointment bound to be theirs 
9022_282357_000017_000000	train-clean-360	He handled their nuggets doubtfully 
9022_282357_000017_000001	train-clean-360	Who knew for a certainty that it was gold anyhow 
none	none	They bade him lay it on the smith s anvil and strike it with a hammer 
9022_282357_000017_000003	train-clean-360	Finlayson smiling sceptically did as he was told 
9022_282357_000017_000004	train-clean-360	The nuggets flattened to a yellow leaf as fine and flexible as silk 
none	none	Finlayson took the nuggets at eleven dollars an ounce and sent the gold down to San Francisco very doubtful what the real value would prove 
9022_282357_000017_000006	train-clean-360	It proved sixteen dollars to the ounce 
none	none	For seven or eight years afterwards rumours kept floating in to the company s forts of finds of gold 
9022_282357_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Many of the company s servants drifted away to California in the wake of the Forty Niners and the company found it hard to keep its trappers from deserting all up and down the Pacific Coast 
9022_282357_000018_000002	train-clean-360	The quest for gold had become a sort of yellow fever madness 
9022_282357_000018_000003	train-clean-360	Men flung certainty to the winds and trekked recklessly to California to Oregon to the hinterland of the country round Colville and Okanagan 
9022_282357_000018_000004	train-clean-360	Yet nothing occurred to cause any excitement in Victoria 
none	none	There was a short lived flurry over the discovery in Queen Charlotte Islands of a nugget valued at six hundred dollars and a vein of gold bearing quartz 
9022_282357_000018_000006	train-clean-360	But the nugget was an isolated freak the quartz could not be worked at a profit and the movement suddenly died out 
none	none	There were however signs of what was to follow The chief trader at the little fur post of Yale reported that when he rinsed sand round in his camp frying pan fine flakes and scales of yellow could be seen at the bottom one But gold in such minute particles would not satisfy the men who were hunting nuggets It required treatment by quicksilver 
9022_282357_000018_000009	train-clean-360	Though Maclean the chief factor at Kamloops kept all the specks and flakes brought to his post as samples from eighteen fifty two to eighteen fifty six he had less than would fill a half pint bottle 
9022_282357_000018_000010	train-clean-360	If a half pint is counted as a half pound and the gold at the company s price of eleven dollars an ounce it will be seen why four years of such discoveries did not set Victoria on fire 
9022_282357_000019_000000	train-clean-360	It has been so with every discovery of gold in the history of the world 
none	none	The silent shaggy ragged first scouts of the gold stampede wander houseless for years from hill to hill from gully to gully up rivers up stream beds up dry watercourses seeking the source of those yellow specks seen far down the mountains near the sea Precipice rapids avalanche winter storm take their toll of dead Corpses are washed down in the spring floods or the thaw reveals a prospector s shack smashed by a snowslide under which lie two dead pardners Then by and by when everybody has forgotten about it a shaggy man comes out of the wilds with a leather bag the bag goes to the mint and the world goes mad 
9022_282357_000020_000000	train-clean-360	Victoria went to sleep again 
9022_282357_000020_000001	train-clean-360	When men drifted in to trade dust and nuggets for picks and flour the fur traders smiled and rightly surmised that the California diggings were playing out 
none	none	Though Vancouver Island was nominally a crown colony it was still with New Caledonia practically a fief of the Hudson s Bay Company James Douglas was governor 
9022_282357_000021_000001	train-clean-360	He was assisted in the administration by a council of three nominated by himself John Tod James Cooper and Roderick Finlayson 
none	none	In eighteen fifty six a colonial legislature was elected and met at Victoria in August for the first time two But in fact the company owned the colony and its will was supreme in the government John Work was the company s chief factor at Victoria and Finlayson was chief trader 
9022_282357_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Because California and Oregon had gone American some small British warships lay at Esquimalt harbour 
9022_282357_000022_000001	train-clean-360	The little fort had expanded beyond the stockade 
9022_282357_000022_000002	train-clean-360	The governor s house was to the east of the stockade 
9022_282357_000022_000003	train-clean-360	A new church had been built and the reverend 
9022_282357_000022_000004	train-clean-360	Edward Cridge afterwards known as Bishop Cridge was the rector 
none	none	Two schools had been built 
9022_282357_000022_000006	train-clean-360	Inside the fort were perhaps forty five employees 
9022_282357_000022_000007	train-clean-360	Inside and outside lived some eight hundred people 
9022_282357_000022_000008	train-clean-360	But grass grew in the roads 
none	none	There was no noise but the church bell or the fort bell or the flapping of a sail while a ship came to anchor 
9022_282357_000022_000010	train-clean-360	Three hundred acres about the fort were worked by the company as a farm which gave employment to about two dozen workmen and on which were perhaps a hundred cattle and a score of brood mares 
9022_282357_000022_000011	train-clean-360	The company also had a saw mill 
9022_282357_000022_000012	train-clean-360	Buildings of huge squared timbers flanked three sides of the inner stockades the dining hall the cook house the bunk house the store the trader s house 
9022_282357_000022_000013	train-clean-360	There were two bastions and from each cannon pointed 
none	none	Close to the wicket at the main entrance stood the postoffice Only a fringe of settlement went beyond the company s farm 
9022_282357_000022_000016	train-clean-360	The fort was sound asleep secure in an eternal certainty that the domain which it guarded would never be overrun by American settlers as California and Oregon had been 
9022_282357_000022_000017	train-clean-360	The little Admiralty cruisers which lay at Esquimalt were guarantee that New Caledonia should never be stampeded into a republic by an inrush of aliens 
9022_282357_000022_000018	train-clean-360	Then as now it was Victoria s boast that it was more English than England 
none	none	So passed Christmas of fifty seven with plum pudding and a roasted ox and toasts to the crown and the company though we cannot be quite sure that the company was not put before the crown in the souls of the fur traders 
9022_282357_000024_000000	train-clean-360	Then in March eighteen fifty eight just when Victoria felt most secure as the capital of a perpetual fur realm something happened 
none	none	A few Yankee prospectors had gone down on the Hudson s Bay steamer Otter to San Francisco in February with gold dust and nuggets from New Caledonia to exchange for money at the mint 
9022_282357_000024_000002	train-clean-360	The Hudson s Bay men had thought nothing of this Other treasure seekers had come to New Caledonia before and had gone back to San Francisco disappointed 
none	none	But in March these men returned to Victoria 
9022_282357_000024_000004	train-clean-360	And with them came a mad rabble of gold crazy prospectors 
9022_282357_000024_000005	train-clean-360	A city of tents sprang up overnight round Victoria 
9022_282357_000024_000006	train-clean-360	The smithy was besieged for picks for shovels for iron ladles 
9022_282357_000024_000007	train-clean-360	Men stood in long lines for their turn at the trading store 
9022_282357_000024_000008	train-clean-360	By canoe by dugout by pack horse and on foot they planned to ascend the Fraser and they mobbed the company for passage to Langley by the first steamer out from Victoria 
9022_282357_000024_000009	train-clean-360	Goods were paid for in cash 
9022_282357_000024_000010	train-clean-360	Before Finlayson could believe his own eyes he had two million dollars in his safe some of it for purchases some of it on deposit for safe keeping Though the company gave no guarantee to the depositors and simply sealed each man s leather pouch as it was placed in the safe no complaint was ever made against it of dishonesty or unfair treatment 
9022_282357_000025_000000	train-clean-360	Without waiting instructions from England and with poignant memory of Oregon Governor Douglas at once clapped on a licence of twenty one shillings a month for mining privileges under the British crown 
9022_282357_000025_000001	train-clean-360	Thus he obtained a rough registration of the men going to the up country but thousands passed Victoria altogether and went in by pack train from Okanagan or rafted across from Puget Sound 
none	none	The month of March had not ended when the first band of gold hunters arrived and settled down a mile and a half below Yale 
9022_282357_000025_000003	train-clean-360	Another boat load of eight hundred and fifty came in April 
9022_282357_000025_000004	train-clean-360	In four months sixty seven vessels carrying from a hundred to a thousand men each had come up from San Francisco to Victoria 
9022_282357_000025_000005	train-clean-360	Crews deserted their ships clerks deserted the company trappers turned miners and took to the gold bars 
9022_282357_000025_000006	train-clean-360	Before Victoria awoke to what it was all about twenty thousand people were camped under tents outside the stockade and the air was full of the wildest rumours of fabulous gold finds 
none	none	The snowfall had been heavy in fifty eight 
9022_282357_000026_000001	train-clean-360	In the spring the Fraser rolled to the sea a swollen flood 
9022_282357_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Against the turbid current worked tipsy rafts towed by wheezy steamers or leaky old sailing craft and rickety row boats raced cockle shell canoes for the gold bars above 
9022_282357_000026_000003	train-clean-360	Ashore the banks of the river were lined with foot passengers toiling under heavy packs wagons to which clung human forms on every foot of space and long rows of pack horses bogged in the flood of the overflowing river 
none	none	By September ten thousand men were rocking and washing for gold round Yale As in the late Kootenay and in the still later Klondike stampede American cities at the coast benefited most 
9022_282357_000027_000001	train-clean-360	Victoria was a ten hour trip from the mainland 
9022_282357_000027_000002	train-clean-360	Whatcom and Townsend on the American side advertised the advantages of the Washington route to the Fraser river gold mines 
9022_282357_000027_000003	train-clean-360	A mushroom boom in town lots had sprung up at these points before Victoria was well awake 
9022_282357_000027_000004	train-clean-360	By the time speculators reached Victoria the best lots in that place had already been bought by the company s men and some of the substantial fortunes of Victoria date from this period 
9022_282357_000027_000005	train-clean-360	Though the river was so high that the richest bars could not be worked till late in August five hundred thousand dollars in gold was taken from the bed of the Fraser during the first six months of fifty eight 
9022_282357_000027_000006	train-clean-360	This amount divided among the ten thousand men who were on the bars around Yale would not average as much as they could have earned as junior clerks with the fur company or as peanut pedlars in San Francisco but not so does the mind of the miner work 
none	none	Here was gold to be scooped up for nothing by the first comer and more vessels ploughed their way up the Fraser though Governor Douglas sought to catch those who came by Puget Sound and evaded licence by charging six dollars toll each for all canoes on the Fraser and twelve dollars for each vessel with decks 
9022_282357_000027_000008	train-clean-360	Later these tolls were disallowed by the home authorities 
9022_282357_000027_000009	train-clean-360	The prompt action of Douglas however had the effect of keeping the mining movement in hand 
9022_282357_000027_000010	train-clean-360	Though the miners were of the same class as the argonauts of California they never broke into the lawlessness that compelled vigilance committees in San Francisco 
none	none	Illustration Sir James Douglas From a portrait by Savannah 
9022_282357_000029_000000	train-clean-360	Judge Howay gives the letter of a treasure seeker who reached the Fraser in April the substance of which is as follows 
none	none	We re now located thirty miles above the junction of the Fraser and the Thompson on Fraser River 
9022_282357_000030_000001	train-clean-360	About a fourth of the canoes that attempt to come up are lost in the rapids which extend from Fort Yale nearly to the Forks 
9022_282357_000030_000002	train-clean-360	A few days ago six men were drowned by their canoe upsetting 
9022_282357_000030_000003	train-clean-360	There is more danger going down than coming up 
9022_282357_000030_000004	train-clean-360	There can be no doubt about this country being immensely rich in gold 
9022_282357_000030_000005	train-clean-360	Almost every bar on the river from Yale up will pay from three dollars to seven dollars a day to the man at the present stage of water 
9022_282357_000030_000006	train-clean-360	When the river gets low which will be about August the bars will pay very well 
none	none	One hundred and ninety six dollars was taken out by one man last winter in a few hours but the water was then at its lowest stage The gold on the bars is all very fine and hard to save in a rocker but with quicksilver properly managed good wages can be made almost anywhere on the river as long as the bars are actually covered with water We have not yet been able to find a place where we can work anything but rockers If we could get a sluice to work we could make from twelve dollars to sixteen dollars a day each 
9022_282357_000030_000011	train-clean-360	We only commenced work yesterday and we are satisfied that when we get fully under way we can make from five dollars to seven dollars a day each 
9022_282357_000030_000012	train-clean-360	The prospect is better as we go up the river on the bars 
9022_282357_000030_000013	train-clean-360	The gold is not any coarser but there is more of it 
9022_282357_000030_000014	train-clean-360	There are also in that region diggings of coarser gold on small streams that empty into the main river 
9022_282357_000030_000015	train-clean-360	A few men have been there and proved the existence of rich diggings by bringing specimens back with them 
9022_282357_000030_000016	train-clean-360	The Indians all along the river have gold in their possession that they say they dug themselves but they will not tell where they get it nor allow small parties to go up after it 
none	none	I have seen pieces in their possession weighing two pounds 
9022_282357_000030_000018	train-clean-360	The Indians above are disposed to be troublesome and went into a camp twenty miles above us and forcibly took provisions and arms from a party of four men and cut two severely with their knives 
9022_282357_000030_000019	train-clean-360	They came to our camp the same day and insisted that we should trade with them or leave the country 
9022_282357_000030_000020	train-clean-360	We design to remain here until we can get a hundred men together when we will move up above the falls and do just what we please without regard to the Indians 
9022_282357_000030_000021	train-clean-360	We are at present the highest up of any white men on the river and we must go higher to be satisfied 
none	none	I don t apprehend any danger from the Indians at present but there will be hell to pay after a while 
9022_282357_000030_000023	train-clean-360	There is a pack trail from Hope but it cannot be travelled till the snow is off the mountains 
9022_282357_000031_000000	train-clean-360	The prices of provisions are as follows flour thirty five dollars per hundred weight pork a dollar a pound beans fifty cents a pound and other things in proportion 
9022_282357_000031_000001	train-clean-360	Every party that starts from the Sound should have their own supplies to last them three or four months and they should bring the largest size chinook canoes as small ones are very liable to swamp in the rapids 
9022_282357_000031_000002	train-clean-360	Each canoe should be provided with thirty fathoms of strong line for towing over swift water and every man well armed 
9022_282357_000031_000003	train-clean-360	The Indians here can beat anything alive stealing They will soon be able to steal a man s food after he has eaten it 
none	none	Illustration Indians near New Westminster B C From a photograph by Maynard 
9022_282357_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Within two miles of Yale eighty Indians and thirty white men were working the gold bars and log boarding houses and saloons sprang up along the river bank as if by magic 
9022_282357_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Naturally the last comers of fifty eight were too late to get a place on the gold bars and they went back to the coast in disgust calling the gold stampede the Fraser River humbug Nevertheless men were washing sluicing rocking and digging gold as far as Lillooet 
none	none	Often the day s yield ran as high as eight hundred dollars a man and the higher up the treasure seekers pushed their way the coarser grew the gold flakes and grains Would the golden lure lead finally to the mother lode of all the yellow washings 
9022_282357_000033_000003	train-clean-360	That is the hope that draws the prospector from river to stream from stream to dry gully bed from dry gully to precipice edge and often over the edge to death or fortune 
9022_282357_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Exactly fifty six years from the first rush of fifty eight in the month of April I sat on the banks of the Fraser at Yale and punted across the rapids in a flat bottomed boat and swirled in and out among the eddies of the famous bars 
none	none	A Siwash family lived there by fishing with clumsy wicker baskets 
9022_282357_000034_000002	train-clean-360	Higher up could be seen some Chinamen but whether they were fishing or washing we could not tell 
9022_282357_000034_000003	train-clean-360	Two transcontinental railroads skirted the canyon one on each side and the tents of a thousand construction workers stood where once were the camps of the gold seekers banded together for protection 
9022_282357_000034_000004	train-clean-360	When we came back across the river an old old man met us and sat talking to us on the bank 
9022_282357_000034_000005	train-clean-360	He had come to the Fraser in that first rush of fifty eight 
9022_282357_000034_000006	train-clean-360	He had been one of the leaders against the murderous bands of Indians 
none	none	Then he had pushed on up the river to Cariboo travelling as he told us by the Indian trails over Jacob s ladders wicker and pole swings to serve as bridges across chasms wherever the float or sign of mineral might lead him Both on the Fraser and in Cariboo he had found his share of luck and ill luck and he plainly regretted the passing of that golden age of danger and adventure
9022_282357_000034_000009	train-clean-360	 But he said pointing his trembling old hands at the two railways if we prospectors hadn t blazed the trail of the canyon you wouldn t have your railroads here to day

9022_282357_000034_000011	train-clean-360	We followed the float up and they followed us 
9022_282357_000035_000000	train-clean-360	What the trapper was to the fur trade the prospector was to the mining era that ushered civilization into the wilds with a blare of dance halls and wine and wassail and greed 
none	none	Ragged poor roofless grubstaked by pardner or outfitter on a basis of half profit the prospector stands as the eternal type of the trail maker for finance one The same of course may be done to day with a like result at many places along the Fraser and even on the Saskatchewan two This was the first Legislative Assembly to meet west of Upper Canada in what is now the Canadian Dominion It consisted of seven members as follows J D Pemberton James Yates E E Langford J S Helmcken Thomas J Skinner John Muir and J F Kennedy Langford however retired almost immediately after the election and J W M Kay was elected in his stead The portraits of five of the members are preserved in the group which appears as the frontispiece to this volume The photograph was probably taken at a later period at any rate two of the members Muir and Kennedy are missing CHAPTER II THE PROSPECTOR By September when mountain rivers are at their lowest every bar on the Fraser from Yale to the forks of the Thompson was occupied 
9000-282380-0001	train-other-500	The Hudson s Bay steamer Otter made regular trips up the Fraser to Fort Langley and from the fort an American steamer called the Enterprise owned by Captain Tom Wright breasted the waters as far as the swift current at Yale
9000-282380-0002	train-other-500	At Yale was a city of tents and hungry men Walter Moberly tells how when he ascended the Fraser with Wright in the autumn of fifty eight
9000-282380-0003	train-other-500	the generous Yankee captain was mobbed by penniless and destitute men for return passage to the coast Many a broken treasure seeker owed his life to Tom Wright s free passage Fortunately there was always good fishing on the Fraser
9000-282380-0004	train-other-500	but salt was a dollar twenty five a pound butter a dollar twenty five a pound and flour rarer than nuggets
none	none	 So hard up were some of the miners for pans to wash their gold 
9000-282380-0005	train-other-500	that one desperate fellow went to a log shack called a grocery store and after paying a dollar for the privilege of using a grindstone bought an empty butter vat at the pound price of butter twelve dollars for an empty butter tub
9000-282380-0006	train-other-500	Half a dollar was the smallest coin used and clothing was so scarce that when a Chinaman s pig chewed up Walter Moberly s boots while the surveyor lay asleep in his shack mister Moberly had to foot it twenty five miles before he could find another pair of boots
9000-282380-0007	train-other-500	Saloons occupied every second shack at Yale and Hope revolvers were in all belts and each man was his own sheriff yet there was little lawlessness With claims filed on all gold bearing bars
9000-282380-0008	train-other-500	what were the ten thousand men to do camped for fifty miles beyond Yale Those who had no provisions and could not induce any storekeeper to grubstake them for a winter s prospecting quit the country in disgust
9000-282380-0009	train-other-500	and the price of land dropped in the boom towns of the Fraser as swiftly as it had been ballooned up Prospecting during the winter in a country of heavy snowfall did not seem a sane project And yet the eternal question urged the miners on
none	none	 from what mother lode are these flakes and nuggets washed down to the sand bars of the Fraser 
9000-282380-0010	train-other-500	Gold had also been found in cracks in the rock along the river Whence had it come The man farthest upstream in spring would be on the ground first for the great find that was bound to make some seeker s fortune So all stayed who could
none	none	 Fortunately the winter of fifty eight fifty nine was mild 
9000-282380-0011	train-other-500	the autumn late the snowfall light and the spring very early Fate as usual favoured the dauntless In parties of twos and tens and twenties and even as many as five hundred
9000-282380-0012	train-other-500	the miners began moving up the river prospecting Those with horses had literally to cut the way with their axes over windfall over steep banks and round precipitous cliffs Where rivers had to be crossed
9000-282380-0013	train-other-500	the men built rude rafts and poled themselves over with their pack horses swimming behind Those who had oxen killed the oxen and sold the beef Others breasted the mill race of the Fraser in canoes and dugouts
9000-282380-0014	train-other-500	Governor Douglas estimated that before April of fifty nine as many as three hundred boats with five men in each had ascended the Fraser Sometimes the amazing spectacle was seen of canoes lashed together in the fashion of pontoon bridges
none	none	 with wagons full of provisions braced across the canoes 
9000-282380-0015	train-other-500	These travellers naturally did not attempt Fraser Canyon Before Christmas of fifty nine prospectors had spread into Lillooet and up the river as high as Chilcotin Soda Creek Alexandria Cottonwood Canyon
9000-282380-0016	train-other-500	Quesnel and Fort George It was safer to ascend such wild streams than to run with the current though countless canoes and their occupants were never heard of after leaving Yale Where the turbid yellow flood began to rise and collect 
9000-282380-0017	train-other-500	a boatman s phrase the men would scramble ashore and by means of a long tump line tied not to the prow which would send her sidling to the middle of the first thwart would tow their craft slowly up stream
9000-282380-0018	train-other-500	I have passed up and down Fraser Canyon too often to count the times and have canoed one wild rapid twice but never without wondering how those first gold seekers managed the ascent in that winter of fifty nine There was no Cariboo Road then
9000-282380-0019	train-other-500	There was only the narrow footpath of the trapper and the fisherman close down to the water and when the rocks broke off in sheer precipice an unsteady bridge of poles and willows spanned the abyss
none	none	 A Jacob s ladder a hundred feet above a roaring whirlpool without handhold on either side 
9000-282380-0020	train-other-500	was one thing for the Indian moccasin and quite another thing for the miner s hobnailed boot The men used to strip at these places and attempt the rock walls barefoot or else they cached their canoe in a tree or hid it under moss lashed what provisions they could to a dog s back
none	none	 and with a pack strapped to their own back proceeded along the bank on foot 
9000-282380-0021	train-other-500	The trapper carries his pack with a strap round his forehead The miner ropes his round under his shoulders He wants hands and neck free for climbing Usually the prospectors would appoint a rendezvous
9000-282380-0022	train-other-500	There provisions would be slung in the trees above the reach of marauding beasts and the party would disperse at daybreak each to search in a different direction blazing trees as he went ahead so that he could find the way back at night to the camp
9000-282380-0023	train-other-500	Distress or a find was to be signalled by a gunshot or by heliograph of sunlight on a pocket mirror but many a man strayed beyond rescue of signal and never returned to his waiting pardners
9000-282380-0024	train-other-500	Some were caught in snowslides only to be dug out years later Many signs guided the experienced prospector Streams clear as crystal came he knew from upper snows
none	none	 Those swollen at midday came from near by snowfields 
9000-282380-0025	train-other-500	Streams milky or blue or peacock green came from glaciers ice grinding over rock Heavy mists often added to the dangers
9000-282380-0026	train-other-500	I stood at the level of eight thousand feet in this region once with one of the oldest prospectors of the canyon He had been a great hunter in his day A cloud came through a defile of the peaks heavy as a blanket
9000-282380-0027	train-other-500	Though we were on a well cut bridle trail he bade us pause as one side of the trail had a sheer drop of four thousand feet in places Before there were any trails
9000-282380-0028	train-other-500	how did you make your way here to hunt the mountain goat when this kind of fog caught you I asked Threw chips of stone ahead and listened he answered and let me tell you that only the greenest kind of tenderfoot ever takes risks on a precipice
none	none	 And nine men out of ten were such green tenderfoots that winter of fifty eight fifty nine 
9000-282380-0029	train-other-500	when five thousand prospectors overran the wild canyons and precipices of the Fraser Two or three things the prospector always carried with him matches a knife a gun rice flour bacon
9000-282380-0030	train-other-500	and a little mallet shaped hammer to test the float What was the float A sandy chunk of gravel
none	none	 perhaps flaked with yellow specks the size of a pin head 
9000-282380-0031	train-other-500	He wanted to know where that chunk rolled down from He knocked it open with his mallet If it had a shiny yellow pebble inside only the size of a pea the miner would stay on that bank and begin bench diggings into the dry bank
9000-282380-0032	train-other-500	By the spring of fifty nine dry bench diggings had extended back fifty miles from the river If the chunk revealed only tiny yellow specks perhaps mixed with white quartz the miner would try to find where it rolled from
9000-282380-0033	train-other-500	and would ascend the gully or mountain torrent or precipice Queer stories are told of how during that winter almost bankrupt grocers grubstaked prospectors with bacon and flour
9000-282380-0034	train-other-500	and received a half interest in a mine that yielded five or six hundred dollars a day in nuggets But for one who found a mine a thousand found nothing The sensations of the lucky one beggared description Was it luck or was it perseverance
9000-282380-0035	train-other-500	I asked the man who found one of the richest silver mines in the Big Bend of the Columbia Both and mostly dogged he answered Take our party as a type of prospectors from fifty nine to eighty nine
none	none	 the thirty years when the most of the mining country was exploited We had come up eleven green kids and one old man 
9000-282380-0036	train-other-500	from Washington We had roughed it in East and West Kootenay and were working south to leave the country dead broke We had found float in plenty and had followed it up ridges and over divides across three ranges of mountains
9000-282380-0037	train-other-500	Our horses were plumb played out We had camped on a ridge to let them fatten up enough to beat it out of British Columbia for ever Well we found some galena floats in a dry gully on the other side of the valley
none	none	 We had provisions left for only eleven days 
9000-282380-0038	train-other-500	Some of the boys said they would go out and shoot enough deer to last us for meat till we could get out of the country Old Sandy and I thought we would try our luck for just one day We followed that float clear across the valley We found more
9000-282380-0039	train-other-500	up the bed of a raging mountain torrent but the trouble was that the stream came over a rock sheer as the wall of a house I was afraid we d lose the direction if we left the stream bed but I could see high up the precipice where it widened out in a bench
9000-282380-0040	train-other-500	You couldn t reach it from below but you could from above so we blazed the trees below to keep our direction and started up round the hog s back to drop to the bank under
none	none	 By now it was nightfall and we hadn t had anything to eat since six that morning 
9000-282380-0041	train-other-500	Old Sandy wanted to go back but I wouldn t let him He was trembling like an aspen leaf It is so often just the one pace more that wins or loses the race We laboured up that slope and reached the bench just at dark
9000-282380-0042	train-other-500	We were so tired we had hauled ourselves up by trees brushwood branches anything I looked over the edge of the rock It dropped to that shelf we had seen from the gully below It was too dark to do anything more
none	none	 we knew the fellows back at the camp on the ridge would be alarmed but we were too far to signal 
9000-282380-0043	train-other-500	How far I asked About twenty two miles We threw ourselves down to sleep It was terribly cold We were high up and the fall frosts were icy I tell you I woke aching at daybreak
9000-282380-0044	train-other-500	Old Sandy was still sleeping I thought I would let myself down over the ledge and see what was below for there were no mineral signs where we were
none	none	 I crawled over the ledge and by sticking my fingers and toes in the rocks got down to about fifteen feet from the drop 
9000-282380-0045	train-other-500	to a soft grassy level I looked hung for a moment let go and lit on all fours Then I looked up The sun had just come over that east ridge and hit the rocks
none	none	 I can t talk about it yet 
9000-282380-0046	train-other-500	I went mad I laughed I cried I howled There wasn t an ache left in my bones I forgot that my knees knocked from weakness and that we had not had a bite for twenty four hours I yelled at Old Sandy to wake the dead
9000-282380-0047	train-other-500	He came crawling over the ledge and peeked down What s the matter says he Matter I yelled Wake up you old son of a gun we are millionaires There sticking right out of the rock
9000-282380-0048	train-other-500	was the ledge where float had been breaking and washing for hundreds of years so you see only eleven days from the time we were going to give up we made our find That mine paid from the first load of ore sent out by pack horses
9000-282380-0049	train-other-500	Other mines were found in a less spectacular way The float lost itself in a rounded knoll in the lap of a dozen peaks and the miners had to decide which of the benches to tunnel
9000-282380-0050	train-other-500	They might have to bring the stream from miles distant to sluice out the gravel and the largest nuggets might not be found till hundreds of feet had been washed out but always the float the pebbles the specks that shone in the sun lured them with promise
9000-282380-0051	train-other-500	Even for those who found no mine the search was not without reward
none	none	 There was the care free outdoor life 
9000-282380-0052	train-other-500	There was the lure of hope edging every sunrise There was the fresh washed ozone fragrant with the resinous exudations of the great trees of the forest There was the healing regeneration to body and soul
9000-282380-0053	train-other-500	Amid the dance halls and saloons the miner with money becomes a sot Out in the wilds he becomes a child of nature simple and clean and elemental as the trees around him or the stars above him
9000-282380-0054	train-other-500	I think of one prospector whose range was at the headwaters of the Athabaska In the dance halls he had married a cheap variety actress When the money of his first find had been dissipated she refused to live with him
9000-282380-0055	train-other-500	and tried to extort high alimony by claiming their two year old son The penniless prospector knew that he was no equal for law courts and sheriffs and lawyers so he made him a raft got a local trader to outfit him
9000-282380-0056	train-other-500	and plunged with his baby boy into the wilderness where no sheriff could track him I asked him why he did not use pack horses He said dogs could have tracked them but the water didn t leave no smell
9000-282380-0057	train-other-500	In the heart of the wilderness west of Mounts Brown and Hooker he built him a log cabin with a fireplace
none	none	 In that cabin he daily hobbled his little son so that the child could not fall in the fire 
9000-282380-0058	train-other-500	He set his traps round the mountains and hunted till the snow cleared By the time he could go prospecting in spring he had seven hundred dollars worth of furs to sell
none	none	 and he kept the child with him in the wilds till his wife danced herself across the boundary 
9000-282380-0059	train-other-500	Then he brought the boy down and sent him to school When the Canadian Pacific Railway crossed the Rockies that man became one of the famous guides He was the first guide I ever employed in the mountains
9000-282380-0060	train-other-500	Up stream then headed the prospectors on the Fraser in that autumn of fifty eight The miner s train of pack horses is a study in nature There is always the wise old bell mare leading the way
9000-282380-0061	train-other-500	There is always the lazy packer that has to be nipped by the horse behind him There are always the shanky colts who bolt to stampede where the trail widens but even shanky legged colts learn to keep in line in the wilds At every steep ascent the pack train halts
9000-282380-0062	train-other-500	girths are tightened and sly old horses blow out their sides to deceive the driver At first colts try to rub packs off on every passing tree but a few tumbles heels over head down a bank cure them of that trick
none	none	 Always the course in new territory is according to the slope of the ground 
9000-282380-0063	train-other-500	River bank is followed where possible but where windfall or precipice drives back from the bed of the river over the mountain spurs the pathfinder takes his bearings from countless signs Moss is on the north side of tree trunks
9000-282380-0064	train-other-500	A steep slope compels a zigzag corkscrew ascent but the slope of the ground guides the climber as to the way to go for slope means valley and in valleys are streams and in the stream is the float
9000-282380-0065	train-other-500	which is to the prospector the one shining signal to be followed Timber line is passed till the forests below look like dank banks of moss Cloud line is passed till the clouds lie underneath in grey lakes and pools
9000-282380-0066	train-other-500	A fool hen or mountain grouse comes out and bobbles her head at the passing packtrain A whistling marmot pops up from the rocks and pierces the stillness
none	none	 Redwings and waxbills pick crumbs from every camp meal and occasionally a bald headed eagle utters a lonely raucous cry from solitary perch of dead branch or high rock Illustration In the Rocky Mountains From a photograph Naturally enough the pack train unconsciously follows the game trail of deer and goat and cougar and bear across the slope to the watering places where springs gush out from the rocks One has only to look close enough to see the little cleft footprint of the deer round these springs To the miners penetrating the wilds north of the Fraser the caribou proved a godsend during that lean first winter The miners spelled it cariboo 
9000-282380-0067	train-other-500	and thus gave the great gold area its name The population of Yale that winter consisted of some eight hundred people housed in tents and log shacks roofed with canvas Between Yale and Hope remained two thousand miners during the winter
9000-282380-0068	train-other-500	Meals cost a dollar served on tin plates to diners standing in long rows waiting turn at the counter The regular menu at all meals was bacon salmon bread and coffee Of butter there was little
9000-282380-0069	train-other-500	of milk none Wherever a sand bar gave signs of mineral it was tested with the primitive frying pan If the pan showed a deposit the miner rigged up a rocker a contraption resembling a cradle with rockers below
9000-282380-0070	train-other-500	about four feet from end to end two feet across and two deep The sides converged to bottom At the head was a perforated sheet iron bottom like a housewife s colander Into this box the gravel was shovelled by one miner
9000-282380-0071	train-other-500	The man s pardner poured in water and rocked the cradle cradled the sand
none	none	 The water ran through the perforated bottom to a second floor of quicksilver or copperplate or woolly blanket which caught the gold On a larger scale 
9000-282380-0072	train-other-500	when streams were directed through wooden boxes the gold was sluiced on a still larger scale the process was hydraulic mining though the same in principle
none	none	 In fact in huge free milling works where hydraulic machinery crushes the gold bearing quartz and screens it to fineness before catching the gold on delicate sieves 
9000-282380-0073	train-other-500	the process is only a complex refinement of the bar washer cradling his gold Fires had not yet cleared the giant hemlock forests as they have to day along the Cariboo Trail
9000-282380-0074	train-other-500	and prospectors found their way through a chartless sea of windfall hemlocks criss crossed the height of a house with branches interlaced like wire Cataracts fell over lofty ledges in wind blown spray Spanish moss
9000-282380-0075	train-other-500	grey green and feathery hung from branch to branch of the huge Douglas firs Sometimes the trail would lead for miles round the edge of some precipices beyond which could be glimpsed the eternal snows
9000-282380-0076	train-other-500	Sometimes an avalanche slid over a slope with the distant appearance of a great white waterfall and the echo of muffled thunder
none	none	 Where the mountain was swept as by a mighty besom the pack train kept an anxious eye on the snow amid the valleys of the upper peaks 
9000-282380-0077	train-other-500	for in an instant the snowslide might come over the edge of the upper valley to sweep down the slope carrying away forests rocks trail pack train and all The story is told of one slide seen by the guide at the head of a long pack train
9000-282380-0078	train-other-500	He had judged it to be ten miles away but out from the upper valley it came coiling like a long white snake and before he could turn it had caught him In a slide death was almost certain
9000-282380-0079	train-other-500	from suffocation if not from the crush of falling trees and rocks Miners have been taken from their cabins dead in the trail of a snowslide that swept the shack to the bottom of the valley without so much as a hair of their heads being injured
9000-282380-0080	train-other-500	Though the logs were twisted and warped the dead bodies were not even bruised When a hushed whisper came through the trees travellers looked for some waterfall At midday when the thaw was at its full
9000-282380-0081	train-other-500	all the mountain torrents became vocal with the glee of disimprisoned life running a race of gladness to the sea The sun sets early in the mountains with a gradual hushing of the voice of glad waters and a red glow as of wine on the encircling peaks
9000-282380-0082	train-other-500	Camp for the night was always near water for the horses
none	none	 and every star was etched in replica in river or lake 
9000-282380-0083	train-other-500	Sunrise steals in silence among the mountain peaks There is none of that stir of song and vague rustling of animal life such as are heard at lower levels Nor does the light gradually rise above the eastern horizon
9000-282380-0084	train-other-500	The walled peaks cut off the skyline in mid heaven The stars pale Trees and crags are mirrored in the lake so clearly that one can barely tell which is real and which is reflection Then the water lines shorten
9000-282380-0085	train-other-500	and the rocks emerge from the belts and wisps of mist and all the sunset colours of the night before repeat themselves across the changing scene As you look the clouds lift The cook shouts breakfast And it is another day
none	none	 Such was the trail and the life of the prospector who beat his way by pack train and canoe up the canyons of the Fraser to learn whence came the wash of gold flake and nugget which he found in the sand bars below CHAPTER III 
9000-282381-0000	train-other-500	CARIBOO Indian unrest was probably first among the causes which led the miners to organize themselves into leagues for protection
none	none	 The Indians of the Fraser were no more friendly to newcomers now than they had been in the days of Alexander Mackenzie and Simon Fraser one They now professed great alarm for their fishing grounds 
9000-282381-0001	train-other-500	Men on the gold bars were jostled and hustled and pegs marking limits were pulled up A danger lay in the rows of saloons along the water front the well known danger of liquor to the Indian
9000-282381-0002	train-other-500	So the miners at Yale formed a vigilance committee and established self made laws The saloons should be abolished they decreed Sale of liquor to any person whomsoever was forbidden
9000-282381-0003	train-other-500	All liquor wherever found was ordered spilled
none	none	 Any one selling liquor to an Indian should be seized and whipped thirty nine lashes on the bare back A standing committee of twelve was appointed to enforce the law till the regular government should be organized It was July fifty eight when the miners on the river bars formed their committee And they formed it none too soon 
9000-282381-0005	train-other-500	for the Indians were on the war path in Washington and the unrest had spread to New Caledonia Young M Loughlin son of the famous John M Loughlin of Oregon coming up the Columbia overland from Okanagan to Kamloops with a hundred and sixty men
9000-282381-0006	train-other-500	four hundred pack horses and a drove of oxen had three men sniped off by Indians in ambush and many cattle stolen At Big Canyon on the Fraser two Frenchmen were found murdered
9000-282381-0007	train-other-500	When word came of this murder the vigilance committee of Yale formed a rifle company of forty which in August started up to the forks at Lytton At Spuzzum there was a fight Indians barred the way
9000-282381-0008	train-other-500	but they were routed and seven of them killed in a running fire and Indian villages along the river were burned Meanwhile a hundred and sixty volunteers at Yale formed a company to go up the river under Captain Snyder
none	none	 The company s trader at Yale was reluctant to supply arms for the company s policy had ever been to conciliate the Indians But when a rabble of two thousand angry miners gathered round the store 
9000-282381-0009	train-other-500	the rifles were handed over on condition that forty of the worst fire eaters in the band should remain behind Snyder then led his men up the river and joined the first company at Spuzzum At China Bar five miners were found hiding in a hole in the bank
9000-282381-0010	train-other-500	With a number of companions they had been driven down stream from the Thompson by Indians and had been sniped all the way for forty miles Man after man had fallen and the five survivors in the bank were all wounded
9000-282381-0011	train-other-500	When the Indians saw the company of armed men under Snyder they fled to the hills Flags of truce were displayed on both sides and a peace was patched up till Governor Douglas could come up from the coast
9000-282381-0012	train-other-500	Not however before there occurred an unfortunate incident At Long Bar when an Indian chief came with a flag of truce two of the white men snatched it from him and trampled it in the mud
9000-282381-0013	train-other-500	On the instant the Indians shot both the white men where they stood Douglas had been up as far as Yale in June but was now back in Victoria where couriers brought him word of the open fight in August
none	none	 He promptly organized a force of Royal Engineers and marines 
9000-282381-0014	train-other-500	and set out for the scene of the disorders Royal Engineers to the number of a hundred and fifty six and their families had come out from England for the boundary survey
none	none	 and their presence must have seemed providential to Douglas 
9000-282381-0015	train-other-500	now that the miners were forming vigilance committees of their own and the Indians were on the war path He went up the river in a small cruiser and reached Hope on the first of September Salutes were fired as he landed
9000-282381-0016	train-other-500	Douglas knew how to use all the pomp of regimentals and formality to impress the Indians He opened a solemn powwow with the chiefs of the Fraser As usual the white man s fire water was found to be the chief cause of the trouble
9000-282381-0017	train-other-500	Without waiting for legislative authority Douglas issued a royal proclamation against the sale of liquor and left a mining recorder to register claims

9000-282381-0028	train-other-500	some miles down the river had beaten up a negro The Yale magistrate had issued a warrant for the miner s arrest poor magistrate he had found little to do since his appointment in September The miner now sobered fled back to his bar
9000-282381-0029	train-other-500	The warrant was sent after him to the local peace officer for execution but this officer had already issued a warrant for the arrest of the negro at Yale so there it stood each fighter making complaint against the other

9000-282381-0030	train-other-500	The man who tried to arrest the negro was insolent and was jailed by the Yale magistrate Ned M Gowan the Californian down on the bar then came up to Yale with a posse of twenty men to arrest the magistrate for arresting the man

9000-282381-0036	train-other-500	There were fights and there was killing and sometimes the river cast up its dead The marvel is that there were not more crimes In every camp is a species of human vulture living off other men s risk

none	none	 up from Quesnel Lake five men washed out in primitive rockers a hundred ounces of nuggets in a week The gold fever which had subsided when all the bars of the Fraser were occupied mounted again Great rumours began to float out from the up country Bank facings seemed to indicate that the richest pay dirt lay at bed rock This kind of mining required sluicing and long ditches were constructed to bring the water to the dry diggings By the autumn of fifty nine a thousand miners were at work round Quesnel Lake By the spring of sixty Yale and Hope were almost deserted Men on the upper diggings were making from sixty to a hundred dollars a day Only Chinamen remained on the lower bars It was in the autumn of the year sixty that Doc Keithley John Rose Sandy MacDonald and George Weaver set out from Keithley Creek which flows into Cariboo Lake to explore the cup like valley amid the great peaks which seemed to feed this lake They toiled up the creek five miles then followed signs up a dry ravine seven miles farther Reaching the divide at last they came on an open park like ridge bounded north and east by lofty shining peaks Deer and caribou tracks were everywhere It was now that the region became known as Cariboo They camped on the ridge cooked supper and slept under the stars Should they go on or back This was far above the benches of wash gravel Going up one of the nameless peaks they stepped out on a ledge and viewed the white silent mountain world Marmots stabbed the lonely solitude with echoing whistle Wind came up from the valley in the sibilant sigh of a sea It was doubtful if even Indians had ever hunted this ground The game was so tame it did not know enough to be afraid The men could see another creek shining in the sunrise on the other side of the ridge It seemed to go down to a valley benched by gravel flanks They began wandering down that creek and testing the gravel Before they had gone far their eyes shone like the wet pebbles in their hands The gravel was pitted with little yellow stones Where rain and spring wash had swept off the gravel to naked rock little nuggets lay exposed The men began washing the gravel The first pan gave an ounce the second pan gave nuggets to the weight of a quarter of a pound The excited prospectors forgot time Dark was falling They slept under their blankets and awoke at daybreak below twelve inches of snow They were out of provisions Somebody had to go back down to Cariboo Lake for food Each man staked out a claim And while two built a log cabin the other two set off over the hills for food There was some sort of a log store down at Cariboo Lake The one thing these prospectors were determined on was secrecy till they could get their claims registered Bands of nondescript men hung round the provision store of Cariboo Lake awaiting a breath to fan their flaming hopes of fortune What let the secret out at the store is not known Perhaps too great an air of secrecy Perhaps too strenuous denials Perhaps the payment of provisions in nuggets But when these two packed back over the hills on snowshoes they were trailed Followers came in with a whoop behind them on Antler Creek Claims were staked faster than they could be recorded The same claims were staked over and over the corner of one overlapping another When the gold commissioner came hurriedly across the country in March he found the MacDonald Rose party living in a cabin and the rest of the camp holding down their claims by living in holes which they had dug in the ground This was the spring of sixty one and Antler Creek proved only the beginning of the rush to Cariboo Over the divide in mad stampede rushed the gold seekers northward and eastward Ed Stout and Billy Deitz and two others found signs that seemed very poor on a creek which they named William s after Deitz The gold did not pan a dollar a wash but in wild haste came the rush to William s Creek Crossing a creek one party of prospectors was overtaken by a terrific thunderstorm with rock shattering flashes of lightning Shivering in the canyon but afraid to stand under trees or near rocks with the gravel shelving down all round them one of the men exclaimed sardonically Well boys this is lightning The stream became known as Lightning Creek and proved one of the richest in Cariboo William s Creek was panning poorer and poorer and was being called Humbug Creek when miners staked near by decided to see what they could find beneath the blue clay It took forty eight hours to dig down The reward was a thousand dollars worth of wash gravel Back surged the miners to William s Creek They put shafts and tunnels through the clay and sluiced in more water for hydraulic work Claims on William s Creek produced as high as forty pounds of gold in a day From another creek only four hundred feet long fifty thousand dollars worth of gold was washed within a space of six weeks Lightning Creek yielded a hundred thousand dollars in three weeks In one year gold to the value of two and a half million dollars was shipped from Cariboo Millions were not so plentiful in those days and the reports which reached the outside world sounded like the Arabian Nights or some fairy tale The whole world took fire Cariboo was on every man s lips as were Transvaal and Klondike half a century later The New England States Canada the Maritime Provinces the British Isles all were set agog by the reports of the new gold camps where it was only necessary to dig to find nuggets By way of Panama by way of San Francisco by way of Spokane by way of Victoria by way of Winnipeg and Edmonton came the gold seekers indifferent alike to perils of sea and perils of mountain Men who had never seen a mountain thought airily that they could climb a watershed in a day s walk Men who did not know a canoe from a row boat essayed to run the maddest rapids in America People without provisions started blindly from Winnipeg across the width of half a continent In the mad rush were clerks who had never seen float English school teachers whose only knowledge of gold was that it was yellow and dance hall girls with very little possession of anything on earth but recklessness and slippers and the recklessness and the slippers danced them into Cariboo while many a solemn wight went to his death in rockslide or rapids By the opening of sixty two six thousand miners were in Cariboo and Barkerville had become the central camp How these people ever gained access to the centre of the wilderness before the famous Cariboo Road had been built is a mystery Some arrived by pack train some by canoe but the majority afoot Governor Douglas could not regulate prices here and they jumped to war level Flour was three hundred dollars a barrel Dried apples brought two dollars and fifty cents a pound and for lack of fruit many miners died from scurvy Where gold seekers tramped six hundred miles over a rocky trail it is not surprising that boots commanded fifty dollars a pair Of the disappointed countless numbers filled unknown graves and thousands tramped their way out starving and begging a meal from the procession of incomers The places of the gold deposits were freakish and unaccountable Sometimes the best diggings were a mother lode at the head of a creek Sometimes they were found fifty feet under clay at the foot of a creek where the dashing waters swerved round some rocky point into a river Old miners now retired at Yale and Hope say that the most ignorant prospector could guess the place of the gold as well as the geologist Billy Barker after whom Barkerville was named struck it rich by going fifty feet below the surface down the canyon Cariboo Cameron the luckiest of all the miners and not originally a prospector found his wealth by going still lower on the watercourse to a vertical depth of eighty feet For seven miles along William s Creek worked four thousand men Cariboo Cameron took a hundred and fifty thousand out of his claim in three months In six months of sixty three William s Creek yielded a million and a half dollars and this was only one of many rich creeks From fifty nine to seventy one came twenty five million dollars in gold from the Cariboo country By sixty five hydraulic machinery was coming in and the prospectors were flocking out but to this day the Cariboo mines have remained a freakish gamble Mines for which capitalists have paid hundreds of thousands have suddenly ended in barren rock Diggings from which nuggets worth five hundred dollars have been taken have petered out after a few hundred feet Even where the gravel merged to whitish gold quartz the most expert engineer in the camp could not tell when the vein would fault and cease as entirely as if cut off And the explanation of this is entirely theoretical The theory is that the place of the gold was the gravel bed of an old stream an old stream antedating the petrified forests of the South west and that when vast alluvial deposits were carried over a great part of the continent by inland lakes and seas the gold settled to the bottom and was buried beneath the deposits of countless centuries Then convulsive changes shook the earth s surface Mountains heaved up where had been sea bottom and swamp and watery plain In the upheaval these subterranean creek beds were hoisted and thrown towards the surface Floods from the eternal snows then grooved out watercourses down the scarred mountainsides Frost and rain split away loose debris And man found gold in these prehistoric perhaps preglacial creek beds However this may be there was no possible scientific way of knowing how the gold bearing area would run A fortune might come out of one claim of a hundred feet and its next door neighbour might not yield an atom of gold Only the genii of the hidden earth held the secret and modern science derides the invisible pixies of superstition just as these invisible spirits of the earth seem to laugh at man s best efforts to ferret out their secrets What became of the lucky prospectors I have talked with some of them on the lower reaches of the Cariboo Road They are old and poor to day and the memory of their fortune is as a dream Have they not lived at Hope and Yale and Lytton for fifty years and seen their trail crumble into the canyon with not a dozen pack trains a year passing to the Upper country John Rose who was one of the men to find Cariboo set out in the spring of sixty three to prospect the Bear River country He set out alone and was never again seen alive Cariboo Cameron a man from Glengarry went back to Glengarry by the Ottawa and established something like a baronial estate but he lost his money in various investments and died in eighteen eighty eight in Cariboo a poor man Billy Deitz after whom a famous creek was named died penniless in Victoria and the Scottish miner who rhymed the songs of Cariboo died unwept and unknown to history The romance of the trail is almost incredible to us who may travel by motor from Ashcroft to Barkerville In October sixty two a mister Ireland and a party were on the trail when snow began falling so heavily that it was unsafe to proceed They halted at a negro s cabin Out of the heavy snowfall came another party struggling like themselves Then a packer emerged from the storm with word that five women and twenty six men were snowbound half a mile ahead Ireland and his party set out to the rescue but they lost the trail and could only find the cabin again by means of the gunshots that the others kept firing as a signal Two dozen people slept that night in the log shack and when dawn came four feet of snow lay on the ground and the great evergreens looked like huge sugar cones On snowshoes Ireland and three others set out to find the lost men and women on the lower trail They found them at sundown camped in a ravine beside a rock with their blankets up to keep off the wind thawing themselves out before a fire A high wind was blowing and it was bitterly cold The lost people had not eaten for three days Twenty men from the cabin dug a way through the drifts with their snowshoes and brought horses to carry the women back to the coloured man s roof But it was not of the perils of the trail that the outside world heard The outside world heard of claims which any man might find and from which gold to the value of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars could be dug and washed in three months The outside world thought that gold could be picked up amid the rocks of British Columbia Necessity is the mother of invention She is also the hard foster mother of desperation and folly Times were very hard in Canada The East was hard up Farming did not pay All eyes turned towards Cariboo and no wonder Many of the treasure seekers holding the richest claims had gone to Cariboo owning nothing but the clothes on their backs A season s adventure in a no man s land of bear and deer above cloud line and amid wild mountain torrents had sent them out to the world laden with wealth Some ran the wild canyons of the Fraser in frail canoes and crazy rafts with their gold strapped to their backs or packed in buckskin sacks and carpet bags And some who had won fortune and were bringing it home went to their graves in Fraser Canyon one See Pioneers of the Pacific Coast in this Series

9022_282383_000004_000000	train-clean-360	When the Cariboo fever reached the East the public there had heard neither of the Indian massacres in Oregon nor that the Sioux were on the war path in Dakota 
9022_282383_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Promoters who had never set foot west of Buffalo launched wild cat mining companies and parcel express devices and stages by routes that went up sheer walls and crossed unbridged rivers 
9022_282383_000004_000002	train-clean-360	To such frauds there could be no certain check for it took six months to get word in and out of Cariboo 
9022_282383_000004_000003	train-clean-360	Eastern papers were full of advertisements of easy routes to the gold diggings 
none	none	Far off fields look green 
9022_282383_000004_000005	train-clean-360	Far off gold glittered the brighter for the distance Cariboo became in popular imagination a land where nuggets grew on the side of the road and could be picked by the bushel basket 
9022_282383_000004_000006	train-clean-360	Besides times were so hard in the East that the majority of the youthful adventurers who were caught by the fever had nothing to lose except their lives 
9022_282383_000006_000000	train-clean-360	A group of threescore young men from different parts of Canada from Kingston Niagara and Montreal having noticed advertisements of an easy stage route from saint Paul set out for the gold diggings in May eighteen sixty two 
9022_282383_000006_000001	train-clean-360	Tickets could be purchased in London England as well as in Canada for when these young Canadians reached saint Paul they found eighteen young men from England like themselves diligently searching the whereabouts of the stage route 
9022_282383_000006_000002	train-clean-360	That was their first inkling that fraudulent practices were being carried on and that they had been deceived that there was in fact no stage route from saint Paul to Cariboo 
9022_282383_000006_000003	train-clean-360	A few of them turned back but the majority by ox cart and rickety stagecoach pushed on to the Red River and went up to a point near the boundary of modern Manitoba where lay the first steamboat to navigate that river about to start on her maiden trip 
none	none	On this steamboat the little International afterwards famous for running into sand banks and mud bars the troops of Overlanders took passage and stowed themselves away wherever they could some in the cook s galley and some among the cordwood piled in the engine room The Sioux were on a rampage in Minnesota and Dakota but Alexander Dallas governor of Rupert s Land for the Hudson s Bay Company and Mgr Tache bishop of saint Boniface were aboard and their presence afforded protection 
9022_282383_000007_000001	train-clean-360	On the way to the vessel some of the Overlanders had narrowly escaped a massacre 
9022_282383_000007_000002	train-clean-360	The story is told that as they slowly made their way in ox carts up the river bank a band of horsemen swept over the horizon and the travellers found themselves surrounded by Sioux warriors 
9022_282383_000007_000003	train-clean-360	The old plainsman who acted as guide bethought him of a ruse he hoisted a flag of the Hudson s Bay Company and waved it in the face of the Sioux without speaking 
9022_282383_000007_000004	train-clean-360	The painted warriors drew together and conferred 
9022_282383_000007_000005	train-clean-360	The oxen stood complacently chewing the cud Indians never molested British fur traders 
9022_282383_000007_000006	train-clean-360	Presently the raiders went off over the horizon as swiftly as they had come and the gold seekers drove on little realizing the fate from which they had been delivered 
9022_282383_000008_000000	train-clean-360	There had been heavy rains that spring on the prairie and trees came jouncing down the muddy flood of the Red River 
none	none	The little International like a panicky bicycle rider steered straight for every tree and hit one with such impact that her smokestack came toppling down At another place she pushed her nose so deep in the soft mud of the riverbank that it required all the crew and most of the passengers to shove her off 
9022_282383_000008_000003	train-clean-360	But everybody was jubilant 
9022_282383_000008_000004	train-clean-360	This was the first navigation of the Red River by steam 
9022_282383_000008_000005	train-clean-360	The Queen s Birthday the twenty fourth of May was celebrated on board the vessel pottle deep to the tune of the bagpipes played by the governor s Scottish piper 
none	none	But the governor s wife was heard to lament to Bishop Tache that the International s menu consisted only of pork and beans alternated with beans and pork that the service was on tin plates and that the dining room chairs were backless benches 
9022_282383_000009_000000	train-clean-360	The arrival of the steamer at Fort Garry Winnipeg was celebrated with great rejoicing 
9022_282383_000009_000001	train-clean-360	Indians ran along the river bank firing off rifles in welcome and opposite the flats where the fort gate opened on what is now Main Street the company s men came out and fired a royal salute The people bound for Cariboo camped on the flats outside Fort Garry Here was a strange world indeed 
9022_282383_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Two wheeled ox carts made wholly of wood without iron or bolt wound up to the fort from saint Paul in processions a mile long with fat squaws and whole Indian families sitting squat inside the crib like structure of the cart 
none	none	Men and boys loped ahead and abreast on sinewy ponies riding bareback or on home made saddles 
9022_282383_000009_000004	train-clean-360	Only a few stores stood along what is now Main Street which ran northward towards the Selkirk Settlement 
9022_282383_000009_000005	train-clean-360	With the Indians who were camped everywhere in the woods along the Assiniboine the Overlanders began to barter for carts oxen ponies and dried deer meat or pemmican 
9022_282383_000009_000006	train-clean-360	An ox and cart cost from forty to fifty dollars 
9022_282383_000009_000007	train-clean-360	Ponies sold at twenty five dollars 
9022_282383_000009_000008	train-clean-360	Pemmican cost sixteen cents a pound and a pair of duffel Hudson s Bay blankets cost eight or ten dollars 
9022_282383_000009_000009	train-clean-360	Instead of blankets many of the travellers bought the cheaper buffalo robes 
9022_282383_000009_000010	train-clean-360	These sold as low as a dollar each 
9022_282383_000010_000000	train-clean-360	John Black the Presbyterian apostle of the Red River preached special sermons on Sunday for the miners 
9022_282383_000010_000001	train-clean-360	And on a beautiful June afternoon the Overlanders headed towards the setting sun in a procession of almost a hundred ox carts and the fort waved them farewell 
9022_282383_000010_000002	train-clean-360	One wonders whether as the last ox cart creaked into the distance the fur traders realized that the miner heralded the settler and that the settler would fence off the hunter s game preserve into farms and cities 
none	none	A rare glamour lay over the plains that June not the less rare because hope beckoned the travellers 
9022_282383_000010_000004	train-clean-360	The unfenced prairie billowed to the horizon a sea of green diversified by the sky blue waters of slough and lake and decked with the hues of gorgeous flowers the prairie rose fragrant tender elusive and fragile as the English primrose the blood red tiger lily the brown windflower with its corn tassel the heavy wax cups of the sedgy water lily growing where wild duck flackered unafraid 
9022_282383_000010_000005	train-clean-360	Game was superabundant 
9022_282383_000010_000006	train-clean-360	Prairie chickens nestled along the single file trail Deer bounded from the poplar thickets and shy coyotes barked all night in the offing 
9022_282383_000010_000007	train-clean-360	Night in June on the northern prairie is but the shadowy twilight between two long days 
9022_282383_000010_000008	train-clean-360	The sun sets between nine and ten and rises between three and four and the moonlight is clear enough on cloudless nights for campers to see the time on their watches 
none	none	Illustration A Red River cart From a photograph The trail followed was the old path of the fur trader from fort to fort the plains across to the Rockies From the Assiniboine the road ran northerly to Forts Ellice and Carlton and Pitt and Edmonton one Thomas M Micking of Niagara acted as captain and eight others as lieutenants 
9022_282383_000012_000002	train-clean-360	A scout preceded the marchers and at sundown camp was formed in a big triangle with the carts as a stockade the animals tethered or hobbled inside 
9022_282383_000012_000003	train-clean-360	Tents were pitched outside with six men doing sentry duty all night 
9022_282383_000012_000004	train-clean-360	At two in the morning a halloo roused camp 
9022_282383_000012_000005	train-clean-360	An hour was permitted for harnessing and breaking camp and then the carts creaked out in line 
9022_282383_000012_000006	train-clean-360	They halted at six for breakfast and marched again at seven 
none	none	Dinner was at two supper at six and tents were seldom pitched before nine at night

9022_282383_000012_000009	train-clean-360	The oxen and ponies foraged for themselves 
9022_282383_000012_000010	train-clean-360	By limiting camp to five hours in spite of the slow pace of the oxen forty to fifty miles a day could be made on a good trail in fair weather 
9022_282383_000012_000011	train-clean-360	While the scout led the way the captain and his lieutenants kept the long procession in line and the travellers for the most part dozed lazily in their carts dreaming of the fortunes awaiting them in Cariboo 
9022_282383_000012_000012	train-clean-360	Some nights when the captain permitted a longer halt than usual and when camp fires blazed before the tents men played the violin and sang and danced

9022_282383_000013_000002	train-clean-360	Heavy rains came on now and James M Kay chief trader at Fort Ellice opened his doors to the gold seekers Harness and carts repaired and more pemmican bought the travellers crossed the Qu Appelle river in a Hudson s Bay scow paying toll of fifty cents a cart 
9022_282383_000013_000003	train-clean-360	From the Qu Appelle westward the journey grew more arduous 
none	none	The weather became oppressively hot and mosquitoes swarmed from the sloughs At Carlton and at Fort Pitt the fur traders string band husky dogs in wolfish packs surrounded the camp of the Overlanders and stole pemmican from under the tent flaps 
9022_282383_000013_000006	train-clean-360	From Fort Pitt westward the trail crossed a rough wooded country and there were no more scows to take the ox carts across the rivers 
none	none	Eleven days of continuous rain had flooded the sloughs into swamps and in three days as many as eight corduroy bridges had to be built Two long trees were felled parallel and light poles were laid across the floating trees 
9022_282383_000013_000009	train-clean-360	Where the trees swerved to the current some one would swim out and anchor them with ropes till the hundred carts had passed safely to the other side 
9022_282383_000014_000000	train-clean-360	It was the twenty first of July when the travellers came out on the high banks of the North Saskatchewan flowing broad and swift opposite Fort Edmonton 
9022_282383_000014_000001	train-clean-360	There had been floods and all the company s rafts had been carried away 
none	none	But the ox carts were poled across by means of a big York boat and the travellers were welcomed inside the fort 
9022_282383_000015_000000	train-clean-360	The arrival of the Overlanders is remembered at Edmonton by some old timers even to this day 
9022_282383_000015_000001	train-clean-360	Salvoes of welcome were fired from the fort cannon by a half breed shooting his musket into the touch hole of the big gun 
9022_282383_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Concerts were given with bagpipes concertinas flutes drums and fiddles in honour of the far travellers 
9022_282383_000015_000003	train-clean-360	Pemmican bags were replenished from the company s stores 
9022_282383_000016_000000	train-clean-360	Miners often uttered loud complaints against the charges made by the fur traders for provisions forgetting what it cost to pack these provisions in by dog train and canoe 
none	none	If the Hudson s Bay officials at Fort Garry and Edmonton had withheld their help the Overlanders would have perished before they reached the Rockies 
9022_282383_000016_000002	train-clean-360	Though the miner did everything to destroy the fur trade started fires which ravaged the hunter s forest haunts put up saloons which demoralized the Indians built wagon roads where aforetime wandered only the shy creatures of the wilds though the miner heralded the doom of the fur trade yet with an unvarying courtesy from Fort Garry to the Rockies the Hudson s Bay men helped the Overlanders 
none	none	The majority of the travellers now changed oxen and carts for pack horses and travois contrivances consisting of two poles within which the horses were attached and a rude sledge 
9022_282383_000017_000001	train-clean-360	A few continued with oxen and these oxen were to save their lives in the mountains 
none	none	Illustration Washing gold on the Saskatchewan From a photograph The farther the Overlanders now plunged into the wilderness the more they were pestered by the husky dogs that roamed in howling hordes round the outskirts of the forts The story is told of several prospectors of this time who slept soundly in their tent after a day s exhausting tramp and awoke to find that their boots bacon rope and clothes had been devoured by the ravenous dogs They asked the trader s permission to sleep inside the fort
9022_282383_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 Why asked the amused trader 
9022_282383_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 Why now when the huskies have chewed all you own but your instruments 
9022_282383_000020_000002	train-clean-360	You are locking the stable door after your horse has been stolen 
9022_282383_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 No answered the prospectors 
9022_282383_000021_000001	train-clean-360	 If those husky dogs last night could devour all our camp kit without disturbing us to night they might swallow us before we d waken 
none	none	The next pause was at saint Albert one of Father Lacombe s missions What surprised the Overlanders as they advanced was the amazing fertility of the soil At Fort Garry at Pitt at Edmonton at saint Albert at saint Ann they saw great fields of wheat barley and potatoes 
9022_282383_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Afterwards many who failed in the mines drifted back to the plains and became farmers 
9022_282383_000022_000003	train-clean-360	The same thing had happened in California and was repeated at a later day in the rush to the Klondike 
9022_282383_000022_000004	train-clean-360	Great seams of coal too were seen projecting from the banks of the Saskatchewan

9022_282383_000022_000006	train-clean-360	Later when these belated Overlanders decided to follow on to Cariboo they suffered terrible hardships 
9022_282383_000023_000000	train-clean-360	The Overlanders were to enter the Rockies by the Yellowhead Pass which had been discovered long ago by Jasper Hawse of the Hudson s Bay Company 
9022_282383_000023_000001	train-clean-360	This section of their trail is visible to the modern traveller from the windows of a Grand Trunk Pacific Railway train just as the lower sections of the Cariboo Trail in the Fraser Canyon are to be seen from the trains of the Canadian Pacific and the Canadian Northern 
9022_282383_000023_000002	train-clean-360	First came the fur trader seeking adventure through these passes pursuing the little beaver 
9022_282383_000023_000003	train-clean-360	The miner came next fevered to delirium lured by the siren of an elusive yellow goddess

9022_282383_000023_000005	train-clean-360	And then came the railroad following the trail which had been beaten hard by the stumbling feet of pioneers 
none	none	Illustration In the Yellowhead Pass From a photograph At saint Ann a guide was engaged to lead the long train of pack horses through the pass from Jasper House on the east to Yellowhead Lake on the west Colin Fraser son of the famous piper for Sir George Simpson of the Hudson s Bay Company danced a Highland fling at the gate of the fort to speed the departing guests 
9022_282383_000025_000002	train-clean-360	And to the skirl of the bagpipes the procession wound away westward bound for the mountains 
9022_282383_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Instead of the thirty miles a day which they had made farther east the travellers were now glad to cover ten miles a day 
none	none	Fallen trees lay across the trail in impassable ramparts and floods filled the gullies Scouts went ahead blazing trees to show the way Bushwhackers followed cutting away windfall and throwing logs into sloughs Horses sank to their withers in seemingly bottomless muskegs two so that packs had to be cut off and the unlucky bronchos pulled out by all hands straining on a rope Somewhere between the rivers Pembina and M Leod the travellers were amazed to see what the wise ones in the party thought a volcano a continuous and self fed fire burning on the crown of a hill Science of a later day pronounced this a gas well burning above some subterranean coal seam At length the Overlanders were ascending the banks of the M Leod whose torrential current warned them of rising ground 
9022_282383_000028_000001	train-clean-360	Three times in one day windfall and swamp forced the party to ford the stream for passage on the opposite side 
9022_282383_000028_000002	train-clean-360	The oxen swam and the ox carts floated and the packs came up the bank dripping 
9022_282383_000028_000003	train-clean-360	For eleven days in August every soul of the company including missus Shubert s babies travelled wet to the skin 
9022_282383_000028_000004	train-clean-360	At night great log fires were kindled and the Overlanders sat round trying to dry themselves out 
9022_282383_000028_000005	train-clean-360	Then the trail lifted to the foothills 
9022_282383_000028_000006	train-clean-360	And on the evening of the fifteenth of August there pierced through the clouds the snowy shining serrated peaks of the Rockies

9022_282383_000030_000002	train-clean-360	What cared these argonauts who had tramped across the width of the continent that the lofty mountains raised a sheer wall between them and their treasure 
9022_282383_000030_000003	train-clean-360	Cheer on cheer rang from the encampment 
none	none	Men with clothes in tatters pitched caps in air proud that they had proved themselves kings of their own fate It is perhaps well that we have to climb our mountains step by step else would many turn back 
9022_282383_000030_000006	train-clean-360	But there were no faint hearts in the camp that night 
9022_282383_000030_000007	train-clean-360	Even the Irishwoman s two little children came out and gazed at what they could not understand 
9022_282383_000031_000000	train-clean-360	The party now crossed a ravine to the main stream of the Athabaska 
9022_282383_000031_000001	train-clean-360	It was necessary to camp here for a week 
none	none	A huge raft was built of pine saplings bound together by withes 
9022_282383_000031_000003	train-clean-360	To the stern of this was attached a tree the branch end dipping in the water as a sweep and rudder to keep the craft to its course 
9022_282383_000031_000004	train-clean-360	On this the Overlanders were ferried across the Athabaska 
9022_282383_000031_000005	train-clean-360	And so they entered the Yellowhead Pass 
none	none	one See the map in The Adventurers of England on Hudson Bay in this Series two Perhaps the distinction should be made here between the muskeg and the slough The slough was simply any depression in the ground filled with mud and water The muskeg was permanent wet ground resting on soft mud covered over on the top with most deceiving soft green moss which looked solid but which quaked to every step and gave to the slightest weight Many muskegs west of Edmonton have been formed by beavers damming the natural drainage of a small river for so many centuries that the silt and humus washed down from the mountains have formed a surface of deep black muck CHAPTER V CROSSING THE MOUNTAINS Like many lowland dwellers the Overlanders had thought of a pass as a door opening through a rock wall What they found was a forested slope flanked on both sides by mighty precipices down which poured cataracts with the sound of the voice of many waters Huge hemlocks lay criss crossed on the slope Above could be seen the green edge of a glacier and still higher the eternal snows of the far peaks The tang of ice was in the air but in the valleys was all the gorgeous bloom of midsummer the gaudy painter s brush the shy harebell the tasselled windflower and a few belated mountain roses Long stemmed slender cornflowers and bluebells held up their faces to the sun blue as the sky above them Everywhere was an odour as of incense the fragrance of the great hemlocks of grasses frost touched at night and sunburnt by day of the unpolluted earth mould of a thousand years Where was the trail None was visible The captain led the way following blazes chipped in the bark of the trees zigzagging up the slope from right to left from left to right hanging to the horse s mane to lift weight from the saddle with a rest for breathing at each turn as they climbed and when the ridge of the foothill was surmounted a world of peacock blue lakes lay below fringed by forests The cataracts looked like wind blown ribbons of silver Instead of dipping down the trail led to the rolling flank of another great foothill and yet another round sharp saddlebacks connecting the mountains Here ox carts were dangerous and had to be abandoned It was with difficulty that the oxen could be driven along the narrow ledges Jasper House Whitefish Lake the ruins of Henry House they saw from the height of the pass One foaming stream they forded eight times in three hours driven from side to side by precipice and windfall and in places they could advance only by ascending the stream bed This was risky work on a fractious pony and some of the riders preferred wading to riding At noon on the twenty second of August the riders crossed a small stream and set up their tents on the border of a sedgy lake Then somebody noticed that the lake emptied west not east and a wild halloo split the welkin They had crossed the Divide They were on the headwaters of the Fraser where a man could stand astride the stream and the Fraser led to the Cariboo gold diggings They still had four hundred miles to travel Their boots were in shreds and their clothes in tatters but what were four hundred miles to men who had tramped almost three thousand But their progress had been so slow that the provisions were running short The first snow of the mountains falls in September and it was already near the end of August There was not a moment to lose in resting What had been a lure of hope now became a goad of desperation So it is with all life s highest emprises We plunge in led by hope We plunge on spurred by fate When the reward is won only God and our own souls know that even if we would we could not have done otherwise than go on Those travellers who had insisted on bringing oxen had now to kill them for meat Chipmunks were shot for food So were many worn out horses Hides were used to resole boots and make mitts Not far from Moose Lake the last bag of pemmican was eaten Perhaps it was a good thing at this time that the band of Overlanders began to spread out and scatter along the trail for hungry men in large groups are a tragic danger to themselves Those of the advance party were now some ten days ahead of their companions in the rear missus MacNaughton whose husband was with the rear party of which we shall hear more anon relates the story of a young fellow so ravenous that he fried the deer thong he had bought for a tump line back at one of the company s forts Fortunately somewhere west of Moose Lake the travellers came on a band of Shuswap Indians who traded for matches and powder enough salmon and cranberry cakes to stave off actual famine Trees with chipped bark pointed the way down the Fraser For three days the party followed the little stream that had come out of the lake hardly wider than the span of a man s stride With each mile its waters swelled and grew wilder On the third day windfall and precipice drove the riders back from the river bed into the heavy hemlock forest where festoons of Spanish moss overhead almost shut out the light of the sun and all sense of direction And when they came back to the bank of the stream they saw a wild cataract cutting its way through a dark canyon There was no mistake This was the Fraser and it was living up to its reputation And yet the Overlanders were sorely puzzled There were no more blazes on the trees to point the way and if this was the Fraser it seemed to flow almost due north Where was Cariboo mister M Micking who was acting as captain tried to find out from the Indians They made him a drawing showing that if he crossed another watershed he would come on a white man s wide pack road That must lead to Cariboo but the snow lay already a foot deep on this road and unless the Overlanders hastened they would be snowbound for the winter On the other hand if the white men continued to follow the wild river canyon north it would bring them to Fort George on the main Fraser in ten days There was no time to waste on chance travelling The Overlanders knew that somewhere south from Moose Lake must lie the headwaters of the Thompson which would bring them to Kamloops Was that what the Indians meant by their drawings of a white man s road If that were true between Moose Lake and the Thompson must lie the land of their desire Cariboo but to cross another unknown divide in winter seemed risky To follow the bend of the Fraser north might be the long way round but it was sure It was decided to let the party separate Let those with provisions still remaining try to push overland to Cariboo If they failed to find it they could build cabins and winter on their pack animals Twenty men joined this group The rest decided to stick to the river Behind were straggling a score more of the travellers who were left to follow as they could missus Shubert with her children joined the band going overland to find the Thompson The Indians traded canoes for horses and showed the Overlanders how to put rafts together to run the Fraser Axes had been worn almost to the haft Cutting the huge trees and splitting them into suitable timbers was slow work It was September before the rafts were ready to be launched There were four Each had a heavy railing round it like that of a ferry with some flat stones on which fires could be lighted to cook meals without pausing to land When we recall the experiences of Mackenzie and Fraser on this river it seems almost incredible that these landsmen made the descent on rafts with their few remaining ponies and oxen tied to the railings yet so they did If we imagine rafts with horses and oxen tied to the railings trying to run the whirlpool below Niagara we shall have some conception of what this meant The canoes sheered out of the way and the rafts were unmoored The Scarborough raft with men from Whitby and Scarborough near Toronto swirled out to midstream on the afternoon of the first of September Poor poor white men sighed the Indians no more see white men but the men in the canoes rapped the gunnels with their paddles and uttered rousing cheers Then the Ottawa and the Niagara and the Huntingdon rafts slipped out on the current All went well for four days Sweeps made of trees with the branch ends turned down and long slim poles kept the rafts in mid current Meals were cooked as the unwieldy craft glided along the river bank Two or three men kept guard at night so that the rafts were delayed for only a few hours during the darkest part of the night The sun shone hot at midday and there were hard frosts at night but the rest in this sort of travel was wonderfully refreshing after four months of toil across prairie and mountain But on the afternoon of the fifth of September the rafts began to bounce and swirl The banks raced to the rear and before the crews realized it a noise as of breaking seas filled the air and the Scarborough was riding her first rapid Luckily the water was deep and the rocks well submerged The Scarborough ran the rapid without mishap and the other rafts followed On the next day however the waters collected and began running in leaps and throwing back spume Some one shouted Breakers head ashore and the galloping rafts bumped on the bank of the river The banks here were steep for portaging and the Scarborough boys brought up on the lake front east of Toronto decided come what might to run the rapids They let go the mooring rope and went churning into a whirlpool of yeasty spray All hands bent their strength to the poles The raft dipped out of sight but was presently seen riding safely and calmly below the rapids Those watching the Scarborough from the bank breathed freely again and plucked up heart but the worst was yet ahead The oily calm below the first rapid dropped into another maelstrom of angry waters Into this the Scarborough was drawn by the terrible undertow For a moment the watchers on the bank could see nothing but the horns of the bellowing frightened oxen tied to the railing Then the raft was mounting the waves again The seaworthiness of a raft is of course well known It may dip under water or even split but it seldom upsets and never swamps or sinks Before the other rafts ran the rapids two of them were first lightened of their loads The men preferred to pack their provisions over the precipices rather than take the risk of losing them in the rapid Nor was the packing child s play There was a narrow portage trail along the ledges of the rocks and where the slabs of granite had split off Indians had laid rickety poles across Over these frail bridges the packers with great difficulty carried the loads of the two rafts Fortunately most of them had long since discarded boots for moccasins All the rafts came through safely The canoes were not so fortunate When the Scarborough reached a sand bar at the foot of the rapids the men were surprised to find three of their Toronto friends who had gone ahead in a canoe now stranded high and dry The canoe had sidled to the waves swamped and sunk with everything the Toronto men owned including their coats tents and boots For two days they had been awaiting the coming of the rafts They were almost dead from exposure and hunger Nine canoes in all were wrecked at this spot One split on the reef Another was caught in the backwater Others sank in the whirlpool below the rapids Others went under at the first leap into the cataract Two of the canoes had foolishly been lashed abreast They sidled shipped a billow and sank All the men clung to the gunnels but one who was a powerful swimmer struck out for the shore The canoes stranded on the shore below and the clinging men saved themselves When they looked for their friend who had struck out for the shore he was no longer to be seen These men were all from Goderich brought up on the banks of Lake Huron A similar fate befell a crew of four men from Toronto Two of them undertook to portage provisions along the bank of the canyon while the other two named Carpenter and Alexander tried to run the canoe down the rapids The episode has some interest for students of psychology Carpenter walked down the bank of the canyon a short distance to reconnoitre the different channels of the rapids He was seen to take out his notebook and write an entry He then put the note book in the inner pocket of his coat took off the coat and slung it in a tree on the bank When he came back to the canoe he seemed preoccupied The canoe ripped on a rock in midstream flattened and sank Carpenter went down insensible as though his head had struck and he had been stunned Alexander was washed ashore He found himself on the side of the bank opposite the rest of the party Going below to calmer waters he swam across Carpenter s coat hung on the trees In the pocket was the note book in which Alexander read the astounding words Arrived at Grand Canyon Ran the canyon and was drowned Carpenter left a wife and child in Toronto for whom evidently he had written the message But if he was of sound mind desiring to live and so certain of death that he was able to write his own fate in the past tense why did he attempt the rapids His friends had no explanation of the curious incident There is another gruesome story of a sand bar in the very middle of this raging canyon It will be remembered that some of the Overlanders had straggled far to the rear Some time before spring a party of them attempted to run this canyon They were never again seen alive Some treasure seekers who came over the trail in spring stranded on this sand bar They found the bodies of the missing men All but one had been torn and partly devoured It need not be told here that no wild beast could have stemmed the rapids from either side Unless wolves or cougars had accidentally been washed to the sand bar and washed away again the wild solitude must have witnessed a horror too terrible to be told for the body of the man who had apparently died last was fully clothed and unmolested As absolutely nothing more is known of what happened than has been set down here it seems well that there is no record of the names of these castaways CHAPTER VI QUESNEL AND KAMLOOPS The walls of the river lowered and widened the current slackened and the surviving canoes and rafts were presently gliding peacefully down a smooth stream That night the Overlanders slept dead with weariness but a fearful depression rested on the company Gold had begun to collect its toll and the price appalled every soul Who would be the next How soon would the unknown river turn west and south Where was Fort George What perils yet lay between the fort and the gold camp As the heavy mists lifted at daybreak the travellers observed that the river was narrowing again and that the wooded banks had begun to fly past very swiftly There was no mistaking the signs They were approaching more rapids But the trick of guiding the craft down rapids had now been learned so the flotilla rode the furious waters unharmed for fifteen miles It was almost dark when canoes and rafts swung round a curve in the river and saw a flag waving above the little walled fur post of Fort George The tired wanderers were welcomed in by clerks too amazed to speak while a howling chorus of husky dogs set up their serenade A young Englishman who had joined the Overlanders at saint Paul died from the effects of exposure a few minutes after being carried into the fort Next morning the body was rolled in blankets placed in a canoe and buried under a rude wooden cross with stones piled above the grave to prevent the ravaging of huskies and wolves The chief factor was away but the young clerks in charge sent Indians along to pilot the Overlanders through the rapids below Fort George known as the most dangerous on the Fraser These rapids it will be recalled had wrecked Alexander Mackenzie and had almost cost Simon Fraser his life But the treasure seekers did not have to go as far south as Alexandria where Mackenzie had turned back With guides who knew the waters they ran the rapids below Fort George safely and moored at Quesnel the entrance to Cariboo on the eleventh of September four months after they had left Canada Quesnel was at this time a rude settlement of perhaps a dozen log shacks chiefly bunkhouses and provision stores North of Yale the Cariboo Road had not yet been opened and all provisions had been brought in from the lower Fraser by pack horse and dog train at enormous cost and risk Food sold at extortionate prices A meal cost two dollars and fifty cents for beans bacon and coffee Salmon of course was cheap Fortunately there was little whisky so though tattered miners were everywhere in the woods order was maintained without vigilance committees On one spectacle the far travelled ragged Overlanders feasted their tired eyes They saw miners everywhere along the banks of creeks washing gold But there were more gold seekers than claims and those without claims were full of complaints and fears for the winter They declared the country was over rated and a humbug The question was how to get out to Victoria Overlanders who had tramped across the breadth of a continent did not relish the prospect as one Yankee miner described it of hoofing it five hundred miles farther Some of the disappointed Overlanders floated on down to Alexandria where they sold their rafts and took jobs on the government road which was being constructed along the canyon This ensured them safety from starvation for the winter at least Other Overlanders followed these first pioneers the plains across And we have seen that some of those who had crossed the prairie with the first party had fallen behind These stragglers did not reach Yellowhead Pass till the first week of September They were entirely out of food but they had matches and each box of fifty bought a huge salmon from the Shuswaps Some of the men pushed ahead built a raft and launched it on the Fraser The raft ripped on a rock in midstream and stuck there at an angle of forty five degrees Money tools food and clothing slithered into the tow of the rapids while the men clung in desperation to the upper railing of the wreck One man let go and dropped into the water Swimming and drifting and rolling over and over he gained the shore and hurried back to the pass with word of the accident Friends accompanied by Indians came in canoes to the rescue and by means of ropes every man was brought off the wrecked raft alive But the party now stood in a more desperate predicament than ever for lack of food and clothing The Shuswaps saved the whites from starvation They took the white men to a pool in the Fraser where salmon exhausted from the long run up the river could be speared or clubbed by the boat load And while some of the men chopped down trees to build dugout canoes others speared cleaned and dried the salmon Night and day they worked and forgot sleep in their desperate haste At length they launched their craft on the Fraser On the way down the dangerous canyon they saw the wrecked canoes of those who had gone before The tenth day after leaving Yellowhead Pass they reached Fort George Their story has been told by missus MacNaughton whose husband was of the party They arrived at Fort George mostly barefoot coatless and trousers and shirts in tatters Their hair and beards were long and unkempt It is supposed that they must have lost the salmon in some of the rapids or else the supply was insufficient for they were so weak from hunger that they had to be carried into the fort They arrived at Quesnel a month after the first Overlanders when the snow was too deep in the mountains for prospecting or mining The majority of this party also took work on the government road Meanwhile how had fared that band of the Overlanders who had gone over the hills south from the pass in search of the upper branches of the Thompson A Shuswap accompanied them as guide and for a few days there was a well defined game trail Then the trail meandered off into a dense forest of hemlock and windfall which had to be cut almost every mile of the way They did not average six miles a day but they finally came to the steep bank of a wild river flowing south which they judged must be a branch of the Thompson The mountains were so steep that it was impossible to proceed farther with horses and oxen so they abandoned these in the woods and cut trees for rafts For seven days they ran rapid after rapid One of the rafts stranded on a rock and remained for two days before companions came to the rescue At another point a canoe was smashed in midstream The crew struggled to a slippery rock and hung to the ledge A man named Strachan attempted to swim ashore to signal distress to those above They saw him ride the waves Then a roll of angry waters swept over him and he passed out of sight His companions clung to the rock till another canoe came shooting down stream when lines were hoisted to the castaways and they were hauled ashore Where the Clearwater comes into the Thompson they found the fur trader s horse trail and tramped the remaining hundred miles overland south to Kamloops On the last lap of their terrible march all were so exhausted they could scarcely drag themselves forward Some would lie down and sleep then creep on a few miles About twenty miles from the mouth of the Thompson they came to a field of potatoes planted by some rancher of Kamloops The starving Overlanders could scarcely credit their eyes No one occupied the windowless log cabin but there was the potato patch an oasis of food in a desert of starvation They paused long enough at the cabin to boil a great kettleful and to feast ravenously This gave them strength to tramp on to Kamloops We saw that the Irish mother missus Shubert with her two children accompanied this party The day after reaching Kamloops she gave birth to a child Did the Overlanders find the gold which each man s rainbow hopes had dreamed They had followed the rainbow over the ends of earth Was the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow You will find an occasional Overlander passing the sunset of his days in quiet retreat at Yale or Hope or Quesnel or Barkerville He does not wear evidence of great earthly possessions though he may refer wistfully to the golden age of those long past adventurous days The leaders who survived became honoured citizens of British Columbia Few came back to the East They passed their lives in the wild free new land that had given them such harsh experiences

9026_282385_000003_000001	train-clean-360	The ordinary wage was ten dollars a day and men who could be trusted and who were brave enough to pack the gold out to the coast received twenty and even as high as fifty dollars a day 
9026_282385_000003_000002	train-clean-360	There is a letter written by Sir Matthew Begbie describing how the mountain trails were infested that winter by desperadoes lying in wait for the miners who came staggering over the trail literally weighted down with gold 
9026_282385_000003_000003	train-clean-360	The miners found what the great banks have always found that the presence of unused gold is a nuisance and a curse 
none	none	They had to lug the gold in leather sacks with them to their work and back with them to their shacks and they always carried firearms ready for use There was very little shooting at the mines but if a bad man turned up missing no one asked whether he had hoofed it down the trail or whether he hung as a sign of warning from a pole set horizontally at a proper height between two trees 
9026_282385_000003_000006	train-clean-360	In a mining camp there is no mercy for the crook 
9026_282385_000003_000007	train-clean-360	If the trail could have told tales there would have been many a story of dead men washed up on the bars of sneak thieves given thirty nine lashes and like the scapegoat turned out into the mountain wilds a rough and ready justice administered without judge or jury 
none	none	But a woman was as safe on the trail as in her own home a thing that civilization never understands about a wild mining camp 
9026_282385_000004_000001	train-clean-360	missus Cameron wife of the famous Cariboo Cameron lived with her husband on his claim till she died and many other women lived in the camps with their husbands 
9026_282385_000004_000002	train-clean-360	When the road opened there was a rush of hurdy gurdy girls for dance halls but that did not modify the rough chivalry of an unwritten law 
none	none	These hurdy gurdy girls who tiptoed to the concertina the fiddle and the hand organ were German and if we may believe the poet of Cariboo they were something like the Glasgow girls described by Wolfe as cold to everything but a bagpipe I wrong them there is not one that does not melt away at the sound of money Sings the poet of Cariboo 
9026_282385_000005_000000	train-clean-360	They danced a nicht in dresses licht Fra late until the early O But O their hearts were hard as flint Which vexed the laddies sairly O 
9026_282385_000006_000000	train-clean-360	The dollar was their only love And that they loved fu dearly O They dinna care a flea for men Let them court hooe er sincerely O 
9026_282385_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Cariboo was what the miners call a he camp Not unnaturally the she camps heard the call from Macedonia The bishop of Oxford the bishop of London the lord mayor of London and a colonial society in England gathered up some industrious young women as suitable wives for the British Columbia miners 
9026_282385_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Alack the day there was no poet to send letters to the outside world on this handling of Cupid s bow and arrow The comedy was pushed in the most business like fashion 
9026_282385_000007_000002	train-clean-360	Threescore young girls came out under the auspices of the society and the Church carefully shepherded by a clergyman and a stern matron 
9026_282385_000007_000003	train-clean-360	They reached Victoria in September of sixty two and were housed in the barracks 
none	none	Miners camped on every inch of ground from which the barracks could be watched and when the girls passed to and from their temporary lodging their progress was like a royal procession through a silent gaping but most respectful lane of whiskered faces 
9026_282385_000007_000005	train-clean-360	A man looking anything but respect would have been knocked down on the spot 
9026_282385_000007_000006	train-clean-360	We laugh now Victoria did not laugh then 
none	none	It was all taken very seriously 
9026_282385_000007_000008	train-clean-360	On the instant every girl was offered some kind of situation which she voluntarily and almost immediately exchanged for matrimony 
none	none	In all some ninety girls came out under these auspices in sixty two sixty three The respectable girls fitted in where they belonged 
9026_282385_000007_000011	train-clean-360	The disreputable also found their own places 
9026_282385_000007_000012	train-clean-360	And the mining camp began to take on an appearance of domesticity and home 
9026_282385_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Matthew Begbie later like Douglas given a title for his services to the Empire had as we have seen first come out under direct appointment by the crown and when parliamentary government was organized in British Columbia his position was confirmed as chief justice 
none	none	He had less regard for red tape than most chief justices Like Douglas he first maintained law and order and then looked up to see if he had any authority for it No man ever did more for a mining camp than Sir Matthew Begbie 
9026_282385_000008_000003	train-clean-360	He stood for the rights of the poorest miner 
9026_282385_000008_000004	train-clean-360	In private life he was fond of music art and literature but in public life he was autocratic as a czar and sternly righteous as a prophet 
9026_282385_000008_000005	train-clean-360	He was a vigilance committee in himself through sheer force of personality 
none	none	Crime did not flourish where Begbie went Chinaman or Indian could be as sure of justice as the richest miner in Cariboo 
9026_282385_000008_000008	train-clean-360	From hating and fearing him the camp came almost to worship him 
9026_282385_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Many are the stories of his circuits 
none	none	Once a jury persisted in bringing in a verdict of manslaughter in place of murder Prisoner thundered Begbie it is not a pleasant duty to me to sentence you only to prison for life 
9026_282385_000010_000001	train-clean-360	You deserve to be hanged 
9026_282385_000010_000002	train-clean-360	Had the jury performed their duty I might have the painful satisfaction of condemning you to death 
9026_282385_000010_000003	train-clean-360	You gentlemen of the jury permit me to say that it would give me great pleasure to sentence you to be hanged each and every one of you for bringing in a murderer guilty only of manslaughter 
none	none	On another occasion when an American had accidentally shot an Indian the coroner rendered a verdict worried to death by a dog Begbie ordered another inquest This time the coroner returned a finding that the Indian had been killed by falling over a cliff Begbie on his own authority ordered the American seized and taken down to Victoria 
9026_282385_000011_000002	train-clean-360	On his way down the prisoner escaped from the constable This type of hair trigger gunmen at once fled the country when Begbie came 
9026_282385_000012_000000	train-clean-360	mister Alexander one of the Overlanders of sixty two tells how Begbie s decisions may not have been good law but they were first class justice His doctrine was that if a man were killed some one had to be hanged for it and the effect was salutary A man had been sandbagged in a Victoria saloon and thrown out to die 
9026_282385_000012_000001	train-clean-360	His companion in the saloon was arrested and tried 
9026_282385_000012_000002	train-clean-360	The circumstantial evidence was strong and the judge so charged the jury 
9026_282385_000012_000003	train-clean-360	But the jury acquitted the prisoner 
9026_282385_000012_000004	train-clean-360	Dead silence fell in the court room 
9026_282385_000012_000005	train-clean-360	The prisoner s counsel arose and requested the discharge of the man 
none	none	Begbie whirled Prisoner at the bar the jury have said you are not guilty 
9026_282385_000012_000007	train-clean-360	You can go and I devoutly hope the next man you sandbag will be one of the jury On another occasion a man was found stabbed on the Cariboo Road 
none	none	The man with whom the dead miner had been quarrelling was arrested tried and in spite of strong evidence against him acquitted 
9026_282385_000012_000009	train-clean-360	Begbie adjourned the court with the pious wish that the murderer should go out and cut the throats of the jury 
9026_282385_000013_000000	train-clean-360	But in spite of his harsh manner towards the wrong doer the old man as the miners affectionately called him kept law and order 
9026_282385_000013_000001	train-clean-360	In the early days gold commissioners not only settled all mining disputes but acted as judge and jury 
none	none	Against any decision of the gold commissioners Begbie was the sole appeal and in all the long years of his administration no decision of his was ever challenged 
9026_282385_000014_000000	train-clean-360	The effect of sudden wealth on some of the hungry ragged horde who infested Cariboo was of a sort to discount fiction 
none	none	One man took out forty thousand dollars in gold nuggets 
9026_282385_000014_000002	train-clean-360	A lunatic escaped from a madhouse could not have been more foolish 
9026_282385_000014_000003	train-clean-360	He came to the best saloon of Barkerville 
none	none	He called in guests from the highways and byways and treated them to champagne which cost thirty dollars and fifty dollars a bottle When the rabble could drink no more champagne he ordered every glass filled and placed on the bar With one magnificent drunken gesture of vainglory he swept the glasses in a clattering crash to the floor 
9026_282385_000014_000007	train-clean-360	There was still a basket of champagne left 
9026_282385_000014_000008	train-clean-360	He danced the hurdy gurdy on that basket till he cut his feet 
9026_282385_000014_000009	train-clean-360	The champagne was all gone but he still had some gold nuggets 
none	none	There was a mirror in the bar room valued at hundreds of dollars 
9026_282385_000014_000011	train-clean-360	The miner stood and proudly surveyed his own figure in the glass 
none	none	Had he not won his dearest desire and conquered all things in conquering fortune 
9026_282385_000014_000013	train-clean-360	He gathered his last nuggets and hurled them in handfuls at the mirror shattering it in countless pieces 
9026_282385_000014_000014	train-clean-360	Then he went out in the night to sleep under the stars penniless 
9026_282385_000014_000015	train-clean-360	He settled down to work for the rest of his life in other men s mines 
none	none	The staid Overlanders who had risked their lives to reach this wild land of desire who had come from such church going hamlets as Whitby such Scottish Presbyterian centres as Toronto and Montreal hardly knew whether they were dreaming or living in a country of crazy pixies who delved in mud and water all day and weltered in champagne all night The Cariboo poet sang their sentiments in these words 
9026_282385_000016_000000	train-clean-360	I ken a body made a strike He looked a little lord He had a clan o followers Amang a needy horde 
none	none	Whane er he d enter a saloon You d see the barkeep smile His lordship s humble servant he Wi out a thought o guile A twalmonth passed an a is gane Baith freends and brandy bottle An noo the puir soul s left alane Wi nocht to weet his throttle 
9026_282385_000020_000000	train-clean-360	In Barkerville which became the centre of Cariboo saloons and dance halls grew up overnight 
none	none	Pianos were packed in on mules at a rate of a dollar a pound from Quesnel 
9026_282385_000020_000002	train-clean-360	Champagne in pint bottles sold at two ounces of gold 
none	none	Potatoes retailed at ninety dollars a hundredweight 
9026_282385_000020_000004	train-clean-360	Nails were cheap at a dollar a pound 
9026_282385_000020_000005	train-clean-360	Milk was retailed frozen at a dollar a pound 
9026_282385_000020_000006	train-clean-360	Boots still cost fifty dollars Such luxuries as mirrors and stoves cost as high as seven hundred dollars each 
none	none	The hurdy gurdy girls with true German thrift charged ten dollars or more a dance not the stately waltz but a wild fling to shake the rafters and tire out the stoutest miners 
9026_282385_000021_000000	train-clean-360	A newspaper was published in Barkerville 
none	none	And it was in it that James Anderson of Scotland first issued Jeames s Letters to Sawney Your letter cam by the express Eight shillin s carriage naethin less You maybe like to ken what pay Miners get here for ilka day Jus twa poond sterling sure as death It should be four between us baith For gin ye coont the cost o livin There s naethin left to gang an come on Sawney had ye yer taters

O his castles in the air CHAPTER VIII THE CARIBOO ROAD When the railway first went through the Fraser Canyon passengers looking out of the windows anywhere from Yale to Ashcroft were amazed to see something like a Jacob s ladder up and down the mountains appearing in places to hang almost in mid air Between Yale and Lytton it hugged the mountain side on what looked like a shelf of rock directly above the wildest water of the canyon Crib work of huge trees resembling in the distance the woven pattern of a willow basket projected out over the ledges like a bird s nest hung from some mountain eyrie The traveller almost expected to see the thing sway and swing to the wind Then the train would sweep through a tunnel or swing round a sharp bend and far up among the summits might be seen a mule team or a string of pack horses winding round the shoulders of the rock It seemed impossible that any man made highway could climb such perpendicular walls and drop down precipitous cliffs and follow a trail apparently secure only for a mountain goat The first impression was that the thing must be an old Indian war path along which no enemy could pursue But when the train paused at a water tank and the traveller made inquiry he was told that this was nothing less than the famous Cariboo Road one of the wonders of the world Illustration The Cariboo Road From a photograph As long as the discovery of gold was confined to the Fraser river bars the important matter of transportation gave the government no difficulty Hudson s Bay steamers crossed from Victoria to Langley on the Fraser which was a large fort and well equipped as a base of supplies for the workers in the wilderness Stern wheelers canoes and miscellaneous craft could with care creep up from Langley to Hope and Yale and the fares charged afforded a good revenue to the Hudson s Bay Company Even when prospectors struck above Yale on up to Harrison Lake and across to Lillooet or from the Okanagan to the Thompson the difficulties of transportation were soon surmounted A road was shortly opened from Harrison Lake to Lillooet built by the miners themselves under the direction of the Royal Engineers and as to the Thompson there was the well worn trail of the fur traders who had been going overland to Kamloops for fifty years It was when gold was discovered higher up on the Fraser and in Cariboo after the colony of British Columbia had taken its place on the political map that Governor Douglas was put to the task of building a great road Henceforth for a few years at least the miners would be the backbone if not the whole body of the new colony How could the administration be carried on if the government had no road into the mining region And so the governor of British Columbia entered on the boldest undertaking in roadbuilding ever launched by any community of twenty thousand people The Cariboo Road became to British Columbia what the Appian Way was to Rome It was eighteen feet wide and over four hundred and eighty miles long It was one of the finest roads ever built in the world Yet it cost the country only two thousand dollars a mile as against the forty thousand dollars a mile which the two transcontinental railways spent later on their roadbeds along the canyon It was Sir James Douglas s greatest monument Five hundred volunteer mine workers built the road from Harrison Lake to Lillooet in eighteen fifty eight at the rate of ten miles a day and when the road was opened in September packers charges fell from a dollar to forty eight cents and finally to eighteen cents a pound But presently the trend of travel drew away from Harrison Lake to the line of the Fraser At first there was nothing but a mule trail hacked out of the rock from Yale to Spuzzum but miners went voluntarily to work and widened the bridle path above the shelving waters From Spuzzum to Lytton the river ledges seemed almost impassable for pack animals yet a cable ferry was rigged up at Spuzzum and mules were sent over the ledges to draw it up the river When the water rose so high that the lower ledges were unsafe the packers ascended the mountains eight hundred feet above the roaring canyon Where cliffs broke off they sent the animals across an Indian bridge The marvel is not that many a poor beast fell headlong eight hundred feet down the precipice The marvel is that any pack animal could cross such a trail at all A traveller must trust his hands as much as his feet wrote Begbie after his first experience of this trail Illustration Indian graves at Lytton B C From a photograph But by eighteen sixty two cutting and blasting and bridge building had begun under the direction of the Royal Engineers and before eighteen sixty five the great road was completed into the heart of the mining country at Barkerville Henceforth passengers went in by stage coach drawn by six horses Road houses along the way provided relays of fresh horses Freight went in by bull team but pack horses and mules were still used to carry miners provisions to the camps in the hills which lay off the main road It was while the road was still building that an enterprising packer brought twenty one camels on the trail They were not a success and caused countless stampedes Horses and mules took fright at the slightest whiff of them The camels themselves could stand neither the climate nor the hard rock road They were turned adrift on the Thompson river where the last of them died in nineteen oh five There was something highly romantic in the stage coach travel of this halcyon era The driver was always a crack whip a man who called himself an old timer though often his years numbered fewer than twenty Most of the drivers however knew the trail from having packed in on shanks s mare and camped under the stars At the log taverns known as road houses travellers could sleep for the night and obtain meals On the down trip bags were piled on the roof with a couple of frontiersmen armed with rifles to guard them Many were the devices of a returning miner for concealing the gold which he had won A fat hurdy gurdy girl or sometimes a squaw would climb to a place in the stage And when the stage with a crack of the whip and a prance of the six horses came rattling across the bridge and rolling into Yale the fat girl would be the first to deposit her ample person at the bank or the express office whence gold could safely be sent on down to Victoria And when she emerged half an hour later she would have thinned perceptibly Then the rough miner who had not addressed a word to her on the way down for fear of a confidence man aboard would present Susy with a handsome reward in the form of a gaudy dress or a year s provisions Start from a road house was made at dawn when the clouds still hung heavy on the mountains and the peaks were all reflected in the glacial waters The passengers tumbled dishevelled from log walled rooms where the beds were bench berths and ate breakfast in a dining hall where the seats were hewn logs The fare consisted of ham fried in slabs eggs ancient and transformed to leather in lard slapjacks known as Rocky Mountain dead shot in maple syrup that never saw a maple tree and was black as a pot and potatoes in soggy pyramids Yet so keen was the mountain air so stimulating the ozone of the resinous hemlock forests that the most fastidious traveller felt he had fared sumptuously and gaily paid the two fifty for the meal Perhaps there was time to wash in the common tin basin at the door where the towel always bore evidence of patronage perhaps not anyhow no matter Washing was only a trivial incident of mountain travel in those days The passenger jumped for a place in the coach the long whip cracked The horses sprang forward and away the stage rattled round curves where a hind wheel would try to go over the edge only the driver didn t let it down embankments where any normal wagon would have upset but this one didn t up sharp grades where no horses ought to be driven at a trot but where the six persisted in going at a gallop The passenger didn t mind the jolting that almost dislocated his spine He didn t mind the negro who sat on one side of him or the fat squaw who sat on the other He was thankful not to be held up by highwaymen or dumped into the wild cataract of waters below Outside was a changing panorama of mountain and canyon with a world of forests and lakes Inside was a drama of human nature to outdo any curtain raiser he had ever witnessed a baronet who had lost in the game and was going home penniless perhaps earning his way by helping with the horses an outworn actress who had been trying her luck at the dance halls a gambler pretending that he was a millionaire a saloon keeper with a few thousands in his pockets and a diamond in his shirt the size of a pebble a tenderfoot rigged out as a veteran with buckskin coat a belt full of artillery fearfully and wonderfully made new high boots and a devil may care air that deceived no one but himself a few Shuswaps and Siwashes fat ill smelling insolent and plainly highly amused in their beady watchful black ferret eyes at the mad ways of this white race a still more ill smelling Chinaman and a taciturn grizzled ragged fellow paying no attention to the fat squaw keeping his observations and his thoughts inside his high boots but likely as not to turn out the man who would conduct the squaw to the bank or the express office at Yale If one could get a seat outside with the guards and the driver one who knew how to unlock the lore of these sons of the hills he was lucky for he would learn who made his strike there who was murdered at another place how the sneak thief trailed the tenderfoot somewhere else all of it romance much of it fiction much of it fact but no fiction half so marvellous as the fact 
9026_282386_000018_000000	train-clean-360	Bull teams of twenty yokes long lines of pack horses led by a bell mare mule teams with a tinkling of bells and singing of the drivers met the stage and passed with happy salute 
none	none	At nightfall the camp fires of foot travellers could be seen down at the water s edge And there was always danger enough to add zest to the journey Wherever there are hordes of hungry adventurous men there will be desperadoes In spite of Begbie s justice robberies occurred on the road and not a few murders The time going in and out varied but the journey could be made in five days and was often made in four The building of the Cariboo Road had an important influence on the camp that its builders could not foresee The unknown El Dorado is always invested with a fabulous glamour that draws to ruin the reckless and the unfit Before the road was built adventurers had arrived in Cariboo expecting to pick up pails of nuggets at the bottom of a rainbow Their disillusionment came but there was an easy way back to the world They did not stay to breed crime and lawlessness in the camp The walking as Begbie expressed it was all down hill and the road was good especially for thugs While there were ten thousand men in Cariboo in the winter of sixty two and perhaps twenty thousand in the winter of sixty three there were less than five thousand in seventy one 
9026_282386_000020_000000	train-clean-360	This does not mean that the camp had collapsed 
none	none	It had simply changed from a poor man s camp to a camp for a capitalist or a company It will be remembered that the miners first found the gold in flakes then farther up in nuggets then that the nuggets had to be pursued to pay dirt beneath gravel and clay 
9026_282386_000020_000003	train-clean-360	This meant shafts tunnels hydraulic machinery stamp mills 
none	none	Later when the pay dirt showed signs of merging into quartz there passed away for ever the day of the penniless prospector seeking the golden fleece of the hills as his predecessor the trapper had sought the pelt of the little beaver All unwittingly the miner as well as the trapper was an instrument in the hands of destiny an instrument for shaping empire for it was the inrush of miners which gave birth to the colony of British Columbia Federation with the Canadian Dominion followed in eighteen seventy one the railway and the settler came and the man with the pick and his eyes on the float gave place to the man with the plough BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE The episode of Cariboo is so recent that the bibliography on it is not very complete British Columbia by Judge Howay and E O S Scholefield provincial librarian is the last and most accurate word on the history of that province though one could wish that the authors had given more human document records in the biographical section In a very few years there will be no old timers of the trail left and after all it is the human document that gives colour and life to history It was my privilege to know some of the Overlanders intimately One of the companies who rafted down the Fraser came from the county where I was born and though they preceded my day their terrible experiences were a household word With others I have poled the Fraser on those very tempestuous waters that took such toll of life in sixty two Others have been my hosts I have gone up and down the Arrow Lakes in a steamer as a guest of the man who came through the worst experiences of the Overlanders Chance conversations are shifty guides on dates and place names For these regarding the Overlanders I have relied on missus MacNaughton s Cariboo Gosnell s British Columbia Year Book and Hubert Howe Bancroft s British Columbia are very full on this era Walter Moberly s pamphlets on the building of the trail and mister Alexander s casual addresses are excellent Old files of the Kamloops Sentinel and the Victoria Colonist are full of scattered data Anderson s Hand Book of eighteen fifty eight Begbie s Report to the London Geographical Society eighteen sixty one Begg s British Columbia Fraser s Journal Mayne s British Columbia eighteen sixty two Milton and Cheadle s North West Passage eighteen sixty five Palliser s Report eighteen fifty nine Waddington s Fraser River Mines all afford sidelights on this adventurous era On the prospector s daily life there is no book That must be learned from him on the trail and on many camp trips in the Rockies with prospectors for guides I have picked up such facts as I could INDEX Alexander mister his tragic experience on the Fraser seventy seven eight quoted ninety
