Company edition by David Price email ccxseventy four coventry ac uk MARTIN EDEN CHAPTER I The one opened the door with a latch key and went in followed by a young fellow who awkwardly removed his cap He wore rough clothes that smacked of the sea and he was manifestly out of place in the spacious hall in which he found himself He did not know what to do with his cap and was stuffing it into his coat pocket when the other took it from him The act was done quietly and naturally and the awkward young fellow appreciated it He understands was his thought He ll see me through all right He walked at the other s heels with a swing to his shoulders and his legs spread unwittingly as if the level floors were tilting up and sinking down to the heave and lunge of the sea The wide rooms seemed too narrow for his rolling gait and to himself he was in terror lest his broad shoulders should collide with the doorways or sweep the bric a brac from the low mantel He recoiled from side to side between the various objects and multiplied the hazards that in reality lodged only in his mind Between a grand piano and a centre table piled high with books was space for a half a dozen to walk abreast yet he essayed it with trepidation His heavy arms hung loosely at his sides He did not know what to do with those arms and hands and when to his excited vision one arm seemed liable to brush against the books on the table he lurched away like a frightened horse barely missing the piano stool He watched the easy walk of the other in front of him and for the first time realized that his walk was different from that of other men He experienced a momentary pang of shame that he should walk so uncouthly The sweat burst through the skin of his forehead in tiny beads and he paused and mopped his bronzed face with his handkerchief Hold on Arthur my boy he said attempting to mask his anxiety with facetious utterance This is too much all at once for yours truly Give me a chance to get my nerve You know I didn t want to come an I guess your fam ly ain t hankerin to see me neither That s all right was the reassuring answer You mustn t be frightened at us We re just homely people Hello there s a letter for me He stepped back to the table tore open the envelope and began to read giving the stranger an opportunity to recover himself And the stranger understood and appreciated His was the gift of sympathy understanding and beneath his alarmed exterior that sympathetic process went on He mopped his forehead dry and glanced about him with a controlled face though in the eyes there was an expression such as wild animals betray when they fear the trap He was surrounded by the unknown apprehensive of what might happen ignorant of what he should do aware that he walked and bore himself awkwardly fearful that every attribute and power of him was similarly afflicted He was keenly sensitive hopelessly self conscious and the amused glance that the other stole privily at him over the top of the letter burned into him like a dagger thrust He saw the glance but he gave no sign for among the things he had learned was discipline Also that dagger thrust went to his pride He cursed himself for having come and at the same time resolved that happen what would having come he would carry it through The lines of his face hardened and into his eyes came a fighting light He looked about more unconcernedly sharply observant every detail of the pretty interior registering itself on his brain His eyes were wide apart nothing in their field of vision escaped and as they drank in the beauty before them the fighting light died out and a warm glow took its place He was responsive to beauty and here was cause to respond An oil painting caught and held him A heavy surf thundered and burst over an outjutting rock lowering storm clouds covered the sky and outside the line of surf a pilot schooner close hauled heeled over till every detail of her deck was visible was surging along against a stormy sunset sky There was beauty and it drew him irresistibly He forgot his awkward walk and came closer to the painting very close The beauty faded out of the canvas His face expressed his bepuzzlement He stared at what seemed a careless daub of paint then stepped away Immediately all the beauty flashed back into the canvas A trick picture was his thought as he dismissed it though in the midst of the multitudinous impressions he was receiving he found time to feel a prod of indignation that so much beauty should be sacrificed to make a trick He did not know painting He had been brought up on chromos and lithographs that were always definite and sharp near or far He had seen oil paintings it was true in the show windows of shops but the glass of the windows had prevented his eager eyes from approaching too near He glanced around at his friend reading the letter and saw the books on the table Into his eyes leaped a wistfulness and a yearning as promptly as the yearning leaps into the eyes of a starving man at sight of food An impulsive stride with one lurch to right and left of the shoulders brought him to the table where he began affectionately handling the books He glanced at the titles and the authors names read fragments of text caressing the volumes with his eyes and hands and once recognized a book he had read For the rest they were strange books and strange authors He chanced upon a volume of Swinburne and began reading steadily forgetful of where he was his face glowing Twice he closed the book on his forefinger to look at the name of the author Swinburne he would remember that name That fellow had eyes and he had certainly seen color and flashing light But who was Swinburne Was he dead a hundred years or so like most of the poets Or was he alive still and writing He turned to the title page yes he had written other books well he would go to the free library the first thing in the morning and try to get hold of some of Swinburne s stuff He went back to the text and lost himself He did not notice that a young woman had entered the room The first he knew was when he heard Arthur s voice saying Ruth this is mister Eden The book was closed on his forefinger and before he turned he was thrilling to the first new impression which was not of the girl but of her brother s words Under that muscled body of his he was a mass of quivering sensibilities At the slightest impact of the outside world upon his consciousness his thoughts sympathies and emotions leapt and played like lambent flame He was extraordinarily receptive and responsive while his imagination pitched high was ever at work establishing relations of likeness and difference mister Eden was what he had thrilled to he who had been called Eden or Martin Eden or just Martin all his life And Mister It was certainly going some was his internal comment His mind seemed to turn on the instant into a vast camera obscura and he saw arrayed around his consciousness endless pictures from his life of stoke holes and forecastles camps and beaches jails and boozing kens fever hospitals and slum streets wherein the thread of association was the fashion in which he had been addressed in those various situations And then he turned and saw the girl The phantasmagoria of his brain vanished at sight of her She was a pale ethereal creature with wide spiritual blue eyes and a wealth of golden hair He did not know how she was dressed except that the dress was as wonderful as she He likened her to a pale gold flower upon a slender stem No she was a spirit a divinity a goddess such sublimated beauty was not of the earth Or perhaps the books were right and there were many such as she in the upper walks of life She might well be sung by that chap Swinburne Perhaps he had had somebody like her in mind when he painted that girl Iseult in the book there on the table All this plethora of sight and feeling and thought occurred on the instant There was no pause of the realities wherein he moved He saw her hand coming out to his and she looked him straight in the eyes as she shook hands frankly like a man The women he had known did not shake hands that way For that matter most of them did not shake hands at all A flood of associations visions of various ways he had made the acquaintance of women rushed into his mind and threatened to swamp it But he shook them aside and looked at her Never had he seen such a woman The women he had known Immediately beside her on either hand ranged the women he had known For an eternal second he stood in the midst of a portrait gallery wherein she occupied the central place while about her were limned many women all to be weighed and measured by a fleeting glance herself the unit of weight and measure He saw the weak and sickly faces of the girls of the factories and the simpering boisterous girls from the south of Market There were women of the cattle camps and swarthy cigarette smoking women of Old Mexico These in turn were crowded out by Japanese women doll like stepping mincingly on wooden clogs by Eurasians delicate featured stamped with degeneracy by full bodied South Sea Island women flower crowned and brown skinned All these were blotted out by a grotesque and terrible nightmare brood frowsy shuffling creatures from the pavements of Whitechapel gin bloated hags of the stews and all the vast hell s following of harpies vile mouthed and filthy that under the guise of monstrous female form prey upon sailors the scrapings of the ports the scum and slime of the human pit Won t you sit down mister Eden the girl was saying I have been looking forward to meeting you ever since Arthur told us It was brave of you He waved his hand deprecatingly and muttered that it was nothing at all what he had done and that any fellow would have done it She noticed that the hand he waved was covered with fresh abrasions in the process of healing and a glance at the other loose hanging hand showed it to be in the same condition Also with quick critical eye she noted a scar on his cheek another that peeped out from under the hair of the forehead and a third that ran down and disappeared under the starched collar She repressed a smile at sight of the red line that marked the chafe of the collar against the bronzed neck He was evidently unused to stiff collars Likewise her feminine eye took in the clothes he wore the cheap and unaesthetic cut the wrinkling of the coat across the shoulders and the series of wrinkles in the sleeves that advertised bulging biceps muscles While he waved his hand and muttered that he had done nothing at all he was obeying her behest by trying to get into a chair He found time to admire the ease with which she sat down then lurched toward a chair facing her overwhelmed with consciousness of the awkward figure he was cutting This was a new experience for him All his life up to then he had been unaware of being either graceful or awkward Such thoughts of self had never entered his mind He sat down gingerly on the edge of the chair greatly worried by his hands They were in the way wherever he put them Arthur was leaving the room and Martin Eden followed his exit with longing eyes He felt lost alone there in the room with that pale spirit of a woman There was no bar keeper upon whom to call for drinks no small boy to send around the corner for a can of beer and by means of that social fluid start the amenities of friendship flowing You have such a scar on your neck mister Eden the girl was saying How did it happen I am sure it must have been some adventure A Mexican with a knife miss he answered moistening his parched lips and clearing hip throat It was just a fight After I got the knife away he tried to bite off my nose Baldly as he had stated it in his eyes was a rich vision of that hot starry night at Salina Cruz the white strip of beach the lights of the sugar steamers in the harbor the voices of the drunken sailors in the distance the jostling stevedores the flaming passion in the Mexican s face the glint of the beast eyes in the starlight the sting of the steel in his neck and the rush of blood the crowd and the cries the two bodies his and the Mexican s locked together rolling over and over and tearing up the sand and from away off somewhere the mellow tinkling of a guitar Such was the picture and he thrilled to the memory of it wondering if the man could paint it who had painted the pilot schooner on the wall The white beach the stars and the lights of the sugar steamers would look great he thought and midway on the sand the dark group of figures that surrounded the fighters The knife occupied a place in the picture he decided and would show well with a sort of gleam in the light of the stars But of all this no hint had crept into his speech He tried to bite off my nose he concluded Oh the girl said in a faint far voice and he noticed the shock in her sensitive face He felt a shock himself and a blush of embarrassment shone faintly on his sunburned cheeks though to him it burned as hotly as when his cheeks had been exposed to the open furnace door in the fire room Such sordid things as stabbing affrays were evidently not fit subjects for conversation with a lady People in the books in her walk of life did not talk about such things perhaps they did not know about them either There was a brief pause in the conversation they were trying to get started Then she asked tentatively about the scar on his cheek Even as she asked he realized that she was making an effort to talk his talk and he resolved to get away from it and talk hers It was just an accident he said putting his hand to his cheek One night in a calm with a heavy sea running the main boom lift carried away an next the tackle The lift was wire an it was threshin around like a snake The whole watch was tryin to grab it an I rushed in an got swatted Oh she said this time with an accent of comprehension though secretly his speech had been so much Greek to her and she was wondering what a lift was and what swatted meant This man Swineburne he began attempting to put his plan into execution and pronouncing the i long Who Swineburne he repeated with the same mispronunciation The poet Swinburne she corrected Yes that s the chap he stammered his cheeks hot again How long since he died Why I haven t heard that he was dead She looked at him curiously Where did you make his acquaintance I never clapped eyes on him was the reply But I read some of his poetry out of that book there on the table just before you come in How do you like his poetry And thereat she began to talk quickly and easily upon the subject he had suggested He felt better and settled back slightly from the edge of the chair holding tightly to its arms with his hands as if it might get away from him and buck him to the floor He had succeeded in making her talk her talk and while she rattled on he strove to follow her marvelling at all the knowledge that was stowed away in that pretty head of hers and drinking in the pale beauty of her face Follow her he did though bothered by unfamiliar words that fell glibly from her lips and by critical phrases and thought processes that were foreign to his mind but that nevertheless stimulated his mind and set it tingling Here was intellectual life he thought and here was beauty warm and wonderful as he had never dreamed it could be He forgot himself and stared at her with hungry eyes Here was something to live for to win to to fight for ay and die for The books were true There were such women in the world She was one of them She lent wings to his imagination and great luminous canvases spread themselves before him whereon loomed vague gigantic figures of love and romance and of heroic deeds for woman s sake for a pale woman a flower of gold And through the swaying palpitant vision as through a fairy mirage he stared at the real woman sitting there and talking of literature and art He listened as well but he stared unconscious of the fixity of his gaze or of the fact that all that was essentially masculine in his nature was shining in his eyes But she who knew little of the world of men being a woman was keenly aware of his burning eyes She had never had men look at her in such fashion and it embarrassed her She stumbled and halted in her utterance The thread of argument slipped from her He frightened her and at the same time it was strangely pleasant to be so looked upon Her training warned her of peril and of wrong subtle mysterious luring while her instincts rang clarion voiced through her being impelling her to hurdle caste and place and gain to this traveller from another world to this uncouth young fellow with lacerated hands and a line of raw red caused by the unaccustomed linen at his throat who all too evidently was soiled and tainted by ungracious existence She was clean and her cleanness revolted but she was woman and she was just beginning to learn the paradox of woman As I was saying what was I saying She broke off abruptly and laughed merrily at her predicament You was saying that this man Swinburne failed bein a great poet because an that was as far as you got miss he prompted while to himself he seemed suddenly hungry and delicious little thrills crawled up and down his spine at the sound of her laughter Like silver he thought to himself like tinkling silver bells and on the instant and for an instant he was transported to a far land where under pink cherry blossoms he smoked a cigarette and listened to the bells of the peaked pagoda calling straw sandalled devotees to worship Yes thank you she said Swinburne fails when all is said because he is well indelicate There are many of his poems that should never be read Every line of the really great poets is filled with beautiful truth and calls to all that is high and noble in the human Not a line of the great poets can be spared without impoverishing the world by that much I thought it was great he said hesitatingly the little I read I had no idea he was such a a scoundrel I guess that crops out in his other books There are many lines that could be spared from the book you were reading she said her voice primly firm and dogmatic I must a missed em he announced What I read was the real goods It was all lighted up an shining an it shun right into me an lighted me up inside like the sun or a searchlight That s the way it landed on me but I guess I ain t up much on poetry miss He broke off lamely He was confused painfully conscious of his inarticulateness He had felt the bigness and glow of life in what he had read but his speech was inadequate He could not express what he felt and to himself he likened himself to a sailor in a strange ship on a dark night groping about in the unfamiliar running rigging Well he decided it was up to him to get acquainted in this new world He had never seen anything that he couldn t get the hang of when he wanted to and it was about time for him to want to learn to talk the things that were inside of him so that she could understand She was bulking large on his horizon Now Longfellow she was saying Yes I ve read m he broke in impulsively spurred on to exhibit and make the most of his little store of book knowledge desirous of showing her that he was not wholly a stupid clod The Psalm of Life Excelsior an I guess that s all She nodded her head and smiled and he felt somehow that her smile was tolerant pitifully tolerant He was a fool to attempt to make a pretence that way That Longfellow chap most likely had written countless books of poetry Excuse me miss for buttin in that way I guess the real facts is that

none	none	nothin much about such things It ain t in my class But I m goin to make it in my class It sounded like a threat His voice was determined his eyes were flashing the lines of his face had grown harsh And to her it seemed that the angle of his jaw had changed its pitch had become unpleasantly aggressive At the same time a wave of intense virility seemed to surge out from him and impinge upon her I think you could make it in in your class she finished with a laugh You are very strong Her gaze rested for a moment on the muscular neck heavy corded almost bull like bronzed by the sun spilling over with rugged health and strength And though he sat there blushing and humble again she felt drawn to him She was surprised by a wanton thought that rushed into her mind It seemed to her that if she could lay her two hands upon that neck that all its strength and vigor would flow out to her She was shocked by this thought It seemed to reveal to her an undreamed depravity in her nature Besides strength to her was a gross and brutish thing Her ideal of masculine beauty had always been slender gracefulness Yet the thought still persisted It bewildered her that she should desire to place her hands on that sunburned neck In truth she was far from robust and the need of her body and mind was for strength But she did not know it She knew only that no man had ever affected her before as this one had who shocked her from moment to moment with his awful grammar Yes I ain t no invalid he said When it comes down to hard pan I can digest scrap iron But just now I ve got dyspepsia Most of what you was sayin I can t digest Never trained that way you see I like books and poetry and what time I ve had I ve read em but I ve never thought about em the way you have That s why I can t talk about em I m like a navigator adrift on a strange sea without chart or compass Now I want to get my bearin s Mebbe you can put me right How did you learn all this you ve ben talkin By going to school I fancy and by studying she answered I went to school when I was a kid he began to object Yes but I mean high school and lectures and the university You ve gone to the university he demanded in frank amazement He felt that she had become remoter from him by at least a million miles I m going there now I m taking special courses in English He did not know what English meant but he made a mental note of that item of ignorance and passed on How long would I have to study before I could go to the university he asked She beamed encouragement upon his desire for knowledge and said That depends upon how much studying you have already done You have never attended high school Of course not But did you finish grammar school I had two years to run when I left he answered But I was always honorably promoted at school The next moment angry with himself for the boast he had gripped the arms of the chair so savagely that every finger end was stinging At the same moment he became aware that a woman was entering the room He saw the girl leave her chair and trip swiftly across the floor to the newcomer They kissed each other and with arms around each other s waists they advanced toward him That must be her mother he thought She was a tall blond woman slender and stately and beautiful Her gown was what he might expect in such a house His eyes delighted in the graceful lines of it She and her dress together reminded him of women on the stage Then he remembered seeing similar grand ladies and gowns entering the London theatres while he stood and watched and the policemen shoved him back into the drizzle beyond the awning Next his mind leaped to the Grand Hotel at Yokohama where too from the sidewalk he had seen grand ladies Then the city and the harbor of Yokohama in a thousand pictures began flashing before his eyes But he swiftly dismissed the kaleidoscope of memory oppressed by the urgent need of the present He knew that he must stand up to be introduced and he struggled painfully to his feet where he stood with trousers bagging at the knees his arms loose hanging and ludicrous his face set hard for the impending ordeal CHAPTER II The process of getting into the dining room was a nightmare to him Between halts and stumbles jerks and lurches locomotion had at times seemed impossible But at last he had made it and was seated alongside of Her The array of knives and forks frightened him They bristled with unknown perils and he gazed at them fascinated till their dazzle became a background across which moved a succession of forecastle pictures wherein he and his mates sat eating salt beef with sheath knives and fingers or scooping thick pea soup out of pannikins by means of battered iron spoons The stench of bad beef was in his nostrils while in his ears to the accompaniment of creaking timbers and groaning bulkheads echoed the loud mouth noises of the eaters He watched them eating and decided that they ate like pigs Well he would be careful here He would make no noise He would keep his mind upon it all the time He glanced around the table Opposite him was Arthur and Arthur s brother Norman They were her brothers he reminded himself and his heart warmed toward them How they loved each other the members of this family There flashed into his mind the picture of her mother of the kiss of greeting and of the pair of them walking toward him with arms entwined Not in his world were such displays of affection between parents and children made It was a revelation of the heights of existence that were attained in the world above It was the finest thing yet that he had seen in this small glimpse of that world He was moved deeply by appreciation of it and his heart was melting with sympathetic tenderness He had starved for love all his life His nature craved love It was an organic demand of his being Yet he had gone without and hardened himself in the process He had not known that he needed love Nor did he know it now He merely saw it in operation and thrilled to it and thought it fine and high and splendid He was glad that mister Morse was not there It was difficult enough getting acquainted with her and her mother and her brother Norman Arthur he already knew somewhat The father would have been too much for him he felt sure It seemed to him that he had never worked so hard in his life The severest toil was child s play compared with this Tiny nodules of moisture stood out on his forehead and his shirt was wet with sweat from the exertion of doing so many unaccustomed things at once He had to eat as he had never eaten before to handle strange tools to glance surreptitiously about and learn how to accomplish each new thing to receive the flood of impressions that was pouring in upon him and being mentally annotated and classified to be conscious of a yearning for her that perturbed him in the form of a dull aching restlessness to feel the prod of desire to win to the walk in life whereon she trod and to have his mind ever and again straying off in speculation and vague plans of how to reach to her Also when his secret glance went across to Norman opposite him or to any one else to ascertain just what knife or fork was to be used in any particular occasion that person s features were seized upon by his mind which automatically strove to appraise them and to divine what they were all in relation to her Then he had to talk to hear what was said to him and what was said back and forth and to answer when it was necessary with a tongue prone to looseness of speech that required a constant curb And to add confusion to confusion there was the servant an unceasing menace that appeared noiselessly at his shoulder a dire Sphinx that propounded puzzles and conundrums demanding instantaneous solution He was oppressed throughout the meal by the thought of finger bowls Irrelevantly insistently scores of times he wondered when they would come on and what they looked like He had heard of such things and now sooner or later somewhere in the next few minutes he would see them sit at table with exalted beings who used them ay and he would use them himself And most important of all far down and yet always at the surface of his thought was the problem of how he should comport himself toward these persons What should his attitude be He wrestled continually and anxiously with the problem There were cowardly suggestions that he should make believe assume a part and there were still more cowardly suggestions that warned him he would fail in such course that his nature was not fitted to live up to it and that he would make a fool of himself It was during the first part of the dinner struggling to decide upon his attitude that he was very quiet He did not know that his quietness was giving the lie to Arthur s words of the day before when that brother of hers had announced that he was going to bring a wild man home to dinner and for them not to be alarmed because they would find him an interesting wild man Martin Eden could not have found it in him just then to believe that her brother could be guilty of such treachery especially when he had been the means of getting this particular brother out of an unpleasant row So he sat at table perturbed by his own unfitness and at the same time charmed by all that went on about him For the first time he realized that eating was something more than a utilitarian function He was unaware of what he ate It was merely food He was feasting his love of beauty at this table where eating was an aesthetic function It was an intellectual function too His mind was stirred He heard words spoken that were meaningless to him and other words that he had seen only in books and that no man or woman he had known was of large enough mental caliber to pronounce When he heard such words dropping carelessly from the lips of the members of this marvellous family her family he thrilled with delight The romance and beauty and high vigor of the books were coming true He was in that rare and blissful state wherein a man sees his dreams stalk out from the crannies of fantasy and become fact Never had he been at such an altitude of living and he kept himself in the background listening observing and pleasuring replying in reticent monosyllables saying Yes miss and No miss to her and Yes ma am and No ma am to her mother He curbed the impulse arising out of his sea training to say Yes sir and No sir to her brothers He felt that it would be inappropriate and a confession of inferiority on his part which would never do if he was to win to her Also it was a dictate of his pride By God he cried to himself once I m just as good as them and if they do know lots that I don t I could learn m a few myself all the same 
4438_52195_000012_000009	train-clean-360	And the next 
none	none	moment when she or her mother addressed him as mister Eden his aggressive pride was forgotten and he was glowing and warm with delight He was a civilized man that was what he was shoulder to shoulder at dinner with people he had read about in books He was in the books himself adventuring through the printed pages of bound volumes But while he belied Arthur s description and appeared a gentle lamb rather than a wild man he was racking his brains for a course of action He was no gentle lamb and the part of second fiddle would never do for the high pitched dominance of his nature He talked only when he had to and then his speech was like his walk to the table filled with jerks and halts as he groped in his polyglot vocabulary for words debating over words he knew were fit but which he feared he could not pronounce rejecting other words he knew would not be understood or would be raw and harsh But all the time he was oppressed by the consciousness that this carefulness of diction was making a booby of him preventing him from expressing what he had in him Also his love of freedom chafed against the restriction in much the same way his neck chafed against the starched fetter of a collar Besides he was confident that he could not keep it up He was by nature powerful of thought and sensibility and the creative spirit was restive and urgent He was swiftly mastered by the concept or sensation in him that struggled in birth throes to receive expression and form and then he forgot himself and where he was and the old words the tools of speech he knew slipped out Once he declined something from the servant who interrupted and pestered at his shoulder and he said shortly and emphatically Pew On the instant those at the table were keyed up and expectant the servant was smugly pleased and he was wallowing in mortification But he recovered himself quickly It s the Kanaka for finish he explained and it just come out naturally It s spelt p a u He caught her curious and speculative eyes fixed on his hands and being in explanatory mood he said I just come down the Coast on one of the Pacific mail steamers She was behind time an around the Puget Sound ports we worked like niggers storing cargo mixed freight if

none	none	That s how the skin got knocked off Oh it wasn t that she hastened to explain in turn Your hands seemed too small for your body His cheeks were hot He took it as an exposure of another of his deficiencies Yes he said depreciatingly They ain t big enough to stand the strain I can hit like a mule with my arms and shoulders They are too strong an when I smash a man on the jaw the hands get smashed too He was not happy at what he had said He was filled with disgust at himself He had loosed the guard upon his tongue and talked about things that were not nice It was brave of you to help Arthur the way you did and you a stranger she said tactfully aware of his discomfiture though not of the reason for it He in turn realized what she had done and in the consequent warm surge of gratefulness that overwhelmed him forgot his loose worded tongue It wasn t nothin at all he said Any guy ud do it for another That bunch of hoodlums was lookin for trouble an Arthur wasn t botherin em none They butted in on m an then I butted in on them an poked a few That s where some of the skin off my hands went along with some of the teeth of the gang I wouldn t a missed it for anything When I seen He paused open mouthed on the verge of the pit of his own depravity and utter worthlessness to breathe the same air she did And while Arthur took up the tale for the twentieth time of his adventure with the drunken hoodlums on the ferry boat and of how Martin Eden had rushed in and rescued him that individual with frowning brows meditated upon the fool he had made of himself and wrestled more determinedly with the problem of how he should conduct himself toward these people He certainly had not succeeded so far He wasn t of their tribe and he couldn t talk their lingo was the way he put it to himself He couldn t fake being their kind The masquerade would fail and besides masquerade was foreign to his nature There was no room in him for sham or artifice Whatever happened he must be real He couldn t talk their talk just yet though in time he would Upon that he was resolved But in the meantime talk he must and it must be his own talk toned down of course so as to be comprehensible to them and so as not to shook them too much And furthermore he wouldn t claim not even by tacit acceptance to be familiar with anything that was unfamiliar In pursuance of this decision when the two brothers talking university shop had used trig several times Martin Eden demanded What is trig Trignometry Norman said a higher form of math And what is math was the next question which somehow brought the laugh on Norman Mathematics arithmetic was the answer Martin Eden nodded He had caught a glimpse of the apparently illimitable vistas of knowledge What he saw took on tangibility His abnormal power of vision made abstractions take on concrete form In the alchemy of his brain trigonometry and mathematics and the whole field of knowledge which they betokened were transmuted into so much landscape The vistas he saw were vistas of green foliage and forest glades all softly luminous or shot through with flashing lights In the distance detail was veiled and blurred by a purple haze but behind this purple haze he knew was the glamour of the unknown the lure of romance It was like wine to him Here was adventure something to do with head and hand a world to conquer and straightway from the back of his consciousness rushed the thought conquering to win to her that lily pale spirit sitting beside him The glimmering vision was rent asunder and dissipated by Arthur who all evening had been trying to draw his wild man out Martin Eden remembered his decision For the first time he became himself consciously and deliberately at first but soon lost in the joy of creating in making life as he knew it appear before his listeners eyes He had been a member of the crew of the smuggling schooner Halcyon when she was captured by a revenue cutter He saw with wide eyes and he could tell what he saw He brought the pulsing sea before them and the men and the ships upon the sea He communicated his power of vision till they saw with his eyes what he had seen He selected from the vast mass of detail with an artist s touch drawing pictures of life that glowed and burned with light and color injecting movement so that his listeners surged along with him on the flood of rough eloquence enthusiasm and power At times he shocked them with the vividness of the narrative and his terms of speech but beauty always followed fast upon the heels of violence and tragedy was relieved by humor by interpretations of the strange twists and quirks of sailors minds And while he talked the girl looked at him with startled eyes His fire warmed her She wondered if she had been cold all her days She wanted to lean toward this burning blazing man that was like a volcano spouting forth strength robustness and health She felt that she must lean toward him and resisted by an effort Then too there was the counter impulse to shrink away from him She was repelled by those lacerated hands grimed by toil so that the very dirt of life was ingrained in the flesh itself by that red chafe of the collar and those bulging muscles His roughness frightened her each roughness of speech was an insult to her ear each rough phase of his life an insult to her soul And ever and again would come the draw of him till she thought he must be evil to have such power over her All that was most firmly established in her mind was rocking His romance and adventure were battering at the conventions Before his facile perils and ready laugh life was no longer an affair of serious effort and restraint but a toy to be played with and turned topsy turvy carelessly to be lived and pleasured in and carelessly to be flung aside Therefore play was the cry that rang through her Lean toward him if so you will and place your two hands upon his neck She wanted to cry out at the recklessness of the thought and in vain she appraised her own cleanness and culture and balanced all that she was against what he was not She glanced about her and saw the others gazing at him with rapt attention and she would have despaired had not she seen horror in her mother s eyes fascinated horror it was true but none the less horror This man from outer darkness was evil Her mother saw it and her mother was right She would trust her mother s judgment in this as she had always trusted it in all things The fire of him was no longer warm and the fear of him was no longer poignant Later at the piano she played for him and at him aggressively with the vague intent of emphasizing the impassableness of the gulf that separated them Her music was a club that she swung brutally upon his head and though it stunned him and crushed him down it incited him He gazed upon her in awe In his mind as in her own the gulf widened but faster than it widened towered his ambition to win across it But he was too complicated a plexus of sensibilities to sit staring at a gulf a whole evening especially when there was music He was remarkably susceptible to music It was like strong drink firing him to audacities of feeling a drug that laid hold of his imagination and went cloud soaring through the sky It banished sordid fact flooded his mind with beauty loosed romance and to its heels added wings He did not understand the music she played It was different from the dance hall piano banging and blatant brass bands he had heard But he had caught hints of such music from the books and he accepted her playing largely on faith patiently waiting at first for the lifting measures of pronounced and simple rhythm puzzled because those measures were not long continued Just as he caught the swing of them and started his imagination attuned in flight always they vanished away in a chaotic scramble of sounds that was meaningless to him and that dropped his imagination an inert weight back to earth Once it entered his mind that there was a deliberate rebuff in all this He caught her spirit of antagonism and strove to divine the message that her hands pronounced upon the keys Then he dismissed the thought as unworthy and impossible and yielded himself more freely to the music The old delightful condition began to be induced His feet were no longer clay and his flesh became spirit before his eyes and behind his eyes shone a great glory and then the scene before him vanished and he was away rocking over the world that was to him a very dear world The known and the unknown were commingled in the dream pageant that thronged his vision He entered strange ports of sun washed lands and trod market places among barbaric peoples that no man had ever seen The scent of the spice islands was in his nostrils as he had known it on warm breathless nights at sea or he beat up against the southeast trades through long tropic days sinking palm tufted coral islets in the turquoise sea behind and lifting palm tufted coral islets in the turquoise sea ahead Swift as thought the pictures came and went One instant he was astride a broncho and flying through the fairy colored Painted Desert country the next instant he was gazing down through shimmering heat into the whited sepulchre of Death Valley or pulling an oar on a freezing ocean where great ice islands towered and glistened in the sun He lay on a coral beach where the cocoanuts grew down to the mellow sounding surf The hulk of an ancient wreck burned with blue fires in the light of which danced the hula dancers to the barbaric love calls of the singers who chanted to tinkling ukuleles and rumbling tom toms It was a sensuous tropic night In the background a volcano crater was silhouetted against the stars Overhead drifted a pale crescent moon and the Southern Cross burned low in the sky He was a harp all life that he had known and that was his consciousness was the strings and the flood of music was a wind that poured against those strings and set them vibrating with memories and dreams He did not merely feel Sensation invested itself in form and color and radiance and what his imagination dared it objectified in some sublimated and magic way Past present and future mingled and he went on oscillating across the broad warm world through high adventure and noble deeds to Her ay and with her winning her his arm about her and carrying her on in flight through the empery of his mind And she glancing at him across her shoulder saw something of all this in his face It was a transfigured face with great shining eyes that gazed beyond the veil of sound and saw behind it the leap and pulse of life and the gigantic phantoms of the spirit She was startled The raw stumbling lout was gone The ill fitting clothes battered hands and sunburned face remained but these seemed the prison bars through which she saw a great soul looking forth inarticulate and dumb because of those feeble lips that would not give it speech Only for a flashing moment did she see this then she saw the lout returned and she laughed at the whim of her fancy But the impression of that fleeting glimpse lingered and when the time came for him to beat a stumbling retreat and go she lent him the volume of Swinburne and another of Browning she was studying Browning in one of her English courses He seemed such a boy as he stood blushing and stammering his thanks that a wave of pity maternal in its prompting welled up in her She did not remember the lout nor the imprisoned soul nor the man who had stared at her in all masculineness and delighted and frightened her She saw before her only a boy who was shaking her hand with a hand so calloused that it felt like a nutmeg grater and rasped her skin and who was saying jerkily The greatest time of my life You see I ain t used to things He looked about him helplessly To people and houses like this It s all new to me and I like it I hope you ll call again she said as he was saying good night to her brothers He pulled on his cap lurched desperately through the doorway and was gone Well what do you think of him Arthur demanded He is most interesting a whiff of ozone she answered How old is he Twenty almost twenty one I asked him this afternoon I didn t think he was that young And I am three years older was the thought in her mind as she kissed her brothers goodnight CHAPTER III As Martin Eden went down the steps his hand dropped into his coat pocket It came out with a brown rice paper and a pinch of Mexican tobacco which were deftly rolled together into a cigarette He drew the first whiff of smoke deep into his lungs and expelled it in a long and lingering exhalation By God he said aloud in a voice of awe and wonder By God he repeated And yet again he murmured By God Then his hand went to his collar which he ripped out of the shirt and stuffed into his pocket A cold drizzle was falling but he bared his head to it and unbuttoned his vest swinging along in splendid unconcern He was only dimly aware that it was raining He was in an ecstasy dreaming dreams and reconstructing the scenes just past He had met the woman at last the woman that he had thought little about not being given to thinking about women but whom he had expected in a remote way he would sometime meet He had sat next to her at table He had felt her hand in his he had looked into her eyes and caught a vision of a beautiful spirit but no more beautiful than the eyes through which it shone nor than the flesh that gave it expression and form He did not think of her flesh as flesh which was new to him for of the women he had known that was the only way he thought Her flesh was somehow different He did not conceive of her body as a body subject to the ills and frailties of bodies Her body was more than the garb of her spirit It was an emanation of her spirit a pure and gracious crystallization of her divine essence This feeling of the divine startled him It shocked him from his dreams to sober thought No word no clew no hint of the divine had ever reached him before He had never believed in the divine He had always been irreligious scoffing good naturedly at the sky pilots and their immortality of the soul There was no life beyond he had contended it was here and now then darkness everlasting But what he had seen in her eyes was soul immortal soul that could never die No man he had known nor any woman had given him the message of immortality But she had She had whispered it to him the first moment she looked at him Her face shimmered before his eyes as he walked along pale and serious sweet and sensitive smiling with pity and tenderness as only a spirit could smile and pure as he had never dreamed purity could be Her purity smote him like a blow It startled him He had known good and bad but purity as an attribute of existence had never entered his mind And now in her he conceived purity to be the superlative of goodness and of cleanness the sum of which constituted eternal life And promptly urged his ambition to grasp at eternal life He was not fit to carry water for her he knew that it was a miracle of luck and a fantastic stroke that had enabled him to see her and be with her and talk with her that night It was accidental There was no merit in it He did not deserve such fortune His mood was essentially religious He was humble and meek filled with self disparagement and abasement In such frame of mind sinners come to the penitent form He was convicted of sin But as the meek and lowly at the penitent form catch splendid glimpses of their future lordly existence so did he catch similar glimpses of the state he would gain to by possessing her But this possession of her was dim and nebulous and totally different from possession as he had known it Ambition soared on mad wings and he saw himself climbing the heights with her sharing thoughts with her pleasuring in beautiful and noble things with her It was a soul possession he dreamed refined beyond any grossness a free comradeship of spirit that he could not put into definite thought He did not think it For that matter he did not think at all Sensation usurped reason and he was quivering and palpitant with emotions he had never known drifting deliciously on a sea of sensibility where feeling itself was exalted and spiritualized and carried beyond the summits of life He staggered along like a drunken man murmuring fervently aloud By God By God A policeman on a street corner eyed him suspiciously then noted his sailor roll Where did you get it the policeman demanded Martin Eden came back to earth His was a fluid organism swiftly adjustable capable of flowing into and filling all sorts of nooks and crannies With the policeman s hail he was immediately his ordinary self grasping the situation clearly It s a beaut ain t it he laughed back I didn t know I was talkin out loud You ll be singing next was the policeman s diagnosis No I won t Gimme a match an I ll catch the next car home He lighted his cigarette said good night and went on Now wouldn t that rattle you he ejaculated under his breath That copper thought I was drunk He smiled to himself and meditated I guess I was he added but I didn t think a woman s face d do it He caught a Telegraph Avenue car that was going to Berkeley It was crowded with youths and young men who were singing songs and ever and again barking out college yells He studied them curiously They were university boys They went to the same university that she did were in her class socially could know her could see her every day if they wanted to He wondered that they did not want to that they had been out having a good time instead of being with her that evening talking with her sitting around her in a worshipful and adoring circle His thoughts wandered on He noticed one with narrow slitted eyes and a loose lipped mouth That fellow was vicious he decided On shipboard he would be a sneak a whiner a tattler He Martin Eden was a better man than that fellow The thought cheered him It seemed to draw him nearer to Her He began comparing himself with the students He grew conscious of the muscled mechanism of his body and felt confident that he was physically their master But their heads were filled with knowledge that enabled them to talk her talk the thought depressed him But what was a brain for he demanded passionately What they had done he could do They had been studying about life from the books while he had been busy living life His brain was just as full of knowledge as theirs though it was a different kind of knowledge How many of them could tie a lanyard knot or take a wheel or a lookout His life spread out before him in a series of pictures of danger and daring hardship and toil He remembered his failures and scrapes in the process of learning He was that much to the good anyway Later on they would have to begin living life and going through the mill as he had gone Very well While they were busy with that he could be learning the other side of life from the books As the car crossed the zone of scattered dwellings that separated Oakland from Berkeley he kept a lookout for a familiar two story building along the front of which ran the proud sign HIGGINBOTHAM S CASH STORE Martin Eden got off at this corner He stared up for a moment at the sign It carried a message to him beyond its mere wording A personality of smallness and egotism and petty underhandedness seemed to emanate from the letters themselves Bernard Higginbotham had married his sister and he knew him well He let himself in with a latch key and climbed the stairs to the second floor Here lived his brother in law The grocery was below There was a smell of stale vegetables in the air As he groped his way across the hall he stumbled over a toy cart left there by one of his numerous nephews and nieces and brought up against a door with a resounding bang The pincher was his thought too miserly to burn two cents worth of gas and save his boarders necks He fumbled for the knob and entered a lighted room where sat his sister and Bernard Higginbotham She was patching a pair of his trousers while his lean body was distributed over two chairs his feet dangling in dilapidated carpet slippers over the edge of the second chair He glanced across the top of the paper he was reading showing a pair of dark insincere sharp staring eyes Martin Eden never looked at him without experiencing a sense of repulsion What his sister had seen in the man was beyond him The other affected him as so much vermin and always aroused in him an impulse to crush him under his foot Some day I ll beat the face off of him was the way he often consoled himself for enduring the man s existence The eyes weasel like and cruel were looking at him complainingly Well Martin demanded Out with it I had that door painted only last week mister Higginbotham half whined half bullied and you know what union wages are You should be more careful Martin had intended to reply but he was struck by the hopelessness of it He gazed across the monstrous sordidness of soul to a chromo on the wall It surprised him He had always liked it but it seemed that now he was seeing it for the first time It was cheap that was what it was like everything else in this house His mind went back to the house he had just left and he saw first the paintings and next Her looking at him with melting sweetness as she shook his hand at leaving He forgot where he was and Bernard Higginbotham s existence till that gentleman demanded Seen a ghost Martin came back and looked at the beady eyes sneering truculent cowardly and there leaped into his vision as on a screen the same eyes when their owner was making a sale in the store below subservient eyes smug and oily and flattering Yes Martin answered I seen a ghost Good night Good night Gertrude He started to leave the room tripping over a loose seam in the slatternly carpet Don t bang the door mister Higginbotham cautioned him He felt the blood crawl in his veins but controlled himself and closed the door softly behind him mister Higginbotham looked at his wife exultantly He s ben drinkin he proclaimed in a hoarse whisper I told you he would She nodded her head resignedly His eyes was pretty shiny she confessed and he didn t have no collar though he went away with one But mebbe he didn t have more n a couple of glasses He couldn t stand up straight asserted her husband I watched him He couldn t walk across the floor without stumblin You heard m yourself almost fall down in the hall I think it was over Alice s cart she said He couldn t see it in the dark mister Higginbotham s voice and wrath began to rise All day he effaced himself in the store reserving for the evening with his family the privilege of being himself I tell you that precious brother of yours was drunk His voice was cold sharp and final his lips stamping the enunciation of each word like the die of a machine His wife sighed and remained silent She was a large stout woman always dressed slatternly and always tired from the burdens of her flesh her work and her husband He s got it in him I tell you from his father mister Higginbotham went on accusingly An he ll croak in the gutter the same way You know that She nodded sighed and went on stitching They were agreed that Martin had come home drunk They did not have it in their souls to know beauty or they would have known that those shining eyes and that glowing face betokened youth s first vision of love Settin a fine example to the children mister Higginbotham snorted suddenly in the silence for which his wife was responsible and which he resented Sometimes he almost wished she would oppose him more If he does it again he s got to get out Understand I won t put up with his shinanigan debotchin innocent children with his boozing mister Higginbotham liked the word which was a new one in his vocabulary recently gleaned from a newspaper column That s what it is debotchin there ain t no other name for it Still his wife sighed shook her head sorrowfully and stitched on mister Higginbotham resumed the newspaper Has he paid last week s board he shot across the top of the newspaper She nodded then added He still has some money When is he goin to sea again When his pay day s spent I guess she answered He was over to San Francisco yesterday looking for a ship But he s got money yet an he s particular about the kind of ship he signs for It s not for a deck swab like him to put on airs mister Higginbotham snorted Particular Him He said something about a schooner that s gettin ready to go off to some outlandish place to look for buried treasure that he d sail on her if his money held out If he only wanted to steady down I d give him a job drivin the wagon her husband said but with no trace of benevolence in his voice Tom s quit His wife looked alarm and interrogation Quit to night Is goin to work for Carruthers They paid m more n I could afford I told you you d lose m she cried out He was worth more n you was giving him Now look here old woman Higginbotham bullied for the thousandth time I ve told you to keep your nose out of the business I won t tell you again I don t care she sniffled Tom was a good boy Her husband glared at her This was unqualified defiance If that brother of yours was worth his salt he could take the wagon he snorted He pays his board just the same was the retort An he s my brother an so long as he don t owe you money you ve got no right to be jumping on him all the time I ve got some feelings if I have been married to you for seven years Did you tell m you d charge him for gas if he goes on readin in bed he demanded missus Higginbotham made no reply Her revolt faded away her spirit wilting down into her tired flesh Her husband was triumphant He had her His eyes snapped vindictively while his ears joyed in the sniffles she emitted He extracted great happiness from squelching her and she squelched easily these days though it had been different in the first years of their married life before the brood of children and his incessant nagging had sapped her energy Well you tell m to morrow that s all he said An I just want to tell you before I forget it that you d better send for Marian to morrow to take care of the children With Tom quit I ll have to be out on the wagon an you can make up your mind to it to be down below waitin on the counter But to morrow s wash day she objected weakly Get up early then an do it first I won t start out till ten o clock He crinkled the paper viciously and resumed his reading CHAPTER IV Martin Eden with blood still crawling from contact with his brother in law felt his way along the unlighted back hall and entered his room a tiny cubbyhole with space for a bed a wash stand and one chair mister Higginbotham was too thrifty to keep a servant when his wife could do the work Besides the servant s room enabled them to take in two boarders instead of one Martin placed the Swinburne and Browning on the chair took off his coat and sat down on the bed A screeching of asthmatic springs greeted the weight of his body but he did not notice them He started to take off his shoes but fell to staring at the white plaster wall opposite him broken by long streaks of dirty brown where rain had leaked through the roof On this befouled background visions began to flow and burn He forgot his shoes and stared long till his lips began to move and he murmured Ruth Ruth He had not thought a simple sound could be so beautiful It delighted his ear and he grew intoxicated with the repetition of it Ruth It was a talisman a magic word to conjure with Each time he murmured it her face shimmered before him suffusing the foul wall with a golden radiance This radiance did not stop at the wall It extended on into infinity and through its golden depths his soul went questing after hers The best that was in him was out in splendid flood The very thought of her ennobled and purified him made him better and made him want to be better This was new to him He had never known women who had made him better They had always had the counter effect of making him beastly He did not know that many of them had done their best bad as it was Never having been conscious of himself he did not know that he had that in his being that drew love from women and which had been the cause of their reaching out for his youth Though they had often bothered him he had never bothered about them and he would never have dreamed that there were women who had been better because of him Always in sublime carelessness had he lived till now and now it seemed to him that they had always reached out and dragged at him with vile hands This was not just to them nor to himself But he who for the first time was becoming conscious of himself was in no condition to judge and he burned with shame as he stared at the vision of his infamy He got up abruptly and tried to see himself in the dirty looking glass over the wash stand He passed a towel over it and looked again long and carefully It was the first time he had ever really seen himself His eyes were made for seeing but up to that moment they had been filled with the ever changing panorama of the world at which he had been too busy gazing ever to gaze at himself He saw the head and face of a young fellow of twenty but being unused to such appraisement he did not know how to value it Above a square domed forehead he saw a mop of brown hair nut brown with a wave to it and hints of curls that were a delight to any woman making hands tingle to stroke it and fingers tingle to pass caresses through it But he passed it by as without merit in Her eyes and dwelt long and thoughtfully on the high square forehead striving to penetrate it and learn the quality of its content What kind of a brain lay behind there was his insistent interrogation What was it capable of How far would it take him Would it take him to her He wondered if there was soul in those steel gray eyes that were often quite blue of color and that were strong with the briny airs of the sun washed deep He wondered also how his eyes looked to her He tried to imagine himself she gazing into those eyes of his but failed in the jugglery He could successfully put himself inside other men s minds but they had to be men whose ways of life he knew He did not know her way of life She was wonder and mystery and how could he guess one thought of hers Well they were honest eyes he concluded and in them was neither smallness nor meanness The brown sunburn of his face surprised him He had not dreamed he was so black He rolled up his shirt sleeve and compared the white underside if the arm with his face Yes he was a white man after all But the arms were sunburned too He twisted his arm rolled the biceps over with his other hand and gazed underneath where he was least touched by the sun It was very white He laughed at his bronzed face in the glass at the thought that it was once as white as the underside of his arm nor did he dream that in the world there were few pale spirits of women who could boast fairer or smoother skins than he fairer than where he had escaped the ravages of the sun His might have been a cherub s mouth had not the full sensuous lips a trick under stress of drawing firmly across the teeth At times so tightly did they draw the mouth became stern and harsh even ascetic They were the lips of a fighter and of a lover They could taste the sweetness of life with relish and they could put the sweetness aside and command life The chin and jaw strong and just hinting of square aggressiveness helped the lips to command life Strength balanced sensuousness and had upon it a tonic effect compelling him to love beauty that was healthy and making him vibrate to sensations that were wholesome And between the lips were teeth that had never known nor needed the dentist s care They were white and strong and regular he decided as he looked at them But as he looked he began to be troubled Somewhere stored away in the recesses of his mind and vaguely remembered was the impression that there were people who washed their teeth every day They were the people from up above people in her class She must wash her teeth every day too What would she think if she learned that he had never washed his teeth in all the days of his life He resolved to get a tooth brush and form the habit He would begin at once to morrow It was not by mere achievement that he could hope to win to her He must make a personal reform in all things even to tooth washing and neck gear though a starched collar affected him as a renunciation of freedom He held up his hand rubbing the ball of the thumb over the calloused palm and gazing at the dirt that was ingrained in the flesh itself and which no brush could scrub away How different was her palm He thrilled deliciously at the remembrance Like a rose petal he thought cool and soft as a snowflake He had never thought that a mere woman s hand could be so sweetly soft He caught himself imagining the wonder of a caress from such a hand and flushed guiltily It was too gross a thought for her In ways it seemed to impugn her high spirituality She was a pale slender spirit exalted far beyond the flesh but nevertheless the softness of her palm persisted in his thoughts He was used to the harsh callousness of factory girls and working women Well he knew why their hands were rough but this hand of hers It was soft because she had never used it to work with The gulf yawned between her and him at the awesome thought of a person who did not have to work for a living He suddenly saw the aristocracy of the people who did not labor It towered before him on the wall a figure in brass arrogant and powerful He had worked himself his first memories seemed connected with work and all his family had worked There was Gertrude When her hands were not hard from the endless housework they were swollen and red like boiled beef what of the washing And there was his sister Marian She had worked in the cannery the preceding summer and her slim pretty hands were all scarred with the tomato knives Besides the tips of two of her fingers had been left in the cutting machine at the paper box factory the preceding winter He remembered the hard palms of his mother as she lay in her coffin And his father had worked to the last fading gasp the horned growth on his hands must have been half an inch thick when he died But Her hands were soft and her mother s hands and her brothers This last came to him as a surprise it was tremendously indicative of the highness of their caste of the enormous distance that stretched between her and him He sat back on the bed with a bitter laugh and finished taking off his shoes He was a fool he had been made drunken by a woman s face and by a woman s soft white hands And then suddenly before his eyes on the foul plaster wall appeared a vision He stood in front of a gloomy tenement house It was night time in the East End of London and before him stood Margey a little factory girl of fifteen He had seen her home after the bean feast She lived in that gloomy tenement a place not fit for swine His hand was going out to hers as he said good night She had put her lips up to be kissed but he wasn t going to kiss her Somehow he was afraid of her And then her hand closed on his and pressed feverishly He felt her callouses grind and grate on his and a great wave of pity welled over him He saw her yearning hungry eyes and her ill fed female form which had been rushed from childhood into a frightened and ferocious maturity then he put his arms about her in large tolerance and stooped and kissed her on the lips Her glad little cry rang in his ears and he felt her clinging to him like a cat Poor little starveling He continued to stare at the vision of what had happened in the long ago His flesh was crawling as it had crawled that night when she clung to him and his heart was warm with pity It was a gray scene greasy gray and the rain drizzled greasily on the pavement stones And then a radiant glory shone on the wall and up through the other vision displacing it glimmered Her pale face under its crown of golden hair remote and inaccessible as a star He took the Browning and the Swinburne from the chair and kissed them Just the same she told me to call again he thought He took another look at himself in the glass and said aloud with great solemnity Martin Eden the first thing to morrow you go to the free library an read up on etiquette Understand He turned off the gas and the springs shrieked under his body But you ve got to quit cussin Martin old boy you ve got to quit cussin he said aloud Then he dozed off to sleep and to dream dreams that for madness and audacity rivalled those of poppy eaters CHAPTER V He awoke next morning from rosy scenes of dream to a steamy atmosphere that smelled of soapsuds and dirty clothes and that was vibrant with the jar and jangle of tormented life As he came out of his room he heard the slosh of water a sharp exclamation and a resounding smack as his sister visited her irritation upon one of her numerous progeny The squall of the child went through him like a knife He was aware that the whole thing the very air he breathed was repulsive and mean How different he thought from the atmosphere of beauty and repose of the house wherein Ruth dwelt There it was all spiritual Here it was all material and meanly material Come here Alfred he called to the crying child at the same time thrusting his hand into his trousers pocket where he carried his money loose in the same large way that he lived life in general He put a quarter in the youngster s hand and held him in his arms a moment soothing his sobs Now run along and get some candy and don t forget to give some to your brothers and sisters Be sure and get the kind that lasts longest His sister lifted a flushed face from the wash tub and looked at him A nickel d ha ben enough she said It s just like you no idea of the value of money The child ll eat himself sick That s all right sis he answered jovially My money ll take care of itself If you weren t so busy I d kiss you good morning He wanted to be affectionate to this sister who was good and who in her way he knew loved him But somehow she grew less herself as the years went by and more and more baffling It was the hard work the many children and the nagging of her husband he decided that had changed her It came to him in a flash of fancy that her nature seemed taking on the attributes of stale vegetables smelly soapsuds and of the greasy dimes nickels and quarters she took in over the counter of the store Go along an get your breakfast she said roughly though secretly pleased Of all her wandering brood of brothers he had always been her favorite I declare I will kiss you she said with a sudden stir at her heart With thumb and forefinger she swept the dripping suds first from one arm and then from the other He put his arms round her massive waist and kissed her wet steamy lips The tears welled into her eyes not so much from strength of feeling as from the weakness of chronic overwork She shoved him away from her but not before he caught a glimpse of her moist eyes You ll find breakfast in the oven she said hurriedly Jim ought to be up now I had to get up early for the washing Now get along with you and get out of the house early It won t be nice to day what of Tom quittin an nobody but Bernard to drive the wagon Martin went into the kitchen with a sinking heart the image of her red face and slatternly form eating its way like acid into his brain She might love him if she only had some time he concluded But she was worked to death Bernard Higginbotham was a brute to work her so hard But he could not help but feel on the other hand that there had not been anything beautiful in that kiss It was true it was an unusual kiss For years she had kissed him only when he returned from voyages or departed on voyages But this kiss had tasted soapsuds and the lips he had noticed were flabby There had been no quick vigorous lip pressure such as should accompany any kiss Hers was the kiss of a tired woman who had been tired so long that she had forgotten how to kiss He remembered her as a girl before her marriage when she would dance with the best all night after a hard day s work at the laundry and think nothing of leaving the dance to go to another day s hard work And then he thought of Ruth and the cool sweetness that must reside in her lips as it resided in all about her Her kiss would be like her hand shake or the way she looked at one firm and frank In imagination he dared to think of her lips on his and so vividly did he imagine that he went dizzy at the thought and seemed to rift through clouds of rose petals filling his brain with their perfume In the kitchen he found Jim the other boarder eating mush very languidly with a sick far away look in his eyes Jim was a plumber s apprentice whose weak chin and hedonistic temperament coupled with a certain nervous stupidity promised to take him nowhere in the race for bread and butter Why don t you eat he demanded as Martin dipped dolefully into the cold half cooked oatmeal mush Was you drunk again last night Martin shook his head He was oppressed by the utter squalidness of it all Ruth Morse seemed farther removed than ever I was Jim went on with a boastful nervous giggle I was loaded right to the neck Oh she was a daisy Billy brought me home Martin nodded that he heard it was a habit of nature with him to pay heed to whoever talked to him and poured a cup of lukewarm coffee Goin to the Lotus Club dance to night Jim demanded They re goin to have beer an if that Temescal bunch comes there ll be a rough house I don t care though I m takin my lady friend just the same Cripes but I ve got a taste in my mouth He made a wry face and attempted to wash the taste away with coffee D ye know Julia Martin shook his head She s my lady friend Jim explained and she s a peach I d introduce you to her only you d win her I don t see what the girls see in you honest I don t but the way you win them away from the fellers is sickenin I never got any away from you Martin answered uninterestedly The breakfast had to be got through somehow Yes you did too the other asserted warmly There was Maggie Never had anything to do with her Never danced with her except that one night Yes an that s just what did it Jim cried out You just danced with her an looked at her an it was all off Of course you didn t mean nothin by it but it settled me for keeps Wouldn t

none	none	again Always askin about you She d have made fast dates enough with you if you d wanted to But I didn t want to Wasn t necessary I was left at the pole Jim looked at him admiringly How d ye do it anyway Mart By not carin about em was the answer You mean makin b lieve you don t care about them Jim queried eagerly Martin considered for a moment then answered Perhaps that will do but with me I guess it s different I never have cared much If you can put it on it s all right most likely You should a ben up at Riley s barn last night Jim announced inconsequently A lot of the fellers put on the gloves There was a peach from West Oakland They called m The Rat Slick as silk No one could touch m We was all wishin you was there Where was you anyway Down in Oakland Martin replied To the show Martin shoved his plate away and got up Comin to the dance to night the other called after him No I think not he answered He went downstairs and out into the street breathing great breaths of air He had been suffocating in that atmosphere while the apprentice s chatter had driven him frantic There had been times when it was all he could do to refrain from reaching over and mopping Jim s face in the mush plate The more he had chattered the more remote had Ruth seemed to him How could he herding with such cattle ever become worthy of her He was appalled at the problem confronting him weighted down by the incubus of his working class station Everything reached out to hold him down his sister his sister s house and family Jim the apprentice everybody he knew every tie of life Existence did not taste good in his mouth Up to then he had accepted existence as he had lived it with all about him as a good thing He had never questioned it except when he read books but then they were only books fairy stories of a fairer and impossible world But now he had seen that world possible and real with a flower of a woman called Ruth in the midmost centre of it and thenceforth he must know bitter tastes and longings sharp as pain and hopelessness that tantalized because it fed on hope He had debated between the Berkeley Free Library and the Oakland Free Library and decided upon the latter because Ruth lived in Oakland Who could tell a library was a most likely place for her and he might see her there He did not know the way of libraries and he wandered through endless rows of fiction till the delicate featured French looking girl who seemed in charge told him that the reference department was upstairs He did not know enough to ask the man at the desk and began his adventures in the philosophy alcove He had heard of book philosophy but had not imagined there had been so much written about it The high bulging shelves of heavy tomes humbled him and at the same time stimulated him Here was work for the vigor of his brain He found books on trigonometry in the mathematics section and ran the pages and stared at the meaningless formulas and figures He could read English but he saw there an alien speech Norman and Arthur knew that speech He had heard them talking it And they were her brothers He left the alcove in despair From every side the books seemed to press upon him and crush him He had never dreamed that the fund of human knowledge bulked so big He was frightened How could his brain ever master it all Later he remembered that there were other men many men who had mastered it and he breathed a great oath passionately under his breath swearing that his brain could do what theirs had done And so he wandered on alternating between depression and elation as he stared at the shelves packed with wisdom In one miscellaneous section he came upon a Norrie s Epitome He turned the pages reverently In a way it spoke a kindred speech Both he and it were of the sea Then he found a Bowditch and books by Lecky and Marshall There it was he would teach himself navigation He would quit drinking work up and become a captain Ruth seemed very near to him in that moment As a captain he could marry her if she would have him And if she wouldn t well he would live a good life among men because of Her and he would quit drinking anyway Then he remembered the underwriters and the owners the two masters a captain must serve either of which could and would break him and whose interests were diametrically opposed He cast his eyes about the room and closed the lids down on a vision of ten thousand books No no more of the sea for him There was power in all that wealth of books and if he would do great things he must do them on the land Besides captains were not allowed to take their wives to sea with them Noon came and afternoon He forgot to eat and sought on for the books on etiquette for in addition to career his mind was vexed by a simple and very concrete problem When you meet a young lady and she asks you to call how soon can you call was the way he worded it to himself But when he found the right shelf he sought vainly for the answer He was appalled at the vast edifice of etiquette and lost himself in the mazes of visiting card conduct between persons in polite society He abandoned his search He had not found what he wanted though he had found that it would take all of a man s time to be polite and that he would have to live a preliminary life in which to learn how to be polite Did you find what you wanted the man at the desk asked him as he was leaving Yes sir he answered You have a fine library here The man nodded We should be glad to see you here often Are you a sailor Yes sir he answered And I ll come again Now how did he know that he asked himself as he went down the stairs And for the first block along the street he walked very stiff and straight and awkwardly until he forgot himself in his thoughts whereupon his rolling gait gracefully returned to him CHAPTER VI A terrible restlessness that was akin to hunger afflicted Martin Eden He was famished for a sight of the girl whose slender hands had gripped his life with a giant s grasp He could not steel himself to call upon her He was afraid that he might call too soon and so be guilty of an awful breach of that awful thing called etiquette He spent long hours in the Oakland and Berkeley libraries and made out application blanks for membership for himself his sisters Gertrude and Marian and Jim the latter s consent being obtained at the expense of several glasses of beer With four cards permitting him to draw books he burned the gas late in the servant s room and was charged fifty cents a week for it by mister Higginbotham The many books he read but served to whet his unrest Every page of every book was a peep hole into the realm of knowledge His hunger fed upon what he read and increased Also he did not know where to begin and continually suffered from lack of preparation The commonest references that he could see plainly every reader was expected to know he did not know And the same was true of the poetry he read which maddened him with delight He read more of Swinburne than was contained in the volume Ruth had lent him and Dolores he understood thoroughly But surely Ruth did not understand it he concluded How could she living the refined life she did Then he chanced upon Kipling s poems and was swept away by the lilt and swing and glamour with which familiar things had been invested He was amazed at the man s sympathy with life and at his incisive psychology Psychology was a new word in Martin s vocabulary He had bought a dictionary which deed had decreased his supply of money and brought nearer the day on which he must sail in search of more Also it incensed mister Higginbotham who would have preferred the money taking the form of board He dared not go near Ruth s neighborhood in the daytime but night found him lurking like a thief around the Morse home stealing glimpses at the windows and loving the very walls that sheltered her Several times he barely escaped being caught by her brothers and once he trailed mister Morse down town and studied his face in the lighted streets longing all the while for some quick danger of death to threaten so that he might spring in and save her father On another night his vigil was rewarded by a glimpse of Ruth through a second story window He saw only her head and shoulders and her arms raised as she fixed her hair before a mirror It was only for a moment but it was a long moment to him during which his blood turned to wine and sang through his veins Then she pulled down the shade But it was her room he had learned that and thereafter he strayed there often hiding under a dark tree on the opposite side of the street and smoking countless cigarettes One afternoon he saw her mother coming out of a bank and received another proof of the enormous distance that separated Ruth from him She was of the class that dealt with banks He had never been inside a bank in his life and he had an idea that such institutions were frequented only by the very rich and the very powerful In one way he had undergone a moral revolution Her cleanness and purity had reacted upon him and he felt in his being a crying need to be clean He must be that if he were ever to be worthy of breathing the same air with her He washed his teeth and scrubbed his hands with a kitchen scrub brush till he saw a nail brush in a drug store window and divined its use While purchasing it the clerk glanced at his nails suggested a nail file and so he became possessed of an additional toilet tool He ran across a book in the library on the care of the body and promptly developed a penchant for a cold water bath every morning much to the amazement of Jim and to the bewilderment of mister Higginbotham who was not in sympathy with such high fangled notions and who seriously debated whether or not he should charge Martin extra for the water Another stride was in the direction of creased trousers Now that Martin was aroused in such matters he swiftly noted the difference between the baggy knees of the trousers worn by the working class and the straight line from knee to foot of those worn by the men above the working class Also he learned the reason why and invaded his sister s kitchen in search of irons and ironing board He had misadventures at first hopelessly burning one pair and buying another which expenditure again brought nearer the day on which he must put to sea But the reform went deeper than mere outward appearance He still smoked but he drank no more Up to that time drinking had seemed to him the proper thing for men to do and he had prided himself on his strong head which enabled him to drink most men under the table Whenever he encountered a chance shipmate and there were many in San Francisco he treated them and was treated in turn as of old but he ordered for himself root beer or ginger ale and good naturedly endured their chaffing And as they waxed maudlin he studied them watching the beast rise and master them and thanking God that he was no longer as they They had their limitations to forget and when they were drunk their dim stupid spirits were even as gods and each ruled in his heaven of intoxicated desire With Martin the need for strong drink had vanished He was drunken in new and more profound ways with Ruth who had fired him with love and with a glimpse of higher and eternal life with books that had set a myriad maggots of desire gnawing in his brain and with the sense of personal cleanliness he was achieving that gave him even more superb health than what he had enjoyed and that made his whole body sing with physical well being One night he went to the theatre on the blind chance that he might see her there and from the second balcony he did see her He saw her come down the aisle with Arthur and a strange young man with a football mop of hair and eyeglasses the sight of whom spurred him to instant apprehension and jealousy He saw her take her seat in the orchestra circle and little else than her did he see that night a pair of slender white shoulders and a mass of pale gold hair dim with distance But there were others who saw and now and again glancing at those about him he noted two young girls who looked back from the row in front a dozen seats along and who smiled at him with bold eyes He had always been easy going It was not in his nature to give rebuff In the old days he would have smiled back and gone further and encouraged smiling But now it was different He did smile back then looked away and looked no more deliberately But several times forgetting the existence of the two girls his eyes caught their smiles He could not re thumb himself in a day nor could he violate the intrinsic kindliness of his nature so at such moments he smiled at the girls in warm human friendliness It was nothing new to him He knew they were reaching out their woman s hands to him But it was different now Far down there in the orchestra circle was the one woman in all the world so different so terrifically different from these two girls of his class that he could feel for them only pity and sorrow He had it in his heart to wish that they could possess in some small measure her goodness and glory And not for the world could he hurt them because of their outreaching He was not flattered by it he even felt a slight shame at his lowliness that permitted it He knew did he belong in Ruth s class that there would be no overtures from these girls and with each glance of theirs he felt the fingers of his own class clutching at him to hold him down He left his seat before the curtain went down on the last act intent on seeing Her as she passed out There were always numbers of men who stood on the sidewalk outside and he could pull his cap down over his eyes and screen himself behind some one s shoulder so that she should not see him He emerged from the theatre with the first of the crowd but scarcely had he taken his position on the edge of the sidewalk when the two girls appeared They were looking for him he knew and for the moment he could have cursed that in him which drew women Their casual edging across the sidewalk to the curb as they drew near apprised him of discovery They slowed down and were in the thick of the crown as they came up with him One of them brushed against him and apparently for the first time noticed him She was a slender dark girl with black defiant eyes But they smiled at him and he smiled back Hello he said It was automatic he had said it so often before under similar circumstances of first meetings Besides he could do no less There was that large tolerance and sympathy in his nature that would permit him to do no less The black eyed girl smiled gratification and greeting and showed signs of stopping while her companion arm linked in arm giggled and likewise showed signs of halting He thought quickly It would never do for Her to come out and see him talking there with them Quite naturally as a matter of course he swung in along side the dark eyed one and walked with her There was no awkwardness on his part no numb tongue He was at home here and he held his own royally in the badinage bristling with slang and sharpness that was always the preliminary to getting acquainted in these swift moving affairs At the corner where the main stream of people flowed onward he started to edge out into the cross street But the girl with the black eyes caught his arm following him and dragging her companion after her as she cried Hold on Bill What s yer rush You re not goin to shake us so sudden as all that He halted with a laugh and turned facing them Across their shoulders he could see the moving throng passing under the street lamps Where he stood it was not so light and unseen he would be able to see Her as she passed by She would certainly pass by for that way led home What s her name he asked of the giggling girl nodding at the dark eyed one You ask her was the convulsed response Well what is it he demanded turning squarely on the girl in question You ain t told me yours yet she retorted You never asked it he smiled Besides you guessed the first rattle It s Bill all right all right Aw go long with you She looked him in the eyes her own sharply passionate and inviting What is it honest Again she looked All the centuries of woman since sex began were eloquent in her eyes And he measured her in a careless way and knew bold now that she would begin to retreat coyly and delicately as he pursued ever ready to reverse the game should he turn fainthearted And too he was human and could feel the draw of her while his ego could not but appreciate the flattery of her kindness Oh he knew it all and knew them well from A to Z Good as goodness might be measured in their particular class hard working for meagre wages and scorning the sale of self for easier ways nervously desirous for some small pinch of happiness in the desert of existence and facing a future that was a gamble between the ugliness of unending toil and the black pit of more terrible wretchedness the way whereto being briefer though better paid Bill he answered nodding his head Sure Pete Bill an no other No joshin she queried It ain t Bill at all the other broke in How do you know he demanded You never laid eyes on me before No need to to know you re lyin was the retort Straight Bill what is it the first girl asked Bill ll do he confessed She reached out to his arm and shook him playfully I knew you was lyin but you look good to me just the same He captured the hand that invited and felt on the palm familiar markings and distortions When d you chuck the cannery he asked How d yeh know and My ain t cheh a mind reader the girls chorussed And while he exchanged the stupidities of stupid minds with them before his inner sight towered the book shelves of the library filled with the wisdom of the ages He smiled bitterly at the incongruity of it and was assailed by doubts But between inner vision and outward pleasantry he found time to watch the theatre crowd streaming by And then he saw Her under the lights between her brother and the strange young man with glasses and his heart seemed to stand still He had waited long for this moment He had time to note the light fluffy something that hid her queenly head the tasteful lines of her wrapped figure the gracefulness of her carriage and of the hand that caught up her skirts and then she was gone and he was left staring at the two girls of the cannery at their tawdry attempts at prettiness of dress their tragic efforts to be clean and trim the cheap cloth the cheap ribbons and the cheap rings on the fingers He felt a tug at his arm and heard a voice saying Wake up Bill What s the matter with you What was you sayin he asked Oh nothin the dark girl answered with a toss of her head I was only remarkin What Well I was whisperin it d be a good idea if you could dig up a gentleman friend for her indicating her companion and then we could go off an have ice cream soda somewhere or coffee or anything He was afflicted by a sudden spiritual nausea The transition from Ruth to this had been too abrupt Ranged side by side with the bold defiant eyes of the girl before him he saw Ruth s clear luminous eyes like a saint s gazing at him out of unplumbed depths of purity And somehow he felt within him a stir of power He was better than this Life meant more to him than it meant to these two girls whose thoughts did not go beyond ice cream and a gentleman friend He remembered that he had led always a secret life in his thoughts These thoughts he had tried to share but never had he found a woman capable of understanding nor a man He had tried at times but had only puzzled his listeners And as his thoughts had been beyond them so he argued now he must be beyond them He felt power move in him and clenched his fists If life meant more to him then it was for him to demand more from life but he could not demand it from such companionship as this Those bold black eyes had nothing to offer He knew the thoughts behind them of ice cream and of something else But those saint s eyes alongside they offered all he knew and more than he could guess They offered books and painting beauty and repose and all the fine elegance of higher existence Behind those black eyes he knew every thought process It was like clockwork He could watch every wheel go around Their bid was low pleasure narrow as the grave that palled and the grave was at the end of it But the bid of the saint s eyes was mystery and wonder unthinkable and eternal life He had caught glimpses of the soul in them and glimpses of his own soul too There s only one thing wrong with the programme he said aloud I ve got a date already The girl s eyes blazed her disappointment To sit up with a sick friend I suppose she sneered No a real honest date with he faltered with a girl You re not stringin me she asked earnestly He looked her in the eyes and answered It s straight all right But why can t we meet some other time You ain t told me your name yet An where d ye live Lizzie she replied softening toward him her hand pressing his arm while her body leaned against his Lizzie Connolly And I live at Fifth an Market He talked on a few minutes before saying good night He did not go home immediately and under the tree where he kept his vigils he looked up at a window and murmured That date was with you Ruth I kept it for you CHAPTER VII A week of heavy reading had passed since the evening he first met Ruth Morse and still he dared not call Time and again he nerved himself up to call but under the doubts that assailed him his determination died away He did not know the proper time to call nor was there any one to tell him and he was afraid of committing himself to an irretrievable blunder Having shaken himself free from his old companions and old ways of life and having no new companions nothing remained for him but to read and the long hours he devoted to it would have ruined a dozen pairs of ordinary eyes But his eyes were strong and they were backed by a body superbly strong Furthermore his mind was fallow It had lain fallow all his life so far as the abstract thought of the books was concerned and it was ripe for the sowing It had never been jaded by study and it bit hold of the knowledge in the books with sharp teeth that would not let go It seemed to him by the end of the week that he had lived centuries so far behind were the old life and outlook But he was baffled by lack of preparation He attempted to read books that required years of preliminary specialization One day he would read a book of antiquated philosophy and the next day one that was ultra modern so that his head would be whirling with the conflict and contradiction of ideas It was the same with the economists On the one shelf at the library he found Karl Marx Ricardo Adam Smith and Mill and the abstruse formulas of the one gave no clew that the ideas of another were obsolete He was bewildered and yet he wanted to know He had become interested in a day in economics industry and politics Passing through the City Hall Park he had noticed a group of men in the centre of which were half a dozen with flushed faces and raised voices earnestly carrying on a discussion He joined the listeners and heard a new alien tongue in the mouths of the philosophers of the people One was a tramp another was a labor agitator a third was a law school student and the remainder was composed of wordy workingmen For the first time he heard of socialism anarchism and single tax and learned that there were warring social philosophies He heard hundreds of technical words that were new to him belonging to fields of thought that his meagre reading had never touched upon Because of this he could not follow the arguments closely and he could only guess at and surmise the ideas wrapped up in such strange expressions Then there was a black eyed restaurant waiter who was a theosophist a union baker who was an agnostic an old man who baffled all of them with the strange philosophy that what is is right and another old man who discoursed interminably about the cosmos and the father atom and the mother atom Martin Eden s head was in a state of addlement when he went away after several hours and he hurried to the library to look up the definitions of a dozen unusual words And when he left the library he carried under his arm four volumes Madam Blavatsky s Secret Doctrine Progress and Poverty The Quintessence of Socialism and Warfare of Religion and Science Unfortunately he began on the Secret Doctrine Every line bristled with many syllabled words he did not understand He sat up in bed and the dictionary was in front of him more often than the book He looked up so many new words that when they recurred he had forgotten their meaning and had to look them up again He devised the plan of writing the definitions in a note book and filled page after page with them And still he could not understand He read until three in the morning and his brain was in a turmoil but not one essential thought in the text had he grasped He looked up and it seemed that the room was lifting heeling and plunging like a ship upon the sea Then he hurled the Secret Doctrine and many curses across the room turned off the gas and composed himself to sleep Nor did he have much better luck with the other three books It was not that his brain was weak or incapable it could think these thoughts were it not for lack of training in thinking and lack of the thought tools with which to think He guessed this and for a while entertained the idea of reading nothing but the dictionary until he had mastered every word in it Poetry however was his solace and he read much of it finding his greatest joy in the simpler poets who were more understandable He loved beauty and there he found beauty Poetry like music stirred him profoundly and though he did not know it he was preparing his mind for the heavier work that was to come The pages of his mind were blank and without effort much he read and liked stanza by stanza was impressed upon those pages so that he was soon able to extract great joy from chanting aloud or under his breath the music and the beauty of the printed words he had read Then he stumbled upon Gayley s Classic Myths and Bulfinch s Age of Fable side by side on a library shelf It was illumination a great light in the darkness of his ignorance and he read poetry more avidly than ever The man at the desk in the library had seen Martin there so often that he had become quite cordial always greeting him with a smile and a nod when he entered It was because of this that Martin did a daring thing Drawing out some books at the desk and while the man was stamping the cards Martin blurted out Say there s something I d like to ask you The man smiled and paid attention When you meet a young lady an she asks you to call how soon can you call Martin felt his shirt press and cling to his shoulders what of the sweat of the effort Why I d say any time the man answered Yes but this is different Martin objected She I well you see it s this way maybe she won t be there She goes to the university Then call again What I said ain t what I meant Martin confessed falteringly while he made up his mind to throw himself wholly upon the other s mercy I m just a rough sort of a fellow an I ain t never seen anything of society This girl is all that I ain t an I ain t anything that she is You don t think I m playin the fool do you he demanded abruptly No no not at all I assure you the other protested Your request is not exactly in the scope of the reference department but I shall be only too pleased to assist you Martin looked at him admiringly If I could tear it off that way I d be all right he said I beg pardon I mean if I could talk easy that way an polite an all the rest Oh said the other with comprehension What is the best time to call The afternoon not too close to meal time Or the evening Or Sunday I ll tell you the librarian said with a brightening face You call her up on the telephone and find out I ll do it he said picking up his books and starting away He turned back and asked When you re speakin to a young lady say for instance Miss Lizzie Smith do you say Miss Lizzie or Miss Smith Say Miss Smith the librarian stated authoritatively Say Miss Smith always until you come to know her better So it was that Martin Eden solved the problem Come down any time I ll be at home all afternoon was Ruth s reply over the telephone to his stammered request as to when he could return the borrowed books She met him at the door herself and her woman s eyes took in immediately the creased trousers and the certain slight but indefinable change in him for the better Also she was struck by his face It was almost violent this health of his and it seemed to rush out of him and at her in waves of force She felt the urge again of the desire to lean toward him for warmth and marvelled again at the effect his presence produced upon her And he in turn knew again the swimming sensation of bliss when he felt the contact of her hand in greeting The difference between them lay in that she was cool and self possessed while his face flushed to the roots of the hair He stumbled with his old awkwardness after her and his shoulders swung and lurched perilously Once they were seated in the living room he began to get on easily more easily by far than he had expected She made it easy for him and the gracious spirit with which she did it made him love her more madly than ever They talked first of the borrowed books of the Swinburne he was devoted to and of the Browning he did not understand and she led the conversation on from subject to subject while she pondered the problem of how she could be of help to him She had thought of this often since their first meeting She wanted to help him He made a call upon her pity and tenderness that no one had ever made before and the pity was not so much derogatory of him as maternal in her Her pity could not be of the common sort when the man who drew it was so much man as to shock her with maidenly fears and set her mind and pulse thrilling with strange thoughts and feelings The old fascination of his neck was there and there was sweetness in the thought of laying her hands upon it It seemed still a wanton impulse but she had grown more used to it She did not dream that in such guise new born love would epitomize itself Nor did she dream that the feeling he excited in her was love She thought she was merely interested in him as an unusual type possessing various potential excellencies and she even felt philanthropic about it She did not know she desired him but with him it was different He knew that he loved her and he desired her as he had never before desired anything in his life He had loved poetry for beauty s sake but since he met her the gates to the vast field of love poetry had been opened wide She had given him understanding even more than Bulfinch and Gayley There was a line that a week before he would not have favored with a second thought God s own mad lover dying on a kiss but now it was ever insistent in his mind He marvelled at the wonder of it and the truth and as he gazed upon her he knew that he could die gladly upon a kiss He felt himself God s own mad lover and no accolade of knighthood could have given him greater pride And at last he knew the meaning of life and why he had been born As he gazed at her and listened his thoughts grew daring He reviewed all the wild delight of the pressure of her hand in his at the door and longed for it again His gaze wandered often toward her lips and he yearned for them hungrily But there was nothing gross or earthly about this yearning It gave him exquisite delight to watch every movement and play of those lips as they enunciated the words she spoke yet they were not ordinary lips such as all men and women had Their substance was not mere human clay They were lips of pure spirit and his desire for them seemed absolutely different from the desire that had led him to other women s lips He could kiss her lips rest his own physical lips upon them but it would be with the lofty and awful fervor with which one would kiss the robe of God He was not conscious of this transvaluation of values that had taken place in him and was unaware that the light that shone in his eyes when he looked at her was quite the same light that shines in all men s eyes when the desire of love is upon them He did not dream how ardent and masculine his gaze was nor that the warm flame of it was affecting the alchemy of her spirit Her penetrative virginity exalted and disguised his own emotions elevating his thoughts to a star cool chastity and he would have been startled to learn that there was that shining out of his eyes like warm waves that flowed through her and kindled a kindred warmth She was subtly perturbed by it and more than once though she knew not why it disrupted her train of thought with its delicious intrusion and compelled her to grope for the remainder of ideas partly uttered Speech was always easy with her and these interruptions would have puzzled her had she not decided that it was because he was a remarkable type She was very sensitive to impressions and it was not strange after all that this aura of a traveller from another world should so affect her The problem in the background of her consciousness was how to help him and she turned the conversation in that direction but it was Martin who came to the point first I wonder if I can get some advice from you he began and received an acquiescence of willingness that made his heart bound You remember the other time I was here I said I couldn t talk about books an things because I didn t know how Well I ve ben doin a lot of thinkin ever since I ve ben to the library a whole lot but most of the books I ve tackled have ben over my head Mebbe I d better begin at the beginnin I ain t never had no advantages I ve worked pretty hard ever since I was a kid an since I ve ben to the library lookin with new eyes at books an lookin at new books too I ve just about concluded that I ain t ben reading the right kind You know the books you find in cattle camps an fo c s ls ain t the same you ve got in this house for instance Well that s the sort of readin matter I ve ben accustomed to And yet an I ain t just makin a brag of it I ve ben different from the people I ve herded with Not that I m any better than the sailors an cow punchers I travelled with I was cow punchin for a short time you know but I always liked books read everything I could lay hands on an well I guess I think differently from most of em Now to come to what I m drivin at I was never inside a house like this When I come a week ago an saw all this an you an your mother an brothers an everything well I liked it I d heard about such things an read about such things in some of the books an when I looked around at your house why the books come true But the thing I m after is I liked it I wanted it I want it now I want to breathe air like you get in this house air that is filled with books and pictures and beautiful things where people talk in low voices an are clean an their thoughts are clean The air I always breathed was mixed up with grub an house rent an scrappin an booze an that s all they talked about too Why when you was crossin the room to kiss your mother I thought it was the most beautiful thing I ever seen I ve seen a whole lot of life an somehow I ve seen a whole lot more of it than most of them that was with me I like to see an I want to see more an I want to see it different But I ain t got to the point yet Here it is I want to make my way to the kind of life you have in this house There s more in life than booze an hard work an knockin about Now how am I goin to get it Where do I take hold an begin I m willin to work my passage you know an I can make most men sick when it comes to hard work Once I get started I ll work night an day Mebbe you think it s funny me askin you about all this I know you re the last person in the world I ought to ask but I don t know anybody else I could ask unless it s Arthur Mebbe I ought to ask him If I was His voice died away His firmly planned intention had come to a halt on the verge of the horrible probability that he should have asked Arthur and that he had made a fool of himself Ruth did not speak immediately She was too absorbed in striving to reconcile the stumbling uncouth speech and its simplicity of thought with what she saw in his face She had never looked in eyes that expressed greater power Here was a man who could do anything was the message she read there and it accorded ill with the weakness of his spoken thought And for that matter so complex and quick was her own mind that she did not have a just appreciation of simplicity And yet she had caught an impression of power in the very groping of this mind It had seemed to her like a giant writhing and straining at the bonds that held him down Her face was all sympathy when she did speak What you need you realize yourself and it is education You should go back and finish grammar school and then go through to high school and university But that takes money he interrupted Oh she cried I had not thought of that But then you have relatives somebody who could assist you He shook his head My father and mother are dead I ve two sisters one married an the other ll get married soon I suppose Then I ve a string of brothers I m the youngest but they never helped nobody They ve just knocked around over the world lookin out for number one The oldest died in India Two are in South Africa now an another s on a whaling voyage an one s travellin with a circus he does trapeze work An I guess I m just like them I ve taken care of myself since I was eleven that s when my mother died I ve got to study by myself I guess an what I want to know is where to begin I should say the first thing of all would be to get a grammar Your grammar is She had intended saying awful but she amended it to is not particularly good He flushed and sweated I know I must talk a lot of slang an words you don t understand But then they re the only words I know how to speak I ve got other words in my mind picked em up from books but I can t pronounce em so I don t use em It isn t what you say so much as how you say it You don t mind my being frank do you I don t want to hurt you No no he cried while he secretly blessed her for her kindness Fire away I ve got to know an I d sooner know from you than anybody else Well then you say You was it should be You were You say I seen for I saw You use the double negative What s the double negative he demanded then added humbly You see I don t even understand your explanations I m afraid I didn t explain that she smiled A double negative is let me see well you say never helped nobody Never is a negative Nobody is another negative It is a rule that two negatives make a positive Never helped nobody means that not helping nobody they must have helped somebody That s pretty clear he said I never thought of it before But it don t mean they must have helped somebody does it Seems to me that never helped nobody just naturally fails to say whether or not they helped somebody I never thought of it before and I ll never say it again She was pleased and surprised with the quickness and surety of his mind As soon as he had got the clew he not only understood but corrected her error You ll find it all in the grammar she went on There s something else I noticed in your speech You say don t when you shouldn t Don t is a contraction and stands for two words Do you know them He thought a moment then answered Do not She nodded her head and said And you use don t when you mean does not He was puzzled over this and did not get it so quickly Give me an illustration he asked Well She puckered her brows and pursed up her mouth as she thought while he looked on and decided that her expression was most adorable It don t do to be hasty Change don t to do not and it reads It do not do to be hasty which is perfectly absurd He turned it over in his mind and considered Doesn t it jar on your ear she suggested Can t say that it does he replied judicially Why didn t you say Can t say that it do she queried That sounds wrong he said slowly As for the other I can t make up my mind I guess my ear ain t had the trainin yours has There is no such word as ain t she said prettily emphatic Martin flushed again And you say ben for been she continued come for came and the way you chop your endings is something dreadful How do you mean He leaned forward feeling that he ought to get down on his knees before so marvellous a mind How do I chop You don t complete the endings A n d spells and You pronounce it an I n g spells ing Sometimes you pronounce it ing and sometimes you leave off the g And then you slur by dropping initial letters and diphthongs T h e m spells them You pronounce it oh well it is not necessary to go over all of them What you need is the grammar I ll get one and show you how to begin As she arose there shot through his mind something that he had read in the etiquette books and he stood up awkwardly worrying as to whether he was doing the right thing and fearing that she might take it as a sign that he was about to go By the way mister Eden she called back as she was leaving the room What is booze You used it several times you know Oh booze he laughed It s slang It means whiskey an beer anything that will make you drunk And another thing she laughed back Don t use you when you are impersonal You is very personal and your use of it just now was not precisely what you meant I don t just see that Why you said just now to me whiskey and beer anything that will make you drunk make me drunk don t you see Well it would wouldn t it Yes of course she smiled But it would be nicer not to bring me into it Substitute one for you and see how much better it sounds When she returned with the grammar she drew a chair near his he wondered if he should have helped her with the chair and sat down beside him She turned the pages of the grammar and their heads were inclined toward each other He could hardly follow her outlining of the work he must do so amazed was he by her delightful propinquity But when she began to lay down the importance of conjugation he forgot all about her He had never heard of conjugation and was fascinated by the glimpse he was catching into the tie ribs of language He leaned closer to the page and her hair touched his cheek He had fainted but once in his life and he thought he was going to faint again He could scarcely breathe and his heart was pounding the blood up into his throat and suffocating him Never had she seemed so accessible as now For the moment the great gulf that separated them was bridged But there was no diminution in the loftiness of his feeling for her She had not descended to him It was he who had been caught up into the clouds and carried to her His reverence for her in that moment was of the same order as religious awe and fervor It seemed to him that he had intruded upon the holy of holies and slowly and carefully he moved his head aside from the contact which thrilled him like an electric shock and of which she had not been aware CHAPTER VIII Several weeks went by during which Martin Eden studied his grammar reviewed the books on etiquette and read voraciously the books that caught his fancy Of his own class he saw nothing The girls of the Lotus Club wondered what had become of him and worried Jim with questions and some of the fellows who put on the glove at Riley s were glad that Martin came no more He made another discovery of treasure trove in the library As the grammar had shown him the tie ribs of language so that book showed him the tie ribs of poetry and he began to learn metre and construction and form beneath the beauty he loved finding the why and wherefore of that beauty Another modern book he found treated poetry as a representative art treated it exhaustively with copious illustrations from the best in literature Never had he read fiction with so keen zest as he studied these books And his fresh mind untaxed for twenty years and impelled by maturity of desire gripped hold of what he read with a virility unusual to the student mind When he looked back now from his vantage ground the old world he had known the world of land and sea and ships of sailor men and harpy women seemed a very small world and yet it blended in with this new world and expanded His mind made for unity and he was surprised when at first he began to see points of contact between the two worlds And he was ennobled as well by the loftiness of thought and beauty he found in the books This led him to believe more firmly than ever that up above him in society like Ruth and her family all men and women thought these thoughts and lived them Down below where he lived was the ignoble and he wanted to purge himself of the ignoble that had soiled all his days and to rise to that sublimated realm where dwelt the upper classes All his childhood and youth had been troubled by a vague unrest he had never known what he wanted but he had wanted something that he had hunted vainly for until he met Ruth And now his unrest had become sharp and painful and he knew at last clearly and definitely that it was beauty and intellect and love that he must have During those several weeks he saw Ruth half a dozen times and each time was an added inspiration She helped him with his English corrected his pronunciation and started him on arithmetic But their intercourse was not all devoted to elementary study He had seen too much of life and his mind was too matured to be wholly content with fractions cube root parsing and analysis and there were times when their conversation turned on other themes the last poetry he had read the latest poet she had studied And when she read aloud to him her favorite passages he ascended to the topmost heaven of delight Never in all the women he had heard speak had he heard a voice like hers The least sound of it was a stimulus to his love and he thrilled and throbbed with every word she uttered It was the quality of it the repose and the musical modulation the soft rich indefinable product of culture and a gentle soul As he listened to her there rang in the ears of his memory the harsh cries of barbarian women and of hags and in lesser degrees of harshness the strident voices of working women and of the girls of his own class Then the chemistry of vision would begin to work and they would troop in review across his mind each by contrast multiplying Ruth s glories Then too his bliss was heightened by the knowledge that her mind was comprehending what she read and was quivering with appreciation of the beauty of the written thought She read to him much from The Princess and often he saw her eyes swimming with tears so finely was her aesthetic nature strung At such moments her own emotions elevated him till he was as a god and as he gazed at her and listened he seemed gazing on the face of life and reading its deepest secrets And then becoming aware of the heights of exquisite sensibility he attained he decided that this was love and that love was the greatest thing in the world And in review would pass along the corridors of memory all previous thrills and burnings he had known the drunkenness of wine the caresses of women the rough play and give and take of physical contests and they seemed trivial and mean compared with this sublime ardor he now enjoyed The situation was obscured to Ruth She had never had any experiences of the heart Her only experiences in such matters were of the books where the facts of ordinary day were translated by fancy into a fairy realm of unreality and she little knew that this rough sailor was creeping into her heart and storing there pent forces that would some day burst forth and surge through her in waves of fire She did not know the actual fire of love Her knowledge of love was purely theoretical and she conceived of it as lambent flame gentle as the fall of dew or the ripple of quiet water and cool as the velvet dark of summer nights Her idea of love was more that of placid affection serving the loved one softly in an atmosphere flower scented and dim lighted of ethereal calm She did not dream of the volcanic convulsions of love its scorching heat and sterile wastes of parched ashes She knew neither her own potencies nor the potencies of the world and the deeps of life were to her seas of illusion The conjugal affection of her father and mother constituted her ideal of love affinity and she looked forward some day to emerging without shock or friction into that same quiet sweetness of existence with a loved one So it was that she looked upon Martin Eden as a novelty a strange individual and she identified with novelty and strangeness the effects he produced upon her It was only natural In similar ways she had experienced unusual feelings when she looked at wild animals in the menagerie or when she witnessed a storm of wind or shuddered at the bright ribbed lightning There was something cosmic in such things and there was something cosmic in him He came to her breathing of large airs and great spaces The blaze of tropic suns was in his face and in his swelling resilient muscles was the primordial vigor of life He was marred and scarred by that mysterious world of rough men and rougher deeds the outposts of which began beyond her horizon He was untamed wild and in secret ways her vanity was touched by the fact that he came so mildly to her hand Likewise she was stirred by the common impulse to tame the wild thing It was an unconscious impulse and farthest from her thoughts that her desire was to re thumb the clay of him into a likeness of her father s image which image she believed to be the finest in the world Nor was there any way out of her inexperience for her to know that the cosmic feel she caught of him was that most cosmic of things love which with equal power drew men and women together across the world compelled stags to kill each other in the rutting season and drove even the elements irresistibly to unite His swift development was a source of surprise and interest She detected unguessed finenesses in him that seemed to bud day by day like flowers in congenial soil She read Browning aloud to him and was often puzzled by the strange interpretations he gave to mooted passages It was beyond her to realize that out of his experience of men and women and life his interpretations were far more frequently correct than hers His conceptions seemed naive to her though she was often fired by his daring flights of comprehension whose orbit path was so wide among the stars that she could not follow and could only sit and thrill to the impact of unguessed power Then she played to him no longer at him and probed him with music that sank to depths beyond her plumb line His nature opened to music as a flower to the sun and the transition was quick from his working class rag time and jingles to her classical display pieces that she knew nearly by heart Yet he betrayed a democratic fondness for Wagner and the Tannhauser overture when she had given him the clew to it claimed him as nothing else she played In an immediate way it personified his life All his past was the Venusburg motif while her he identified somehow with the Pilgrim s Chorus motif and from the exalted state this elevated him to he swept onward and upward into that vast shadow realm of spirit groping where good and evil war eternally Sometimes he questioned and induced in her mind temporary doubts as to the correctness of her own definitions and conceptions of music But her singing he did not question It was too wholly her and he sat always amazed at the divine melody of her pure soprano voice And he could not help but contrast it with the weak pipings and shrill quaverings of factory girls ill nourished and untrained and with the raucous shriekings from gin cracked throats of the women of the seaport towns She enjoyed singing and playing to him In truth it was the first time she had ever had a human soul to play with and the plastic clay of him was a delight to mould for she thought she was moulding it and her intentions were good Besides it was pleasant to be with him He did not repel her That first repulsion had been really a fear of her undiscovered self and the fear had gone to sleep Though she did not know it she had a feeling in him of proprietary right Also he had a tonic effect upon her She was studying hard at the university and it seemed to strengthen her to emerge from the dusty books and have the fresh sea breeze of his personality blow upon her Strength Strength was what she needed and he gave it to her in generous measure To come into the same room with him or to meet him at the door was to take heart of life And when he had gone she would return to her books with a keener zest and fresh store of energy She knew her Browning but it had never sunk into her that it was an awkward thing to play with souls As her interest in Martin increased the remodelling of his life became a passion with her There is mister Butler she said one afternoon when grammar and arithmetic and poetry had been put aside He had comparatively no advantages at first His father had been a bank cashier but he lingered for years dying of consumption in Arizona so that when he was dead mister Butler Charles Butler he was called found himself alone in the world His father had come from Australia you know and so he had no relatives in California He went to work in a printing office I have heard him tell of it many times and he got three dollars a week at first His income to day is at least thirty thousand a year How did he do it He was honest and faithful and industrious and economical He denied himself the enjoyments that most boys indulge in He made it a point to save so much every week no matter what he had to do without in order to save it Of course he was soon earning more than three dollars a week and as his wages increased he saved more and more He worked in the daytime and at night he went to night school He had his eyes fixed always on the future Later on he went to night high school When he was only seventeen he was earning excellent wages at setting type but he was ambitious He wanted a career not a livelihood and he was content to make immediate sacrifices for his ultimate again He decided upon the law and he entered father s office as an office boy think of that and got only four dollars a week But he had learned how to be economical and out of that four dollars he went on saving money She paused for breath and to note how Martin was receiving it His face was lighted up with interest in the youthful struggles of mister Butler but there was a frown upon his face as well I d say they was pretty hard lines for a young fellow he remarked Four dollars a week How could he live on it You can bet he didn t have any frills Why I pay five dollars a week for board now an there s nothin excitin about it you can lay to that He must have lived like a dog The food he ate He cooked for himself she interrupted on a little kerosene stove The food he ate must have been worse than what a sailor gets on the worst feedin deep water ships than which there ain t much that can be possibly worse But think of him now she cried enthusiastically Think of what his income affords him His early denials are paid for a thousand fold Martin looked at her sharply There s one thing I ll bet you he said and it is that mister Butler is nothin gay hearted now in his fat days He fed himself like that for years an years on a boy s stomach an I bet his stomach s none too good now for it Her eyes dropped before his searching gaze I ll bet he s got dyspepsia right now Martin challenged Yes he has she confessed but An I bet Martin dashed on that he s solemn an serious as an old owl an doesn t care a rap for a good time for all his thirty thousand a year An I ll bet he s not particularly joyful at seein others have a good time Ain t I right She nodded her head in agreement and hastened to explain But he is not that type of man By nature he is sober and serious He always was that You can bet he was Martin proclaimed Three dollars a week an four dollars a week an a young boy cookin for himself on an oil burner an layin up money workin all day an studyin all night just workin an never playin never havin a good time an never learnin how to have a good time of course his thirty thousand came along too late His sympathetic imagination was flashing upon his inner sight all the thousands of details of the boy s existence and of his narrow spiritual development into a thirty thousand dollar a year man With the swiftness and wide reaching of multitudinous thought Charles Butler s whole life was telescoped upon his vision Do you know he added I feel sorry for mister Butler He was too young to know better but he robbed himself of life for the sake of thirty thousand a year that s clean wasted upon him Why thirty thousand lump sum wouldn t buy for him right now what ten cents he was layin up would have bought him when he was a kid in the way of candy an peanuts or a seat in nigger heaven It was just such uniqueness of points of view that startled Ruth Not only were they new to her and contrary to her own beliefs but she always felt in them germs of truth that threatened to unseat or modify her own convictions Had she been fourteen instead of twenty four she might have been changed by them but she was twenty four conservative by nature and upbringing and already crystallized into the cranny of life where she had been born and formed It was true his bizarre judgments troubled her in the moments they were uttered but she ascribed them to his novelty of type and strangeness of living and they were soon forgotten Nevertheless while she disapproved of them the strength of their utterance and the flashing of eyes and earnestness of face that accompanied them always thrilled her and drew her toward him She would never have guessed that this man who had come from beyond her horizon was in such moments flashing on beyond her horizon with wider and deeper concepts Her own limits were the limits of her horizon but limited minds can recognize limitations only in others And so she felt that her outlook was very wide indeed and that where his conflicted with hers marked his limitations and she dreamed of helping him to see as she saw of widening his horizon until it was identified with hers But I have not finished my story she said He worked so father says as no other office boy he ever had mister Butler was always eager to work He never was late and he was usually at the office a few minutes before his regular time And yet he saved his time Every spare moment was devoted to study He studied book keeping and type writing and he paid for lessons in shorthand by dictating at night to a court reporter who needed practice He quickly became a clerk and he made himself invaluable Father appreciated him and saw that he was bound to rise It was on father s suggestion that he went to law college He became a lawyer and hardly was he back in the office when father took him in as junior partner He is a great man He refused the United States Senate several times and father says he could become a justice of the Supreme Court any time a vacancy occurs if he wants to Such a life is an inspiration to all of us It shows us that a man with will may rise superior to his environment He is a great man Martin said sincerely But it seemed to him there was something in the recital that jarred upon his sense of beauty and life He could not find an adequate motive in mister Butler s life of pinching and privation Had he done it for love of a woman or for attainment of beauty Martin would have understood God s own mad lover should do anything for the kiss but not for thirty thousand dollars a year He was dissatisfied with mister Butler s career There was something paltry about it after all Thirty thousand a year was all right but dyspepsia and inability to be humanly happy robbed such princely income of all its value Much of this he strove to express to Ruth and shocked her and made it clear that more remodelling was necessary Hers was that common insularity of mind that makes human creatures believe that their color creed and politics are best and right and that other human creatures scattered over the world are less fortunately placed than they It was the same insularity of mind that made the ancient Jew thank God he was not born a woman and sent the modern missionary god substituting to the ends of the earth and it made Ruth desire to shape this man from other crannies of life into the likeness of the men who lived in her particular cranny of life CHAPTER IX Back from sea Martin Eden came homing for California with a lover s desire His store of money exhausted he had shipped before the mast on the treasure hunting schooner and the Solomon Islands after eight months of failure to find treasure had witnessed the breaking up of the expedition The men had been paid off in Australia and Martin had immediately shipped on a deep water vessel for San Francisco Not alone had those eight months earned him enough money to stay on land for many weeks but they had enabled him to do a great deal of studying and reading His was the student s mind and behind his ability to learn was the indomitability of his nature and his love for Ruth The grammar he had taken along he went through again and again until his unjaded brain had mastered it He noticed the bad grammar used by his shipmates and made a point of mentally correcting and reconstructing their crudities of speech To his great joy he discovered that his ear was becoming sensitive and that he was developing grammatical nerves A double negative jarred him like a discord and often from lack of practice it was from his own lips that the jar came His tongue refused to learn new tricks in a day After he had been through the grammar repeatedly he took up the dictionary and added twenty words a day to his vocabulary He found that this was no light task and at wheel or lookout he steadily went over and over his lengthening list of pronunciations and definitions while he invariably memorized himself to sleep Never did anything if I were and those things were phrases with many variations that he repeated under his breath in order to accustom his tongue to the language spoken by Ruth And and ing with the d and g pronounced emphatically he went over thousands of times and to his surprise he noticed that he was beginning to speak cleaner and more correct English than the officers themselves and the gentleman adventurers in the cabin who had financed the expedition The captain was a fishy eyed Norwegian who somehow had fallen into possession of a complete Shakespeare which he never read and Martin had washed his clothes for him and in return been permitted access to the precious volumes For a time so steeped was he in the plays and in the many favorite passages that impressed themselves almost without effort on his brain that all the world seemed to shape itself into forms of Elizabethan tragedy or comedy and his very thoughts were in blank verse It trained his ear and gave him a fine appreciation for noble English withal it introduced into his mind much that was archaic and obsolete The eight months had been well spent and in addition to what he had learned of right speaking and high thinking he had learned much of himself Along with his humbleness because he knew so little there arose a conviction of power He felt a sharp gradation between himself and his shipmates and was wise enough to realize that the difference lay in potentiality rather than achievement What he could do they could do but within him he felt a confused ferment working that told him there was more in him than he had done He was tortured by the exquisite beauty of the world and wished that Ruth were there to share it with him He decided that he would describe to her many of the bits of South Sea beauty The creative spirit in him flamed up at the thought and urged that he recreate this beauty for a wider audience than Ruth And then in splendor and glory came the great idea He would write He would be one of the eyes through which the world saw one of the ears through which it heard one of the hearts through which it felt He would write everything poetry and prose fiction and description and plays like Shakespeare There was career and the way to win to Ruth The men of literature were the world s giants and he conceived them to be far finer than the mister Butlers who earned thirty thousand a year and could be Supreme Court justices if they wanted to Once the idea had germinated it mastered him and the return voyage to San Francisco was like a dream He was drunken with unguessed power and felt that he could do anything In the midst of the great and lonely sea he gained perspective Clearly and for the first lime he saw Ruth and her world It was all visualized in his mind as a concrete thing which he could take up in his two hands and turn around and about and examine There was much that was dim and nebulous in that world but he saw it as a whole and not in detail and he saw also the way to master it To write The thought was fire in him He would begin as soon as he got back The first thing he would do would be to describe the voyage of the treasure hunters He would sell it to some San Francisco newspaper He would not tell Ruth anything about it and she would be surprised and pleased when she saw his name in print While he wrote he could go on studying There were twenty four hours in each day He was invincible He knew how to work and the citadels would go down before him He would not have to go to sea again as a sailor and for the instant he caught a vision of a steam yacht There were other writers who possessed steam yachts Of course he cautioned himself it would be slow succeeding at first and for a time he would be content to earn enough money by his writing to enable him to go on studying And then after some time a very indeterminate time when he had learned and prepared himself he would write the great things and his name would be on all men s lips But greater than that infinitely greater and greatest of all he would have proved himself worthy of Ruth Fame was all very well but it was for Ruth that his splendid dream arose He was not a fame monger but merely one of God s mad lovers Arrived in Oakland with his snug pay day in his pocket he took up his old room at Bernard Higginbotham s and set to work He did not even let Ruth know he was back He would go and see her when he finished the article on the treasure hunters It was not so difficult to abstain from seeing her because of the violent heat of creative fever that burned in him Besides the very article he was writing would bring her nearer to him He did not know how long an article he should write but he counted the words in a double page article in the Sunday supplement of the San Francisco Examiner and guided himself by that Three days at white heat completed his narrative but when he had copied it carefully in a large scrawl that was easy to read he learned from a rhetoric he picked up in the library that there were such things as paragraphs and quotation marks He had never thought of such things before and he promptly set to work writing the article over referring continually to the pages of the rhetoric and learning more in a day about composition than the average schoolboy in a year When he had copied the article a second time and rolled it up carefully he read in a newspaper an item on hints to beginners and discovered the iron law that manuscripts should never be rolled and that they should be written on one side of the paper He had violated the law on both counts Also he learned from the item that first class papers paid a minimum of ten dollars a column So while he copied the manuscript a third time he consoled himself by multiplying ten columns by ten dollars The product was always the same one hundred dollars and he decided that that was better than seafaring If it hadn t been for his blunders he would have finished the article in three days One hundred dollars in three days It would have taken him three months and longer on the sea to earn a similar amount A man was a fool to go to sea when he could write he concluded though the money in itself meant nothing to him Its value was in the liberty it would get him the presentable garments it would buy him all of which would bring him nearer swiftly nearer to the slender pale girl who had turned his life back upon itself and given him inspiration He mailed the manuscript in a flat envelope and addressed it to the editor of the San Francisco Examiner He had an idea that anything accepted by a paper was published immediately and as he had sent the manuscript in on Friday he expected it to come out on the following Sunday He conceived that it would be fine to let that event apprise Ruth of his return Then Sunday afternoon he would call and see her In the meantime he was occupied by another idea which he prided himself upon as being a particularly sane careful and modest idea He would write an adventure story for boys and sell it to The Youth s Companion He went to the free reading room and looked through the files of The Youth s Companion Serial stories he found were usually published in that weekly in five instalments of about three thousand words each He discovered several serials that ran to seven instalments and decided to write one of that length He had been on a whaling voyage in the Arctic once a voyage that was to have been for three years and which had terminated in shipwreck at the end of six months While his imagination was fanciful even fantastic at times he had a basic love of reality that compelled him to write about the things he knew He knew whaling and out of the real materials of his knowledge he proceeded to manufacture the fictitious adventures of the two boys he intended to use as joint heroes It was easy work he decided on Saturday evening He had completed on that day the first instalment of three thousand words much to the amusement of Jim and to the open derision of mister Higginbotham who sneered throughout meal time at the litery person they had discovered in the family Martin contented himself by picturing his brother in law s surprise on Sunday morning when he opened his Examiner and saw the article on the treasure hunters Early that morning he was out himself to the front door nervously racing through the many sheeted newspaper He went through it a second time very carefully then folded it up and left it where he had found it He was glad he had not told any one about his article On second thought he concluded that he had been wrong about the speed with which things found their way into newspaper columns Besides there had not been any news value in his article and most likely the editor would write to him about it first After breakfast he went on with his serial The words flowed from his pen though he broke off from the writing frequently to look up definitions in the dictionary or to refer to the rhetoric He often read or re read a chapter at a time during such pauses and he consoled himself that while he was not writing the great things he felt to be in him he was learning composition at any rate and training himself to shape up and express his thoughts He toiled on till dark when he went out to the reading room and explored magazines and weeklies until the place closed at ten o clock This was his programme for a week Each day he did three thousand words and each evening he puzzled his way through the magazines taking note of the stories articles and poems that editors saw fit to publish One thing was certain What these multitudinous writers did he could do and only give him time and he would do what they could not do He was cheered to read in Book News in a paragraph on the payment of magazine writers not that Rudyard Kipling received a dollar per word but that the minimum rate paid by first class magazines was two cents a word The Youth s Companion was certainly first class and at that rate the three thousand words he had written that day would bring him sixty dollars two months wages on the sea On Friday night he finished the serial twenty one thousand words long At two cents a word he calculated that would bring him four hundred and twenty dollars Not a bad week s work It was more money than he had ever possessed at one time He did not know how he could spend it all He had tapped a gold mine Where this came from he could always get more He planned to buy some more clothes to subscribe to many magazines and to buy dozens of reference books that at present he was compelled to go to the library to consult And still there was a large portion of the four hundred and twenty dollars unspent This worried him until the thought came to him of hiring a servant for Gertrude and of buying a bicycle for Marion He mailed the bulky manuscript to The Youth s Companion and on Saturday afternoon after having planned an article on pearl diving he went to see Ruth He had telephoned and she went herself to greet him at the door The old familiar blaze of health rushed out from him and struck her like a blow It seemed to enter into her body and course through her veins in a liquid glow and to set her quivering with its imparted strength He flushed warmly as he took her hand and looked into her blue eyes but the fresh bronze of eight months of sun hid the flush though it did not protect the neck from the gnawing chafe of the stiff collar She noted the red line of it with amusement which quickly vanished as she glanced at his clothes They really fitted him it was his first made to order suit and he seemed slimmer and better modelled In addition his cloth cap had been replaced by a soft hat which she commanded him to put on and then complimented him on his appearance She did not remember when she had felt so happy This change in him was her handiwork and she was proud of it and fired with ambition further to help him But the most radical change of all and the one that pleased her most was the change in his speech Not only did he speak more correctly but he spoke more easily and there were many new words in his vocabulary When he grew excited or enthusiastic however he dropped back into the old slurring and the dropping of final consonants Also there was an awkward hesitancy at times as he essayed the new words he had learned On the other hand along with his ease of expression he displayed a lightness and facetiousness of thought that delighted her It was his old spirit of humor and badinage that had made him a favorite in his own class but which he had hitherto been unable to use in her presence through lack of words and training He was just beginning to orientate himself and to feel that he was not wholly an intruder But he was very tentative fastidiously so letting Ruth set the pace of sprightliness and fancy keeping up with her but never daring to go beyond her He told her of what he had been doing and of his plan to write for a livelihood and of going on with his studies But he was disappointed at her lack of approval She did not think much of his plan You see she said frankly writing must be a trade like anything else Not that I know anything about it of course I only bring common judgment to bear You couldn t hope to be a blacksmith without spending three years at learning the trade or is it five years Now writers are so much better paid than blacksmiths that there must be ever so many more men who would like to write who try to write But then may not I be peculiarly constituted to write he queried secretly exulting at the language he had used his swift imagination throwing the whole scene and atmosphere upon a vast screen along with a thousand other scenes from his life scenes that were rough and raw gross and bestial The whole composite vision was achieved with the speed of light producing no pause in the conversation nor interrupting his calm train of thought On the screen of his imagination he saw himself and this sweet and beautiful girl facing each other and conversing in good English in a room of books and paintings and tone and culture and all illuminated by a bright light of steadfast brilliance while ranged about and fading away to the remote edges of the screen were antithetical scenes each scene a picture and he the onlooker free to look at will upon what he wished He saw these other scenes through drifting vapors and swirls of sullen fog dissolving before shafts of red and garish light He saw cowboys at the bar drinking fierce whiskey the air filled with obscenity and ribald language and he saw himself with them drinking and cursing with the wildest or sitting at table with them under smoking kerosene lamps while the chips clicked and clattered and the cards were dealt around He saw himself stripped to the waist with naked fists fighting his great fight with Liverpool Red in the forecastle of the Susquehanna and he saw the bloody deck of the John Rogers that gray morning of attempted mutiny the mate kicking in death throes on the main hatch the revolver in the old man s hand spitting fire and smoke the men with passion wrenched faces of brutes screaming vile blasphemies and falling about him and then he returned to the central scene calm and clean in the steadfast light where Ruth sat and talked with him amid books and paintings and he saw the grand piano upon which she would later play to him and he heard the echoes of his own selected and correct words But then may I not be peculiarly constituted to write But no matter how peculiarly constituted a man may be for blacksmithing she was laughing I never heard of one becoming a blacksmith without first serving his apprenticeship What would you advise he asked And don t forget that I feel in me this capacity to write I can t explain it I just know that it is in me You must get a thorough education was the answer whether or not you ultimately become a writer This education is indispensable for whatever career you select and it must not be slipshod or sketchy You should go to high school Yes he began but she interrupted with an afterthought Of course you could go on with your writing too I would have to he said grimly Why She looked at him prettily puzzled for she did not quite like the persistence with which he clung to his notion Because without writing there wouldn t be any high school I must live and buy books and clothes you know I d forgotten that she laughed Why weren t you born with an income I d rather have good health and imagination he answered I can make good on the income but the other things have to be made good for He almost said you then amended his sentence to have to be made good for one Don t say make good she cried sweetly petulant It s slang and it s horrid He flushed and stammered That s right and I only wish you d correct me every time I I d like to she said haltingly You have so much in you that is good that I want to see you perfect He was clay in her hands immediately as passionately desirous of being moulded by her as she was desirous of shaping him into the image of her ideal of man And when she pointed out the opportuneness of the time that the entrance examinations to high school began on the following Monday he promptly volunteered that he would take them Then she played and sang to him while he gazed with hungry yearning at her drinking in her loveliness and marvelling that there should not be a hundred suitors listening there and longing for her as he listened and longed CHAPTER X He stopped to dinner that evening and much to Ruth s satisfaction made a favorable impression on her father They talked about the sea as a career a subject which Martin had at his finger ends and mister Morse remarked afterward that he seemed a very clear headed young man In his avoidance of slang and his search after right words Martin was compelled to talk slowly which enabled him to find the best thoughts that were in him He was more at ease than that first night at dinner nearly a year before and his shyness and modesty even commended him to missus Morse who was pleased at his manifest improvement He is the first man that ever drew passing notice from Ruth she told her husband She has been so singularly backward where men are concerned that I have been worried greatly mister Morse looked at his wife curiously You mean to use this young sailor to wake her up he questioned I mean that she is not to die an old maid if I can help it was the answer If this young Eden can arouse her interest in mankind in general it will be a good thing A very good thing he commented But suppose and we must suppose sometimes my dear suppose he arouses her interest too particularly in him Impossible missus Morse laughed She is three years older than he and besides it is impossible Nothing will ever come of it Trust that to me And so Martin s role was arranged for him while he led on by Arthur and Norman was meditating an extravagance They were going out for a ride into the hills Sunday morning on their wheels which did not interest Martin until he learned that Ruth too rode a wheel and was going along He did not ride nor own a wheel but if Ruth rode it was up to him to begin was his decision and when he said good night he stopped in at a cyclery on his way home and spent forty dollars for a wheel It was more than a month s hard earned wages and it reduced his stock of money amazingly but when he added the hundred dollars he was to receive from the Examiner to the four hundred and twenty dollars that was the least The Youth s Companion could pay him he felt that he had reduced the perplexity the unwonted amount of money had caused him Nor did he mind in the course of learning to ride the wheel home the fact that he ruined his suit of clothes He caught the tailor by telephone that night from mister Higginbotham s store and ordered another suit Then he carried the wheel up the narrow stairway that clung like a fire escape to the rear wall of the building and when he had moved his bed out from the wall found there was just space enough in the small room for himself and the wheel Sunday he had intended to devote to studying for the high school examination but the pearl diving article lured him away and he spent the day in the white hot fever of re creating the beauty and romance that burned in him The fact that the Examiner of that morning had failed to publish his treasure hunting article did not dash his spirits He was at too great a height for that and having been deaf to a twice repeated summons he went without the heavy Sunday dinner with which mister Higginbotham invariably graced his table To mister Higginbotham such a dinner was advertisement of his worldly achievement and prosperity and he honored it by delivering platitudinous sermonettes upon American institutions and the opportunity said institutions gave to any hard working man to rise the rise in his case which he pointed out unfailingly being from a grocer s clerk to the ownership of Higginbotham s Cash Store Martin Eden looked with a sigh at his unfinished Pearl diving on Monday morning and took the car down to Oakland to the high school And when days later he applied for the results of his examinations he learned that he had failed in everything save grammar Your grammar is excellent Professor Hilton informed him staring at him through heavy spectacles but you know nothing positively nothing in the other branches and your United States history is abominable there is no other word for it abominable I should advise you Professor Hilton paused and glared at him unsympathetic and unimaginative as one of his own test tubes He was professor of physics in the high school possessor of a large family a meagre salary and a select fund of parrot learned knowledge Yes sir Martin said humbly wishing somehow that the man at the desk in the library was in Professor Hilton s place just then And I should advise you to go back to the grammar school for at least two years Good day Martin was not deeply affected by his failure though he was surprised at Ruth s shocked expression when he told her Professor Hilton s advice Her disappointment was so evident that he was sorry he had failed but chiefly so for her sake You see I was right she said You know far more than any of the students entering high school and yet you can t pass the examinations It is because what education you have is fragmentary sketchy You need the discipline of study such as only skilled teachers can give you You must be thoroughly grounded Professor Hilton is right and if I were you I d go to night school A year and a half of it might enable you to catch up that additional six months Besides that would leave you your days in which to write or if you could not make your living by your pen you would have your days in which to work in some position But if my days are taken up with work and my nights with school when am I going to see you was Martin s first thought though he refrained from uttering it Instead he said It seems so babyish for me to be going to night school But I wouldn t mind that if I thought it would pay But I don t think it will pay I can do the work quicker than they can teach me It would be a loss of time he thought of her and his desire to have her and I can t afford the time I haven t the time to spare in fact There is so much that is necessary She looked at him gently and he was a brute to oppose her Physics and chemistry you can t do them without laboratory study and you ll find algebra and geometry almost hopeless with instruction You need the skilled teachers the specialists in the art of imparting knowledge He was silent for a minute casting about for the least vainglorious way in which to express himself Please don t think I m bragging he began I don t intend it that way at all But I have a feeling that I am what I may call a natural student I can study by myself I take to it kindly like a duck to water You see yourself what I did with grammar And I ve learned much of other things you would never dream how much And I m only getting started Wait till I get He hesitated and assured himself of the pronunciation before he said momentum I m getting my first real feel of things now I m beginning to size up the situation Please don t say size up she interrupted To get a line on things he hastily amended That doesn t mean anything in correct English she objected He floundered for a fresh start What I m driving at is that I m beginning to get the lay of the land Out of pity she forebore and he went on Knowledge seems to me like a chart room Whenever I go into the library I am impressed that way The part played by teachers is to teach the student the contents of the chart room in a systematic way The teachers are guides to the chart room that s all It s not something that they have in their own heads They don t make it up don t create it It s all in the chart room and they know their way about in it and it s their business to show the place to strangers who might else get lost Now I don t get lost easily I have the bump of location I usually know where I m at What s wrong now Don t say where I m at That s right he said gratefully where I am But where am I at I mean where am I Oh yes in the chart room Well some people Persons she corrected Some persons need guides most persons do but I think I can get along without them I ve spent a lot of time in the chart room now and I m on the edge of knowing my way about what charts I want to refer to what coasts I want to explore And from the way I line it up I ll explore a whole lot more quickly by myself The speed of a fleet you know is the speed of the slowest ship and the speed of the teachers is affected the same way They can t go any faster than the ruck of their scholars and I can set a faster pace for myself than they set for a whole schoolroom He travels the fastest who travels alone she quoted at him But I d travel faster with you just the same was what he wanted to blurt out as he caught a vision of a world without end of sunlit spaces and starry voids through which he drifted with her his arm around her her pale gold hair blowing about his face In the same instant he was aware of the pitiful inadequacy of speech God If he could so frame words that she could see what he then saw And he felt the stir in him like a throe of yearning pain of the desire to paint these visions that flashed unsummoned on the mirror of his mind Ah that was it He caught at the hem of the secret It was the very thing that the great writers and master poets did That was why they were giants They knew how to express what they thought and felt and saw Dogs asleep in the sun often whined and barked but they were unable to tell what they saw that made them whine and bark He had often wondered what it was And that was all he was a dog asleep in the sun He saw noble and beautiful visions but he could only whine and bark at Ruth But he would cease sleeping in the sun He would stand up with open eyes and he would struggle and toil and learn until with eyes unblinded and tongue untied he could share with her his visioned wealth Other men had discovered the trick of expression of making words obedient servitors and of making combinations of words mean more than the sum of their separate meanings He was stirred profoundly by the passing glimpse at the secret and he was again caught up in the vision of sunlit spaces and starry voids until it came to him that it was very quiet and he saw Ruth regarding him with an amused expression and a smile in her eyes I have had a great visioning he said and at the sound of his words in his own ears his heart gave a leap Where had those words come from They had adequately expressed the pause his vision had put in the conversation It was a miracle Never had he so loftily framed a lofty thought But never had he attempted to frame lofty thoughts in words That was it That explained it He had never tried But Swinburne had and Tennyson and Kipling and all the other poets His mind flashed on to his Pearl diving He had never dared the big things the spirit of the beauty that was a fire in him That article would be a different thing when he was done with it He was appalled by the vastness of the beauty that rightfully belonged in it and again his mind flashed and dared and he demanded of himself why he could not chant that beauty in noble verse as the great poets did And there was all the mysterious delight and spiritual wonder of his love for Ruth Why could he not chant that too as the poets did They had sung of love So 
4438_52195_000005_000000	train-clean-360	would he 
none	none	By God And in his frightened ears he heard his exclamation echoing Carried away he had breathed it aloud The blood surged into his face wave upon wave mastering the bronze of it till the blush of shame flaunted itself from collar rim to the roots of his hair I I beg your pardon he stammered I was thinking It sounded as if you were praying she said bravely but she felt herself inside to be withering and shrinking It was the first time she had heard an oath from the lips of a man she knew and she was shocked not merely as a matter of principle and training but shocked in spirit by this rough blast of life in the garden of her sheltered maidenhood But she forgave and with surprise at the ease of her forgiveness Somehow it was not so difficult to forgive him anything He had not had a chance to be as other men and he was trying so hard and succeeding too It never entered her head that there could be any other reason for her being kindly disposed toward him She was tenderly disposed toward him but she did not know it She had no way of knowing it The placid poise of twenty four years without a single love affair did not fit her with a keen perception of her own feelings and she who had never warmed to actual love was unaware that she was warming now CHAPTER XI Martin went back to his pearl diving article which would have been finished sooner if it had not been broken in upon so frequently by his attempts to write poetry His poems were love poems inspired by Ruth but they were never completed Not in a day could he learn to chant in noble verse Rhyme and metre and structure were serious enough in themselves but there was over and beyond them an intangible and evasive something that he caught in all great poetry but which he could not catch and imprison in his own It was the elusive spirit of poetry itself that he sensed and sought after but could not capture It seemed a glow to him a warm and trailing vapor ever beyond his reaching though sometimes he was rewarded by catching at shreds of it and weaving them into phrases that echoed in his brain with haunting notes or drifted across his vision in misty wafture of unseen beauty It was baffling He ached with desire to express and could but gibber prosaically as everybody gibbered He read his fragments aloud The metre marched along on perfect feet and the rhyme pounded a longer and equally faultless rhythm but the glow and high exaltation that he felt within were lacking He could not understand and time and again in despair defeated and depressed he returned to his article Prose was certainly an easier medium Following the Pearl diving he wrote an article on the sea as a career another on turtle catching and a third on the northeast trades Then he tried as an experiment a short story and before he broke his stride he had finished six short stories and despatched them to various magazines He wrote prolifically intensely from morning till night and late at night except when he broke off to go to the reading room draw books from the library or to call on Ruth He was profoundly happy Life was pitched high He was in a fever that never broke The joy of creation that is supposed to belong to the gods was his All the life about him the odors of stale vegetables and soapsuds the slatternly form of his sister and the jeering face of mister Higginbotham was a dream The real world was in his mind and the stories he wrote were so many pieces of reality out of his mind The days were too short There was so much he wanted to study He cut his sleep down to five hours and found that he could get along upon it He tried four hours and a half and regretfully came back to five He could joyfully have spent all his waking hours upon any one of his pursuits It was with regret that he ceased from writing to study that he ceased from study to go to the library that he tore himself away from that chart room of knowledge or from the magazines in the reading room that were filled with the secrets of writers who succeeded in selling their wares It was like severing heart strings when he was with Ruth to stand up and go and he scorched through the dark streets so as to get home to his books at the least possible expense of time And hardest of all was it to shut up the algebra or physics put note book and pencil aside and close his tired eyes in sleep He hated the thought of ceasing to live even for so short a time and his sole consolation was that the alarm clock was set five hours ahead He would lose only five hours anyway and then the jangling bell would jerk him out of unconsciousness and he would have before him another glorious day of nineteen hours In the meantime the weeks were passing his money was ebbing low and there was no money coming in A month after he had mailed it the adventure serial for boys was returned to him by The Youth s Companion The rejection slip was so tactfully worded that he felt kindly toward the editor But he did not feel so kindly toward the editor of the San Francisco Examiner After waiting two whole weeks Martin had written to him A week later he wrote again At the end of the month he went over to San Francisco and personally called upon the editor But he did not meet that exalted personage thanks to a Cerberus of an office boy of tender years and red hair who guarded the portals At the end of the fifth week the manuscript came back to him by mail without comment There was no rejection slip no explanation nothing In the same way his other articles were tied up with the other leading San Francisco papers When he recovered them he sent them to the magazines in the East from which they were returned more promptly accompanied always by the printed rejection slips The short stories were returned in similar fashion He read them over and over and liked them so much that he could not puzzle out the cause of their rejection until one day he read in a newspaper that manuscripts should always be typewritten That explained it Of course editors were so busy that they could not afford the time and strain of reading handwriting Martin rented a typewriter and spent a day mastering the machine Each day he typed what he composed and he typed his earlier manuscripts as fast as they were returned him He was surprised when the typed ones began to come back His jaw seemed to become squarer his chin more aggressive and he bundled the manuscripts off to new editors The thought came to him that he was not a good judge of his own work He tried it out on Gertrude He read his stories aloud to her Her eyes glistened and she looked at him proudly as she said Ain t it grand you writin those sort of things Yes yes he demanded impatiently But the story how did you like it Just grand was the reply Just grand an thrilling too I was all worked up He could see that her mind was not clear The perplexity was strong in her good natured face So he waited But say Mart after a long pause how did it end Did that young man who spoke so highfalutin get her And after he had explained the end which he thought he had made artistically obvious she would say That s what I wanted to know Why didn t you write that way in the story One thing he learned after he had read her a number of stories namely that she liked happy endings That story was perfectly grand she announced straightening up from the wash tub with a tired sigh and wiping the sweat from her forehead with a red steamy hand but it makes me sad I want to cry There is too many sad things in the world anyway It makes me happy to think about happy things Now if he d married her and You don t mind Mart she queried apprehensively I just happen to feel that way because I m tired I guess But the story was grand just the same perfectly grand Where are you goin to sell it That s a horse of another color he laughed But if you did sell it what do you think you d get for it Oh a hundred dollars That would be the least the way prices go My I do hope you ll sell it Easy money eh Then he added proudly I wrote it in two days That s fifty dollars a day He longed to read his stories to Ruth but did not dare He would wait till some were published he decided then she would understand what he had been working for In the meantime he toiled on Never had the spirit of adventure lured him more strongly than on this amazing exploration of the realm of mind He bought the text books on physics and chemistry and along with his algebra worked out problems and demonstrations He took the laboratory proofs on faith and his intense power of vision enabled him to see the reactions of chemicals more understandingly than the average student saw them in the laboratory Martin wandered on through the heavy pages overwhelmed by the clews he was getting to the nature of things He had accepted the world as the world but now he was comprehending the organization of it the play and interplay of force and matter Spontaneous explanations of old matters were continually arising in his mind Levers and purchases fascinated him and his mind roved backward to hand spikes and blocks and tackles at sea The theory of navigation which enabled the ships to travel unerringly their courses over the pathless ocean was made clear to him The mysteries of storm and rain and tide were revealed and the reason for the existence of trade winds made him wonder whether he had written his article on the northeast trade too soon At any rate he knew he could write it better now One afternoon he went out with Arthur to the University of California and with bated breath and a feeling of religious awe went through the laboratories saw demonstrations and listened to a physics professor lecturing to his classes But he did not neglect his writing A stream of short stories flowed from his pen and he branched out into the easier forms of verse the kind he saw printed in the magazines though he lost his head and wasted two weeks on a tragedy in blank verse the swift rejection of which by half a dozen magazines dumfounded him Then he discovered Henley and wrote a series of sea poems on the model of Hospital Sketches They were simple poems of light and color and romance and adventure Sea Lyrics he called them and he judged them to be the best work he had yet done There were thirty and he completed them in a month doing one a day after having done his regular day s work on fiction which day s work was the equivalent to a week s work of the average successful writer The toil meant nothing to him It was not toil He was finding speech and all the beauty and wonder that had been pent for years behind his inarticulate lips was now pouring forth in a wild and virile flood He showed the Sea Lyrics to no one not even to the editors He had become distrustful of editors But it was not distrust that prevented him from submitting the Lyrics They were so beautiful to him that he was impelled to save them to share with Ruth in some glorious far off time when he would dare to read to her what he had written Against that time he kept them with him reading them aloud going over them until he knew them by heart He lived every moment of his waking hours and he lived in his sleep his subjective mind rioting through his five hours of surcease and combining the thoughts and events of the day into grotesque and impossible marvels In reality he never rested and a weaker body or a less firmly poised brain would have been prostrated in a general break down His late afternoon calls on Ruth were rarer now for June was approaching when she would take her degree and finish with the university Bachelor of Arts when he thought of her degree it seemed she fled beyond him faster than he could pursue One afternoon a week she gave to him and arriving late he usually stayed for dinner and for music afterward Those were his red letter days The atmosphere of the house in such contrast with that in which he lived and the mere nearness to her sent him forth each time with a firmer grip on his resolve to climb the heights In spite of the beauty in him and the aching desire to create it was for her that he struggled He was a lover first and always All other things he subordinated to love Greater than his adventure in the world of thought was his love adventure The world itself was not so amazing because of the atoms and molecules that composed it according to the propulsions of irresistible force what made it amazing was the fact that Ruth lived in it She was the most amazing thing he had ever known or dreamed or guessed But he was oppressed always by her remoteness She was so far from him and he did not know how to approach her He had been a success with girls and women in his own class but he had never loved any of them while he did love her and besides she was not merely of another class His very love elevated her above all classes She was a being apart so far apart that he did not know how to draw near to her as a lover should draw near It was true as he acquired knowledge and language that he was drawing nearer talking her speech discovering ideas and delights in common but this did not satisfy his lover s yearning His lover s imagination had made her holy too holy too spiritualized to have any kinship with him in the flesh It was his own love that thrust her from him and made her seem impossible for him Love itself denied him the one thing that it desired And then one day without warning the gulf between them was bridged for a moment and thereafter though the gulf remained it was ever narrower They had been eating cherries great luscious black cherries with a juice of the color of dark wine And later as she read aloud to him from The Princess he chanced to notice the stain of the cherries on her lips For the moment her divinity was shattered She was clay after all mere clay subject to the common law of clay as his clay was subject or anybody s clay Her lips were flesh like his and cherries dyed them as cherries dyed his And if so with her lips then was it so with all of her She was woman all woman just like any woman It came upon him abruptly It was a revelation that stunned him It was as if he had seen the sun fall out of the sky or had seen worshipped purity polluted Then he realized the significance of it and his heart began pounding and challenging him to play the lover with this woman who was not a spirit from other worlds but a mere woman with lips a cherry could stain He trembled at the audacity of his thought but all his soul was singing and reason in a triumphant paean assured him he was right Something of this change in him must have reached her for she paused from her reading looked up at him and smiled His eyes dropped from her blue eyes to her lips and the sight of the stain maddened him His arms all but flashed out to her and around her in the way of his old careless life She seemed to lean toward him to wait and all his will fought to hold him back You were not following a word she pouted Then she laughed at him delighting in his confusion and as he looked into her frank eyes and knew that she had divined nothing of what he felt he became abashed He had indeed in thought dared too far Of all the women he had known there was no woman who would not have guessed save her And she had not guessed There was the difference She was different He was appalled by his own grossness awed by her clear innocence and he gazed again at her across the gulf The bridge had broken down But still the incident had brought him nearer The memory of it persisted and in the moments when he was most cast down he dwelt upon it eagerly The gulf was never again so wide He had accomplished a distance vastly greater than a bachelorship of arts or a dozen bachelorships She was pure it was true as he had never dreamed of purity but cherries stained her lips She was subject to the laws of the universe just as inexorably as he was She had to eat to live and when she got her feet wet she caught cold But that was not the point If she could feel hunger and thirst and heat and cold then could she feel love and love for a man Well he was a man And why could he not be the man It s up to me to make good he would murmur fervently I will be the man I will make myself the man I will make good CHAPTER XII 
4438_52195_000001_000000	train-clean-360	Early one evening struggling with a sonnet that twisted all awry the beauty and thought that trailed in glow and vapor through his brain Martin was called to the telephone 
4438_52195_000002_000000	train-clean-360	 It s a lady s voice a fine lady s mister Higginbotham who had called him jeered 
none	none	Martin went to the telephone in the corner of the room and felt a wave of warmth rush through him as he heard Ruth s voice 
4438_52195_000003_000001	train-clean-360	In his battle with the sonnet he had forgotten her existence and at the sound of her voice his love for her smote him like a sudden blow 
4438_52195_000003_000002	train-clean-360	And such a voice delicate and sweet like a strain of music heard far off and faint or better like a bell of silver a perfect tone crystal pure No mere woman had a voice like that 
4438_52195_000003_000003	train-clean-360	There was something celestial about it and it came from other worlds 
4438_52195_000003_000004	train-clean-360	He could scarcely hear what it said so ravished was he though he controlled his face for he knew that mister Higginbotham s ferret eyes were fixed upon him 
none	none	It was not much that Ruth wanted to say merely that Norman had been going to take her to a lecture that night but that he had a headache and she was so disappointed and she had the tickets and that if he had no other engagement would he be good enough to take her Would he 
4438_52195_000005_000001	train-clean-360	He fought to suppress the eagerness in his voice 
none	none	It was amazing He had always seen her in her own house 
4438_52195_000005_000004	train-clean-360	And he had never dared to ask her to go anywhere with him 
4438_52195_000005_000005	train-clean-360	Quite irrelevantly still at the telephone and talking with her he felt an overpowering desire to die for her and visions of heroic sacrifice shaped and dissolved in his whirling brain 
4438_52195_000005_000006	train-clean-360	He loved her so much so terribly so hopelessly 
none	none	In that moment of mad happiness that she should go out with him go to a lecture with him with him Martin Eden she soared so far above him that there seemed nothing else for him to do than die for her 
4438_52195_000005_000008	train-clean-360	It was the only fit way in which he could express the tremendous and lofty emotion he felt for her 
4438_52195_000005_000009	train-clean-360	It was the sublime abnegation of true love that comes to all lovers and it came to him there at the telephone in a whirlwind of fire and glory and to die for her he felt was to have lived and loved well 
4438_52195_000005_000010	train-clean-360	And he was only twenty one and he had never been in love before 
4438_52195_000006_000000	train-clean-360	His hand trembled as he hung up the receiver and he was weak from the organ which had stirred him 
4438_52195_000006_000001	train-clean-360	His eyes were shining like an angel s and his face was transfigured purged of all earthly dross and pure and holy 
4438_52195_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Makin dates outside eh his brother in law sneered 
none	none	You know what that means 
4438_52195_000007_000002	train-clean-360	You ll be in the police court yet 
4438_52195_000008_000000	train-clean-360	But Martin could not come down from the height 
4438_52195_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Not even the bestiality of the allusion could bring him back to earth 
4438_52195_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Anger and hurt were beneath him 
4438_52195_000008_000003	train-clean-360	He had seen a great vision and was as a god and he could feel only profound and awful pity for this maggot of a man 
4438_52195_000008_000004	train-clean-360	He did not look at him and though his eyes passed over him he did not see him and as in a dream he passed out of the room to dress 
4438_52195_000008_000005	train-clean-360	It was not until he had reached his own room and was tying his necktie that he became aware of a sound that lingered unpleasantly in his ears 
4438_52195_000008_000006	train-clean-360	On investigating this sound he identified it as the final snort of Bernard Higginbotham which somehow had not penetrated to his brain before 
none	none	As Ruth s front door closed behind them and he came down the steps with her he found himself greatly perturbed 
4438_52195_000009_000001	train-clean-360	It was not unalloyed bliss taking her to the lecture 
4438_52195_000009_000002	train-clean-360	He did not know what he ought to do 
4438_52195_000009_000003	train-clean-360	He had seen on the streets with persons of her class that the women took the men s arms 
4438_52195_000009_000004	train-clean-360	But then again he had seen them when they didn t and he wondered if it was only in the evening that arms were taken or only between husbands and wives and relatives 
4438_52195_000010_000000	train-clean-360	Just before he reached the sidewalk he remembered Minnie 
4438_52195_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Minnie had always been a stickler 
none	none	She had called him down the second time she walked out with him because he had gone along on the inside and she had laid the law down to him that a gentleman always walked on the outside when he was with a lady 
4438_52195_000010_000003	train-clean-360	And Minnie had made a practice of kicking his heels whenever they crossed from one side of the street to the other to remind him to get over on the outside 
none	none	He wondered where she had got that item of etiquette and whether it had filtered down from above and was all right 
4438_52195_000011_000000	train-clean-360	It wouldn t do any harm to try it he decided by the time they had reached the sidewalk and he swung behind Ruth and took up his station on the outside 
4438_52195_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Then the other problem presented itself 
none	none	Should he offer her his arm 
4438_52195_000011_000003	train-clean-360	He had never offered anybody his arm in his life 
4438_52195_000011_000004	train-clean-360	The girls he had known never took the fellows arms 
none	none	For the first several times they walked freely side by side and after that it was arms around the waists and heads against the fellows shoulders where the streets were unlighted 
4438_52195_000011_000006	train-clean-360	But this was different 
4438_52195_000011_000007	train-clean-360	She wasn t that kind of a girl He must do something 
none	none	He crooked the arm next to her crooked it very slightly and with secret tentativeness not invitingly but just casually as though he was accustomed to walk that way 
4438_52195_000012_000001	train-clean-360	And then the wonderful thing happened 
4438_52195_000012_000002	train-clean-360	He felt her hand upon his arm 
4438_52195_000012_000003	train-clean-360	Delicious thrills ran through him at the contact and for a few sweet moments it seemed that he had left the solid earth and was flying with her through the air 
4438_52195_000012_000004	train-clean-360	But he was soon back again perturbed by a new complication 
4438_52195_000012_000005	train-clean-360	They were crossing the street This would put him on the inside 
4438_52195_000012_000006	train-clean-360	He should be on the outside 
4438_52195_000012_000007	train-clean-360	Should he therefore drop her arm and change over 
4438_52195_000012_000008	train-clean-360	And if he did so would he have to repeat the manoeuvre the next time 
none	none	And the next 
4438_52195_000012_000010	train-clean-360	There was something wrong about it and he resolved not to caper about and play the fool 
4438_52195_000012_000011	train-clean-360	Yet he was not satisfied with his conclusion and when he found himself on the inside he talked quickly and earnestly making a show of being carried away by what he was saying so that in case he was wrong in not changing sides his enthusiasm would seem the cause for his carelessness 
4438_52195_000013_000000	train-clean-360	As they crossed Broadway he came face to face with a new problem 
4438_52195_000013_000001	train-clean-360	In the blaze of the electric lights he saw Lizzie Connolly and her giggly friend 
4438_52195_000013_000002	train-clean-360	Only for an instant he hesitated then his hand went up and his hat came off 
4438_52195_000013_000003	train-clean-360	He could not be disloyal to his kind and it was to more than Lizzie Connolly that his hat was lifted 
4438_52195_000013_000004	train-clean-360	She nodded and looked at him boldly not with soft and gentle eyes like Ruth s but with eyes that were handsome and hard and that swept on past him to Ruth and itemized her face and dress and station 
4438_52195_000013_000005	train-clean-360	And he was aware that Ruth looked too with quick eyes that were timid and mild as a dove s but which saw in a look that was a flutter on and past the working class girl in her cheap finery and under the strange hat that all working class girls were wearing just then 
4438_52195_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 What a pretty girl Ruth said a moment later 
4438_52195_000015_000000	train-clean-360	Martin could have blessed her though he said 
none	none	I don t know 
4438_52195_000016_000001	train-clean-360	I guess it s all a matter of personal taste but she doesn t strike me as being particularly pretty 
4438_52195_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Why there isn t one woman in ten thousand with features as regular as hers 
4438_52195_000017_000001	train-clean-360	They are splendid 
4438_52195_000017_000002	train-clean-360	Her face is as clear cut as a cameo 
4438_52195_000017_000003	train-clean-360	And her eyes are beautiful 
4438_52195_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 Do you think so Martin queried absently for to him there was only one beautiful woman in the world and she was beside him her hand upon his arm 
4438_52195_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Do I think so 
4438_52195_000019_000001	train-clean-360	If that girl had proper opportunity to dress mister Eden and if she were taught how to carry herself you would be fairly dazzled by her and so would all men 
4438_52195_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 She would have to be taught how to speak he commented or else most of the men wouldn t understand her 
4438_52195_000020_000001	train-clean-360	I m sure you couldn t understand a quarter of what she said if she just spoke naturally 
4438_52195_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Nonsense 
none	none	You are as bad as Arthur when you try to make your point
4438_52195_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 You forget how I talked when you first met me 
4438_52195_000022_000001	train-clean-360	I have learned a new language since then 
4438_52195_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Before that time I talked as that girl talks 
4438_52195_000022_000003	train-clean-360	Now I can manage to make myself understood sufficiently in your language to explain that you do not know that other girl s language 
4438_52195_000022_000004	train-clean-360	And do you know why she carries herself the way she does 
4438_52195_000022_000005	train-clean-360	I think about such things now though I never used to think about them and I am beginning to understand much 
4438_52195_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 But why does she 
4438_52195_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 She has worked long hours for years at machines 
4438_52195_000024_000001	train-clean-360	When one s body is young it is very pliable and hard work will mould it like putty according to the nature of the work 
4438_52195_000024_000002	train-clean-360	I can tell at a glance the trades of many workingmen I meet on the street 
none	none	Look at me 
4438_52195_000024_000004	train-clean-360	Why am I rolling all about the shop 
4438_52195_000024_000005	train-clean-360	Because of the years I put in on the sea 
none	none	If I d put in the same years cow punching with my body young and pliable I wouldn t be rolling now but I d be bow legged 
4438_52195_000024_000007	train-clean-360	And so with that girl You noticed that her eyes were what I might call hard 
4438_52195_000024_000008	train-clean-360	She has never been sheltered 
4438_52195_000024_000009	train-clean-360	She has had to take care of herself and a young girl can t take care of herself and keep her eyes soft and gentle like like yours for example 
4438_52195_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 I think you are right Ruth said in a low voice 
4438_52195_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 And it is too bad She is such a pretty girl 
4438_52195_000026_000000	train-clean-360	He looked at her and saw her eyes luminous with pity 
4438_52195_000026_000001	train-clean-360	And then he remembered that he loved her and was lost in amazement at his fortune that permitted him to love her and to take her on his arm to a lecture 
4438_52195_000027_000002	train-clean-360	Who are you 
4438_52195_000027_000000	train-clean-360	Who are you Martin Eden he demanded of himself in the looking glass that night when he got back to his room 
none	none	He gazed at himself long and curiously Who are you 
4438_52195_000027_000003	train-clean-360	What are you 
4438_52195_000027_000004	train-clean-360	Where do you belong 
4438_52195_000027_000005	train-clean-360	You belong by rights to girls like Lizzie Connolly 
4438_52195_000027_000006	train-clean-360	You belong with the legions of toil with all that is low and vulgar and unbeautiful 
4438_52195_000027_000007	train-clean-360	You belong with the oxen and the drudges in dirty surroundings among smells and stenches 
4438_52195_000027_000008	train-clean-360	There are the stale vegetables now 
4438_52195_000027_000009	train-clean-360	Those potatoes are rotting 
4438_52195_000027_000010	train-clean-360	Smell them damn you smell them 
4438_52195_000027_000013	train-clean-360	damn you 
none	none	smell them And yet you dare to open the books to listen to beautiful music to learn to love beautiful paintings to speak good English to think thoughts that none of your own kind thinks to tear yourself away from the oxen and the Lizzie Connollys and to love a pale spirit of a woman who is a million miles beyond you and who lives in the stars 
4438_52195_000027_000012	train-clean-360	Who are you and what are you 
none	none	damn you 
4438_52195_000027_000014	train-clean-360	And are you going to make good 
4438_52195_000028_000000	train-clean-360	He shook his fist at himself in the glass and sat down on the edge of the bed to dream for a space with wide eyes 
4438_52195_000028_000001	train-clean-360	Then he got out note book and algebra and lost himself in quadratic equations while the hours slipped by and the stars dimmed and the gray of dawn flooded against his window 
none	none	CHAPTER XIII It was the knot of wordy socialists and working class philosophers that held forth in the City Hall Park on warm afternoons that was responsible for the great discovery Once or twice in the month while riding through the park on his way to the library Martin dismounted from his wheel and listened to the arguments and each time he tore himself away reluctantly The tone of discussion was much lower than at mister Morse s table The men were not grave and dignified They lost their tempers easily and called one another names while oaths and obscene allusions were frequent on their lips Once or twice he had seen them come to blows And yet he knew not why there seemed something vital about the stuff of these men s thoughts Their logomachy was far more stimulating to his intellect than the reserved and quiet dogmatism of mister Morse These men who slaughtered English gesticulated like lunatics and fought one another s ideas with primitive anger seemed somehow to be more alive than mister Morse and his crony mister Butler Martin had heard Herbert Spencer quoted several times in the park but one afternoon a disciple of Spencer s appeared a seedy tramp with a dirty coat buttoned tightly at the throat to conceal the absence of a shirt Battle royal was waged amid the smoking of many cigarettes and the expectoration of much tobacco juice wherein the tramp successfully held his own even when a socialist workman sneered There is no god but the Unknowable and Herbert Spencer is his prophet Martin was puzzled as to what the discussion was about but when he rode on to the library he carried with him a new born interest in Herbert Spencer and because of the frequency with which the tramp had mentioned First Principles Martin drew out that volume So the great discovery began Once before he had tried Spencer and choosing the Principles of Psychology to begin with he had failed as abjectly as he had failed with Madam Blavatsky There had been no understanding the book and he had returned it unread But this night after algebra and physics and an attempt at a sonnet he got into bed and opened First Principles Morning found him still reading It was impossible for him to sleep Nor did he write that day He lay on the bed till his body grew tired when he tried the hard floor reading on his back the book held in the air above him or changing from side to side He slept that night and did his writing next morning and then the book tempted him and he fell reading all afternoon oblivious to everything and oblivious to the fact that that was the afternoon Ruth gave to him His first consciousness of the immediate world about him was when Bernard Higginbotham jerked open the door and demanded to know if he thought they were running a restaurant Martin Eden had been mastered by curiosity all his days He wanted to know and it was this desire that had sent him adventuring over the world But he was now learning from Spencer that he never had known and that he never could have known had he continued his sailing and wandering forever He had merely skimmed over the surface of things observing detached phenomena accumulating fragments of facts making superficial little generalizations and all and everything quite unrelated in a capricious and disorderly world of whim and chance The mechanism of the flight of birds he had watched and reasoned about with understanding but it had never entered his head to try to explain the process whereby birds as organic flying mechanisms had been developed He had never dreamed there was such a process That birds should have come to be was unguessed They always had been They just happened And as it was with birds so had it been with everything His ignorant and unprepared attempts at philosophy had been fruitless The medieval metaphysics of Kant had given him the key to nothing and had served the sole purpose of making him doubt his own intellectual powers In similar manner his attempt to study evolution had been confined to a hopelessly technical volume by Romanes He had understood nothing and the only idea he had gathered was that evolution was a dry as dust theory of a lot of little men possessed of huge and unintelligible vocabularies And now he learned that evolution was no mere theory but an accepted process of development that scientists no longer disagreed about it their only differences being over the method of evolution And here was the man Spencer organizing all knowledge for him reducing everything to unity elaborating ultimate realities and presenting to his startled gaze a universe so concrete of realization that it was like the model of a ship such as sailors make and put into glass bottles There was no caprice no chance All was law It was in obedience to law that the bird flew and it was in obedience to the same law that fermenting slime had writhed and squirmed and put out legs and wings and become a bird Martin had ascended from pitch to pitch of intellectual living and here he was at a higher pitch than ever All the hidden things were laying their secrets bare He was drunken with comprehension At night asleep he lived with the gods in colossal nightmare and awake in the day he went around like a somnambulist with absent stare gazing upon the world he had just discovered At table he failed to hear the conversation about petty and ignoble things his eager mind seeking out and following cause and effect in everything before him In the meat on the platter he saw the shining sun and traced its energy back through all its transformations to its source a hundred million miles away or traced its energy ahead to the moving muscles in his arms that enabled him to cut the meat and to the brain wherewith he willed the muscles to move to cut the meat until with inward gaze he saw the same sun shining in his brain He was entranced by illumination and did not hear the Bughouse whispered by Jim nor see the anxiety on his sister s face nor notice the rotary motion of Bernard Higginbotham s finger whereby he imparted the suggestion of wheels revolving in his brother in law s head What in a way most profoundly impressed Martin was the correlation of knowledge of all knowledge He had been curious to know things and whatever he acquired he had filed away in separate memory compartments in his brain Thus on the subject of sailing he had an immense store On the subject of woman he had a fairly large store But these two subjects had been unrelated Between the two memory compartments there had been no connection That in the fabric of knowledge there should be any connection whatever between a woman with hysterics and a schooner carrying a weather helm or heaving to in a gale would have struck him as ridiculous and impossible But Herbert Spencer had shown him not only that it was not ridiculous but that it was impossible for there to be no connection All things were related to all other things from the farthermost star in the wastes of space to the myriads of atoms in the grain of sand under one s foot This new concept was a perpetual amazement to Martin and he found himself engaged continually in tracing the relationship between all things under the sun and on the other side of the sun He drew up lists of the most incongruous things and was unhappy until he succeeded in establishing kinship between them all kinship between love poetry earthquake fire rattlesnakes rainbows precious gems monstrosities sunsets the roaring of lions illuminating gas cannibalism beauty murder lovers fulcrums and tobacco Thus he unified the universe and held it up and looked at it or wandered through its byways and alleys and jungles not as a terrified traveller in the thick of mysteries seeking an unknown goal but observing and charting and becoming familiar with all there was to know And the more he knew the more passionately he admired the universe and life and his own life in the midst of it all You fool he cried at his image in the looking glass You wanted to write and you tried to write and you had nothing in you to write about What did you have in you some childish notions a few half baked sentiments a lot of undigested beauty a great black mass of ignorance a heart filled to bursting with love and an ambition as big as your love and as futile as your ignorance And you wanted to write Why you re just on the edge of beginning to get something in you to write about You wanted to create beauty but how could you when you knew nothing about the nature of beauty You wanted to write about life when you knew nothing of the essential characteristics of life You wanted to write about the world and the scheme of existence when the world was a Chinese puzzle to you and all that you could have written would have been about what you did not know of the scheme of existence But cheer up Martin my boy You ll write yet You know a little a very little and you re on the right road now to know more Some day if you re lucky you may come pretty close to knowing all that may be known Then you will write He brought his great discovery to Ruth sharing with her all his joy and wonder in it But she did not seem to be so enthusiastic over it She tacitly accepted it and in a way seemed aware of it from her own studies It did not stir her deeply as it did him and he would have been surprised had he not reasoned it out that it was not new and fresh to her as it was to him Arthur and Norman he found believed in evolution and had read Spencer though it did not seem to have made any vital impression upon them while the young fellow with the glasses and the mop of hair Will Olney sneered disagreeably at Spencer and repeated the epigram There is no god but the Unknowable and Herbert Spencer is his prophet But Martin forgave him the sneer for he had begun to discover that Olney was not in love with Ruth Later he was dumfounded to learn from various little happenings not only that Olney did not care for Ruth but that he had a positive dislike for her Martin could not understand this It was a bit of phenomena that he could not correlate with all the rest of the phenomena in the universe But nevertheless he felt sorry for the young fellow because of the great lack in his nature that prevented him from a proper appreciation of Ruth s fineness and beauty They rode out into the hills several Sundays on their wheels and Martin had ample opportunity to observe the armed truce that existed between Ruth and Olney The latter chummed with Norman throwing Arthur and Martin into company with Ruth for which Martin was duly grateful Those Sundays were great days for Martin greatest because he was with Ruth and great also because they were putting him more on a par with the young men of her class In spite of their long years of disciplined education he was finding himself their intellectual equal and the hours spent with them in conversation was so much practice for him in the use of the grammar he had studied so hard He had abandoned the etiquette books falling back upon observation to show him the right things to do Except when carried away by his enthusiasm he was always on guard keenly watchful of their actions and learning their little courtesies and refinements of conduct The fact that Spencer was very little read was for some time a source of surprise to Martin Herbert Spencer said the man at the desk in the library oh yes a great mind But the man did not seem to know anything of the content of that great mind One evening at dinner when mister Butler was there Martin turned the conversation upon Spencer mister Morse bitterly arraigned the English philosopher s agnosticism but confessed that he had not read First Principles while mister Butler stated that he had no patience with Spencer had never read a line of him and had managed to get along quite well without him Doubts arose in Martin s mind and had he been less strongly individual he would have accepted the general opinion and given Herbert Spencer up As it was he found Spencer s explanation of things convincing and as he phrased it to himself to give up Spencer would be equivalent to a navigator throwing the compass and chronometer overboard So Martin went on into a thorough study of evolution mastering more and more the subject himself and being convinced by the corroborative testimony of a thousand independent writers The more he studied the more vistas he caught of fields of knowledge yet unexplored and the regret that days were only twenty four hours long became a chronic complaint with him One day because the days were so short he decided to give up algebra and geometry Trigonometry he had not even attempted Then he cut chemistry from his study list retaining only physics I am not a specialist he said in defence to Ruth Nor am I going to try to be a specialist There are too many special fields for any one man in a whole lifetime to master a tithe of them I must pursue general knowledge When I need the work of specialists I shall refer to their books But that is not like having the knowledge yourself she protested But it is unnecessary to have it We profit from the work of the specialists That s what they are for When I came in I noticed the chimney sweeps at work They re specialists and when they get done you will enjoy clean chimneys without knowing anything about the construction of chimneys That s far fetched I am afraid She looked at him curiously and he felt a reproach in her gaze and manner But he was convinced of the rightness of his position All thinkers on general subjects the greatest minds in the world in fact rely on the specialists Herbert Spencer did that He generalized upon the findings of thousands of investigators He would have had to live a thousand lives in order to do it all himself And so with Darwin He took advantage of all that had been learned by the florists and cattle breeders You re right Martin Olney said You know what you re after and Ruth doesn t She doesn t know what she is after for herself even Oh yes Olney rushed on heading off her objection I know you call it general culture But it doesn t matter what you study if you want general culture You can study French or you can study German or cut them both out and study Esperanto you ll get the culture tone just the same You can study Greek or Latin too for the same purpose though it will never be any use to you It will be culture though Why Ruth studied Saxon became clever in it that was two years ago and all that she remembers of it now is Whan that sweet Aprile with his schowers soote isn t that the way it goes But it s given you the culture tone just the same he laughed again heading her off I know We were in the same classes But you speak of culture as if it should be a means to something Ruth cried out Her eyes were flashing and in her cheeks were two spots of color Culture is the end in itself But that is not what Martin wants How do you know What do you want Martin Olney demanded turning squarely upon him Martin felt very uncomfortable and looked entreaty at Ruth Yes what do you want Ruth asked That will settle it Yes of course I want culture Martin faltered I love beauty and culture will give me a finer and keener appreciation of beauty She nodded her head and looked triumph Rot and you know it was Olney s comment Martin s after career not culture It just happens that culture in his case is incidental to career If he wanted to be a chemist culture would be unnecessary Martin wants to write but he s afraid to say so because it will put you in the wrong And why does Martin want to write he went on Because he isn t rolling in wealth Why do you fill your head with Saxon and general culture Because you don t have to make your way in the world Your father sees to that He buys your clothes for you and all the rest What rotten good is our education yours and mine and Arthur s and Norman s We re soaked in general culture and if our daddies went broke to day we d be falling down to morrow on teachers examinations The best job you could get Ruth would be a country school or music teacher in a girls boarding school And pray what would you do she asked Not a blessed thing I could earn a dollar and a half a day common labor and I might get in as instructor in Hanley s cramming joint I say might mind you and I might be chucked out at the end of the week for sheer inability Martin followed the discussion closely and while he was convinced that Olney was right he resented the rather cavalier treatment he accorded Ruth A new conception of love formed in his mind as he listened Reason had nothing to do with love It mattered not whether the woman he loved reasoned correctly or incorrectly Love was above reason If it just happened that she did not fully appreciate his necessity for a career that did not make her a bit less lovable She was all lovable and what she thought had nothing to do with her lovableness What s that he replied to a question from Olney that broke in upon his train of thought I was saying that I hoped you wouldn t be fool enough to tackle Latin But Latin is more than culture Ruth broke in It is equipment Well are you going to tackle it Olney persisted Martin was sore beset He could see that Ruth was hanging eagerly upon his answer I am afraid I won t have time he said finally I d like to but I won t have time You see Martin s not seeking culture Olney exulted He s trying to get somewhere to do something Oh but it s mental training It s mind discipline It s what makes disciplined minds Ruth looked expectantly at Martin as if waiting for him to change his judgment You know the foot ball players have to train before the big game And that is what Latin does for the thinker It trains Rot and bosh That s what they told us when we were kids But there is one thing they didn t tell us then They let us find it out for ourselves afterwards Olney paused for effect then added And what they didn t tell us was that every gentleman should have studied Latin but that no gentleman should know Latin Now that s unfair Ruth cried I knew you were turning the conversation just in order to get off something It s clever all right was the retort but it s fair too The only men who know their Latin are the apothecaries the lawyers and the Latin professors And if Martin wants to be one of them I miss my guess But what s all that got to do with Herbert Spencer anyway Martin s just discovered Spencer and he s wild over him Why Because Spencer is taking him somewhere Spencer couldn t take me anywhere nor you We haven t got anywhere to go You ll get married some day and I ll have nothing to do but keep track of the lawyers and business agents who will take care of the money my father s going to leave me Onley got up to go but turned at the door and delivered a parting shot You leave Martin alone Ruth He knows what s best for himself Look at what he s done already He makes me sick sometimes sick and ashamed of myself He knows more now about the world and life and man s place and all the rest than Arthur or Norman or I or you too for that matter and in spite of all our Latin and French and Saxon and culture But Ruth is my teacher Martin answered chivalrously She is responsible for what little I have learned Rats Olney looked at Ruth and his expression was malicious I suppose you ll be telling me next that you read Spencer on her recommendation only you didn t And she doesn t know anything more about Darwin and evolution than I do about King Solomon s mines What s that jawbreaker definition about something or other of Spencer s that you sprang on us the other day that indefinite incoherent homogeneity thing Spring it on her and see if she understands a word of it That isn t culture you see Well tra la and if you tackle Latin Martin I won t have any respect for you And all the while interested in the discussion Martin had been aware of an irk in it as well It was about studies and lessons dealing with the rudiments of knowledge and the schoolboyish tone of it conflicted with the big things that were stirring in him with the grip upon life that was even then crooking his fingers like eagle s talons with the cosmic thrills that made him ache and with the inchoate consciousness of mastery of it all He likened himself to a poet wrecked on the shores of a strange land filled with power of beauty stumbling and stammering and vainly trying to sing in the rough barbaric tongue of his brethren in the new land And so with him He was alive painfully alive to the great universal things and yet he was compelled to potter and grope among schoolboy topics and debate whether or not he should study Latin What in hell has Latin to do with it he demanded before his mirror that night I wish dead people would stay dead Why should I and the beauty in me be ruled by the dead Beauty is alive and everlasting Languages come and go They are the dust of the dead And his next thought was that he had been phrasing his ideas very well and he went to bed wondering why he could not talk in similar fashion when he was with Ruth He was only a schoolboy with a schoolboy s tongue when he was in her presence Give me time he said aloud Only give me time Time Time Time was his unending plaint CHAPTER XIV It was not because of Olney but in spite of Ruth and his love for Ruth that he finally decided not to take up Latin His money meant time There was so much that was more important than Latin so many studies that clamored with imperious voices And he must write He must earn money He had had no acceptances Twoscore of manuscripts were travelling the endless round of the magazines How did the others do it He spent long hours in the free reading room going over what others had written studying their work eagerly and critically comparing it with his own and wondering wondering about the secret trick they had discovered which enabled them to sell their work He was amazed at the immense amount of printed stuff that was dead No light no life no color was shot through it There was no breath of life in it and yet it sold at two cents a word twenty dollars a thousand the newspaper clipping had said so He was puzzled by countless short stories written lightly and cleverly he confessed but without vitality or reality Life was so strange and wonderful filled with an immensity of problems of dreams and of heroic toils and yet these stories dealt only with the commonplaces of life He felt the stress and strain of life its fevers and sweats and wild insurgences surely this was the stuff to write about He wanted to glorify the leaders of forlorn hopes the mad lovers the giants that fought under stress and strain amid terror and tragedy making life crackle with the strength of their endeavor And yet the magazine short stories seemed intent on glorifying the mister Butlers the sordid dollar chasers and the commonplace little love affairs of commonplace little men and women Was it because the editors of the magazines were commonplace he demanded Or were they afraid of life these writers and editors and readers But his chief trouble was that he did not know any editors or writers And not merely did he not know any writers but he did not know anybody who had ever attempted to write There was nobody to tell him to hint to him to give him the least word of advice He began to doubt that editors were real men They seemed cogs in a machine That was what it was a machine He poured his soul into stories articles and poems and intrusted them to the machine He folded them just so put the proper stamps inside the long envelope along with the manuscript sealed the envelope put more stamps outside and dropped it into the mail box It travelled across the continent and after a certain lapse of time the postman returned him the manuscript in another long envelope on the outside of which were the stamps he had enclosed There was no human editor at the other end but a mere cunning arrangement of cogs that changed the manuscript from one envelope to another and stuck on the stamps It was like the slot machines wherein one dropped pennies and with a metallic whirl of machinery had delivered to him a stick of chewing gum or a tablet of chocolate It depended upon which slot one dropped the penny in whether he got chocolate or gum And so with the editorial machine One slot brought checks and the other brought rejection slips So far he had found only the latter slot It was the rejection slips that completed the horrible machinelikeness of the process These slips were printed in stereotyped forms and he had received hundreds of them as many as a dozen or more on each of his earlier manuscripts If he had received one line one personal line along with one rejection of all his rejections he would have been cheered But not one editor had given that proof of existence And he could conclude only that there were no warm human men at the other end only mere cogs well oiled and running beautifully in the machine He was a good fighter whole souled and stubborn and he would have been content to continue feeding the machine for years but he was bleeding to death and not years but weeks would determine the fight Each week his board bill brought him nearer destruction while the postage on forty manuscripts bled him almost as severely He no longer bought books and he economized in petty ways and sought to delay the inevitable end though he did not know how to economize and brought the end nearer by a week when he gave his sister Marian five dollars for a dress He struggled in the dark without advice without encouragement and in the teeth of discouragement Even Gertrude was beginning to look askance At first she had tolerated with sisterly fondness what she conceived to be his foolishness but now out of sisterly solicitude she grew anxious To her it seemed that his foolishness was becoming a madness Martin knew this and suffered more keenly from it than from the open and nagging contempt of Bernard Higginbotham Martin had faith in himself but he was alone in this faith Not even Ruth had faith She had wanted him to devote himself to study and though she had not openly disapproved of his writing she had never approved He had never offered to show her his work A fastidious delicacy had prevented him Besides she had been studying heavily at the university and he felt averse to robbing her of her time But when she had taken her degree she asked him herself to let her see something of what he had been doing Martin was elated and diffident Here was a judge She was a bachelor of arts She had studied literature under skilled instructors Perhaps the editors were capable judges too But she would be different from them She would not hand him a stereotyped rejection slip nor would she inform him that lack of preference for his work did not necessarily imply lack of merit in his work She would talk a warm human being in her quick bright way and most important of all she would catch glimpses of the real Martin Eden In his work she would discern what his heart and soul were like and she would come to understand something a little something of the stuff of his dreams and the strength of his power Martin gathered together a number of carbon copies of his short stories hesitated a moment then added his Sea Lyrics They mounted their wheels on a late June afternoon and rode for the hills It was the second time he had been out with her alone and as they rode along through the balmy warmth just chilled by she sea breeze to refreshing coolness he was profoundly impressed by the fact that it was a very beautiful and well ordered world and that it was good to be alive and to love They left their wheels by the roadside and climbed to the brown top of an open knoll where the sunburnt grass breathed a harvest breath of dry sweetness and content Its work is done Martin said as they seated themselves she upon his coat and he sprawling close to the warm earth He sniffed the sweetness of the tawny grass which entered his brain and set his thoughts whirling on from the particular to the universal It has achieved its reason for existence he went on patting the dry grass affectionately It quickened with ambition under the dreary downpour of last winter fought the violent early spring flowered and lured the insects and the bees scattered its seeds squared itself with its duty and the world and Why do you always look at things with such dreadfully practical eyes she interrupted Because I ve been studying evolution I guess It s only recently that I got my eyesight if the truth were told But it seems to me you lose sight of beauty by being so practical that you destroy beauty like the boys who catch butterflies and rub the down off their beautiful wings He shook his head Beauty has significance but I never knew its significance before I just accepted beauty as something meaningless as something that was just beautiful without rhyme or reason I did not know anything about beauty But now I know or rather am just beginning to know This grass is more beautiful to me now that I know why it is grass and all the hidden chemistry of sun and rain and earth that makes it become grass Why there is romance in the life history of any grass yes and adventure too The very thought of it stirs me When I think of the play of force and matter and all the tremendous struggle of it I feel as if I could write an epic on the grass How well you talk she said absently and he noted that she was looking at him in a searching way He was all confusion and embarrassment on the instant the blood flushing red on his neck and brow I hope I am learning to talk he stammered There seems to be so much in me I want to say But it is all so big I can t find ways to say what is really in me Sometimes it seems to me that all the world all life everything had taken up residence inside of me and was clamoring for me to be the spokesman I feel oh I can t describe it I feel the bigness of it but when I speak I babble like a little child It is a great task to transmute feeling and sensation into speech written or spoken that will in turn in him who reads or listens transmute itself back into the selfsame feeling and sensation It is a lordly task See I bury my face in the grass and the breath I draw in through my nostrils sets me quivering with a thousand thoughts and fancies It is a breath of the universe I have breathed I know song and laughter and success and pain and struggle and death and I see visions that arise in my brain somehow out of the scent of the grass and I would like to tell them to you to the world But how can I My tongue is tied I have tried by the spoken word just now to describe to you the effect on me of the scent of the grass But I have not succeeded I have no more than hinted in awkward speech My words seem gibberish to me And yet I am stifled with desire to tell Oh he threw up his hands with a despairing gesture it is impossible It is not understandable It is incommunicable But you do talk well she insisted Just think how you have improved in the short time I have known you mister Butler is a noted public speaker He is always asked by the State Committee to go out on stump during campaign Yet you talked just as well as he the other night at dinner Only he was more controlled You get too excited but you will get over that with practice Why you would make a good public speaker You can go far if you want to You are masterly You can lead men I am sure and there is no reason why you should not succeed at anything you set your hand to just as you have succeeded with grammar You would make a good lawyer You should shine in politics There is nothing to prevent you from making as great a success as mister Butler has made And minus the dyspepsia she added with a smile They talked on she in her gently persistent way returning always to the need of thorough grounding in education and to the advantages of Latin as part of the foundation for any career She drew her ideal of the successful man and it was largely in her father s image with a few unmistakable lines and touches of color from the image of mister Butler He listened eagerly with receptive ears lying on his back and looking up and joying in each movement of her lips as she talked But his brain was not receptive There was nothing alluring in the pictures she drew and he was aware of a dull pain of disappointment and of a sharper ache of love for her In all she said there was no mention of his writing and the manuscripts he had brought to read lay neglected on the ground At last in a pause he glanced at the sun measured its height above the horizon and suggested his manuscripts by picking them up I had forgotten she said quickly And I am so anxious to hear He read to her a story one that he flattered himself was among his very best He called it The Wine of Life and the wine of it that had stolen into his brain when he wrote it stole into his brain now as he read it There was a certain magic in the original conception and he had adorned it with more magic of phrase and touch All the old fire and passion with which he had written it were reborn in him and he was swayed and swept away so that he was blind and deaf to the faults of it But it was not so with Ruth Her trained ear detected the weaknesses and exaggerations the overemphasis of the tyro and she was instantly aware each time the sentence rhythm tripped and faltered She scarcely noted the rhythm otherwise except when it became too pompous at which moments she was disagreeably impressed with its amateurishness That was her final judgment on the story as a whole amateurish though she did not tell him so Instead when he had done she pointed out the minor flaws and said that she liked the story But he was disappointed Her criticism was just He acknowledged that but he had a feeling that he was not sharing his work with her for the purpose of schoolroom correction The details did not matter They could take care of themselves He could mend them he could learn to mend them Out of life he had captured something big and attempted to imprison it in the story It was the big thing out of life he had read to her not sentence structure and semicolons He wanted her to feel with him this big thing that was his that he had seen with his own eyes grappled with his own brain and placed there on the page with his own hands in printed words Well he had failed was his secret decision Perhaps the editors were right He had felt the big thing but he had failed to transmute it He concealed his disappointment and joined so easily with her in her criticism that she did not realize that deep down in him was running a strong undercurrent of disagreement This next thing I ve called The Pot he said unfolding the manuscript It has been refused by four or five magazines now but still I think it is good In fact I don t know what to think of it except that I ve caught something there Maybe it won t affect you as it does me It s a short thing only two thousand words How dreadful she cried when he had finished It is horrible unutterably horrible He noted her pale face her eyes wide and tense and her clenched hands with secret satisfaction He had succeeded He had communicated the stuff of fancy and feeling from out of his brain It had struck home No matter whether she liked it or not it had gripped her and mastered her made her sit there and listen and forget details It is life he said and life is not always beautiful And yet perhaps because I am strangely made I find something beautiful there It seems to me that the beauty is tenfold enhanced because it is there But why couldn t the poor woman she broke in disconnectedly Then she left the revolt of her thought unexpressed to cry out Oh It is degrading It is not nice It is nasty For the moment it seemed to him that his heart stood still Nasty He had never dreamed it He had not meant it The whole sketch stood before him in letters of fire and in such blaze of illumination he sought vainly for nastiness Then his heart began to beat again He was not guilty Why didn t you select a nice subject she was saying We know there are nasty things in the world but that is no reason She talked on in her indignant strain but he was not following her He was smiling to himself as he looked up into her virginal face so innocent so penetratingly innocent that its purity seemed always to enter into him driving out of him all dross and bathing him in some ethereal effulgence that was as cool and soft and velvety as starshine We know there are nasty things in the world He cuddled to him the notion of her knowing and chuckled over it as a love joke The next moment in a flashing vision of multitudinous detail he sighted the whole sea of life s nastiness that he had known and voyaged over and through and he forgave her for not understanding the story It was through no fault of hers that she could not understand He thanked God that she had been born and sheltered to such innocence But he knew life its foulness as well as its fairness its greatness in spite of the slime that infested it and by God he was going to have his say on it to the world Saints in heaven how could they be anything but fair and pure No praise to them But saints in slime ah that was the everlasting wonder That was what made life worth while To see moral grandeur rising out of cesspools of iniquity to rise himself and first glimpse beauty faint and far through mud dripping eyes to see out of weakness and frailty and viciousness and all abysmal brutishness arising strength and truth and high spiritual endowment He caught a stray sequence of sentences she was uttering The tone of it all is low And there is so much that is high Take In Memoriam He was impelled to suggest Locksley Hall and would have done so had not his vision gripped him again and left him staring at her the female of his kind who out of the primordial ferment creeping and crawling up the vast ladder of life for a thousand thousand centuries had emerged on the topmost rung having become one Ruth pure and fair and divine and with power to make him know love and to aspire toward purity and to desire to taste divinity him Martin Eden who too had come up in some amazing fashion from out of the ruck and the mire and the countless mistakes and abortions of unending creation There was the romance and the wonder and the glory There was the stuff to write if he could only find speech Saints in heaven They were only saints and could not help themselves But he was a man You have strength he could hear her saying but it is untutored strength Like a bull in a china shop he suggested and won a smile And you must develop discrimination You must consult taste and fineness and tone I dare too much he muttered She smiled approbation and settled herself to listen to another story I don t know what you ll make of this he said apologetically It s a funny thing I m afraid I got beyond my depth in it but my intentions were good Don t bother about the little features of it Just see if you catch the feel of the big thing in it It is big and it is true though the chance is large that I have failed to make it intelligible He read and as he read he watched her At last he had reached her he thought She sat without movement her eyes steadfast upon him scarcely breathing caught up and out of herself he thought by the witchery of the thing he had created He had entitled the story Adventure and it was the apotheosis of adventure not of the adventure of the storybooks but of real adventure the savage taskmaster awful of punishment and awful of reward faithless and whimsical demanding terrible patience and heartbreaking days and nights of toil offering the blazing sunlight glory or dark death at the end of thirst and famine or of the long drag and monstrous delirium of rotting fever through blood and sweat and stinging insects leading up by long chains of petty and ignoble contacts to royal culminations and lordly achievements It was this all of it and more that he had put into his story and it was this he believed that warmed her as she sat and listened Her eyes were wide color was in her pale cheeks and before he finished it seemed to him that she was almost panting Truly she was warmed but she was warmed not by the story but by him She did not think much of the story it was Martin s intensity of power the old excess of strength that seemed to pour from his body and on and over her The paradox of it was that it was the story itself that was freighted with his power that was the channel for the time being through which his strength poured out to her She was aware only of the strength and not of the medium and when she seemed most carried away by what he had written in reality she had been carried away by something quite foreign to it by a thought terrible and perilous that had formed itself unsummoned in her brain She had caught herself wondering what marriage was like and the becoming conscious of the waywardness and ardor of the thought had terrified her It was unmaidenly It was not like her She had never been tormented by womanhood and she had lived in a dreamland of Tennysonian poesy dense even to the full significance of that delicate master s delicate allusions to the grossnesses that intrude upon the relations of queens and knights She had been asleep always and now life was thundering imperatively at all her doors Mentally she was in a panic to shoot the bolts and drop the bars into place while wanton instincts urged her to throw wide her portals and bid the deliciously strange visitor to enter in Martin waited with satisfaction for her verdict He had no doubt of what it would be and he was astounded when he heard her say It is beautiful It is beautiful she repeated with emphasis after a pause Of course it was beautiful but there was something more than mere beauty in it something more stingingly splendid which had made beauty its handmaiden He sprawled silently on the ground watching the grisly form of a great doubt rising before him He had failed He was inarticulate He had seen one of the greatest things in the world and he had not expressed it What did you think of the He hesitated abashed at his first attempt to use a strange word Of the motif he asked It was confused she answered That is my only criticism in the large way I followed the story but there seemed so much else It is too wordy You clog the action by introducing so much extraneous material That was the major motif he hurriedly explained the big underrunning motif the cosmic and universal thing I tried to make it keep time with the story itself which was only superficial after all I was on the right scent but I guess I did it badly I did not succeed in suggesting what I was driving at But I ll learn in time She did not follow him She was a bachelor of arts but he had gone beyond her limitations This she did not comprehend attributing her incomprehension to his incoherence You were too voluble she said But it was beautiful in places He heard her voice as from far off for he was debating whether he would read her the Sea Lyrics He lay in dull despair while she watched him searchingly pondering again upon unsummoned and wayward thoughts of marriage You want to be famous she asked abruptly Yes a little bit he confessed That is part of the adventure It is not the being famous but the process of becoming so that counts And after all to be famous would be for me only a means to something else I want to be famous very much for that matter and for that reason For your sake he wanted to add and might have added had she proved enthusiastic over what he had read to her But she was too busy in her mind carving out a career for him that would at least be possible to ask what the ultimate something was which he had hinted at There was no career for him in literature Of that she was convinced He had proved it to day with his amateurish and sophomoric productions He could talk well but he was incapable of expressing himself in a literary way She compared Tennyson and Browning and her favorite prose masters with him and to his hopeless discredit Yet she did not tell him her whole mind Her strange interest in him led her to temporize His desire to write was after all a little weakness which he would grow out of in time Then he would devote himself to the more serious affairs of life And he would succeed too She knew that He was so strong that he could not fail if only he would drop writing I wish you would show me all you write mister Eden she said He flushed with pleasure She was interested that much was sure And at least she had not given him a rejection slip She had called certain portions of his work beautiful and that was the first encouragement he had ever received from any one I will he said passionately And I promise you Miss Morse that I will make good I have come far I know that and I have far to go and I will cover it if I have to do it on my hands and knees He held up a bunch of manuscript Here are the Sea Lyrics When you get home I ll turn them over to you to read at your leisure And you must be sure to tell me just what you think of them What I need you know above all things is criticism And do please be frank with me I will be perfectly frank she promised with an uneasy conviction that she had not been frank with him and with a doubt if she could be quite frank with him the next time CHAPTER XV The first battle fought and finished Martin said to the looking glass ten days later But there will be a second battle and a third battle and battles to the end of time unless He had not finished the sentence but looked about the mean little room and let his eyes dwell sadly upon a heap of returned manuscripts still in their long envelopes which lay in a corner on the floor He had no stamps with which to continue them on their travels and for a week they had been piling up More of them would come in on the morrow and on the next day and the next till they were all in And he would be unable to start them out again He was a month s rent behind on the typewriter which he could not pay having barely enough for the week s board which was due and for the employment office fees He sat down and regarded the table thoughtfully There were ink stains upon it and he suddenly discovered that he was fond of it Dear old table he said I ve spent some happy hours with you and you ve been a pretty good friend when all is said and done You never turned me down never passed me out a reward of unmerit rejection slip never complained about working overtime He dropped his arms upon the table and buried his face in them His throat was aching and he wanted to cry It reminded him of his first fight when he was six years old when he punched away with the tears running down his cheeks while the other boy two years his elder had beaten and pounded him into exhaustion He saw the ring of boys howling like barbarians as he went down at last writhing in the throes of nausea the blood streaming from his nose and the tears from his bruised eyes Poor little shaver he murmured And you re just as badly licked now You re beaten to a pulp You re down and out But the vision of that first fight still lingered under his eyelids and as he watched he saw it dissolve and reshape into the series of fights which had followed Six months later Cheese Face that was the boy had whipped him again But he had blacked Cheese Face s eye that time That was going some He saw them all fight after fight himself always whipped and Cheese Face exulting over him But he had never run away He felt strengthened by the memory of that He had always stayed and taken his medicine Cheese Face had been a little fiend at fighting and had never once shown mercy to him But he had stayed He had stayed with it Next he saw a narrow alley between ramshackle frame buildings The end of the alley was blocked by a one story brick building out of which issued the rhythmic thunder of the presses running off the first edition of the Enquirer He was eleven and Cheese Face was thirteen and they both carried the Enquirer That was why they were there waiting for their papers And of course Cheese Face had picked on him again and there was another fight that was indeterminate because at quarter to four the door of the press room was thrown open and the gang of boys crowded in to fold their papers I ll lick you to morrow he heard Cheese Face promise and he heard his own voice piping and trembling with unshed tears agreeing to be there on the morrow And he had come there the next day hurrying from school to be there first and beating Cheese Face by two minutes The other boys said he was all right and gave him advice pointing out his faults as a scrapper and promising him victory if he carried out their instructions The same boys gave Cheese Face advice too How they had enjoyed the fight He paused in his recollections long enough to envy them the spectacle he and Cheese Face had put up Then the fight was on and it went on without rounds for thirty minutes until the press room door was opened He watched the youthful apparition of himself day after day hurrying from school to the Enquirer alley He could not walk very fast He was stiff and lame from the incessant fighting His forearms were black and blue from wrist to elbow what of the countless blows he had warded off and here and there the tortured flesh was beginning to fester His head and arms and shoulders ached the small of his back ached he ached all over and his brain was heavy and dazed He did not play at school Nor did he study Even to sit still all day at his desk as he did was a torment It seemed centuries since he had begun the round of daily fights and time stretched away into a nightmare and infinite future of daily fights Why couldn t Cheese Face be licked he often thought that would put him Martin out of his misery It never entered his head to cease fighting to allow Cheese Face to whip him And so he dragged himself to the Enquirer alley sick in body and soul but learning the long patience to confront his eternal enemy Cheese Face who was just as sick as he and just a bit willing to quit if it were not for the gang of newsboys that looked on and made pride painful and necessary One afternoon after twenty minutes of desperate efforts to annihilate each other according to set rules that did not permit kicking striking below the belt nor hitting when one was down Cheese Face panting for breath and reeling offered to call it quits And Martin head on arms thrilled at the picture he caught of himself at that moment in the afternoon of long ago when he reeled and panted and choked with the blood that ran into his mouth and down his throat from his cut lips when he tottered toward Cheese Face spitting out a mouthful of blood so that he could speak crying out that he would never quit though Cheese Face could give in if he wanted to And Cheese Face did not give in and the fight went on The next day and the next days without end witnessed the afternoon fight When he put up his arms each day to begin they pained exquisitely and the first few blows struck and received racked his soul after that things grew numb and he fought on blindly seeing as in a dream dancing and wavering the large features and burning animal like eyes of Cheese Face He concentrated upon that face all else about him was a whirling void There was nothing else in the world but that face and he would never know rest blessed rest until he had beaten that face into a pulp with his bleeding knuckles or until the bleeding knuckles that somehow belonged to that face had beaten him into a pulp And then one way or the other he would have rest But to quit for him Martin to quit that was impossible Came the day when he dragged himself into the Enquirer alley and there was no Cheese Face Nor did Cheese Face come The boys congratulated him and told him that he had licked Cheese Face But Martin was not satisfied He had not licked Cheese Face nor had Cheese Face licked him The problem had not been solved It was not until afterward that they learned that Cheese Face s father had died suddenly that very day Martin skipped on through the years to the night in the nigger heaven at the Auditorium He was seventeen and just back from sea A row started Somebody was bullying somebody and Martin interfered to be confronted by Cheese Face s blazing eyes I ll fix you after de show his ancient enemy hissed Martin nodded The nigger heaven bouncer was making his way toward the disturbance I ll meet you outside after the last act Martin whispered the while his face showed undivided interest in the buck and wing dancing on the stage The bouncer glared and went away Got a gang he asked Cheese Face at the end of the act Sure Then I got to get one Martin announced Between the acts he mustered his following three fellows he knew from the nail works a railroad fireman and half a dozen of the Boo Gang along with as many more from the dread Eighteen and Market Gang When the theatre let out the two gangs strung along inconspicuously on opposite sides of the street When they came to a quiet corner they united and held a council of war Eighth Street Bridge is the place said a red headed fellow belonging to Cheese Face s Gang You kin fight in the middle under the electric light an whichever way the bulls come in we kin sneak the other way That s agreeable to me Martin said after consulting with the leaders of his own gang The Eighth Street Bridge crossing an arm of San Antonio Estuary was the length of three city blocks In the middle of the bridge and at each end were electric lights No policeman could pass those end lights unseen It was the safe place for the battle that revived itself under Martin s eyelids He saw the two gangs aggressive and sullen rigidly keeping apart from each other and backing their respective champions and he saw himself and Cheese Face stripping A short distance away lookouts were set their task being to watch the lighted ends of the bridge A member of the Boo Gang held Martin s coat and shirt and cap ready to race with them into safety in case the police interfered Martin watched himself go into the centre facing Cheese Face and he heard himself say as he held up his hand warningly They ain t no hand shakin in this Understand They ain t nothin but scrap No throwin up the sponge This is a grudge fight an it s to a finish Understand Somebody s goin to get licked Cheese Face wanted to demur Martin could see that but Cheese Face s old perilous pride was touched before the two gangs Aw come on he replied Wot s the good of chewin de rag about it I m wit cheh to de finish Then they fell upon each other like young bulls in all the glory of youth with naked fists with hatred with desire to hurt to maim to destroy All the painful thousand years gains of man in his upward climb through creation were lost Only the electric light remained a milestone on the path of the great human adventure Martin and Cheese Face were two savages of the stone age of the squatting place and the tree refuge They sank lower and lower into the muddy abyss back into the dregs of the raw beginnings of life striving blindly and chemically as atoms strive as the star dust if the heavens strives colliding recoiling and colliding again and eternally again God We are animals Brute beasts Martin muttered aloud as he watched the progress of the fight It was to him with his splendid power of vision like gazing into a kinetoscope He was both onlooker and participant His long months of culture and refinement shuddered at the sight then the present was blotted out of his consciousness and the ghosts of the past possessed him and he was Martin Eden just returned from sea and fighting Cheese Face on the Eighth Street Bridge He suffered and toiled and sweated and bled and exulted when his naked knuckles smashed home They were twin whirlwinds of hatred revolving about each other monstrously The time passed and the two hostile gangs became very quiet They had never witnessed such intensity of ferocity and they were awed by it The two fighters were greater brutes than they The first splendid velvet edge of youth and condition wore off and they fought more cautiously and deliberately There had been no advantage gained either way It s anybody s fight Martin heard some one saying Then he followed up a feint right and left was fiercely countered and felt his cheek laid open to the bone No bare knuckle had done that He heard mutters of amazement at the ghastly damage wrought and was drenched with his own blood But he gave no sign He became immensely wary for he was wise with knowledge of the low cunning and foul vileness of his kind He watched and waited until he feigned a wild rush which he stopped midway for he had seen the glint of metal Hold up yer hand he screamed Them s brass knuckles an you hit me with em Both gangs surged forward growling and snarling In a second there would be a free for all fight and he would be robbed of his vengeance He was beside himself You guys keep out he screamed hoarsely Understand Say d ye understand They shrank away from him They were brutes but he was the arch brute a thing of terror that towered over them and dominated them This is my scrap an they ain t goin to be no buttin in Gimme them knuckles Cheese Face sobered and a bit frightened surrendered the foul weapon You passed em to him you red head sneakin in behind the push there Martin went on as he tossed the knuckles into the water I seen you an I was wonderin what you was up to If you try anything like that again I ll beat cheh to death Understand They fought on through exhaustion and beyond to exhaustion immeasurable and inconceivable until the crowd of brutes its blood lust sated terrified by what it saw begged them impartially to cease And Cheese Face ready to drop and die or to stay on his legs and die a grisly monster out of whose features all likeness to Cheese Face had been beaten wavered and hesitated but Martin sprang in and smashed him again and again Next after a seeming century or so with Cheese Face weakening fast in a mix up of blows there was a loud snap and Martin s right arm dropped to his side It was a broken bone Everybody heard it and knew and Cheese Face knew rushing like a tiger in the other s extremity and raining blow on blow Martin s gang surged forward to interfere Dazed by the rapid succession of blows Martin warned them back with vile and earnest curses sobbed out and groaned in ultimate desolation and despair He punched on with his left hand only and as he punched doggedly only half conscious as from a remote distance he heard murmurs of fear in the gangs and one who said with shaking voice This ain t a scrap fellows It s murder an we ought to stop it But no one stopped it and he was glad punching on wearily and endlessly with his one arm battering away at a bloody something before him that was not a face but a horror an oscillating hideous gibbering nameless thing that persisted before his wavering vision and would not go away And he punched on and on slower and slower as the last shreds of vitality oozed from him through centuries and aeons and enormous lapses of time until in a dim way he became aware that the nameless thing was sinking slowly sinking down to the rough board planking of the bridge And the next moment he was standing over it staggering and swaying on shaky legs clutching at the air for support and saying in a voice he did not recognize D ye want any more Say d ye want any more He was still saying it over and over demanding entreating threatening to know if it wanted any more when he felt the fellows of his gang laying hands on him patting him on the back and trying to put his coat on him And then came a sudden rush of blackness and oblivion The tin alarm clock on the table ticked on but Martin Eden his face buried on his arms did not hear it He heard nothing He did not think So absolutely had he relived life that he had fainted just as he fainted years before on the Eighth Street Bridge For a full minute the blackness and the blankness endured Then like one from the dead he sprang upright eyes flaming sweat pouring down his face shouting I licked you Cheese Face It took me eleven years but I licked you His knees were trembling under him he felt faint and he staggered back to the bed sinking down and sitting on the edge of it He was still in the clutch of the past He looked about the room perplexed alarmed wondering where he was until he caught sight of the pile of manuscripts in the corner Then the wheels of memory slipped ahead through four years of time and he was aware of the present of the books he had opened and the universe he had won from their pages of his dreams and ambitions and of his love for a pale wraith of a girl sensitive and sheltered and ethereal who would die of horror did she witness but one moment of what he had just lived through one moment of all the muck of life through which he had waded He arose to his feet and confronted himself in the looking glass And so you arise from the mud Martin Eden he said solemnly And you cleanse your eyes in a great brightness and thrust your shoulders among the stars doing what all life has done letting the ape and tiger die and wresting highest heritage from all powers that be He looked more closely at himself and laughed A bit of hysteria and melodrama eh he queried Well never mind You licked Cheese Face and you ll lick the editors if it takes twice eleven years to do it in You can t stop here You ve got to go on It s to a finish you know CHAPTER XVI The alarm clock went off jerking Martin out of sleep with a suddenness that would have given headache to one with less splendid constitution Though he slept soundly he awoke instantly like a cat and he awoke eagerly glad that the five hours of unconsciousness were gone He hated the oblivion of sleep There was too much to do too much of life to live He grudged every moment of life sleep robbed him of and before the clock had ceased its clattering he was head and ears in the washbasin and thrilling to the cold bite of the water But he did not follow his regular programme There was no unfinished story waiting his hand no new story demanding articulation He had studied late and it was nearly time for breakfast He tried to read a chapter in Fiske but his brain was restless and he closed the book To day witnessed the beginning of the new battle wherein for some time there would be no writing He was aware of a sadness akin to that with which one leaves home and family He looked at the manuscripts in the corner That was it He was going away from them his pitiful dishonored children that were welcome nowhere He went over and began to rummage among them reading snatches here and there his favorite portions The Pot he honored with reading aloud as he did Adventure Joy his latest born completed the day before and tossed into the corner for lack of stamps won his keenest approbation I can t understand he murmured Or maybe it s the editors who can t understand There s nothing wrong with that They publish worse every month Everything they publish is worse nearly everything anyway After breakfast he put the type writer in its case and carried it down into Oakland I owe a month on it he told the clerk in the store But you tell the manager I m going to work and that I ll be in in a month or so and straighten up He crossed on the ferry to San Francisco and made his way to an employment office Any kind of work no trade he told the agent and was interrupted by a new comer dressed rather foppishly as some workingmen dress who have instincts for finer things The agent shook his head despondently Nothin doin eh said the other Well I got to get somebody to day He turned and stared at Martin and Martin staring back noted the puffed and discolored face handsome and weak and knew that he had been making a night of it Lookin for a job the other queried What can you do Hard labor sailorizing run a type writer no shorthand can sit on a horse willing to do anything and tackle anything was the answer The other nodded Sounds good to me My name s Dawson Joe Dawson an I m tryin to scare up a laundryman Too much for me Martin caught an amusing glimpse of himself ironing fluffy white things that women wear But he had taken a liking to the other and he added I might do the plain washing I learned that much at sea Joe Dawson thought visibly for a moment Look here let s get together an frame it up Willin to listen Martin nodded This is a small laundry up country belongs to Shelly Hot Springs hotel you know Two men do the work boss and assistant I m the boss You don t work for me but you work under me Think you d be willin to learn Martin paused to think The prospect was alluring A few months of it and he would have time to himself for study He could work hard and study hard Good grub an a room to yourself Joe said That settled it A room to himself where he could burn the midnight oil unmolested But work like hell the other added Martin caressed his swelling shoulder muscles significantly That came from hard work Then let s get to it Joe held his hand to his head for a moment Gee but it s a stem winder Can hardly see I went down the line last night everything everything Here s the frame up The wages for two is a hundred and board I ve ben drawin down sixty the second man forty But he knew the biz You re green If I break you in I ll be doing plenty of your work at first Suppose you begin at thirty an work up to the forty I ll play fair Just as soon as you can do your share you get the forty I ll go you Martin announced stretching out his hand which the other shook Any advance for rail road ticket and extras I blew it in was Joe s sad answer with another reach at his aching head All I got is a return ticket And I m broke when I pay my board Jump it Joe advised Can t Owe it to my sister Joe whistled a long perplexed whistle and racked his brains to little purpose I ve got the price of the drinks he said desperately Come on an mebbe we ll cook up something Martin declined Water wagon This time Martin nodded and Joe lamented Wish I was But I somehow just can t he said in extenuation After I ve ben workin like hell all week I just got to booze up If I didn t I d cut my throat or burn up the premises But I m glad you re on the wagon Stay with it Martin knew of the enormous gulf between him and this man the gulf the books had made but he found no difficulty in crossing back over that gulf He had lived all his life in the working class world and the camaraderie of labor was second nature with him He solved the difficulty of transportation that was too much for the other s aching head He would send his trunk up to Shelly Hot Springs on Joe s ticket As for himself there was his wheel It was seventy miles and he could ride it on Sunday and be ready for work Monday morning In the meantime he would go home and pack up There was no one to say good by to Ruth and her whole family were spending the long summer in the Sierras at Lake Tahoe He arrived at Shelly Hot Springs tired and dusty on Sunday night Joe greeted him exuberantly With a wet towel bound about his aching brow he had been at work all day Part of last week s washin mounted up me bein away to get you he explained Your box arrived all right It s in your room But it s a hell of a thing to call a trunk An what s in it Gold bricks Joe sat on the bed while Martin unpacked The box was a packing case for breakfast food and mister Higginbotham had charged him half a dollar for it Two rope handles nailed on by Martin had technically transformed it into a trunk eligible for the baggage car Joe watched with bulging eyes a few shirts and several changes of underclothes come out of the box followed by books and more books Books clean to the bottom he asked Martin nodded and went on arranging the books on a kitchen table which served in the room in place of a wash stand Gee Joe exploded then waited in silence for the deduction to arise in his brain At last it came Say you don t care for the girls much he queried No was the answer I used to chase a lot before I tackled the books But since then there s no time And there won t be any time here All you can do is work an sleep Martin thought of his five hours sleep a night and smiled The room was situated over the laundry and was in the same building with the engine that pumped water made electricity and ran the laundry machinery The engineer who occupied the adjoining room dropped in to meet the new hand and helped Martin rig up an electric bulb on an extension wire so that it travelled along a stretched cord from over the table to the bed The next morning at quarter past six Martin was routed out for a quarter to seven breakfast There happened to be a bath tub for the servants in the laundry building and he electrified Joe by taking a cold bath Gee but you re a hummer Joe announced as they sat down to breakfast in a corner of the hotel kitchen With them was the engineer the gardener and the assistant gardener and two or three men from the stable They ate hurriedly and gloomily with but little conversation and as Martin ate and listened he realized how far he had travelled from their status Their small mental caliber was depressing to him and he was anxious to get away from them So he bolted his breakfast a sickly sloppy affair as rapidly as they and heaved a sigh of relief when he passed out through the kitchen door It was a perfectly appointed small steam laundry wherein the most modern machinery did everything that was possible for machinery to do Martin after a few instructions sorted the great heaps of soiled clothes while Joe started the masher and made up fresh supplies of soft soap compounded of biting chemicals that compelled him to swathe his mouth and nostrils and eyes in bath towels till he resembled a mummy Finished the sorting Martin lent a hand in wringing the clothes This was done by dumping them into a spinning receptacle that went at a rate of a few thousand revolutions a minute tearing the matter from the clothes by centrifugal force Then Martin began to alternate between the dryer and the wringer between times shaking out socks and stockings By the afternoon one feeding and one stacking up they were running socks and stockings through the mangle while the irons were heating Then it was hot irons and underclothes till six o clock at which time Joe shook his head dubiously Way behind he said Got to work after supper And after supper they worked until ten o clock under the blazing electric lights until the last piece of under clothing was ironed and folded away in the distributing room It was a hot California night and though the windows were thrown wide the room with its red hot ironing stove was a furnace Martin and Joe down to undershirts bare armed sweated and panted for air Like trimming cargo in the tropics Martin said when they went upstairs You ll do Joe answered You take hold like a good fellow If you keep up the pace you ll be on thirty dollars only one month The second month you ll be gettin your forty But don t tell me you never ironed before I know better Never ironed a rag in my life honestly until to day Martin protested He was surprised at his weariness when he act into his room forgetful of the fact that he had been on his feet and working without let up for fourteen hours He set the alarm clock at six and measured back five hours to one o clock He could read until then Slipping off his shoes to ease his swollen feet he sat down at the table with his books He opened Fiske where he had left off to read But he found trouble began to read it through a second time Then he awoke in pain from his stiffened muscles and chilled by the mountain wind that had begun to blow in through the window He looked at the clock It marked two He had been asleep four hours He pulled off his clothes and crawled into bed where he was asleep the moment after his head touched the pillow Tuesday was a day of similar unremitting toil The speed with which Joe worked won Martin s admiration Joe was a dozen of demons for work He was keyed up to concert pitch and there was never a moment in the long day when he was not fighting for moments He concentrated himself upon his work and upon how to save time pointing out to Martin where he did in five motions what could be done in three or in three motions what could be done in two Elimination of waste motion Martin phrased it as he watched and patterned after He was a good workman himself quick and deft and it had always been a point of pride with him that no man should do any of his work for him or outwork him As a result he concentrated with a similar singleness of purpose greedily snapping up the hints and suggestions thrown out by his working mate He rubbed out collars and cuffs rubbing the starch out from between the double thicknesses of linen so that there would be no blisters when it came to the ironing and doing it at a pace that elicited Joe s praise There was never an interval when something was not at hand to be done Joe waited for nothing waited on nothing and went on the jump from task to task They starched two hundred white shirts with a single gathering movement seizing a shirt so that the wristbands neckband yoke and bosom protruded beyond the circling right hand At the same moment the left hand held up the body of the shirt so that it would not enter the starch and at the moment the right hand dipped into the starch starch so hot that in order to wring it out their hands had to thrust and thrust continually into a bucket of cold water And that night they worked till half past ten dipping fancy starch all the frilled and airy delicate wear of ladies Me for the tropics and no clothes Martin laughed And me out of a job Joe answered seriously I don t know nothin but laundrying And you know it well I ought to Began in the Contra Costa in Oakland when I was eleven shakin out for the mangle That was eighteen years ago an I ve never done a tap of anything else But this job is the fiercest I ever had Ought to be one more man on it at least We work to morrow night Always run the mangle Wednesday nights collars an cuffs Martin set his alarm drew up to the table and opened Fiske He did not finish the first paragraph The lines blurred and ran together and his head nodded He walked up and down batting his head savagely with his fists but he could not conquer the numbness of sleep He propped the book before him and propped his eyelids with his fingers and fell asleep with his eyes wide open Then he surrendered and scarcely conscious of what he did got off his clothes and into bed He slept seven hours of heavy animal like sleep and awoke by the alarm feeling that he had not had enough Doin much readin Joe asked Martin shook his head Never mind We got to run the mangle to night but Thursday we ll knock off at six That ll give you a chance Martin washed woollens that day by hand in a large barrel with strong soft soap by means of a hub from a wagon wheel mounted on a plunger pole that was attached to a spring pole overhead My invention Joe said proudly Beats a washboard an your knuckles and besides it saves at least fifteen minutes in the week an fifteen minutes ain t to be sneezed at in this shebang Running the collars and cuffs through the mangle was also Joe s idea That night while they toiled on under the electric lights he explained it Something no laundry ever does except this one An I got to do it if I m goin to get done Saturday afternoon at three o clock But I know how an that s the difference Got to have right heat right pressure and run em through three times Look at that He held a cuff aloft Couldn t do it better by hand or on a tiler Thursday Joe was in a rage A bundle of extra fancy starch had come in I m goin to quit he announced I won t stand for it I m goin to quit it cold What s the good of me workin like a slave all week a savin minutes an them a comin an ringin in fancy starch extras on me This is a free country an I m to tell that fat Dutchman what I think of him An I won t tell m in French Plain United States is good enough for me Him a ringin in fancy starch extras We got to work to night he said the next moment reversing his judgment and surrendering to fate And Martin did no reading that night He had seen no daily paper all week and strangely to him felt no desire to see one He was not interested in the news He was too tired and jaded to be interested in anything though he planned to leave Saturday afternoon if they finished at three and ride on his wheel to Oakland It was seventy miles and the same distance back on Sunday afternoon would leave him anything but rested for the second week s work It would have been easier to go on the train but the round trip was two dollars and a half and he was intent on saving money CHAPTER XVII Martin learned to do many things In the course of the first week in one afternoon he and Joe accounted for the two hundred white shirts Joe ran the tiler a machine wherein a hot iron was hooked on a steel string which furnished the pressure By this means he ironed the yoke wristbands and neckband setting the latter at right angles to the shirt and put the glossy finish on the bosom As fast as he finished them he flung the shirts on a rack between him and Martin who caught them up and backed them This task consisted of ironing all the unstarched portions of the shirts It was exhausting work carried on hour after hour at top speed Out on the broad verandas of the hotel men and women in cool white sipped iced drinks and kept their circulation down But in the laundry the air was sizzling The huge stove roared red hot and white hot while the irons moving over the damp cloth sent up clouds of steam The heat of these irons was different from that used by housewives An iron that stood the ordinary test of a wet finger was too cold for Joe and Martin and such test was useless They went wholly by holding the irons close to their cheeks gauging the heat by some secret mental process that Martin admired but could not understand When the fresh irons proved too hot they hooked them on iron rods and dipped them into cold water This again required a precise and subtle judgment A fraction of a second too long in the water and the fine and silken edge of the proper heat was lost and Martin found time to marvel at the accuracy he developed an automatic accuracy founded upon criteria that were machine like and unerring But there was little time in which to marvel All Martin s consciousness was concentrated in the work Ceaselessly active head and hand an intelligent machine all that constituted him a man was devoted to furnishing that intelligence There was no room in his brain for the universe and its mighty problems All the broad and spacious corridors of his mind were closed and hermetically sealed The echoing chamber of his soul was a narrow room a conning tower whence were directed his arm and shoulder muscles his ten nimble fingers and the swift moving iron along its steaming path in broad sweeping strokes just so many strokes and no more just so far with each stroke and not a fraction of an inch farther rushing along interminable sleeves sides backs and tails and tossing the finished shirts without rumpling upon the receiving frame And even as his hurrying soul tossed it was reaching for another shirt This went on hour after hour while outside all the world swooned under the overhead California sun But there was no swooning in that superheated room The cool guests on the verandas needed clean linen The sweat poured from Martin He drank enormous quantities of water but so great was the heat of the day and of his exertions that the water sluiced through the interstices of his flesh and out at all his pores Always at sea except at rare intervals the work he performed had given him ample opportunity to commune with himself The master of the ship had been lord of Martin s time but here the manager of the hotel was lord of Martin s thoughts as well He had no thoughts save for the nerve racking body destroying toil Outside of that it was impossible to think He did not know that he loved Ruth She did not even exist for his driven soul had no time to remember her It was only when he crawled to bed at night or to breakfast in the morning that she asserted herself to him in fleeting memories This is hell ain t it Joe remarked once Martin nodded but felt a rasp of irritation The statement had been obvious and unnecessary They did not talk while they worked Conversation threw them out of their stride as it did this time compelling Martin to miss a stroke of his iron and to make two extra motions before he caught his stride again On Friday morning the washer ran Twice a week they had to put through hotel linen the sheets pillow slips spreads table cloths and napkins This finished they buckled down to fancy starch It was slow work fastidious and delicate and Martin did not learn it so readily Besides he could not take chances Mistakes were disastrous See that Joe said holding up a filmy corset cover that he could have crumpled from view in one hand Scorch that an it s twenty dollars out of your wages So Martin did not scorch that and eased down on his muscular tension though nervous tension rose higher than ever and he listened sympathetically to the other s blasphemies as he toiled and suffered over the beautiful things that women wear when they do not have to do their own laundrying Fancy starch was Martin s nightmare and it was Joe s too It was fancy starch that robbed them of their hard won minutes They toiled at it all day At seven in the evening they broke off to run the hotel linen through the mangle At ten o clock while the hotel guests slept the two laundrymen sweated on at fancy starch till midnight till one till two At half past two they knocked off Saturday morning it was fancy starch and odds and ends and at three in the afternoon the week s work was done You ain t a goin to ride them seventy miles into Oakland on top of this Joe demanded as they sat on the stairs and took a triumphant smoke Got to was the answer What are you goin for a girl No to save two and a half on the railroad ticket I want to renew some books at the library Why don t you send em down an up by express That ll cost only a quarter each way Martin considered it An take a rest to morrow the other urged You need it I know I do I m plumb tuckered out He looked it Indomitable never resting fighting for seconds and minutes all week circumventing delays and crushing down obstacles a fount of resistless energy a high driven human motor a demon for work now that he had accomplished the week s task he was in a state of collapse He was worn and haggard and his handsome face drooped in lean exhaustion He pulled his cigarette spiritlessly and his voice was peculiarly dead and monotonous All the snap and fire had gone out of him His triumph seemed a sorry one An next week we got to do it all over again he said sadly An what s the good of it all hey Sometimes I wish I was a hobo They don t work an they get their livin Gee I wish I had a glass of beer but I can t get up the gumption to go down to the village an get it You ll stay over an send your books dawn by express or else you re a damn fool But what can I do here all day Sunday Martin asked Rest You don t know how tired you are Why I m that tired Sunday I can t even read the papers I was sick once typhoid In the hospital two months an a half Didn t do a tap of work all that time It was beautiful It was beautiful he repeated dreamily a minute later Martin took a bath after which he found that the head laundryman had disappeared Most likely he had gone for a glass of beer Martin decided but the half mile walk down to the village to find out seemed a long journey to him He lay on his bed with his shoes off trying to make up his mind He did not reach out for a book He was too tired to feel sleepy and he lay scarcely thinking in a semi stupor of weariness until it was time for supper Joe did not appear for that function and when Martin heard the gardener remark that most likely he was ripping the slats off the bar Martin understood He went to bed immediately afterward and in the morning decided that he was greatly rested Joe being still absent Martin procured a Sunday paper and lay down in a shady nook under the trees The morning passed he knew not how He did not sleep nobody disturbed him and he did not finish the paper He came back to it in the afternoon after dinner and fell asleep over it So passed Sunday and Monday morning he was hard at work sorting clothes while Joe a towel bound tightly around his head with groans and blasphemies was running the washer and mixing soft soap I simply can t help it he explained I got to drink when Saturday night comes around Another week passed a great battle that continued under the electric lights each night and that culminated on Saturday afternoon at three o clock when Joe tasted his moment of wilted triumph and then drifted down to the village to forget Martin s Sunday was the same as before He slept in the shade of the trees toiled aimlessly through the newspaper and spent long hours lying on his back doing nothing thinking nothing He was too dazed to think though he was aware that he did not like himself He was self repelled as though he had undergone some degradation or was intrinsically foul All that was god like in him was blotted out The spur of ambition was blunted he had no vitality with which to feel the prod of it He was dead His soul seemed dead He was a beast a work beast He saw no beauty in the sunshine sifting down through the green leaves nor did the azure vault of the sky whisper as of old and hint of cosmic vastness and secrets trembling to disclosure Life was intolerably dull and stupid and its taste was bad in his mouth A black screen was drawn across his mirror of inner vision and fancy lay in a darkened sick room where entered no ray of light He envied Joe down in the village rampant tearing the slats off the bar his brain gnawing with maggots exulting in maudlin ways over maudlin things fantastically and gloriously drunk and forgetful of Monday morning and the week of deadening toil to come A third week went by and Martin loathed himself and loathed life He was oppressed by a sense of failure There was reason for the editors refusing his stuff He could see that clearly now and laugh at himself and the dreams he had dreamed Ruth returned his Sea Lyrics by mail He read her letter apathetically She did her best to say how much she liked them and that they were beautiful But she could not lie and she could not disguise the truth from herself She knew they were failures and he read her disapproval in every perfunctory and unenthusiastic line of her letter And she was right He was firmly convinced of it as he read the poems over Beauty and wonder had departed from him and as he read the poems he caught himself puzzling as to what he had had in mind when he wrote them His audacities of phrase struck him as grotesque his felicities of expression were monstrosities and everything was absurd unreal and impossible He would have burned the Sea Lyrics on the spot had his will been strong enough to set them aflame There was the engine room but the exertion of carrying them to the furnace was not worth while All his exertion was used in washing other persons clothes He did not have any left for private affairs He resolved that when Sunday came he would pull himself together and answer Ruth s letter But Saturday afternoon after work was finished and he had taken a bath the desire to forget overpowered him I guess I ll go down and see how Joe s getting on was the way he put it to himself and in the same moment he knew that he lied But he did not have the energy to consider the lie If he had had the energy he would have refused to consider the lie because he wanted to forget He started for the village slowly and casually increasing his pace in spite of himself as he neared the saloon I thought you was on the water wagon was Joe s greeting Martin did not deign to offer excuses but called for whiskey filling his own glass brimming before he passed the bottle Don t take all night about it he said roughly The other was dawdling with the bottle and Martin refused to wait for him tossing the glass off in a gulp and refilling it Now I can wait for you he said grimly but hurry up Joe hurried and they drank together The work did it eh Joe queried Martin refused to discuss the matter It s fair hell I know the other went on but I kind of hate to see you come off the wagon Mart Well here s how Martin drank on silently biting out his orders and invitations and awing the barkeeper an effeminate country youngster with watery blue eyes and hair parted in the middle It s something scandalous the way they work us poor devils Joe was remarking If I didn t bowl up I d break loose an burn down the shebang My bowlin up is all that saves em I can tell you that But Martin made no answer A few more drinks and in his brain he felt the maggots of intoxication beginning to crawl Ah it was living the first breath of life he had breathed in three weeks His dreams came back to him Fancy came out of the darkened room and lured him on a thing of flaming brightness His mirror of vision was silver clear a flashing dazzling palimpsest of imagery Wonder and beauty walked with him hand in hand and all power was his He tried to tell it to Joe but Joe had visions of his own infallible schemes whereby he would escape the slavery of laundry work and become himself the owner of a great steam laundry I tell yeh Mart they won t be no kids workin in my laundry not on yer life An they won t be no workin a livin soul after six P M You hear me talk They ll be machinery enough an hands enough to do it all in decent workin hours an Mart s help me I ll make yeh superintendent of the shebang the whole of it all of it Now here s the scheme I get on the water wagon an save my money for two years save an then But Martin turned away leaving him to tell it to the barkeeper until that worthy was called away to furnish drinks to two farmers who coming in accepted Martin s invitation Martin dispensed royal largess inviting everybody up farm hands a stableman and the gardener s assistant from the hotel the barkeeper and the furtive hobo who slid in like a shadow and like a shadow hovered at the end of the bar CHAPTER XVIII Monday morning Joe groaned over the first truck load of clothes to the washer I say he began Don t talk to me Martin snarled I m sorry Joe he said at noon when they knocked off for dinner Tears came into the other s eyes That s all right old man he said We re in hell an we can t help ourselves An you know I kind of like you a whole lot That s what made it hurt I cottoned to you from the first Martin shook his hand Let s quit Joe suggested Let s chuck it an go hoboin I ain t never tried it but it must be dead easy An nothin to do Just think of it nothin to do I was sick once typhoid in the hospital an it was beautiful I wish I d get sick again The week dragged on The hotel was full and extra fancy starch poured in upon them They performed prodigies of valor They fought late each night under the electric lights bolted their meals and even got in a half hour s work before breakfast Martin no longer took his cold baths Every moment was drive drive drive and Joe was the masterful shepherd of moments herding them carefully never losing one counting them over like a miser counting gold working on in a frenzy toil mad a feverish machine aided ably by that other machine that thought of itself as once having been one Martin Eden a man But it was only at rare moments that Martin was able to think The house of thought was closed its windows boarded up and he was its shadowy caretaker He was a shadow Joe was right They were both shadows and this was the unending limbo of toil Or was it a dream Sometimes in the steaming sizzling heat as he swung the heavy irons back and forth over the white garments it came to him that it was a dream In a short while or maybe after a thousand years or so he would awake in his little room with the ink stained table and take up his writing where he had left off the day before Or maybe that was a dream too and the awakening would be the changing of the watches when he would drop down out of his bunk in the lurching forecastle and go up on deck under the tropic stars and take the wheel and feel the cool tradewind blowing through his flesh Came Saturday and its hollow victory at three o clock Guess I ll go down an get a glass of beer Joe said in the queer monotonous tones that marked his week end collapse Martin seemed suddenly to wake up He opened the kit bag and oiled his wheel putting graphite on the chain and adjusting the bearings Joe was halfway down to the saloon when Martin passed by bending low over the handle bars his legs driving the ninety six gear with rhythmic strength his face set for seventy miles of road and grade and dust He slept in Oakland that night and on Sunday covered the seventy miles back And on Monday morning weary he began the new week s work but he had kept sober A fifth week passed and a sixth during which he lived and toiled as a machine with just a spark of something more in him just a glimmering bit of soul that compelled him at each week end to scorch off the hundred and forty miles But this was not rest It was super machinelike and it helped to crush out the glimmering bit of soul that was all that was left him from former life At the end of the seventh week without intending it too weak to resist he drifted down to the village with Joe and drowned life and found life until Monday morning Again at the week ends he ground out the one hundred and forty miles obliterating the numbness of too great exertion by the numbness of still greater exertion At the end of three months he went down a third time to the village with Joe He forgot and lived again and living he saw in clear illumination the beast he was making of himself not by the drink but by the work The drink was an effect not a cause It followed inevitably upon the work as the night follows upon the day Not by becoming a toil beast could he win to the heights was the message the whiskey whispered to him and he nodded approbation The whiskey was wise It told secrets on itself He called for paper and pencil and for drinks all around and while they drank his very good health he clung to the bar and scribbled A telegram Joe he said Read it Joe read it with a drunken quizzical leer But what he read seemed to sober him He looked at the other reproachfully tears oozing into his eyes and down his cheeks You ain t goin back on me Mart he queried hopelessly Martin nodded and called one of the loungers to him to take the message to the telegraph office Hold on Joe muttered thickly Lemme think He held on to the bar his legs wobbling under him Martin s arm around him and supporting him while he thought Make that two laundrymen he said abruptly Here lemme fix it What are you quitting for Martin demanded Same reason as you But I m going to sea You can t do that Nope was the answer but I can hobo all right all right Martin looked at him searchingly for a moment then cried By God I think you re right Better a hobo than a beast of toil Why man you ll live And that s more than you ever did before I was in hospital once Joe corrected It was beautiful Typhoid did I tell you While Martin changed the telegram to two laundrymen Joe went on I never wanted to drink when I was in hospital Funny ain t it But when I ve ben workin like a slave all week I just got to bowl up Ever noticed that cooks drink like hell an bakers too It s the work They ve sure got to Here lemme pay half of that telegram I ll shake you for it Martin offered Come on everybody drink Joe called as they rattled the dice and rolled them out on the damp bar Monday morning Joe was wild with anticipation He did not mind his aching head nor did he take interest in his work Whole herds of moments stole away and were lost while their careless shepherd gazed out of the window at the sunshine and the trees Just look at it he cried An it s all mine It s free I can lie down under them trees an sleep for a thousan years if I want to Aw come on Mart let s chuck it What s the good of waitin another moment That s the land of nothin to do out there an I got a ticket for it an it ain t no return ticket b gosh A few minutes later filling the truck with soiled clothes for the washer Joe spied the hotel manager s shirt He knew its mark and with a sudden glorious consciousness of freedom he threw it on the floor and stamped on it I wish you was in it you pig headed Dutchman he shouted In it an right there where I ve got you Take that an that an that damn you Hold me back somebody Hold me back Martin laughed and held him to his work On Tuesday night the new laundrymen arrived and the rest of the week was spent breaking them into the routine Joe sat around and explained his system but he did no more work Not a tap he announced Not a tap They can fire me if they want to but if they do I ll quit No more work in mine thank you kindly Me for the freight cars an the shade under the trees Go to it you slaves That s right Slave an sweat Slave an sweat An when you re dead you ll rot the same as me an what s it matter how you live eh Tell me that what s it matter in the long run On Saturday they drew their pay and came to the parting of the ways They ain t no use in me askin you to change your mind an hit the road with me Joe asked hopelessly Martin shook his head He was standing by his wheel ready to start They shook hands and Joe held on to his for a moment as he said I m goin to see you again Mart before you an me die That s straight dope I feel it in my bones Good by Mart an be good I like you like hell you know He stood a forlorn figure in the middle of the road watching until Martin turned a bend and was gone from sight He s a good Indian that boy he muttered A good Indian Then he plodded down the road himself to the water tank where half a dozen empties lay on a side track waiting for the up freight CHAPTER XIX Ruth and her family were home again and Martin returned to Oakland saw much of her Having gained her degree she was doing no more studying and he having worked all vitality out of his mind and body was doing no writing This gave them time for each other that they had never had before and their intimacy ripened fast At first Martin had done nothing but rest He had slept a great deal and spent long hours musing and thinking and doing nothing He was like one recovering from some terrible bout if hardship The first signs of reawakening came when he discovered more than languid interest in the daily paper Then he began to read again light novels and poetry and after several days more he was head over heels in his long neglected Fiske His splendid body and health made new vitality and he possessed all the resiliency and rebound of youth Ruth showed her disappointment plainly when he announced that he was going to sea for another voyage as soon as he was well rested Why do you want to do that she asked Money was the answer I ll have to lay in a supply for my next attack on the editors Money is the sinews of war in my case money and patience But if all you wanted was money why didn t you stay in the laundry Because the laundry was making a beast of me Too much work of that sort drives to drink She stared at him with horror in her eyes Do you mean she quavered It would have been easy for him to get out of it but his natural impulse was for frankness and he remembered his old resolve to be frank no matter what happened Yes he answered Just that Several times She shivered and drew away from him No man that I have ever known did that ever did that Then they never worked in the laundry at Shelly Hot Springs he laughed bitterly Toil is a good thing It is necessary for human health so all the preachers say and Heaven knows I ve never been afraid of it But there is such a thing as too much of a good thing and the laundry up there is one of them And that s why I m going to sea one more voyage It will be my last I think for when I come back I shall break into the magazines I am certain of it She was silent unsympathetic and he watched her moodily realizing how impossible it was for her to understand what he had been through Some day I shall write it up The Degradation of Toil or the Psychology of Drink in the Working class or something like that for a title Never since the first meeting had they seemed so far apart as that day His confession told in frankness with the spirit of revolt behind had repelled her But she was more shocked by the repulsion itself than by the cause of it It pointed out to her how near she had drawn to him and once accepted it paved the way for greater intimacy Pity too was aroused and innocent idealistic thoughts of reform She would save this raw young man who had come so far She would save him from the curse of his early environment and she would save him from himself in spite of himself And all this affected her as a very noble state of consciousness nor did she dream that behind it and underlying it were the jealousy and desire of love They rode on their wheels much in the delightful fall weather and out in the hills they read poetry aloud now one and now the other noble uplifting poetry that turned one s thoughts to higher things Renunciation sacrifice patience industry and high endeavor were the principles she thus indirectly preached such abstractions being objectified in her mind by her father and mister Butler and by Andrew Carnegie who from a poor immigrant boy had arisen to be the book giver of the world All of which was appreciated and enjoyed by Martin He followed her mental processes more clearly now and her soul was no longer the sealed wonder it had been He was on terms of intellectual equality with her But the points of disagreement did not affect his love His love was more ardent than ever for he loved her for what she was and even her physical frailty was an added charm in his eyes He read of sickly Elizabeth Barrett who for years had not placed her feet upon the ground until that day of flame when she eloped with Browning and stood upright upon the earth under the open sky and what Browning had done for her Martin decided he could do for Ruth But first she must love him The rest would be easy He would give her strength and health And he caught glimpses of their life in the years to come wherein against a background of work and comfort and general well being he saw himself and Ruth reading and discussing poetry she propped amid a multitude of cushions on the ground while she read aloud to him This was the key to the life they would live And always he saw that particular picture Sometimes it was she who leaned against him while he read one arm about her her head upon his shoulder Sometimes they pored together over the printed pages of beauty Then too she loved nature and with generous imagination he changed the scene of their reading sometimes they read in closed in valleys with precipitous walls or in high mountain meadows and again down by the gray sand dunes with a wreath of billows at their feet or afar on some volcanic tropic isle where waterfalls descended and became mist reaching the sea in vapor veils that swayed and shivered to every vagrant wisp of wind But always in the foreground lords of beauty and eternally reading and sharing lay he and Ruth and always in the background that was beyond the background of nature dim and hazy were work and success and money earned that made them free of the world and all its treasures I should recommend my little girl to be careful her mother warned her one day I know what you mean But it is impossible He if not Ruth was blushing but it was the blush of maidenhood called upon for the first time to discuss the sacred things of life with a mother held equally sacred Your kind Her mother finished the sentence for her Ruth nodded I did not want to say it but he is not He is rough brutal strong too strong He has not She hesitated and could not go on It was a new experience talking over such matters with her mother And again her mother completed her thought for her He has not lived a clean life is what you wanted to say Again Ruth nodded and again a blush mantled her face It is just that she said It has not been his fault but he has played much with With pitch Yes with pitch And he frightens me Sometimes I am positively in terror of him when he talks in that free and easy way of the things he has done as if they did not matter They do matter don t they They sat with their arms twined around each other and in the pause her mother patted her hand and waited for her to go on But I am interested in him dreadfully she continued In a way he is my protege Then too he is my first boy friend but not exactly friend rather protege and friend combined Sometimes too when he frightens me it seems that he is a bulldog I have taken for a plaything like some of the frat girls and he is tugging hard and showing his teeth and threatening to break loose Again her mother waited He interests me I suppose like the bulldog And there is much good in him too but there is much in him that I would not like in in the other way You see I have been thinking He swears he smokes he drinks he has fought with his fists he has told me so and he likes it he says so He is all that a man should not be a man I would want for my her voice sank very low husband Then he is too strong My prince must be tall and slender and dark a graceful bewitching prince No there is no danger of my failing in love with Martin Eden It would be the worst fate that could befall me But it is not that that I spoke about her mother equivocated Have you thought about him He is so ineligible in every way you know and suppose he should come to love you But he does already she cried It was to be expected missus Morse said gently How could it be otherwise with any one who knew you Olney hates me she exclaimed passionately And I hate Olney I feel always like a cat when he is around I feel that I must be nasty to him and even when I don t happen to feel that way why he s nasty to me anyway But I am happy with Martin Eden No one ever loved me before no man I mean in that way And it is sweet to be loved that way You know what I mean mother dear It is sweet to feel that you are really and truly a woman She buried her face in her mother s lap sobbing You think I am dreadful I know but I am honest and I tell you just how I feel missus Morse was strangely sad and happy Her child daughter who was a bachelor of arts was gone but in her place was a woman daughter The experiment had succeeded The strange void in Ruth s nature had been filled and filled without danger or penalty This rough sailor fellow had been the instrument and though Ruth did not love him he had made her conscious of her womanhood His hand trembles Ruth was confessing her face for shame s sake still buried It is most amusing and ridiculous but I feel sorry for him too And when his hands are too trembly and his eyes too shiny why I lecture him about his life and the wrong way he is going about it to mend it But he worships me I know His eyes and his hands do not lie And it makes me feel grown up the thought of it the very thought of it and I feel that I am possessed of something that is by rights my own that makes me like the other girls and and young women And then too I knew that I was not like them before and I knew that it worried you You thought you did not let me know that dear worry of yours but I did and I wanted to to make good as Martin Eden says It was a holy hour for mother and daughter and their eyes were wet as they talked on in the twilight Ruth all white innocence and frankness her mother sympathetic receptive yet calmly explaining and guiding He is four years younger than you she said He has no place in the world He has neither position nor salary He is impractical Loving you he should in the name of common sense be doing something that would give him the right to marry instead of paltering around with those stories of his and with childish dreams Martin Eden I am afraid will never grow up He does not take to responsibility and a man s work in the world like your father did or like all our friends mister Butler for one Martin Eden I am afraid will never be a money earner And this world is so ordered that money is necessary to happiness oh no not these swollen fortunes but enough of money to permit of common comfort and decency He he has never spoken He has not breathed a word He has not attempted to but if he did I would not let him because you see I do not love him I am glad of that I should not care to see my daughter my one daughter who is so clean and pure love a man like him There are noble men in the world who are clean and true and manly Wait for them You will find one some day and you will love him and be loved by him and you will be happy with him as your father and I have been happy with each other And there is one thing you must always carry in mind Yes mother missus Morse s voice was low and sweet as she said And that is the children I have thought about them Ruth confessed remembering the wanton thoughts that had vexed her in the past her face again red with maiden shame that she should be telling such things And it is that the children that makes mister Eden impossible missus Morse went on incisively Their heritage must be clean and he is I am afraid not clean Your father has told me of sailors lives and and you understand Ruth pressed her mother s hand in assent feeling that she really did understand though her conception was of something vague remote and terrible that was beyond the scope of imagination You know I do nothing without telling you she began Only sometimes you must ask me like this time I wanted to tell you but I did not know how It is false modesty I know it is that but you can make it easy for me Sometimes like this time you must ask me you must give me a chance Why mother you are a woman too she cried exultantly as they stood up catching her mother s hands and standing erect facing her in the twilight conscious of a strangely sweet equality between them I should never have thought of you in that way if we had not had this talk I had to learn that I was a woman to know that you were one too We are women together her mother said drawing her to her and kissing her We are women together she repeated as they went out of the room their arms around each other s waists their hearts swelling with a new sense of companionship Our little girl has become a woman missus Morse said proudly to her husband an hour later That means he said after a long look at his wife that means she is in love No but that she is loved was the smiling rejoinder The experiment has succeeded She is awakened at last Then we ll have to get rid of him mister Morse spoke briskly in matter of fact businesslike tones But his wife shook her head It will not be necessary Ruth says he is going to sea in a few days When he comes back she will not be here We will send her to Aunt Clara s And besides a year in the East with the change in climate people ideas and everything is just the thing she needs CHAPTER XX The desire to write was stirring in Martin once more Stories and poems were springing into spontaneous creation in his brain and he made notes of them against the future time when he would give them expression But he did not write This was his little vacation he had resolved to devote it to rest and love and in both matters he prospered He was soon spilling over with vitality and each day he saw Ruth at the moment of meeting she experienced the old shock of his strength and health Be careful her mother warned her once again I am afraid you are seeing too much of Martin Eden But Ruth laughed from security She was sure of herself and in a few days he would be off to sea Then by the time he returned she would be away on her visit East There was a magic however in the strength and health of Martin He too had been told of her contemplated Eastern trip and he felt the need for haste Yet he did not know how to make love to a girl like Ruth Then too he was handicapped by the possession of a great fund of experience with girls and women who had been absolutely different from her They had known about love and life and flirtation while she knew nothing about such things Her prodigious innocence appalled him freezing on his lips all ardors of speech and convincing him in spite of himself of his own unworthiness Also he was handicapped in another way He had himself never been in love before He had liked women in that turgid past of his and been fascinated by some of them but he had not known what it was to love them He had whistled in a masterful careless way and they had come to him They had been diversions incidents part of the game men play but a small part at most And now and for the first time he was a suppliant tender and timid and doubting He did not know the way of love nor its speech while he was frightened at his loved one s clear innocence In the course of getting acquainted with a varied world whirling on through the ever changing phases of it he had learned a rule of conduct which was to the effect that when one played a strange game he should let the other fellow play first This had stood him in good stead a thousand times and trained him as an observer as well He knew how to watch the thing that was strange and to wait for a weakness for a place of entrance to divulge itself It was like sparring for an opening in fist fighting And when such an opening came he knew by long experience to play for it and to play hard So he waited with Ruth and watched desiring to speak his love but not daring He was afraid of shocking her and he was not sure of himself Had he but known it he was following the right course with her Love came into the world before articulate speech and in its own early youth it had learned ways and means that it had never forgotten It was in this old primitive way that Martin wooed Ruth He did not know he was doing it at first though later he divined it The touch of his hand on hers was vastly more potent than any word he could utter the impact of his strength on her imagination was more alluring than the printed poems and spoken passions of a thousand generations of lovers Whatever his tongue could express would have appealed in part to her judgment but the touch of hand the fleeting contact made its way directly to her instinct Her judgment was as young as she but her instincts were as old as the race and older They had been young when love was young and they were wiser than convention and opinion and all the new born things So her judgment did not act There was no call upon it and she did not realize the strength of the appeal Martin made from moment to moment to her love nature That he loved her on the other hand was as clear as day and she consciously delighted in beholding his love manifestations the glowing eyes with their tender lights the trembling hands and the never failing swarthy flush that flooded darkly under his sunburn She even went farther in a timid way inciting him but doing it so delicately that he never suspected and doing it half consciously so that she scarcely suspected herself She thrilled with these proofs of her power that proclaimed her a woman and she took an Eve like delight in tormenting him and playing upon him Tongue tied by inexperience and by excess of ardor wooing unwittingly and awkwardly Martin continued his approach by contact The touch of his hand was pleasant to her and something deliciously more than pleasant Martin did not know it but he did know that it was not distasteful to her Not that they touched hands often save at meeting and parting but that in handling the bicycles in strapping on the books of verse they carried into the hills and in conning the pages of books side by side there were opportunities for hand to stray against hand And there were opportunities too for her hair to brush his cheek and for shoulder to touch shoulder as they leaned together over the beauty of the books She smiled to herself at vagrant impulses which arose from nowhere and suggested that she rumple his hair while he desired greatly when they tired of reading to rest his head in her lap and dream with closed eyes about the future that was to be theirs On Sunday picnics at Shellmound Park and Schuetzen Park in the past he had rested his head on many laps and usually he had slept soundly and selfishly while the girls shaded his face from the sun and looked down and loved him and wondered at his lordly carelessness of their love To rest his head in a girl s lap had been the easiest thing in the world until now and now he found Ruth s lap inaccessible and impossible Yet it was right here in his reticence that the strength of his wooing lay It was because of this reticence that he never alarmed her Herself fastidious and timid she never awakened to the perilous trend of their intercourse Subtly and unaware she grew toward him and closer to him while he sensing the growing closeness longed to dare but was afraid Once he dared one afternoon when he found her in the darkened living room with a blinding headache Nothing can do it any good she had answered his inquiries And besides I don t take headache powders Doctor Hall won t permit me I can cure it I think and without drugs was Martin s answer I am not sure of course but I d like to try It s simply massage I learned the trick first from the Japanese They are a race of masseurs you know Then I learned it all over again with variations from the Hawaiians They call it lomi lomi It can accomplish most of the things drugs accomplish and a few things that drugs can t Scarcely had his hands touched her head when she sighed deeply That is so good she said She spoke once again half an hour later when she asked Aren t you tired The question was perfunctory and she knew what the answer would be Then she lost herself in drowsy contemplation of the soothing balm of his strength Life poured from the ends of his fingers driving the pain before it or so it seemed to her until with the easement of pain she fell asleep and he stole away She called him up by telephone that evening to thank him I slept until dinner she said You cured me completely mister Eden and I don t know how to thank you He was warm and bungling of speech and very happy as he replied to her and there was dancing in his mind throughout the telephone conversation the memory of Browning and of sickly Elizabeth Barrett What had been done could be done again and he Martin Eden could do it and would do it for Ruth Morse He went back to his room and to the volume of Spencer s Sociology lying open on the bed But he could not read Love tormented him and overrode his will so that despite all determination he found himself at the little ink stained table The sonnet he composed that night was the first of a love cycle of fifty sonnets which was completed within two months He had the Love sonnets from the Portuguese in mind as he wrote and he wrote under the best conditions for great work at a climacteric of living in the throes of his own sweet love madness The many hours he was not with Ruth he devoted to the Love cycle to reading at home or to the public reading rooms where he got more closely in touch with the magazines of the day and the nature of their policy and content The hours he spent with Ruth were maddening alike in promise and in inconclusiveness It was a week after he cured her headache that a moonlight sail on Lake Merritt was proposed by Norman and seconded by Arthur and Olney Martin was the only one capable of handling a boat and he was pressed into service Ruth sat near him in the stern while the three young fellows lounged amidships deep in a wordy wrangle over frat affairs The moon had not yet risen and Ruth gazing into the starry vault of the sky and exchanging no speech with Martin experienced a sudden feeling of loneliness She glanced at him A puff of wind was heeling the boat over till the deck was awash and he one hand on tiller and the other on main sheet was luffing slightly at the same time peering ahead to make out the near lying north shore He was unaware of her gaze and she watched him intently speculating fancifully about the strange warp of soul that led him a young man with signal powers to fritter away his time on the writing of stories and poems foredoomed to mediocrity and failure Her eyes wandered along the strong throat dimly seen in the starlight and over the firm poised head and the old desire to lay her hands upon his neck came back to her The strength she abhorred attracted her Her feeling of loneliness became more pronounced and she felt tired Her position on the heeling boat irked her and she remembered the headache he had cured and the soothing rest that resided in him He was sitting beside her quite beside her and the boat seemed to tilt her toward him Then arose in her the impulse to lean against him to rest herself against his strength a vague half formed impulse which even as she considered it mastered her and made her lean toward him Or was it the heeling of the boat She did not know She never knew She knew only that she was leaning against him and that the easement and soothing rest were very good Perhaps it had been the boat s fault but she made no effort to retrieve it She leaned lightly against his shoulder but she leaned and she continued to lean when he shifted his position to make it more comfortable for her It was a madness but she refused to consider the madness She was no longer herself but a woman with a woman s clinging need and though she leaned ever so lightly the need seemed satisfied She was no longer tired Martin did not speak Had he the spell would have been broken But his reticence of love prolonged it He was dazed and dizzy He could not understand what was happening It was too wonderful to be anything but a delirium He conquered a mad desire to let go sheet and tiller and to clasp her in his arms His intuition told him it was the wrong thing to do and he was glad that sheet and tiller kept his hands occupied and fended off temptation But he luffed the boat less delicately spilling the wind shamelessly from the sail so as to prolong the tack to the north shore The shore would compel him to go about and the contact would be broken He sailed with skill stopping way on the boat without exciting the notice of the wranglers and mentally forgiving his hardest voyages in that they had made this marvellous night possible giving him mastery over sea and boat and wind so that he could sail with her beside him her dear weight against him on his shoulder When the first light of the rising moon touched the sail illuminating the boat with pearly radiance Ruth moved away from him And even as she moved she felt him move away The impulse to avoid detection was mutual The episode was tacitly and secretly intimate She sat apart from him with burning cheeks while the full force of it came home to her She had been guilty of something she would not have her brothers see nor Olney see Why had she done it She had never done anything like it in her life and yet she had been moonlight sailing with young men before She had never desired to do anything like it She was overcome with shame and with the mystery of her own burgeoning womanhood She stole a glance at Martin who was busy putting the boat about on the other tack and she could have hated him for having made her do an immodest and shameful thing And he of all men Perhaps her mother was right and she was seeing too much of him It would never happen again she resolved and she would see less of him in the future She entertained a wild idea of explaining to him the first time they were alone together of lying to him of mentioning casually the attack of faintness that had overpowered her just before the moon came up Then she remembered how they had drawn mutually away before the revealing moon and she knew he would know it for a lie In the days that swiftly followed she was no longer herself but a strange puzzling creature wilful over judgment and scornful of self analysis refusing to peer into the future or to think about herself and whither she was drifting She was in a fever of tingling mystery alternately frightened and charmed and in constant bewilderment She had one idea firmly fixed however which insured her security She would not let Martin speak his love As long as she did this all would be well In a few days he would be off to sea And even if he did speak all would be well It could not be otherwise for she did not love him Of course it would be a painful half hour for him and an embarrassing half hour for her because it would be her first proposal She thrilled deliciously at the thought She was really a woman with a man ripe to ask for her in marriage It was a lure to all that was fundamental in her sex The fabric of her life of all that constituted her quivered and grew tremulous The thought fluttered in her mind like a flame attracted moth She went so far as to imagine Martin proposing herself putting the words into his mouth and she rehearsed her refusal tempering it with kindness and exhorting him to true and noble manhood And especially he must stop smoking cigarettes She would make a point of that But no she must not let him speak at all She could stop him and she had told her mother that she would All flushed and burning she regretfully dismissed the conjured situation Her first proposal would have to be deferred to a more propitious time and a more eligible suitor CHAPTER XXI Came a beautiful fall day warm and languid palpitant with the hush of the changing season a California Indian summer day with hazy sun and wandering wisps of breeze that did not stir the slumber of the air Filmy purple mists that were not vapors but fabrics woven of color hid in the recesses of the hills San Francisco lay like a blur of smoke upon her heights The intervening bay was a dull sheen of molten metal whereon sailing craft lay motionless or drifted with the lazy tide Far Tamalpais barely seen in the silver haze bulked hugely by the Golden Gate the latter a pale gold pathway under the westering sun Beyond the Pacific dim and vast was raising on its sky line tumbled cloud masses that swept landward giving warning of the first blustering breath of winter The erasure of summer was at hand Yet summer lingered fading and fainting among her hills deepening the purple of her valleys spinning a shroud of haze from waning powers and sated raptures dying with the calm content of having lived and lived well And among the hills on their favorite knoll Martin and Ruth sat side by side their heads bent over the same pages he reading aloud from the love sonnets of the woman who had loved Browning as it is given to few men to be loved But the reading languished The spell of passing beauty all about them was too strong The golden year was dying as it had lived a beautiful and unrepentant voluptuary and reminiscent rapture and content freighted heavily the air It entered into them dreamy and languorous weakening the fibres of resolution suffusing the face of morality or of judgment with haze and purple mist Martin felt tender and melting and from time to time warm glows passed over him His head was very near to hers and when wandering phantoms of breeze stirred her hair so that it touched his face the printed pages swam before his eyes I don t believe you know a word of what you are reading she said once when he had lost his place He looked at her with burning eyes and was on the verge of becoming awkward when a retort came to his lips I don t believe you know either What was the last sonnet about I don t know she laughed frankly I ve already forgotten Don t let us read any more The day is too beautiful It will be our last in the hills for some time he announced gravely There s a storm gathering out there on the sea rim The book slipped from his hands to the ground and they sat idly and silently gazing out over the dreamy bay with eyes that dreamed and did not see Ruth glanced sidewise at his neck She did not lean toward him She was drawn by some force outside of herself and stronger than gravitation strong as destiny It was only an inch to lean and it was accomplished without volition on her part Her shoulder touched his as lightly as a butterfly touches a flower and just as lightly was the counter pressure She felt his shoulder press hers and a tremor run through him Then was the time for her to draw back But she had become an automaton Her actions had passed beyond the control of her will she never thought of control or will in the delicious madness that was upon her His arm began to steal behind her and around her She waited its slow progress in a torment of delight She waited she knew not for what panting with dry burning lips a leaping pulse and a fever of expectancy in all her blood The girdling arm lifted higher and drew her toward him drew her slowly and caressingly She could wait no longer With a tired sigh and with an impulsive movement all her own unpremeditated spasmodic she rested her head upon his breast His head bent over swiftly and as his lips approached hers flew to meet them This must be love she thought in the one rational moment that was vouchsafed her If it was not love it was too shameful It could be nothing else than love She loved the man whose arms were around her and whose lips were pressed to hers She pressed more tightly to him with a snuggling movement of her body And a moment later tearing herself half out of his embrace suddenly and exultantly she reached up and placed both hands upon Martin Eden s sunburnt neck So exquisite was the pang of love and desire fulfilled that she uttered a low moan relaxed her hands and lay half swooning in his arms Not a word had been spoken and not a word was spoken for a long time Twice he bent and kissed her and each time her lips met his shyly and her body made its happy nestling movement She clung to him unable to release herself and he sat half supporting her in his arms as he gazed with unseeing eyes at the blur of the great city across the bay For once there were no visions in his brain Only colors and lights and glows pulsed there warm as the day and warm as his love He bent over her She was speaking When did you love me she whispered From the first the very first the first moment I laid eye on you I was mad for love of you then and in all the time that has passed since then I have only grown the madder I am maddest now dear I am almost a lunatic my head is so turned with joy I am glad I am a woman Martin dear she said after a long sigh He crushed her in his arms again and again and then asked And you When did you first know Oh I knew it all the time almost from the first And I have been as blind as a bat he cried a ring of vexation in his voice I never dreamed it until just how when I when I kissed you I didn t mean that She drew herself partly away and looked at him I meant I knew you loved almost from the first And you he demanded It came to me suddenly She was speaking very slowly her eyes warm and fluttery and melting a soft flush on her cheeks that did not go away I never knew until just now when you put your arms around me And I never expected to marry you Martin not until just now How did you make me love you I don t know he laughed unless just by loving you for I loved you hard enough to melt the heart of a stone much less the heart of the living breathing woman you are This is so different from what I thought love would be she announced irrelevantly What did you think it would be like I didn t think it would be like this She was looking into his eyes at the moment but her own dropped as she continued You see I didn t know what this was like He offered to draw her toward him again but it was no more than a tentative muscular movement of the girdling arm for he feared that he might be greedy Then he felt her body yielding and once again she was close in his arms and lips were pressed on lips What will my people say she queried with sudden apprehension in one of the pauses I don t know We can find out very easily any time we are so minded But if mamma objects I am sure I am afraid to tell her Let me tell her he volunteered valiantly I think your mother does not like me but I can win her around A fellow who can win you can win anything And if we don t Yes Why we ll have each other But there s no danger not winning your mother to our marriage She loves you too well I should not like to break her heart Ruth said pensively He felt like assuring her that mothers hearts were not so easily broken but instead he said And love is the greatest thing in the world Do you know Martin you sometimes frighten me I am frightened now when I think of you and of what you have been You must be very very good to me Remember after all that I am only a child I never loved before Nor I We are both children together And we are fortunate above most for we have found our first love in each other But that is impossible she cried withdrawing herself from his arms with a swift passionate movement Impossible for you You have been a sailor and sailors I have heard are are Her voice faltered and died away Are addicted to having a wife in every port he suggested Is that what you mean Yes she answered in a low voice But that is not love He spoke authoritatively I have been in many ports but I never knew a passing touch of love until I saw you that first night Do you know when I said good night and went away I was almost arrested Arrested Yes The policeman thought I was drunk and I was too with love for you But you said we were children and I said it was impossible for you and we have strayed away from the point I said that I never loved anybody but you he replied You are my first my very first And yet you have been a sailor she objected But that doesn t prevent me from loving you the first And there have been women other women oh And to Martin Eden s supreme surprise she burst into a storm of tears that took more kisses than one and many caresses to drive away And all the while there was running through his head Kipling s line And the Colonel s lady and Judy O Grady are sisters under their skins It was true he decided though the novels he had read had led him to believe otherwise His idea for which the novels were responsible had been that only formal proposals obtained in the upper classes It was all right enough down whence he had come for youths and maidens to win each other by contact but for the exalted personages up above on the heights to make love in similar fashion had seemed unthinkable Yet the novels were wrong Here was a proof of it The same pressures and caresses unaccompanied by speech that were efficacious with the girls of the working class were equally efficacious with the girls above the working class They were all of the same flesh after all sisters under their skins and he might have known as much himself had he remembered his Spencer As he held Ruth in his arms and soothed her he took great consolation in the thought that the Colonel s lady and Judy O Grady were pretty much alike under their skins It brought Ruth closer to him made her possible Her dear flesh was as anybody s flesh as his flesh There was no bar to their marriage Class difference was the only difference and class was extrinsic It could be shaken off A slave he had read had risen to the Roman purple That being so then he could rise to Ruth Under her purity and saintliness and culture and ethereal beauty of soul she was in things fundamentally human just like Lizzie Connolly and all Lizzie Connollys All that was possible of them was possible of her She could love and hate maybe have hysterics and she could certainly be jealous as she was jealous now uttering her last sobs in his arms Besides I am older than you she remarked suddenly opening her eyes and looking up at him three years older Hush you are only a child and I am forty years older than you in experience was his answer In truth they were children together so far as love was concerned and they were as naive and immature in the expression of their love as a pair of children and this despite the fact that she was crammed with a university education and that his head was full of scientific philosophy and the hard facts of life They sat on through the passing glory of the day talking as lovers are prone to talk marvelling at the wonder of love and at destiny that had flung them so strangely together and dogmatically believing that they loved to a degree never attained by lovers before And they returned insistently again and again to a rehearsal of their first impressions of each other and to hopeless attempts to analyze just precisely what they felt for each other and how much there was of it The cloud masses on the western horizon received the descending sun and the circle of the sky turned to rose while the zenith glowed with the same warm color The rosy light was all about them flooding over them as she sang Good by Sweet Day She sang softly leaning in the cradle of his arm her hands in his their hearts in each other s hands CHAPTER XXII missus Morse did not require a mother s intuition to read the advertisement in Ruth s face when she returned home The flush that would not leave the cheeks told the simple story and more eloquently did the eyes large and bright reflecting an unmistakable inward glory What has happened missus Morse asked having bided her time till Ruth had gone to bed You know Ruth queried with trembling lips For reply her mother s arm went around her and a hand was softly caressing her hair He did not speak she blurted out I did not intend that it should happen and I would never have let him speak only he didn t speak But if he did not speak then nothing could have happened could it But it did just the same In the name of goodness child what are you babbling about missus Morse was bewildered I don t think I know what happened after all What did happen Ruth looked at her mother in surprise I thought you knew Why we re engaged Martin and I missus Morse laughed with incredulous vexation No he didn t speak Ruth explained He just loved me that was all I was as surprised as you are He didn t say a word He just put his arm around me And and I was not myself And he kissed me and I kissed him I couldn t help it I just had to And then I knew I loved him She paused waiting with expectancy the benediction of her mother s kiss but missus Morse was coldly silent It is a dreadful accident I know Ruth recommenced with a sinking voice And I don t know how you will ever forgive me But I couldn t help it I did not dream that I loved him until that moment And you must tell father for me Would it not be better not to tell your father Let me see Martin Eden and talk with him and explain He will understand and release you No no Ruth cried starting up I do not want to be released I love him and love is very sweet I am going to marry him of course if you will let me We have other plans for you Ruth dear your father and I oh no no no man picked out for you or anything like that Our plans go no farther than your marrying some man in your own station in life a good and honorable gentleman whom you will select yourself when you love him But I love Martin already was the plaintive protest We would not influence your choice in any way but you are our daughter and we could not bear to see you make a marriage such as this He has nothing but roughness and coarseness to offer you in exchange for all that is refined and delicate in you He is no match for you in any way He could not support you We have no foolish ideas about wealth but comfort is another matter and our daughter should at least marry a man who can give her that and not a penniless adventurer a sailor a cowboy a smuggler and Heaven knows what else who in addition to everything is hare brained and irresponsible Ruth was silent Every word she recognized as true He wastes his time over his writing trying to accomplish what geniuses and rare men with college educations sometimes accomplish A man thinking of marriage should be preparing for marriage But not he As I have said and I know you agree with me he is irresponsible And why should he not be It is the way of sailors He has never learned to be economical or temperate The spendthrift years have marked him It is not his fault of course but that does not alter his nature And have you thought of the years of licentiousness he inevitably has lived Have you thought of that daughter You know what marriage means Ruth shuddered and clung close to her mother I have thought Ruth waited a long time for the thought to frame itself And it is terrible It sickens me to think of it I told you it was a dreadful accident my loving him but I can t help myself Could you help loving father Then it is the same with me There is something in me in him I never knew it was there until to day but it is there and it makes me love him I never thought to love him but you see I do she concluded a certain faint triumph in her voice They talked long and to little purpose in conclusion agreeing to wait an indeterminate time without doing anything The same conclusion was reached a little later that night between missus Morse and her husband after she had made due confession of the miscarriage of her plans It could hardly have come otherwise was mister Morse s judgment This sailor fellow has been the only man she was in touch with Sooner or later she was going to awaken anyway and she did awaken and lo here was this sailor fellow the only accessible man at the moment and of course she promptly loved him or thought she did which amounts to the same thing missus Morse took it upon herself to work slowly and indirectly upon Ruth rather than to combat her There would be plenty of time for this for Martin was not in position to marry Let her see all she wants of him was mister Morse s advice The more she knows him the less she ll love him I wager And give her plenty of contrast Make a point of having young people at the house Young women and young men all sorts of young men clever men men who have done something or who are doing things men of her own class gentlemen She can gauge him by them They will show him up for what he is And after all he is a mere boy of twenty one Ruth is no more than a child It is calf love with the pair of them and they will grow out of it So the matter rested Within the family it was accepted that Ruth and Martin were engaged but no announcement was made The family did not think it would ever be necessary Also it was tacitly understood that it was to be a long engagement They did not ask Martin to go to work nor to cease writing They did not intend to encourage him to mend himself And he aided and abetted them in their unfriendly designs for going to work was farthest from his thoughts I wonder if you ll like what I have done he said to Ruth several days later I ve decided that boarding with my sister is too expensive and I am going to board myself I ve rented a little room out in North Oakland retired neighborhood and all the rest you know and I ve bought an oil burner on which to cook Ruth was overjoyed The oil burner especially pleased her That was the way mister Butler began his start she said Martin frowned inwardly at the citation of that worthy gentleman and went on I put stamps on all my manuscripts and started them off to the editors again Then to day I moved in and to morrow I start to work A position she cried betraying the gladness of her surprise in all her body nestling closer to him pressing his hand smiling And you never told me What is it He shook his head I meant that I was going to work at my writing Her face fell and he went on hastily Don t misjudge me I am not going in this time with any iridescent ideas It is to be a cold prosaic matter of fact business proposition It is better than going to sea again and I shall earn more money than any position in Oakland can bring an unskilled man You see this vacation I have taken has given me perspective I haven t been working the life out of my body and I haven t been writing at least not for publication All I ve done has been to love you and to think I ve read some too but it has been part of my thinking and I have read principally magazines I have generalized about myself and the world my place in it and my chance to win to a place that will be fit for you Also I ve been reading Spencer s Philosophy of Style and found out a lot of what was the matter with me or my writing rather and for that matter with most of the writing that is published every month in the magazines But the upshot of it all of my thinking and reading and loving is that I am going to move to Grub Street I shall leave masterpieces alone and do hack work jokes paragraphs feature articles humorous verse and society verse all the rot for which there seems so much demand Then there are the newspaper syndicates and the newspaper short story syndicates and the syndicates for the Sunday supplements I can go ahead and hammer out the stuff they want and earn the equivalent of a good salary by it There are free lances you know who earn as much as four or five hundred a month I don t care to become as they but I ll earn a good living and have plenty of time to myself which I wouldn t have in any position Then I ll have my spare time for study and for real work In between the grind I ll try my hand at masterpieces and I ll study and prepare myself for the writing of masterpieces Why I am amazed at the distance I have come already When I first tried to write I had nothing to write about except a few paltry experiences which I neither understood nor appreciated But I had no thoughts I really didn t I didn t even have the words with which to think My experiences were so many meaningless pictures But as I began to add to my knowledge and to my vocabulary I saw something more in my experiences than mere pictures I retained the pictures and I found their interpretation That was when I began to do good work when I wrote Adventure Joy The Pot The Wine of Life The Jostling Street the Love cycle and the Sea Lyrics I shall write more like them and better but I shall do it in my spare time My feet are on the solid earth now Hack work and income first masterpieces afterward Just to show you I wrote half a dozen jokes last night for the comic weeklies and just as I was going to bed the thought struck me to try my hand at a triolet a humorous one and inside an hour I had written four They ought to be worth a dollar apiece Four dollars right there for a few afterthoughts on the way to bed Of course it s all valueless just so much dull and sordid plodding but it is no more dull and sordid than keeping books at sixty dollars a month adding up endless columns of meaningless figures until one dies And furthermore the hack work keeps me in touch with things literary and gives me time to try bigger things But what good are these bigger things these masterpieces Ruth demanded You can t sell them Oh yes I can he began but she interrupted All those you named and which you say yourself are good you have not sold any of them We can t get married on masterpieces that won t sell Then we ll get married on triolets that will sell he asserted stoutly putting his arm around her and drawing a very unresponsive sweetheart toward him Listen to this he went on in attempted gayety It s not art but it s a dollar He came in When I was out To borrow some tin Was why he came in And he went without So I was in And he was out The merry lilt with which he had invested the jingle was at variance with the dejection that came into his face as he finished He had drawn no smile from Ruth She was looking at him in an earnest and troubled way It may be a dollar she said but it is a jester s dollar the fee of a clown Don t you see Martin the whole thing is lowering I want the man I love and honor to be something finer and higher than a perpetrator of jokes and doggerel You want him to be like say mister Butler he suggested I know you don t like mister Butler she began mister Butler s all right he interrupted It s only his indigestion I find fault with But to save me I can t see any difference between writing jokes or comic verse and running a type writer taking dictation or keeping sets of books It is all a means to an end Your theory is for me to begin with keeping books in order to become a successful lawyer or man of business Mine is to begin with hack work and develop into an able author There is a difference she insisted What is it Why your good work what you yourself call good you can t sell You have tried you know that but the editors won t buy it Give me time dear he pleaded The hack work is only makeshift and I don t take it seriously Give me two years I shall succeed in that time and the editors will be glad to buy my good work I know what I am saying I have faith in myself I know what I have in me I know what literature is now I know the average rot that is poured out by a lot of little men and I know that at the end of two years I shall be on the highroad to success As for business I shall never succeed at it I am not in sympathy with it It strikes me as dull and stupid and mercenary and tricky Anyway I am not adapted for it I d never get beyond a clerkship and how could you and I be happy on the paltry earnings of a clerk I want the best of everything in the world for you and the only time when I won t want it will be when there is something better And I m going to get it going to get all of it The income of a successful author makes mister Butler look cheap A best seller will earn anywhere between fifty and a hundred thousand dollars sometimes more and sometimes less but as a rule pretty close to those figures She remained silent her disappointment was apparent Well he asked I had hoped and planned otherwise I had thought and I still think that the best thing for you would be to study shorthand you already know type writing and go into father s office You have a good mind and I am confident you would succeed as a lawyer CHAPTER XXIII That Ruth had little faith in his power as a writer did not alter her nor diminish her in Martin s eyes In the breathing spell of the vacation he had taken he had spent many hours in self analysis and thereby learned much of himself He had discovered that he loved beauty more than fame and that what desire he had for fame was largely for Ruth s sake It was for this reason that his desire for fame was strong He wanted to be great in the world s eyes to make good as he expressed it in order that the woman he loved should be proud of him and deem him worthy As for himself he loved beauty passionately and the joy of serving her was to him sufficient wage And more than beauty he loved Ruth He considered love the finest thing in the world It was love that had worked the revolution in him changing him from an uncouth sailor to a student and an artist therefore to him the finest and greatest of the three greater than learning and artistry was love Already he had discovered that his brain went beyond Ruth s just as it went beyond the brains of her brothers or the brain of her father In spite of every advantage of university training and in the face of her bachelorship of arts his power of intellect overshadowed hers and his year or so of self study and equipment gave him a mastery of the affairs of the world and art and life that she could never hope to possess All this he realized but it did not affect his love for her nor her love for him Love was too fine and noble and he was too loyal a lover for him to besmirch love with criticism What did love have to do with Ruth s divergent views on art right conduct the French Revolution or equal suffrage They were mental processes but love was beyond reason it was superrational He could not belittle love He worshipped it Love lay on the mountain tops beyond the valley land of reason It was a sublimates condition of existence the topmost peak of living and it came rarely Thanks to the school of scientific philosophers he favored he knew the biological significance of love but by a refined process of the same scientific reasoning he reached the conclusion that the human organism achieved its highest purpose in love that love must not be questioned but must be accepted as the highest guerdon of life Thus he considered the lover blessed over all creatures and it was a delight to him to think of God s own mad lover rising above the things of earth above wealth and judgment public opinion and applause rising above life itself and dying on a kiss Much of this Martin had already reasoned out and some of it he reasoned out later In the meantime he worked taking no recreation except when he went to see Ruth and living like a Spartan He paid two dollars and a half a month rent for the small room he got from his Portuguese landlady Maria Silva a virago and a widow hard working and harsher tempered rearing her large brood of children somehow and drowning her sorrow and fatigue at irregular intervals in a gallon of the thin sour wine that she bought from the corner grocery and saloon for fifteen cents From detesting her and her foul tongue at first Martin grew to admire her as he observed the brave fight she made There were but four rooms in the little house three when Martin s was subtracted One of these the parlor gay with an ingrain carpet and dolorous with a funeral card and a death picture of one of her numerous departed babes was kept strictly for company The blinds were always down and her barefooted tribe was never permitted to enter the sacred precinct save on state occasions She cooked and all ate in the kitchen where she likewise washed starched and ironed clothes on all days of the week except Sunday for her income came largely from taking in washing from her more prosperous neighbors Remained the bedroom small as the one occupied by Martin into which she and her seven little ones crowded and slept It was an everlasting miracle to Martin how it was accomplished and from her side of the thin partition he heard nightly every detail of the going to bed the squalls and squabbles the soft chattering and the sleepy twittering noises as of birds Another source of income to Maria were her cows two of them which she milked night and morning and which gained a surreptitious livelihood from vacant lots and the grass that grew on either side the public side walks attended always by one or more of her ragged boys whose watchful guardianship consisted chiefly in keeping their eyes out for the poundmen In his own small room Martin lived slept studied wrote and kept house Before the one window looking out on the tiny front porch was the kitchen table that served as desk library and type writing stand The bed against the rear wall occupied two thirds of the total space of the room The table was flanked on one side by a gaudy bureau manufactured for profit and not for service the thin veneer of which was shed day by day This bureau stood in the corner and in the opposite corner on the table s other flank was the kitchen the oil stove on a dry goods box inside of which were dishes and cooking utensils a shelf on the wall for provisions and a bucket of water on the floor Martin had to carry his water from the kitchen sink there being no tap in his room On days when there was much steam to his cooking the harvest of veneer from the bureau was unusually generous Over the bed hoisted by a tackle to the ceiling was his bicycle At first he had tried to keep it in the basement but the tribe of Silva loosening the bearings and puncturing the tires had driven him out Next he attempted the tiny front porch until a howling southeaster drenched the wheel a night long Then he had retreated with it to his room and slung it aloft A small closet contained his clothes and the books he had accumulated and for which there was no room on the table or under the table Hand in hand with reading he had developed the habit of making notes and so copiously did he make them that there would have been no existence for him in the confined quarters had he not rigged several clothes lines across the room on which the notes were hung Even so he was crowded until navigating the room was a difficult task He could not open the door without first closing the closet door and vice versa It was impossible for him anywhere to traverse the room in a straight line To go from the door to the head of the bed was a zigzag course that he was never quite able to accomplish in the dark without collisions Having settled the difficulty of the conflicting doors he had to steer sharply to the right to avoid the kitchen Next he sheered to the left to escape the foot of the bed but this sheer if too generous brought him against the corner of the table With a sudden twitch and lurch he terminated the sheer and bore off to the right along a sort of canal one bank of which was the bed the other the table When the one chair in the room was at its usual place before the table the canal was unnavigable When the chair was not in use it reposed on top of the bed though sometimes he sat on the chair when cooking reading a book while the water boiled and even becoming skilful enough to manage a paragraph or two while steak was frying Also so small was the little corner that constituted the kitchen he was able sitting down to reach anything he needed In fact it was expedient to cook sitting down standing up he was too often in his own way In conjunction with a perfect stomach that could digest anything he possessed knowledge of the various foods that were at the same time nutritious and cheap Pea soup was a common article in his diet as well as potatoes and beans the latter large and brown and cooked in Mexican style Rice cooked as American housewives never cook it and can never learn to cook it appeared on Martin s table at least once a day Dried fruits were less expensive than fresh and he had usually a pot of them cooked and ready at hand for they took the place of butter on his bread Occasionally he graced his table with a piece of round steak or with a soup bone Coffee without cream or milk he had twice a day in the evening substituting tea but both coffee and tea were excellently cooked There was need for him to be economical His vacation had consumed nearly all he had earned in the laundry and he was so far from his market that weeks must elapse before he could hope for the first returns from his hack work Except at such times as he saw Ruth or dropped in to see his sister Gertude he lived a recluse in each day accomplishing at least three days labor of ordinary men He slept a scant five hours and only one with a constitution of iron could have held himself down as Martin did day after day to nineteen consecutive hours of toil He never lost a moment On the looking glass were lists of definitions and pronunciations when shaving or dressing or combing his hair he conned these lists over Similar lists were on the wall over the oil stove and they were similarly conned while he was engaged in cooking or in washing the dishes New lists continually displaced the old ones Every strange or partly familiar word encountered in his reading was immediately jotted down and later when a sufficient number had been accumulated were typed and pinned to the wall or looking glass He even carried them in his pockets and reviewed them at odd moments on the street or while waiting in butcher shop or grocery to be served He went farther in the matter Reading the works of men who had arrived he noted every result achieved by them and worked out the tricks by which they had been achieved the tricks of narrative of exposition of style the points of view the contrasts the epigrams and of all these he made lists for study He did not ape He sought principles He drew up lists of effective and fetching mannerisms till out of many such culled from many writers he was able to induce the general principle of mannerism and thus equipped to cast about for new and original ones of his own and to weigh and measure and appraise them properly In similar manner he collected lists of strong phrases the phrases of living language phrases that bit like acid and scorched like flame or that glowed and were mellow and luscious in the midst of the arid desert of common speech He sought always for the principle that lay behind and beneath He wanted to know how the thing was done after that he could do it for himself He was not content with the fair face of beauty He dissected beauty in his crowded little bedroom laboratory where cooking smells alternated with the outer bedlam of the Silva tribe and having dissected and learned the anatomy of beauty he was nearer being able to create beauty itself He was so made that he could work only with understanding He could not work blindly in the dark ignorant of what he was producing and trusting to chance and the star of his genius that the effect produced should be right and fine He had no patience with chance effects He wanted to know why and how His was deliberate creative genius and before he began a story or poem the thing itself was already alive in his brain with the end in sight and the means of realizing that end in his conscious possession Otherwise the effort was doomed to failure On the other hand he appreciated the chance effects in words and phrases that came lightly and easily into his brain and that later stood all tests of beauty and power and developed tremendous and incommunicable connotations Before such he bowed down and marvelled knowing that they were beyond the deliberate creation of any man And no matter how much he dissected beauty in search of the principles that underlie beauty and make beauty possible he was aware always of the innermost mystery of beauty to which he did not penetrate and to which no man had ever penetrated He knew full well from his Spencer that man can never attain ultimate knowledge of anything and that the mystery of beauty was no less than that of life nay more that the fibres of beauty and life were intertwisted and that he himself was but a bit of the same nonunderstandable fabric twisted of sunshine and star dust and wonder In fact it was when filled with these thoughts that he wrote his essay entitled Star dust in which he had his fling not at the principles of criticism but at the principal critics It was brilliant deep philosophical and deliciously touched with laughter Also it was promptly rejected by the magazines as often as it was submitted But having cleared his mind of it he went serenely on his way It was a habit he developed of incubating and maturing his thought upon a subject and of then rushing into the type writer with it That it did not see print was a matter a small moment with him The writing of it was the culminating act of a long mental process the drawing together of scattered threads of thought and the final generalizing upon all the data with which his mind was burdened To write such an article was the conscious effort by which he freed his mind and made it ready for fresh material and problems It was in a way akin to that common habit of men and women troubled by real or fancied grievances who periodically and volubly break their long suffering silence and have their say till the last word is said CHAPTER XXIV The weeks passed Martin ran out of money and publishers checks were far away as ever All his important manuscripts had come back and been started out again and his hack work fared no better His little kitchen was no longer graced with a variety of foods Caught in the pinch with a part sack of rice and a few pounds of dried apricots rice and apricots was his menu three times a day for five days hand running Then he startled to realize on his credit The Portuguese grocer to whom he had hitherto paid cash called a halt when Martin s bill reached the magnificent total of three dollars and eighty five cents For you see said the grocer you no catcha da work I losa da mon And Martin could reply nothing There was no way of explaining It was not true business principle to allow credit to a strong bodied young fellow of the working class who was too lazy to work You catcha da job I let you have mora da grub the grocer assured Martin No job no grub Thata da business And then to show that it was purely business foresight and not prejudice Hava da drink on da house good friends justa da same So Martin drank in his easy way to show that he was good friends with the house and then went supperless to bed The fruit store where Martin had bought his vegetables was run by an American whose business principles were so weak that he let Martin run a bill of five dollars before stopping his credit The baker stopped at two dollars and the butcher at four dollars Martin added his debts and found that he was possessed of a total credit in all the world of fourteen dollars and eighty five cents He was up with his type writer rent but he estimated that he could get two months credit on that which would be eight dollars When that occurred he would have exhausted all possible credit The last purchase from the fruit store had been a sack of potatoes and for a week he had potatoes and nothing but potatoes three times a day An occasional dinner at Ruth s helped to keep strength in his body though he found it tantalizing enough to refuse further helping when his appetite was raging at sight of so much food spread before it Now and again though afflicted with secret shame he dropped in at his sister s at meal time and ate as much as he dared more than he dared at the Morse table Day by day he worked on and day by day the postman delivered to him rejected manuscripts He had no money for stamps so the manuscripts accumulated in a heap under the table Came a day when for forty hours he had not tasted food He could not hope for a meal at Ruth s for she was away to San Rafael on a two weeks visit and for very shame s sake he could not go to his sister s To cap misfortune the postman in his afternoon round brought him five returned manuscripts Then it was that Martin wore his overcoat down into Oakland and came back without it but with five dollars tinkling in his pocket He paid a dollar each on account to the four tradesmen and in his kitchen fried steak and onions made coffee and stewed a large pot of prunes And having dined he sat down at his table desk and completed before midnight an essay which he entitled The Dignity of Usury Having typed it out he flung it under the table for there had been nothing left from the five dollars with which to buy stamps Later on he pawned his watch and still later his wheel reducing the amount available for food by putting stamps on all his manuscripts and sending them out He was disappointed with his hack work Nobody cared to buy He compared it with what he found in the newspapers weeklies and cheap magazines and decided that his was better far better than the average yet it would not sell Then he discovered that most of the newspapers printed a great deal of what was called plate stuff and he got the address of the association that furnished it His own work that he sent in was returned along with a stereotyped slip informing him that the staff supplied all the copy that was needed In one of the great juvenile periodicals he noted whole columns of incident and anecdote Here was a chance His paragraphs were returned and though he tried repeatedly he never succeeded in placing one Later on when it no longer mattered he learned that the associate editors and sub editors augmented their salaries by supplying those paragraphs themselves The comic weeklies returned his jokes and humorous verse and the light society verse he wrote for the large magazines found no abiding place Then there was the newspaper storiette He knew that he could write better ones than were published Managing to obtain the addresses of two newspaper syndicates he deluged them with storiettes When he had written twenty and failed to place one of them he ceased And yet from day to day he read storiettes in the dailies and weeklies scores and scores of storiettes not one of which would compare with his In his despondency he concluded that he had no judgment whatever that he was hypnotized by what he wrote and that he was a self deluded pretender The inhuman editorial machine ran smoothly as ever He folded the stamps in with his manuscript dropped it into the letter box and from three weeks to a month afterward the postman came up the steps and handed him the manuscript Surely there were no live warm editors at the other end It was all wheels and cogs and oil cups a clever mechanism operated by automatons He reached stages of despair wherein he doubted if editors existed at all He had never received a sign of the existence of one and from absence of judgment in rejecting all he wrote it seemed plausible that editors were myths manufactured and maintained by office boys typesetters and pressmen The hours he spent with Ruth were the only happy ones he had and they were not all happy He was afflicted always with a gnawing restlessness more tantalizing than in the old days before he possessed her love for now that he did possess her love the possession of her was far away as ever He had asked for two years time was flying and he was achieving nothing Again he was always conscious of the fact that she did not approve what he was doing She did not say so directly Yet indirectly she let him understand it as clearly and definitely as she could have spoken it It was not resentment with her but disapproval though less sweet natured women might have resented where she was no more than disappointed Her disappointment lay in that this man she had taken to mould refused to be moulded To a certain extent she had found his clay plastic then it had developed stubbornness declining to be shaped in the image of her father or of mister Butler What was great and strong in him she missed or worse yet misunderstood This man whose clay was so plastic that he could live in any number of pigeonholes of human existence she thought wilful and most obstinate because she could not shape him to live in her pigeonhole which was the only one she knew She could not follow the flights of his mind and when his brain got beyond her she deemed him erratic Nobody else s brain ever got beyond her She could always follow her father and mother her brothers and Olney wherefore when she could not follow Martin she believed the fault lay with him It was the old tragedy of insularity trying to serve as mentor to the universal You worship at the shrine of the established he told her once in a discussion they had over Praps and Vanderwater I grant that as authorities to quote they are most excellent the two foremost literary critics in the United States Every school teacher in the land looks up to Vanderwater as the Dean of American criticism Yet I read his stuff and it seems to me the perfection of the felicitous expression of the inane Why he is no more than a ponderous bromide thanks to Gelett Burgess And Praps is no better His Hemlock Mosses for instance is beautifully written Not a comma is out of place and the tone ah is lofty so lofty He is the best paid critic in the United States Though Heaven forbid he s not a critic at all They do criticism better in England But the point is they sound the popular note and they sound it so beautifully and morally and contentedly Their reviews remind me of a British Sunday They are the popular mouthpieces They back up your professors of English and your professors of English back them up And there isn t an original idea in any of their skulls They know only the established in fact they are the established They are weak minded and the established impresses itself upon them as easily as the name of the brewery is impressed on a beer bottle And their function is to catch all the young fellows attending the university to drive out of their minds any glimmering originality that may chance to be there and to put upon them the stamp of the established I think I am nearer the truth she replied when I stand by the established than you are raging around like an iconoclastic South Sea Islander It was the missionary who did the image breaking he laughed And unfortunately all the missionaries are off among the heathen so there are none left at home to break those old images mister Vanderwater and mister Praps And the college professors as well she added He shook his head emphatically No the science professors should live They re really great But it would be a good deed to break the heads of nine tenths of the English professors little microscopic minded parrots Which was rather severe on the professors but which to Ruth was blasphemy She could not help but measure the professors neat scholarly in fitting clothes speaking in well modulated voices breathing of culture and refinement with this almost indescribable young fellow whom somehow she loved whose clothes never would fit him whose heavy muscles told of damning toil who grew excited when he talked substituting abuse for calm statement and passionate utterance for cool self possession They at least earned good salaries and were yes she compelled herself to face it were gentlemen while he could not earn a penny and he was not as they She did not weigh Martin s words nor judge his argument by them Her conclusion that his argument was wrong was reached unconsciously it is true by a comparison of externals They the professors were right in their literary judgments because they were successes Martin s literary judgments were wrong because he could not sell his wares To use his own phrase they made good and he did not make good And besides it did not seem reasonable that he should be right he who had stood so short a time before in that same living room blushing and awkward acknowledging his introduction looking fearfully about him at the bric a brac his swinging shoulders threatened to break asking how long since Swinburne died and boastfully announcing that he had read Excelsior and the Psalm of Life Unwittingly Ruth herself proved his point that she worshipped the established Martin followed the processes of her thoughts but forbore to go farther He did not love her for what she thought of Praps and Vanderwater and English professors and he was coming to realize with increasing conviction that he possessed brain areas and stretches of knowledge which she could never comprehend nor know existed In music she thought him unreasonable and in the matter of opera not only unreasonable but wilfully perverse How did you like it she asked him one night on the way home from the opera It was a night when he had taken her at the expense of a month s rigid economizing on food After vainly waiting for him to speak about it herself still tremulous and stirred by what she had just seen and heard she had asked the question I liked the overture was his answer It was splendid Yes but the opera itself That was splendid too that is the orchestra was though I d have enjoyed it more if those jumping jacks had kept quiet or gone off the stage Ruth was aghast You don t mean Tetralani or Barillo she queried All of them the whole kit and crew But they are great artists she protested They spoiled the music just the same with their antics and unrealities But don t you like Barillo s voice Ruth asked He is next to Caruso they say Of course I liked him and I liked Tetralani even better Her voice is exquisite or at least I think so But but Ruth stammered I don t know what you mean then You admire their voices yet say they spoiled the music Precisely that I d give anything to hear them in concert and I d give even a bit more not to hear them when the orchestra is playing I m afraid I am a hopeless realist Great singers are not great actors To hear Barillo sing a love passage with the voice of an angel and to hear Tetralani reply like another angel and to hear it all accompanied by a perfect orgy of glowing and colorful music is ravishing most ravishing I do not admit it I assert it But the whole effect is spoiled when I look at them at Tetralani five feet ten in her stocking feet and weighing a hundred and ninety pounds and at Barillo a scant five feet four greasy featured with the chest of a squat undersized blacksmith and at the pair of them attitudinizing clasping their breasts flinging their arms in the air like demented creatures in an asylum and when I am expected to accept all this as the faithful illusion of a love scene between a slender and beautiful princess and a handsome romantic young prince why I can t accept it that s all It s rot it s absurd it s unreal That s what s the matter with it It s not real Don t tell me that anybody in this world ever made love that way Why if I d made love to you in such fashion you d have boxed my ears But you misunderstand Ruth protested Every form of art has its limitations She was busy recalling a lecture she had heard at the university on the conventions of the arts In painting there are only two dimensions to the canvas yet you accept the illusion of three dimensions which the art of a painter enables him to throw into the canvas In writing again the author must be omnipotent You accept as perfectly legitimate the author s account of the secret thoughts of the heroine and yet all the time you know that the heroine was alone when thinking these thoughts and that neither the author nor any one else was capable of hearing them And so with the stage with sculpture with opera with every art form Certain irreconcilable things must be accepted Yes I understood that Martin answered All the arts have their conventions Ruth was surprised at his use of the word It was as if he had studied at the university himself instead of being ill equipped from browsing at haphazard through the books in the library But even the conventions must be real Trees painted on flat cardboard and stuck up on each side of the stage we accept as a forest It is a real enough convention But on the other hand we would not accept a sea scene as a forest We can t do it It violates our senses Nor would you or rather should you accept the ravings and writhings and agonized contortions of those two lunatics to night as a convincing portrayal of love But you don t hold yourself superior to all the judges of music she protested No no not for a moment I merely maintain my right as an individual I have just been telling you what I think in order to explain why the elephantine gambols of Madame Tetralani spoil the orchestra for me The world s judges of music may all be right But I am I and I won t subordinate my taste to the unanimous judgment of mankind If I don t like a thing I don t like it that s all and there is no reason under the sun why I should ape a liking for it just because the majority of my fellow creatures like it or make believe they like it I can t follow the fashions in the things I like or dislike But music you know is a matter of training Ruth argued and opera is even more a matter of training May it not be That I am not trained in opera he dashed in She nodded The very thing he agreed And I consider I am fortunate in not having been caught when I was young If I had I could have wept sentimental tears to night and the clownish antics of that precious pair would have but enhanced the beauty of their voices and the beauty of the accompanying orchestra You are right It s mostly a matter of training And I am too old now I must have the real or nothing An illusion that won t convince is a palpable lie and that s what grand opera is to me when little Barillo throws a fit clutches mighty Tetralani in his arms also in a fit and tells her how passionately he adores her Again Ruth measured his thoughts by comparison of externals and in accordance with her belief in the established Who was he that he should be right and all the cultured world wrong His words and thoughts made no impression upon her She was too firmly intrenched in the established to have any sympathy with revolutionary ideas She had always been used to music and she had enjoyed opera ever since she was a child and all her world had enjoyed it too Then by what right did Martin Eden emerge as he had so recently emerged from his rag time and working class songs and pass judgment on the world s music She was vexed with him and as she walked beside him she had a vague feeling of outrage At the best in her most charitable frame of mind she considered the statement of his views to be a caprice an erratic and uncalled for prank But when he took her in his arms at the door and kissed her good night in tender lover fashion she forgot everything in the outrush of her own love to him And later on a sleepless pillow she puzzled as she had often puzzled of late as to how it was that she loved so strange a man and loved him despite the disapproval of her people And next day Martin Eden cast hack work aside and at white heat hammered out an essay to which he gave the title The Philosophy of Illusion A stamp started it on its travels but it was destined to receive many stamps and to be started on many travels in the months that followed CHAPTER XXV Maria Silva was poor and all the ways of poverty were clear to her Poverty to Ruth was a word signifying a not nice condition of existence That was her total knowledge on the subject She knew Martin was poor and his condition she associated in her mind with the boyhood of Abraham Lincoln of mister Butler and of other men who had become successes Also while aware that poverty was anything but delectable she had a comfortable middle class feeling that poverty was salutary that it was a sharp spur that urged on to success all men who were not degraded and hopeless drudges So that her knowledge that Martin was so poor that he had pawned his watch and overcoat did not disturb her She even considered it the hopeful side of the situation believing that sooner or later it would arouse him and compel him to abandon his writing Ruth never read hunger in Martin s face which had grown lean and had enlarged the slight hollows in the cheeks In fact she marked the change in his face with satisfaction It seemed to refine him to remove from him much of the dross of flesh and the too animal like vigor that lured her while she detested it Sometimes when with her she noted an unusual brightness in his eyes and she admired it for it made him appear more the poet and the scholar the things he would have liked to be and which she would have liked him to be But Maria Silva read a different tale in the hollow cheeks and the burning eyes and she noted the changes in them from day to day by them following the ebb and flow of his fortunes She saw him leave the house with his overcoat and return without it though the day was chill and raw and promptly she saw his cheeks fill out slightly and the fire of hunger leave his eyes In the same way she had seen his wheel and watch go and after each event she had seen his vigor bloom again Likewise she watched his toils and knew the measure of the midnight oil he burned Work She knew that he outdid her though his work was of a different order And she was surprised to behold that the less food he had the harder he worked On occasion in a casual sort of way when she thought hunger pinched hardest she would send him in a loaf of new baking awkwardly covering the act with banter to the effect that it was better than he could bake And again she would send one of her toddlers in to him with a great pitcher of hot soup debating inwardly the while whether she was justified in taking it from the mouths of her own flesh and blood Nor was Martin ungrateful knowing as he did the lives of the poor and that if ever in the world there was charity this was it On a day when she had filled her brood with what was left in the house Maria invested her last fifteen cents in a gallon of cheap wine Martin coming into her kitchen to fetch water was invited to sit down and drink He drank her very good health and in return she drank his Then she drank to prosperity in his undertakings and he drank to the hope that James Grant would show up and pay her for his washing James Grant was a journeymen carpenter who did not always pay his bills and who owed Maria three dollars Both Maria and Martin drank the sour new wine on empty stomachs and it went swiftly to their heads Utterly differentiated creatures that they were they were lonely in their misery and though the misery was tacitly ignored it was the bond that drew them together Maria was amazed to learn that he had been in the Azores where she had lived until she was eleven She was doubly amazed that he had been in the Hawaiian Islands whither she had migrated from the Azores with her people But her amazement passed all bounds when he told her he had been on Maui the particular island whereon she had attained womanhood and married Kahului where she had first met her husband he Martin had been there twice Yes she remembered the sugar steamers and he had been on them well well it was a small world And Wailuku That place too Did he know the head luna of the plantation Yes and had had a couple of drinks with him And so they reminiscenced and drowned their hunger in the raw sour wine To Martin the future did not seem so dim Success trembled just before him He was on the verge of clasping it Then he studied the deep lined face of the toil worn woman before him remembered her soups and loaves of new baking and felt spring up in him the warmest gratitude and philanthropy Maria he exclaimed suddenly What would you like to have She looked at him bepuzzled What would you like to have now right now if you could get it Shoe alla da roun for da childs seven pairs da shoe You shall have them he announced while she nodded her head gravely But I mean a big wish something big that you want Her eyes sparkled good naturedly He was choosing to make fun with her Maria with whom few made fun these days Think hard he cautioned just as she was opening her mouth to speak Alla right she answered I thinka da hard I lika da house dis house all mine no paya da rent seven dollar da month You shall have it he granted and in a short time Now wish the great wish Make believe I am God and I say to you anything you want you can have Then you wish that thing and I listen Maria considered solemnly for a space You no fraid she asked warningly No no he laughed I m not afraid Go ahead Most verra big she warned again All right Fire away Well den She drew a big breath like a child as she voiced to the uttermost all she cared to demand of life I lika da have one milka ranch good milka ranch Plenty cow plenty land plenty grass I lika da have near San Le an my sister liva dere I sella da milk in Oakland I maka da plentee mon Joe an Nick no runna da cow Dey go a to school Bimeby maka da good engineer worka da railroad Yes I lika da milka ranch She paused and regarded Martin with twinkling eyes You shall have it he answered promptly She nodded her head and touched her lips courteously to the wine glass and to the giver of the gift she knew would never be given His heart was right and in her own heart she appreciated his intention as much as if the gift had gone with it No Maria he went on Nick and Joe won t have to peddle milk and all the kids can go to school and wear shoes the whole year round It will be a first class milk ranch everything complete There will be a house to live in and a stable for the horses and cow barns of course There will be chickens pigs vegetables fruit trees and everything like that and there will be enough cows to pay for a hired man or two Then you won t have anything to do but take care of the children For that matter if you find a good man you can marry and take it easy while he runs the ranch And from such largess dispensed from his future Martin turned and took his one good suit of clothes to the pawnshop His plight was desperate for him to do this for it cut him off from Ruth He had no second best suit that was presentable and though he could go to the butcher and the baker and even on occasion to his sister s it was beyond all daring to dream of entering the Morse home so disreputably apparelled He toiled on miserable and well nigh hopeless It began to appear to him that the second battle was lost and that he would have to go to work In doing this he would satisfy everybody the grocer his sister Ruth and even Maria to whom he owed a month s room rent He was two months behind with his type writer and the agency was clamoring for payment or for the return of the machine In desperation all but ready to surrender to make a truce with fate until he could get a fresh start he took the civil service examinations for the Railway Mail To his surprise he passed first The job was assured though when the call would come to enter upon his duties nobody knew It was at this time at the lowest ebb that the smooth running editorial machine broke down A cog must have slipped or an oil cup run dry for the postman brought him one morning a short thin envelope Martin glanced at the upper left hand corner and read the name and address of the Transcontinental Monthly His heart gave a great leap and he suddenly felt faint the sinking feeling accompanied by a strange trembling of the knees He staggered into his room and sat down on the bed the envelope still unopened and in that moment came understanding to him how people suddenly fall dead upon receipt of extraordinarily good news Of course this was good news There was no manuscript in that thin envelope therefore it was an acceptance He knew the story in the hands of the Transcontinental It was The Ring of Bells one of his horror stories and it was an even five thousand words And since first class magazines always paid on acceptance there was a check inside Two cents a word twenty dollars a thousand the check must be a hundred dollars One hundred dollars As he tore the envelope open every item of all his debts surged in his brain three dollars eighty five cents to the grocer butcher four dollars flat baker two dollars fruit store five dollars total fourteen dollars eighty five cents Then there was room rent two dollars fifty cents another month in advance two dollars fifty cents two months type writer eight dollars a month in advance four dollars total thirty one dollars eighty five cents And finally to be added his pledges plus interest with the pawnbroker watch five dollars fifty cents overcoat five dollars fifty cents wheel seven dollars seventy five cents suit of clothes five dollars fifty cents sixty interest but what did it matter grand total fifty six dollars ten cents He saw as if visible in the air before him in illuminated figures the whole sum and the subtraction that followed and that gave a remainder of forty three dollars ninety cents When he had squared every debt redeemed every pledge he would still have jingling in his pockets a princely forty three dollars ninety cents And on top of that he would have a month s rent paid in advance on the type writer and on the room By this time he had drawn the single sheet of type written letter out and spread it open There was no check He peered into the envelope held it to the light but could not trust his eyes and in trembling haste tore the envelope apart There was no check He read the letter skimming it line by line dashing through the editor s praise of his story to the meat of the letter the statement why the check had not been sent He found no such statement but he did find that which made him suddenly wilt The letter slid from his hand His eyes went lack lustre and he lay back on the pillow pulling the blanket about him and up to his chin Five dollars for The Ring of Bells five dollars for five thousand words Instead of two cents a word ten words for a cent And the editor had praised it too And he would receive the check when the story was published Then it was all poppycock two cents a word for minimum rate and payment upon acceptance It was a lie and it had led him astray He would never have attempted to write had he known that He would have gone to work to work for Ruth He went back to the day he first attempted to write and was appalled at the enormous waste of time and all for ten words for a cent And the other high rewards of writers that he had read about must be lies too His second hand ideas of authorship were wrong for here was the proof of it The Transcontinental sold for twenty five cents and its dignified and artistic cover proclaimed it as among the first class magazines It was a staid respectable magazine and it had been published continuously since long before he was born Why on the outside cover were printed every month the words of one of the world s great writers words proclaiming the inspired mission of the Transcontinental by a star of literature whose first coruscations had appeared inside those self same covers And the high and lofty heaven inspired Transcontinental paid five dollars for five thousand words The great writer had recently died in a foreign land in dire poverty Martin remembered which was not to be wondered at considering the magnificent pay authors receive Well he had taken the bait the newspaper lies about writers and their pay and he had wasted two years over it But he would disgorge the bait now Not another line would he ever write He would do what Ruth wanted him to do what everybody wanted him to do get a job The thought of going to work reminded him of Joe Joe tramping through the land of nothing to do Martin heaved a great sigh of envy The reaction of nineteen hours a day for many days was strong upon him But then Joe was not in love had none of the responsibilities of love and he could afford to loaf through the land of nothing to do He Martin had something to work for and go to work he would He would start out early next morning to hunt a job And he would let Ruth know too that he had mended his ways and was willing to go into her father s office Five dollars for five thousand words ten words for a cent the market price for art The disappointment of it the lie of it the infamy of it were uppermost in his thoughts and under his closed eyelids in fiery figures burned the three dollars eighty five cents he owed the grocer He shivered and was aware of an aching in his bones The small of his back ached especially His head ached the top of it ached the back of it ached the brains inside of it ached and seemed to be swelling while the ache over his brows was intolerable And beneath the brows planted under his lids was the merciless three dollars eighty five cents He opened his eyes to escape it but the white light of the room seemed to sear the balls and forced him to close his eyes when the three dollars eighty five cents confronted him again Five dollars for five thousand words ten words for a cent that particular thought took up its residence in his brain and he could no more escape it than he could the three dollars eighty five cents under his eyelids A change seemed to come over the latter and he watched curiously till two dollars burned in its stead Ah he thought that was the baker The next sum that appeared was two dollars fifty cents It puzzled him and he pondered it as if life and death hung on the solution He owed somebody two dollars and a half that was certain but who was it To find it was the task set him by an imperious and malignant universe and he wandered through the endless corridors of his mind opening all manner of lumber rooms and chambers stored with odds and ends of memories and knowledge as he vainly sought the answer After several centuries it came to him easily without effort that it was Maria With a great relief he turned his soul to the screen of torment under his lids He had solved the problem now he could rest But no the two dollars fifty cents faded away and in its place burned eight dollars Who was that He must go the dreary round of his mind again and find out How long he was gone on this quest he did not know but after what seemed an enormous lapse of time he was called back to himself by a knock at the door and by Maria s asking if he was sick He replied in a muffled voice he did not recognize saying that he was merely taking a nap He was surprised when he noted the darkness of night in the room He had received the letter at two in the afternoon and he realized that he was sick Then the eight dollars began to smoulder under his lids again and he returned himself to servitude But he grew cunning There was no need for him to wander through his mind He had been a fool He pulled a lever and made his mind revolve about him a monstrous wheel of fortune a merry go round of memory a revolving sphere of wisdom Faster and faster it revolved until its vortex sucked him in and he was flung whirling through black chaos Quite naturally he found himself at a mangle feeding starched cuffs But as he fed he noticed figures printed in the cuffs It was a new way of marking linen he thought until looking closer he saw three dollars eighty five cents on one of the cuffs Then it came to him that it was the grocer s bill and that these were his bills flying around on the drum of the mangle A crafty idea came to him He would throw the bills on the floor and so escape paying them No sooner thought than done and he crumpled the cuffs spitefully as he flung them upon an unusually dirty floor Ever the heap grew and though each bill was duplicated a thousand times he found only one for two dollars and a half which was what he owed Maria That meant that Maria would not press for payment and he resolved generously that it would be the only one he would pay so he began searching through the cast out heap for hers He sought it desperately for ages and was still searching when the manager of the hotel entered the fat Dutchman His face blazed with wrath and he shouted in stentorian tones that echoed down the universe I shall deduct the cost of those cuffs from your wages The pile of cuffs grew into a mountain and Martin knew that he was doomed to toil for a thousand years to pay for them Well there was nothing left to do but kill the manager and burn down the laundry But the big Dutchman frustrated him seizing him by the nape of the neck and dancing him up and down He danced him over the ironing tables the stove and the mangles and out into the wash room and over the wringer and washer Martin was danced until his teeth rattled and his head ached and he marvelled that the Dutchman was so strong And then he found himself before the mangle this time receiving the cuffs an editor of a magazine was feeding from the other side Each cuff was a check and Martin went over them anxiously in a fever of expectation but they were all blanks He stood there and received the blanks for a million years or so never letting one go by for fear it might be filled out At last he found it With trembling fingers he held it to the light It was for five dollars Ha Ha laughed the editor across the mangle Well then I shall kill you Martin said He went out into the wash room to get the axe and found Joe starching manuscripts He tried to make him desist then swung the axe for him But the weapon remained poised in mid air for Martin found himself back in the ironing room in the midst of a snow storm No it was not snow that was falling but checks of large denomination the smallest not less than a thousand dollars He began to collect them and sort them out in packages of a hundred tying each package securely with twine He looked up from his task and saw Joe standing before him juggling flat irons starched shirts and manuscripts Now and again he reached out and added a bundle of checks to the flying miscellany that soared through the roof and out of sight in a tremendous circle Martin struck at him but he seized the axe and added it to the flying circle Then he plucked Martin and added him Martin went up through the roof clutching at manuscripts so that by the time he came down he had a large armful But no sooner down than up again and a second and a third time and countless times he flew around the circle From far off he could hear a childish treble singing Waltz me around again Willie around around around He recovered the axe in the midst of the Milky Way of checks starched shirts and manuscripts and prepared when he came down to kill Joe But he did not come down Instead at two in the morning Maria having heard his groans through the thin partition came into his room to put hot flat irons against his body and damp cloths upon his aching eyes CHAPTER XXVI Martin Eden did not go out to hunt for a job in the morning It was late afternoon before he came out of his delirium and gazed with aching eyes about the room Mary one of the tribe of Silva eight years old keeping watch raised a screech at sight of his returning consciousness Maria hurried into the room from the kitchen She put her work calloused hand upon his hot forehead and felt his pulse You lika da eat she asked He shook his head Eating was farthest from his desire and he wondered that he should ever have been hungry in his life I m sick Maria he said weakly What is it Do you know Grip she answered Two or three days you alla da right Better you no eat now Bimeby plenty can eat to morrow can eat maybe Martin was not used to sickness and when Maria and her little girl left him he essayed to get up and dress By a supreme exertion of will with rearing brain and eyes that ached so that he could not keep them open he managed to get out of bed only to be left stranded by his senses upon the table Half an hour later he managed to regain the bed where he was content to lie with closed eyes and analyze his various pains and weaknesses Maria came in several times to change the cold cloths on his forehead Otherwise she left him in peace too wise to vex him with chatter This moved him to gratitude and he murmured to himself Maria you getta da milka ranch all righta all right Then he remembered his long buried past of yesterday It seemed a life time since he had received that letter from the Transcontinental a life time since it was all over and done with and a new page turned He had shot his bolt and shot it hard and now he was down on his back If he hadn t starved himself he wouldn t have been caught by La Grippe He had been run down and he had not had the strength to throw off the germ of disease which had invaded his system This was what resulted What does it profit a man to write a whole library and lose his own life he demanded aloud This is no place for me No more literature in mine Me for the counting house and ledger the monthly salary and the little home with Ruth Two days later having eaten an egg and two slices of toast and drunk a cup of tea he asked for his mail but found his eyes still hurt too much to permit him to read You read for me Maria he said Never mind the big long letters Throw them under the table Read me the small letters No can was the answer Teresa she go to school she can So Teresa Silva aged nine opened his letters and read them to him He listened absently to a long dun from the type writer people his mind busy with ways and means of finding a job Suddenly he was shocked back to himself We offer you forty dollars for all serial rights in your story Teresa slowly spelled out provided you allow us to make the alterations suggested What magazine is that Martin shouted Here give it to me He could see to read now and he was unaware of the pain of the action It was the White Mouse that was offering him forty dollars and the story was The Whirlpool another of his early horror stories He read the letter through again and again The editor told him plainly that he had not handled the idea properly but that it was the idea they were buying because it was original If they could cut the story down one third they would take it and send him forty dollars on receipt of his answer He called for pen and ink and told the editor he could cut the story down three thirds if he wanted to and to send the forty dollars right along The letter despatched to the letter box by Teresa Martin lay back and thought It wasn t a lie after all The White Mouse paid on acceptance There were three thousand words in The Whirlpool Cut down a third there would be two thousand At forty dollars that would be two cents a word Pay on acceptance and two cents a word the newspapers had told the truth And he had thought the White Mouse a third rater It was evident that he did not know the magazines He had deemed the Transcontinental a first rater and it paid a cent for ten words He had classed the White Mouse as of no account and it paid twenty times as much as the Transcontinental and also had paid on acceptance Well there was one thing certain when he got well he would not go out looking for a job There were more stories in his head as good as The Whirlpool and at forty dollars apiece he could earn far more than in any job or position Just when he thought the battle lost it was won He had proved for his career The way was clear Beginning with the White Mouse he would add magazine after magazine to his growing list of patrons Hack work could be put aside For that matter it had been wasted time for it had not brought him a dollar He would devote himself to work good work and he would pour out the best that was in him He wished Ruth was there to share in his joy and when he went over the letters left lying on his bed he found one from her It was sweetly reproachful wondering what had kept him away for so dreadful a length of time He reread the letter adoringly dwelling over her handwriting loving each stroke of her pen and in the end kissing her signature And when he answered he told her recklessly that he had not been to see her because his best clothes were in pawn He told her that he had been sick but was once more nearly well and that inside ten days or two weeks as soon as a letter could travel to New York City and return he would redeem his clothes and be with her But Ruth did not care to wait ten days or two weeks Besides her lover was sick The next afternoon accompanied by Arthur she arrived in the Morse carriage to the unqualified delight of the Silva tribe and of all the urchins on the street and to the consternation of Maria She boxed the ears of the Silvas who crowded about the visitors on the tiny front porch and in more than usual atrocious English tried to apologize for her appearance Sleeves rolled up from soap flecked arms and a wet gunny sack around her waist told of the task at which she had been caught So flustered was she by two such grand young people asking for her lodger that she forgot to invite them to sit down in the little parlor To enter Martin s room they passed through the kitchen warm and moist and steamy from the big washing in progress Maria in her excitement jammed the bedroom and bedroom closet doors together and for five minutes through the partly open door clouds of steam smelling of soap suds and dirt poured into the sick chamber Ruth succeeded in veering right and left and right again and in running the narrow passage between table and bed to Martin s side but Arthur veered too wide and fetched up with clatter and bang of pots and pans in the corner where Martin did his cooking Arthur did not linger long Ruth occupied the only chair and having done his duty he went outside and stood by the gate the centre of seven marvelling Silvas who watched him as they would have watched a curiosity in a side show All about the carriage were gathered the children from a dozen blocks waiting and eager for some tragic and terrible denouement Carriages were seen on their street only for weddings and funerals Here was neither marriage nor death therefore it was something transcending experience and well worth waiting for Martin had been wild to see Ruth His was essentially a love nature and he possessed more than the average man s need for sympathy He was starving for sympathy which with him meant intelligent understanding and he had yet to learn that Ruth s sympathy was largely sentimental and tactful and that it proceeded from gentleness of nature rather than from understanding of the objects of her sympathy So it was while Martin held her hand and gladly talked that her love for him prompted her to press his hand in return and that her eyes were moist and luminous at sight of his helplessness and of the marks suffering had stamped upon his face But while he told her of his two acceptances of his despair when he received the one from the Transcontinental and of the corresponding delight with which he received the one from the White Mouse she did not follow him She heard the words he uttered and understood their literal import but she was not with him in his despair and his delight She could not get out of herself She was not interested in selling stories to magazines What was important to her was matrimony She was not aware of it however any more than she was aware that her desire that Martin take a position was the instinctive and preparative impulse of motherhood She would have blushed had she been told as much in plain set terms and next she might have grown indignant and asserted that her sole interest lay in the man she loved and her desire for him to make the best of himself So while Martin poured out his heart to her elated with the first success his chosen work in the world had received she paid heed to his bare words only gazing now and again about the room shocked by what she saw For the first time Ruth gazed upon the sordid face of poverty Starving lovers had always seemed romantic to her but she had had no idea how starving lovers lived She had never dreamed it could be like this Ever her gaze shifted from the room to him and back again The steamy smell of dirty clothes which had entered with her from the kitchen was sickening Martin must be soaked with it Ruth concluded if that awful woman washed frequently Such was the contagiousness of degradation When she looked at Martin she seemed to see the smirch left upon him by his surroundings She had never seen him unshaven and the three days growth of beard on his face was repulsive to her Not alone did it give him the same dark and murky aspect of the Silva house inside and out but it seemed to emphasize that animal like strength of his which she detested And here he was being confirmed in his madness by the two acceptances he took such pride in telling her about A little longer and he would have surrendered and gone to work Now he would continue on in this horrible house writing and starving for a few more months What is that smell she asked suddenly Some of Maria s washing smells I imagine was the answer I am growing quite accustomed to them No no not that It is something else A stale sickish smell Martin sampled the air before replying I can t smell anything else except stale tobacco smoke he announced That s it It is terrible Why do you smoke so much Martin I don t know except that I smoke more than usual when I am lonely And then too it s such a long standing habit I learned when I was only a youngster It is not a nice habit you know she reproved It smells to heaven That s the fault of the tobacco I can afford only the cheapest But wait until I get that forty dollar check I ll use a brand that is not offensive even to the angels But that wasn t so bad was it two acceptances in three days That forty five dollars will pay about all my debts For two years work she queried No for less than a week s work Please pass me that book over on the far corner of the table the account book with the gray cover He opened it and began turning over the pages rapidly Yes I was right Four days for The Ring of Bells two days for The Whirlpool That s forty five dollars for a week s work one hundred and eighty dollars a month That beats any salary I can command And besides I m just beginning A thousand dollars a month is not too much to buy for you all I want you to have A salary of five hundred a month would be too small That forty five dollars is just a starter Wait till I get my stride Then watch my smoke Ruth misunderstood his slang and reverted to cigarettes You smoke more than enough as it is and the brand of tobacco will make no difference It is the smoking itself that is not nice no matter what the brand may be You are a chimney a living volcano a perambulating smoke stack and you are a perfect disgrace Martin dear you know you are She leaned toward him entreaty in her eyes and as he looked at her delicate face and into her pure limpid eyes as of old he was struck with his own unworthiness I wish you wouldn t smoke any more she whispered Please for my sake All right I won t he cried I ll do anything you ask dear love anything you know that A great temptation assailed her In an insistent way she had caught glimpses of the large easy going side of his nature and she felt sure if she asked him to cease attempting to write that he would grant her wish In the swift instant that elapsed the words trembled on her lips But she did not utter them She was not quite brave enough she did not quite dare Instead she leaned toward him to meet him and in his arms murmured You know it is really not for my sake Martin but for your own I am sure smoking hurts you and besides it is not good to be a slave to anything to a drug least of all I shall always be your slave he smiled In which case I shall begin issuing my commands She looked at him mischievously though deep down she was already regretting that she had not preferred her largest request I live but to obey your majesty Well then my first commandment is Thou shalt not omit to shave every day Look how you have scratched my cheek And so it ended in caresses and love laughter But she had made one point and she could not expect to make more than one at a time She felt a woman s pride in that she had made him stop smoking Another time she would persuade him to take a position for had he not said he would do anything she asked She left his side to explore the room examining the clothes lines of notes overhead learning the mystery of the tackle used for suspending his wheel under the ceiling and being saddened by the heap of manuscripts under the table which represented to her just so much wasted time The oil stove won her admiration but on investigating the food shelves she found them empty Why you haven t anything to eat you poor dear she said with tender compassion You must be starving I store my food in Maria s safe and in her pantry he lied It keeps better there No danger of my starving Look at that She had come back to his side and she saw him double his arm at the elbow the biceps crawling under his shirt sleeve and swelling into a knot of muscle heavy and hard The sight repelled her Sentimentally she disliked it But her pulse her blood every fibre of her loved it and yearned for it and in the old inexplicable way she leaned toward him not away from him And in the moment that followed when he crushed her in his arms the brain of her concerned with the superficial aspects of life was in revolt while the heart of her the woman of her concerned with life itself exulted triumphantly It was in moments like this that she felt to the uttermost the greatness of her love for Martin for it was almost a swoon of delight to her to feel his strong arms about her holding her tightly hurting her with the grip of their fervor At such moments she found justification for her treason to her standards for her violation of her own high ideals and most of all for her tacit disobedience to her mother and father They did not want her to marry this man It shocked them that she should love him It shocked her too sometimes when she was apart from him a cool and reasoning creature With him she loved him in truth at times a vexed and worried love but love it was a love that was stronger than she This La Grippe is nothing he was saying It hurts a bit and gives one a nasty headache but it doesn t compare with break bone fever Have you had that too she queried absently intent on the heaven sent justification she was finding in his arms And so with absent queries she led him on till suddenly his words startled her He had had the fever in a secret colony of thirty lepers on one of the Hawaiian Islands But why did you go there she demanded Such royal carelessness of body seemed criminal Because I didn t know he answered I never dreamed of lepers When I deserted the schooner and landed on the beach I headed inland for some place of hiding For three days I lived off guavas ohia apples and bananas all of which grew wild in the jungle On the fourth day I found the trail a mere foot trail It led inland and it led up It was the way I wanted to go and it showed signs of recent travel At one place it ran along the crest of a ridge that was no more than a knife edge The trail wasn t three feet wide on the crest and on either side the ridge fell away in precipices hundreds of feet deep One man with plenty of ammunition could have held it against a hundred thousand It was the only way in to the hiding place Three hours after I found the trail I was there in a little mountain valley a pocket in the midst of lava peaks The whole place was terraced for taro patches fruit trees grew there and there were eight or ten grass huts But as soon as I saw the inhabitants I knew what I d struck One sight of them was enough What did you do Ruth demanded breathlessly listening like any Desdemona appalled and fascinated Nothing for me to do Their leader was a kind old fellow pretty far gone but he ruled like a king He had discovered the little valley and founded the settlement all of which was against the law But he had guns plenty of ammunition and those Kanakas trained to the shooting of wild cattle and wild pig were dead shots No there wasn t any running away for Martin Eden He stayed for three months But how did you escape I d have been there yet if it hadn t been for a girl there a half Chinese quarter white and quarter Hawaiian She was a beauty poor thing and well educated Her mother in Honolulu was worth a million or so Well this girl got me away at last Her mother financed the settlement you see so the girl wasn t afraid of being punished for letting me go But she made me swear first never to reveal the hiding place and I never have This is the first time I have even mentioned it The girl had just the first signs of leprosy The fingers of her right hand were slightly twisted and there was a small spot on her arm That was all I guess she is dead now But weren t you frightened And weren t you glad to get away without catching that dreadful disease Well he confessed I was a bit shivery at first but I got used to it I used to feel sorry for that poor girl though That made me forget to be afraid She was such a beauty in spirit as well as in appearance and she was only slightly touched yet she was doomed to lie there living the life of a primitive savage and rotting slowly away Leprosy is far more terrible than you can imagine it Poor thing Ruth murmured softly It s a wonder she let you get away How do you mean Martin asked unwittingly Because she must have loved you Ruth said still softly Candidly now didn t she Martin s sunburn had been bleached by his work in the laundry and by the indoor life he was living while the hunger and the sickness had made his face even pale and across this pallor flowed the slow wave of a blush He was opening his mouth to speak but Ruth shut him off Never mind don t answer it s not necessary she laughed But it seemed to him there was something metallic in her laughter and that the light in her eyes was cold On the spur of the moment it reminded him of a gale he had once experienced in the North Pacific And for the moment the apparition of the gale rose before his eyes a gale at night with a clear sky and under a full moon the huge seas glinting coldly in the moonlight Next he saw the girl in the leper refuge and remembered it was for love of him that she had let him go She was noble he said simply She gave me life That was all of the incident but he heard Ruth muffle a dry sob in her throat and noticed that she turned her face away to gaze out of the window When she turned it back to him it was composed and there was no hint of the gale in her eyes I m such a silly she said plaintively But I can t help it I do so love you Martin I do I do I shall grow more catholic in time but at present I can t help being jealous of those ghosts of the past and you know your past is full of ghosts It must be she silenced his protest It could not be otherwise And there s poor Arthur motioning me to come He s tired waiting And now good by dear There s some kind of a mixture put up by the druggists that helps men to stop the use of tobacco she called back from the door and I am going to send you some The door closed but opened again I do I do she whispered to him and this time she was really gone Maria with worshipful eyes that none the less were keen to note the texture of Ruth s garments and the cut of them a cut unknown that produced an effect mysteriously beautiful saw her to the carriage The crowd of disappointed urchins stared till the carriage disappeared from view then transferred their stare to Maria who had abruptly become the most important person on the street But it was one of her progeny who blasted Maria s reputation by announcing that the grand visitors had been for her lodger After that Maria dropped back into her old obscurity and Martin began to notice the respectful manner in which he was regarded by the small fry of the neighborhood As for Maria Martin rose in her estimation a full hundred per cent and had the Portuguese grocer witnessed that afternoon carriage call he would have allowed Martin an additional three dollars and eighty five cents worth of credit CHAPTER XXVII The sun of Martin s good fortune rose The day after Ruth s visit he received a check for three dollars from a New York scandal weekly in payment for three of his triolets Two days later a newspaper published in Chicago accepted his Treasure Hunters promising to pay ten dollars for it on publication The price was small but it was the first article he had written his very first attempt to express his thought on the printed page To cap everything the adventure serial for boys his second attempt was accepted before the end of the week by a juvenile monthly calling itself Youth and Age It was true the serial was twenty one thousand words and they offered to pay him sixteen dollars on publication which was something like seventy five cents a thousand words but it was equally true that it was the second thing he had attempted to write and that he was himself thoroughly aware of its clumsy worthlessness But even his earliest efforts were not marked with the clumsiness of mediocrity What characterized them was the clumsiness of too great strength the clumsiness which the tyro betrays when he crushes butterflies with battering rams and hammers out vignettes with a war club So it was that Martin was glad to sell his early efforts for songs He knew them for what they were and it had not taken him long to acquire this knowledge What he pinned his faith to was his later work He had striven to be something more than a mere writer of magazine fiction He had sought to equip himself with the tools of artistry On the other hand he had not sacrificed strength His conscious aim had been to increase his strength by avoiding excess of strength Nor had he departed from his love of reality His work was realism though he had endeavored to fuse with it the fancies and beauties of imagination What he sought was an impassioned realism shot through with human aspiration and faith What he wanted was life as it was with all its spirit groping and soul reaching left in He had discovered in the course of his reading two schools of fiction One treated of man as a god ignoring his earthly origin the other treated of man as a clod ignoring his heaven sent dreams and divine possibilities Both the god and the clod schools erred in Martin s estimation and erred through too great singleness of sight and purpose There was a compromise that approximated the truth though it flattered not the school of god while it challenged the brute savageness of the school of clod It was his story Adventure which had dragged with Ruth that Martin believed had achieved his ideal of the true in fiction and it was in an essay God and Clod that he had expressed his views on the whole general subject But Adventure and all that he deemed his best work still went begging among the editors His early work counted for nothing in his eyes except for the money it brought and his horror stories two of which he had sold he did not consider high work nor his best work To him they were frankly imaginative and fantastic though invested with all the glamour of the real wherein lay their power This investiture of the grotesque and impossible with reality he looked upon as a trick a skilful trick at best Great literature could not reside in such a field Their artistry was high but he denied the worthwhileness of artistry when divorced from humanness The trick had been to fling over the face of his artistry a mask of humanness and this he had done in the half dozen or so stories of the horror brand he had written before he emerged upon the high peaks of Adventure Joy The Pot and The Wine of Life The three dollars he received for the triolets he used to eke out a precarious existence against the arrival of the White Mouse check He cashed the first check with the suspicious Portuguese grocer paying a dollar on account and dividing the remaining two dollars between the baker and the fruit store Martin was not yet rich enough to afford meat and he was on slim allowance when the White Mouse check arrived He was divided on the cashing of it He had never been in a bank in his life much less been in one on business and he had a naive and childlike desire to walk into one of the big banks down in Oakland and fling down his indorsed check for forty dollars On the other hand practical common sense ruled that he should cash it with his grocer and thereby make an impression that would later result in an increase of credit Reluctantly Martin yielded to the claims of the grocer paying his bill with him in full and receiving in change a pocketful of jingling coin Also he paid the other tradesmen in full redeemed his suit and his bicycle paid one month s rent on the type writer and paid Maria the overdue month for his room and a month in advance This left him in his pocket for emergencies a balance of nearly three dollars In itself this small sum seemed a fortune Immediately on recovering his clothes he had gone to see Ruth and on the way he could not refrain from jingling the little handful of silver in his pocket He had been so long without money that like a rescued starving man who cannot let the unconsumed food out of his sight Martin could not keep his hand off the silver He was not mean nor avaricious but the money meant more than so many dollars and cents It stood for success and the eagles stamped upon the coins were to him so many winged victories It came to him insensibly that it was a very good world It certainly appeared more beautiful to him For weeks it had been a very dull and sombre world but now with nearly all debts paid three dollars jingling in his pocket and in his mind the consciousness of success the sun shone bright and warm and even a rain squall that soaked unprepared pedestrians seemed a merry happening to him When he starved his thoughts had dwelt often upon the thousands he knew were starving the world over but now that he was feasted full the fact of the thousands starving was no longer pregnant in his brain He forgot about them and being in love remembered the countless lovers in the world Without deliberately thinking about it motifs for love lyrics began to agitate his brain Swept away by the creative impulse he got off the electric car without vexation two blocks beyond his crossing He found a number of persons in the Morse home Ruth s two girl cousins were visiting her from San Rafael and missus Morse under pretext of entertaining them was pursuing her plan of surrounding Ruth with young people The campaign had begun during Martin s enforced absence and was already in full swing She was making a point of having at the house men who were doing things Thus in addition to the cousins Dorothy and Florence Martin encountered two university professors one of Latin the other of English a young army officer just back from the Philippines one time school mate of Ruth s a young fellow named Melville private secretary to Joseph Perkins head of the San Francisco Trust Company and finally of the men a live bank cashier Charles Hapgood a youngish man of thirty five graduate of Stanford University member of the Nile Club and the Unity Club and a conservative speaker for the Republican Party during campaigns in short a rising young man in every way Among the women was one who painted portraits another who was a professional musician and still another who possessed the degree of Doctor of Sociology and who was locally famous for her social settlement work in the slums of San Francisco But the women did not count for much in missus Morse s plan At the best they were necessary accessories The men who did things must be drawn to the house somehow Don t get excited when you talk Ruth admonished Martin before the ordeal of introduction began He bore himself a bit stiffly at first oppressed by a sense of his own awkwardness especially of his shoulders which were up to their old trick of threatening destruction to furniture and ornaments Also he was rendered self conscious by the company He had never before been in contact with such exalted beings nor with so many of them Melville the bank cashier fascinated him and he resolved to investigate him at the first opportunity For underneath Martin s awe lurked his assertive ego and he felt the urge to measure himself with these men and women and to find out what they had learned from the books and life which he had not learned Ruth s eyes roved to him frequently to see how he was getting on and she was surprised and gladdened by the ease with which he got acquainted with her cousins He certainly did not grow excited while being seated removed from him the worry of his shoulders Ruth knew them for clever girls superficially brilliant and she could scarcely understand their praise of Martin later that night at going to bed But he on the other hand a wit in his own class a gay quizzer and laughter maker at dances and Sunday picnics had found the making of fun and the breaking of good natured lances simple enough in this environment And on this evening success stood at his back patting him on the shoulder and telling him that he was making good so that he could afford to laugh and make laughter and remain unabashed Later Ruth s anxiety found justification Martin and Professor Caldwell had got together in a conspicuous corner and though Martin no longer wove the air with his hands to Ruth s critical eye he permitted his own eyes to flash and glitter too frequently talked too rapidly and warmly grew too intense and allowed his aroused blood to redden his cheeks too much He lacked decorum and control and was in decided contrast to the young professor of English with whom he talked But Martin was not concerned with appearances He had been swift to note the other s trained mind and to appreciate his command of knowledge Furthermore Professor Caldwell did not realize Martin s concept of the average English professor Martin wanted him to talk shop and though he seemed averse at first succeeded in making him do it For Martin did not see why a man should not talk shop It s absurd and unfair he had told Ruth weeks before this objection to talking shop For what reason under the sun do men and women come together if not for the exchange of the best that is in them And the best that is in them is what they are interested in the thing by which they make their living the thing they ve specialized on and sat up days and nights over and even dreamed about Imagine mister Butler living up to social etiquette and enunciating his views on Paul Verlaine or the German drama or the novels of D Annunzio We d be bored to death I for one if I must listen to mister Butler prefer to hear him talk about his law It s the best that is in him and life is so short that I want the best of every man and woman I meet But Ruth had objected there are the topics of general interest to all There you mistake he had rushed on All persons in society all cliques in society or rather nearly all persons and cliques ape their betters Now who are the best betters The idlers the wealthy idlers They do not know as a rule the things known by the persons who are doing something in the world To listen to conversation about such things would mean to be bored wherefore the idlers decree that such things are shop and must not be talked about Likewise they decree the things that are not shop and which may be talked about and those things are the latest operas latest novels cards billiards cocktails automobiles horse shows trout fishing tuna fishing big game shooting yacht sailing and so forth and mark you these are the things the idlers know In all truth they constitute the shop talk of the idlers And the funniest part of it is that many of the clever people and all the would be clever people allow the idlers so to impose upon them As for me I want the best a man s got in him call it shop vulgarity or anything you please And Ruth had not understood This attack of his on the established had seemed to her just so much wilfulness of opinion So Martin contaminated Professor Caldwell with his own earnestness challenging him to speak his mind As Ruth paused beside them she heard Martin saying You surely don t pronounce such heresies in the University of California Professor Caldwell shrugged his shoulders The honest taxpayer and the politician you know Sacramento gives us our appropriations and therefore we kowtow to Sacramento and to the Board of Regents and to the party press or to the press of both parties Yes that s clear but how about you Martin urged You must be a fish out of the water Few like me I imagine in the university pond Sometimes I am fairly sure I am out of water and that I should belong in Paris in Grub Street in a hermit s cave or in some sadly wild Bohemian crowd drinking claret dago red they call it in San Francisco dining in cheap restaurants in the Latin Quarter and expressing vociferously radical views upon all creation Really I am frequently almost sure that I was cut out to be a radical But then there are so many questions on which I am not sure I grow timid when I am face to face with my human frailty which ever prevents me from grasping all the factors in any problem human vital problems you know And as he talked on Martin became aware that to his own lips had come the Song of the Trade Wind I am strongest at noon But under the moon I stiffen the bunt of the sail He was almost humming the words and it dawned upon him that the other reminded him of the trade wind of the Northeast Trade steady and cool and strong He was equable he was to be relied upon and withal there was a certain bafflement about him Martin had the feeling that he never spoke his full mind just as he had often had the feeling that the trades never blew their strongest but always held reserves of strength that were never used Martin s trick of visioning was active as ever His brain was a most accessible storehouse of remembered fact and fancy and its contents seemed ever ordered and spread for his inspection Whatever occurred in the instant present Martin s mind immediately presented associated antithesis or similitude which ordinarily expressed themselves to him in vision It was sheerly automatic and his visioning was an unfailing accompaniment to the living present Just as Ruth s face in a momentary jealousy had called before his eyes a forgotten moonlight gale and as Professor Caldwell made him see again the Northeast Trade herding the white billows across the purple sea so from moment to moment not disconcerting but rather identifying and classifying new memory visions rose before him or spread under his eyelids or were thrown upon the screen of his consciousness These visions came out of the actions and sensations of the past out of things and events and books of yesterday and last week a countless host of apparitions that waking or sleeping forever thronged his mind So it was as he listened to Professor Caldwell s easy flow of speech the conversation of a clever cultured man that Martin kept seeing himself down all his past He saw himself when he had been quite the hoodlum wearing a stiff rim Stetson hat and a square cut double breasted coat with a certain swagger to the shoulders and possessing the ideal of being as tough as the police permitted He did not disguise it to himself nor attempt to palliate it At one time in his life he had been just a common hoodlum the leader of a gang that worried the police and terrorized honest working class householders But his ideals had changed He glanced about him at the well bred well dressed men and women and breathed into his lungs the atmosphere of culture and refinement and at the same moment the ghost of his early youth in stiff rim and square cut with swagger and toughness stalked across the room This figure of the corner hoodlum he saw merge into himself sitting and talking with an actual university professor For after all he had never found his permanent abiding place He had fitted in wherever he found himself been a favorite always and everywhere by virtue of holding his own at work and at play and by his willingness and ability to fight for his rights and command respect But he had never taken root He had fitted in sufficiently to satisfy his fellows but not to satisfy himself He had been perturbed always by a feeling of unrest had heard always the call of something from beyond and had wandered on through life seeking it until he found books and art and love And here he was in the midst of all this the only one of all the comrades he had adventured with who could have made themselves eligible for the inside of the Morse home But such thoughts and visions did not prevent him from following Professor Caldwell closely And as he followed comprehendingly and critically he noted the unbroken field of the other s knowledge As for himself from moment to moment the conversation showed him gaps and open stretches whole subjects with which he was unfamiliar Nevertheless thanks to his Spencer he saw that he possessed the outlines of the field of knowledge It was a matter only of time when he would fill in the outline Then watch out he thought ware shoal everybody He felt like sitting at the feet of the professor worshipful and absorbent but as he listened he began to discern a weakness in the other s judgments a weakness so stray and elusive that he might not have caught it had it not been ever present And when he did catch it he leapt to equality at once Ruth came up to them a second time just as Martin began to speak I ll tell you where you are wrong or rather what weakens your judgments he said You lack biology It has no place in your scheme of things Oh I mean the real interpretative biology from the ground up from the laboratory and the test tube and the vitalized inorganic right on up to the widest aesthetic and sociological generalizations Ruth was appalled She had sat two lecture courses under Professor Caldwell and looked up to him as the living repository of all knowledge I scarcely follow you he said dubiously Martin was not so sure but what he had followed him Then I ll try to explain he said I remember reading in Egyptian history something to the effect that understanding could not be had of Egyptian art without first studying the land question Quite right the professor nodded And it seems to me Martin continued that knowledge of the land question in turn of all questions for that matter cannot be had without previous knowledge of the stuff and the constitution of life How can we understand laws and institutions religions and customs without understanding not merely the nature of the creatures that made them but the nature of the stuff out of which the creatures are made Is literature less human than the architecture and sculpture of Egypt Is there one thing in the known universe that is not subject to the law of evolution Oh I know there is an elaborate evolution of the various arts laid down but it seems to me to be too mechanical The human himself is left out The evolution of the tool of the harp of music and song and dance are all beautifully elaborated but how about the evolution of the human himself the development of the basic and intrinsic parts that were in him before he made his first tool or gibbered his first chant It is that which you do not consider and which I call biology It is biology in its largest aspects I know I express myself incoherently but I ve tried to hammer out the idea It came to me as you were talking so I was not primed and ready to deliver it You spoke yourself of the human frailty that prevented one from taking all the factors into consideration And you in turn or so it seems to me leave out the biological factor the very stuff out of which has been spun the fabric of all the arts the warp and the woof of all human actions and achievements To Ruth s amazement Martin was not immediately crushed and that the professor replied in the way he did struck her as forbearance for Martin s youth Professor Caldwell sat for a full minute silent and fingering his watch chain Do you know he said at last I ve had that same criticism passed on me once before by a very great man a scientist and evolutionist Joseph Le Conte But he is dead and I thought to remain undetected and now you come along and expose me Seriously though and this is confession I think there is something in your contention a great deal in fact I am too classical not enough up to date in the interpretative branches of science and I can only plead the disadvantages of my education and a temperamental slothfulness that prevents me from doing the work I wonder if you ll believe that I ve never been inside a physics or chemistry laboratory It is true nevertheless Le Conte was right and so are you mister Eden at least to an extent how much I do not know Ruth drew Martin away with her on a pretext when she had got him aside whispering You shouldn t have monopolized Professor Caldwell that way There may be others who want to talk with him My mistake Martin admitted contritely But I d got him stirred up and he was so interesting that I did not think Do you know he is the brightest the most intellectual man I have ever talked with And I ll tell you something else I once thought that everybody who went to universities or who sat in the high places in society was just as brilliant and intelligent as he He s an exception she answered I should say so Whom do you want me to talk to now Oh say bring me up against that cashier fellow Martin talked for fifteen minutes with him nor could Ruth have wished better behavior on her lover s part Not once did his eyes flash nor his cheeks flush while the calmness and poise with which he talked surprised her But in Martin s estimation the whole tribe of bank cashiers fell a few hundred per cent and for the rest of the evening he labored under the impression that bank cashiers and talkers of platitudes were synonymous phrases The army officer he found good natured and simple a healthy wholesome young fellow content to occupy the place in life into which birth and luck had flung him On learning that he had completed two years in the university Martin was puzzled to know where he had stored it away Nevertheless Martin liked him better than the platitudinous bank cashier I really don t object to platitudes he told Ruth later but what worries me into nervousness is the pompous smugly complacent superior certitude with which they are uttered and the time taken to do it Why I could give that man the whole history of the Reformation in the time he took to tell me that the Union Labor Party had fused with the Democrats Do you know he skins his words as a professional poker player skins the cards that are dealt out to him Some day I ll show you what I mean I m sorry you don t like him was her reply He s a favorite of mister Butler s mister Butler says he is safe and honest calls him the Rock Peter and says that upon him any banking institution can well be built I don t doubt it from the little I saw of him and the less I heard from him but I don t think so much of banks as I did You don t mind my speaking my mind this way dear No no it is most interesting Yes Martin went on heartily I m no more than a barbarian getting my first impressions of civilization Such impressions must be entertainingly novel to the civilized person What did you think of my cousins Ruth queried I liked them better than the other women There s plenty of fun in them along with paucity of pretence Then you did like the other women He shook his head That social settlement woman is no more than a sociological poll parrot I swear if you winnowed her out between the stars like Tomlinson there would be found in her not one original thought As for the portrait painter she was a positive bore She d make a good wife for the cashier And the musician woman I don t care how nimble her fingers are how perfect her technique how wonderful her expression the fact is she knows nothing about music She plays beautifully Ruth protested Yes she s undoubtedly gymnastic in the externals of music but the intrinsic spirit of music is unguessed by her I asked her what music meant to her you know I m always curious to know that particular thing and she did not know what it meant to her except that she adored it that it was the greatest of the arts and that it meant more than life to her You were making them talk shop Ruth charged him I confess it And if they were failures on shop imagine my sufferings if they had discoursed on other subjects Why I used to think that up here where all the advantages of culture were enjoyed He paused for a moment and watched the youthful shade of himself in stiff rim and square cut enter the door and swagger across the room As I was saying up here I thought all men and women were brilliant and radiant But now from what little I ve seen of them they strike me as a pack of ninnies most of them and ninety percent of the remainder as bores Now there s Professor Caldwell he s different He s a man every inch of him and every atom of his gray matter Ruth s face brightened Tell me about him she urged Not what is large and brilliant I know those qualities but whatever you feel is adverse I am most curious to know Perhaps I ll get myself in a pickle Martin debated humorously for a moment Suppose you tell me first Or maybe you find in him nothing less than the best I attended two lecture courses under him and I have known him for two years that is why I am anxious for your first impression Bad impression you mean Well here goes He is all the fine things you think about him I guess At least he is the finest specimen of intellectual man I have met but he is a man with a secret shame Oh no no he hastened to cry Nothing paltry nor vulgar What I mean is that he strikes me as a man who has gone to the bottom of things and is so afraid of what he saw that he makes believe to himself that he never saw it Perhaps that s not the clearest way to express it Here s another way A man who has found the path to the hidden temple but has not followed it who has perhaps caught glimpses of the temple and striven afterward to convince himself that it was only a mirage of foliage Yet another way A man who could have done things but who placed no value on the doing and who all the time in his innermost heart is regretting that he has not done them who has secretly laughed at the rewards for doing and yet still more secretly has yearned for the rewards and for the joy of doing I don t read him that way she said And for that matter I don t see just what you mean It is only a vague feeling on my part Martin temporized I have no reason for it It is only a feeling and most likely it is wrong You certainly should know him better than I From the evening at Ruth s Martin brought away with him strange confusions and conflicting feelings He was disappointed in his goal in the persons he had climbed to be with On the other hand he was encouraged with his success The climb had been easier than he expected He was superior to the climb and he did not with false modesty hide it from himself he was superior to the beings among whom he had climbed with the exception of course of Professor Caldwell About life and the books he knew more than they and he wondered into what nooks and crannies they had cast aside their educations He did not know that he was himself possessed of unusual brain vigor nor did he know that the persons who were given to probing the depths and to thinking ultimate thoughts were not to be found in the drawing rooms of the world s Morses nor did he dream that such persons were as lonely eagles sailing solitary in the azure sky far above the earth and its swarming freight of gregarious life CHAPTER XXVIII But success had lost Martin s address and her messengers no longer came to his door For twenty five days working Sundays and holidays he toiled on The Shame of the Sun a long essay of some thirty thousand words It was a deliberate attack on the mysticism of the Maeterlinck school an attack from the citadel of positive science upon the wonder dreamers but an attack nevertheless that retained much of beauty and wonder of the sort compatible with ascertained fact It was a little later that he followed up the attack with two short essays The Wonder Dreamers and The Yardstick of the Ego And on essays long and short he began to pay the travelling expenses from magazine to magazine During the twenty five days spent on The Shame of the Sun he sold hack work to the extent of six dollars and fifty cents A joke had brought in fifty cents and a second one sold to a high grade comic weekly had fetched a dollar Then two humorous poems had earned two dollars and three dollars respectively As a result having exhausted his credit with the tradesmen though he had increased his credit with the grocer to five dollars his wheel and suit of clothes went back to the pawnbroker The type writer people were again clamoring for money insistently pointing out that according to the agreement rent was to be paid strictly in advance Encouraged by his several small sales Martin went back to hack work Perhaps there was a living in it after all Stored away under his table were the twenty storiettes which had been rejected by the newspaper short story syndicate He read them over in order to find out how not to write newspaper storiettes and so doing reasoned out the perfect formula He found that the newspaper storiette should never be tragic should never end unhappily and should never contain beauty of language subtlety of thought nor real delicacy of sentiment Sentiment it must contain plenty of it pure and noble of the sort that in his own early youth had brought his applause from nigger heaven the For God my country and the Czar and I may be poor but I am honest brand of sentiment Having learned such precautions Martin consulted The Duchess for tone and proceeded to mix according to formula The formula consists of three parts one a pair of lovers are jarred apart two by some deed or event they are reunited three marriage bells The third part was an unvarying quantity but the first and second parts could be varied an infinite number of times Thus the pair of lovers could be jarred apart by misunderstood motives by accident of fate by jealous rivals by irate parents by crafty guardians by scheming relatives and so forth and so forth they could be reunited by a brave deed of the man lover by a similar deed of the woman lover by change of heart in one lover or the other by forced confession of crafty guardian scheming relative or jealous rival by voluntary confession of same by discovery of some unguessed secret by lover storming girl s heart by lover making long and noble self sacrifice and so on endlessly It was very fetching to make the girl propose in the course of being reunited and Martin discovered bit by bit other decidedly piquant and fetching ruses But marriage bells at the end was the one thing he could take no liberties with though the heavens rolled up as a scroll and the stars fell the wedding bells must go on ringing just the same In quantity the formula prescribed twelve hundred words minimum dose fifteen hundred words maximum dose Before he got very far along in the art of the storiette Martin worked out half a dozen stock forms which he always consulted when constructing storiettes These forms were like the cunning tables used by mathematicians which may be entered from top bottom right and left which entrances consist of scores of lines and dozens of columns and from which may be drawn without reasoning or thinking thousands of different conclusions all unchallengably precise and true Thus in the course of half an hour with his forms Martin could frame up a dozen or so storiettes which he put aside and filled in at his convenience He found that he could fill one in after a day of serious work in the hour before going to bed As he later confessed to Ruth he could almost do it in his sleep The real work was in constructing the frames and that was merely mechanical He had no doubt whatever of the efficacy of his formula and for once he knew the editorial mind when he said positively to himself that the first two he sent off would bring checks And checks they brought for four dollars each at the end of twelve days In the meantime he was making fresh and alarming discoveries concerning the magazines Though the Transcontinental had published The Ring of Bells no check was forthcoming Martin needed it and he wrote for it An evasive answer and a request for more of his work was all he received He had gone hungry two days waiting for the reply and it was then that he put his wheel back in pawn He wrote regularly twice a week to the Transcontinental for his five dollars though it was only semi occasionally that he elicited a reply He did not know that the Transcontinental had been staggering along precariously for years that it was a fourth rater or tenth rater without standing with a crazy circulation that partly rested on petty bullying and partly on patriotic appealing and with advertisements that were scarcely more than charitable donations Nor did he know that the Transcontinental was the sole livelihood of the editor and the business manager and that they could wring their livelihood out of it only by moving to escape paying rent and by never paying any bill they could evade Nor could he have guessed that the particular five dollars that belonged to him had been appropriated by the business manager for the painting of his house in Alameda which painting he performed himself on week day afternoons because he could not afford to pay union wages and because the first scab he had employed had had a ladder jerked out from under him and been sent to the hospital with a broken collar bone The ten dollars for which Martin had sold Treasure Hunters to the Chicago newspaper did not come to hand The article had been published as he had ascertained at the file in the Central Reading room but no word could he get from the editor His letters were ignored To satisfy himself that they had been received he registered several of them It was nothing less than robbery he concluded a cold blooded steal while he starved he was pilfered of his merchandise of his goods the sale of which was the sole way of getting bread to eat Youth and Age was a weekly and it had published two thirds of his twenty one thousand word serial when it went out of business With it went all hopes of getting his sixteen dollars To cap the situation The Pot which he looked upon as one of the best things he had written was lost to him In despair casting about frantically among the magazines he had sent it to The Billow a society weekly in San Francisco His chief reason for submitting it to that publication was that having only to travel across the bay from Oakland a quick decision could be reached Two weeks later he was overjoyed to see in the latest number on the news stand his story printed in full illustrated and in the place of honor He went home with leaping pulse wondering how much they would pay him for one of the best things he had done Also the celerity with which it had been accepted and published was a pleasant thought to him That the editor had not informed him of the acceptance made the surprise more complete After waiting a week two weeks and half a week longer desperation conquered diffidence and he wrote to the editor of The Billow suggesting that possibly through some negligence of the business manager his little account had been overlooked Even if it isn t more than five dollars Martin thought to himself it will buy enough beans and pea soup to enable me to write half a dozen like it and possibly as good Back came a cool letter from the editor that at least elicited Martin s admiration We thank you it ran for your excellent contribution All of us in the office enjoyed it immensely and as you see it was given the place of honor and immediate publication We earnestly hope that you liked the illustrations On rereading your letter it seems to us that you are laboring under the misapprehension that we pay for unsolicited manuscripts This is not our custom and of course yours was unsolicited We assumed naturally when we received your story that you understood the situation We can only deeply regret this unfortunate misunderstanding and assure you of our unfailing regard Again thanking you for your kind contribution and hoping to receive more from you in the near future we remain et cetera There was also a postscript to the effect that though The Billow carried no free list it took great pleasure in sending him a complimentary subscription for the ensuing year After that experience Martin typed at the top of the first sheet of all his manuscripts Submitted at your usual rate Some day he consoled himself they will be submitted at my usual rate He discovered in himself at this period a passion for perfection under the sway of which he rewrote and polished The Jostling Street The Wine of Life Joy the Sea Lyrics and others of his earlier work As of old nineteen hours of labor a day was all too little to suit him He wrote prodigiously and he read prodigiously forgetting in his toil the pangs caused by giving up his tobacco Ruth s promised cure for the habit flamboyantly labelled he stowed away in the most inaccessible corner of his bureau Especially during his stretches of famine he suffered from lack of the weed but no matter how often he mastered the craving it remained with him as strong as ever He regarded it as the biggest thing he had ever achieved Ruth s point of view was that he was doing no more than was right She brought him the anti tobacco remedy purchased out of her glove money and in a few days forgot all about it His machine made storiettes though he hated them and derided them were successful By means of them he redeemed all his pledges paid most of his bills and bought a new set of tires for his wheel The storiettes at least kept the pot a boiling and gave him time for ambitious work while the one thing that upheld him was the forty dollars he had received from The White Mouse He anchored his faith to that and was confident that the really first class magazines would pay an unknown writer at least an equal rate if not a better one But the thing was how to get into the first class magazines His best stories essays and poems went begging among them and yet each month he read reams of dull prosy inartistic stuff between all their various covers If only one editor he sometimes thought would descend from his high seat of pride to write me one cheering line No matter if my work is unusual no matter if it is unfit for prudential reasons for their pages surely there must be some sparks in it somewhere a few to warm them to some sort of appreciation And thereupon he would get out one or another of his manuscripts such as Adventure and read it over and over in a vain attempt to vindicate the editorial silence As the sweet California spring came on his period of plenty came to an end For several weeks he had been worried by a strange silence on the part of the newspaper storiette syndicate Then one day came back to him through the mail ten of his immaculate machine made storiettes They were accompanied by a brief letter to the effect that the syndicate was overstocked and that some months would elapse before it would be in the market again for manuscripts Martin had even been extravagant on the strength of those ten storiettes Toward the last the syndicate had been paying him five dollars each for them and accepting every one he sent So he had looked upon the ten as good as sold and he had lived accordingly on a basis of fifty dollars in the bank So it was that he entered abruptly upon a lean period wherein he continued selling his earlier efforts to publications that would not pay and submitting his later work to magazines that would not buy Also he resumed his trips to the pawn broker down in Oakland A few jokes and snatches of humorous verse sold to the New York weeklies made existence barely possible for him It was at this time that he wrote letters of inquiry to the several great monthly and quarterly reviews and learned in reply that they rarely considered unsolicited articles and that most of their contents were written upon order by well known specialists who were authorities in their various fields CHAPTER XXIX It was a hard summer for Martin Manuscript readers and editors were away on vacation and publications that ordinarily returned a decision in three weeks now retained his manuscript for three months or more The consolation he drew from it was that a saving in postage was effected by the deadlock Only the robber publications seemed to remain actively in business and to them Martin disposed of all his early efforts such as Pearl diving The Sea as a Career Turtle catching and The Northeast Trades For these manuscripts he never received a penny It is true after six months correspondence he effected a compromise whereby he received a safety razor for Turtle catching and that The Acropolis having agreed to give him five dollars cash and five yearly subscriptions for The Northeast Trades fulfilled the second part of the agreement For a sonnet on Stevenson he managed to wring two dollars out of a Boston editor who was running a magazine with a Matthew Arnold taste and a penny dreadful purse The Peri and the Pearl a clever skit of a poem of two hundred lines just finished white hot from his brain won the heart of the editor of a San Francisco magazine published in the interest of a great railroad When the editor wrote offering him payment in transportation Martin wrote back to inquire if the transportation was transferable It was not and so being prevented from peddling it he asked for the return of the poem Back it came with the editor s regrets and Martin sent it to San Francisco again this time to The Hornet a pretentious monthly that had been fanned into a constellation of the first magnitude by the brilliant journalist who founded it But The Hornet s light had begun to dim long before Martin was born The editor promised Martin fifteen dollars for the poem but when it was published seemed to forget about it Several of his letters being ignored Martin indicted an angry one which drew a reply It was written by a new editor who coolly informed Martin that he declined to be held responsible for the old editor s mistakes and that he did not think much of The Peri and the Pearl anyway But The Globe a Chicago magazine gave Martin the most cruel treatment of all He had refrained from offering his Sea Lyrics for publication until driven to it by starvation After having been rejected by a dozen magazines they had come to rest in The Globe office There were thirty poems in the collection and he was to receive a dollar apiece for them The first month four were published and he promptly received a cheek for four dollars but when he looked over the magazine he was appalled at the slaughter In some cases the titles had been altered Finis for instance being changed to The Finish and The Song of the Outer Reef to The Song of the Coral Reef In one case an absolutely different title a misappropriate title was substituted In place of his own Medusa Lights the editor had printed The Backward Track But the slaughter in the body of the poems was terrifying Martin groaned and sweated and thrust his hands through his hair Phrases lines and stanzas were cut out interchanged or juggled about in the most incomprehensible manner Sometimes lines and stanzas not his own were substituted for his He could not believe that a sane editor could be guilty of such maltreatment and his favorite hypothesis was that his poems must have been doctored by the office boy or the stenographer Martin wrote immediately begging the editor to cease publishing the lyrics and to return them to him He wrote again and again begging entreating threatening but his letters were ignored Month by month the slaughter went on till the thirty poems were published and month by month he received a check for those which had appeared in the current number Despite these various misadventures the memory of the White Mouse forty dollar check sustained him though he was driven more and more to hack work He discovered a bread and butter field in the agricultural weeklies and trade journals though among the religious weeklies he found he could easily starve At his lowest ebb when his black suit was in pawn he made a ten strike or so it seemed to him in a prize contest arranged by the County Committee of the Republican Party There were three branches of the contest and he entered them all laughing at himself bitterly the while in that he was driven to such straits to live His poem won the first prize of ten dollars his campaign song the second prize of five dollars his essay on the principles of the Republican Party the first prize of twenty five dollars Which was very gratifying to him until he tried to collect Something had gone wrong in the County Committee and though a rich banker and a state senator were members of it the money was not forthcoming While this affair was hanging fire he proved that he understood the principles of the Democratic Party by winning the first prize for his essay in a similar contest And moreover he received the money twenty five dollars But the forty dollars won in the first contest he never received Driven to shifts in order to see Ruth and deciding that the long walk from north Oakland to her house and back again consumed too much time he kept his black suit in pawn in place of his bicycle The latter gave him exercise saved him hours of time for work and enabled him to see Ruth just the same A pair of knee duck trousers and an old sweater made him a presentable wheel costume so that he could go with Ruth on afternoon rides Besides he no longer had opportunity to see much of her in her own home where missus Morse was thoroughly prosecuting her campaign of entertainment The exalted beings he met there and to whom he had looked up but a short time before now bored him They were no longer exalted He was nervous and irritable what of his hard times disappointments and close application to work and the conversation of such people was maddening He was not unduly egotistic He measured the narrowness of their minds by the minds of the thinkers in the books he read At Ruth s home he never met a large mind with the exception of Professor Caldwell and Caldwell he had met there only once As for the rest they were numskulls ninnies superficial dogmatic and ignorant It was their ignorance that astounded him What was the matter with them What had they done with their educations They had had access to the same books he had How did it happen that they had drawn nothing from them He knew that the great minds the deep and rational thinkers existed He had his proofs from the books the books that had educated him beyond the Morse standard And he knew that higher intellects than those of the Morse circle were to be found in the world He read English society novels wherein he caught glimpses of men and women talking politics and philosophy And he read of salons in great cities even in the United States where art and intellect congregated Foolishly in the past he had conceived that all well groomed persons above the working class were persons with power of intellect and vigor of beauty Culture and collars had gone together to him and he had been deceived into believing that college educations and mastery were the same things Well he would fight his way on and up higher And he would take Ruth with him Her he dearly loved and he was confident that she would shine anywhere As it was clear to him that he had been handicapped by his early environment so now he perceived that she was similarly handicapped She had not had a chance to expand The books on her father s shelves the paintings on the walls the music on the piano all was just so much meretricious display To real literature real painting real music the Morses and their kind were dead And bigger than such things was life of which they were densely hopelessly ignorant In spite of their Unitarian proclivities and their masks of conservative broadmindedness they were two generations behind interpretative science their mental processes were mediaeval while their thinking on the ultimate data of existence and of the universe struck him as the same metaphysical method that was as young as the youngest race as old as the cave man and older the same that moved the first Pleistocene ape man to fear the dark that moved the first hasty Hebrew savage to incarnate Eve from Adam s rib that moved Descartes to build an idealistic system of the universe out of the projections of his own puny ego and that moved the famous British ecclesiastic to denounce evolution in satire so scathing as to win immediate applause and leave his name a notorious scrawl on the page of history So Martin thought and he thought further till it dawned upon him that the difference between these lawyers officers business men and bank cashiers he had met and the members of the working class he had known was on a par with the difference in the food they ate clothes they wore neighborhoods in which they lived Certainly in all of them was lacking the something more which he found in himself and in the books The Morses had shown him the best their social position could produce and he was not impressed by it A pauper himself a slave to the money lender he knew himself the superior of those he met at the Morses and when his one decent suit of clothes was out of pawn he moved among them a lord of life quivering with a sense of outrage akin to what a prince would suffer if condemned to live with goat herds You hate and fear the socialists he remarked to mister Morse one evening at dinner but why You know neither them nor their doctrines The conversation had been swung in that direction by missus Morse who had been invidiously singing the praises of mister Hapgood The cashier was Martin s black beast and his temper was a trifle short where the talker of platitudes was concerned Yes he had said Charley Hapgood is what they call a rising young man somebody told me as much And it is true He ll make the Governor s Chair before he dies and who knows maybe the United States Senate What makes you think so missus Morse had inquired I ve heard him make a campaign speech It was so cleverly stupid and unoriginal and also so convincing that the leaders cannot help but regard him as safe and sure while his platitudes are so much like the platitudes of the average voter that oh well you know you flatter any man by dressing up his own thoughts for him and presenting them to him I actually think you are jealous of mister Hapgood Ruth had chimed in Heaven forbid The look of horror on Martin s face stirred missus Morse to belligerence You surely don t mean to say that mister Hapgood is stupid she demanded icily No more than the average Republican was the retort or average Democrat either They are all stupid when they are not crafty and very few of them are crafty The only wise Republicans are the millionnaires and their conscious henchmen They know which side their bread is buttered on and they know why I am a Republican mister Morse put in lightly Pray how do you classify me Oh you are an unconscious henchman Henchman Why yes You do corporation work You have no working class nor criminal practice You don t depend upon wife beaters and pickpockets for your income You get your livelihood from the masters of society and whoever feeds a man is that man s master Yes you are a henchman You are interested in advancing the interests of the aggregations of capital you serve mister Morse s face was a trifle red I confess sir he said that you talk like a scoundrelly socialist Then it was that Martin made his remark You hate and fear the socialists but why You know neither them nor their doctrines Your doctrine certainly sounds like socialism mister Morse replied while Ruth gazed anxiously from one to the other and missus Morse beamed happily at the opportunity afforded of rousing her liege lord s antagonism Because I say Republicans are stupid and hold that liberty equality and fraternity are exploded bubbles does not make me a socialist Martin said with a smile Because I question Jefferson and the unscientific Frenchmen who informed his mind does not make me a socialist Believe me mister Morse you are far nearer socialism than I who am its avowed enemy Now you please to be facetious was all the other could say Not at all I speak in all seriousness You still believe in equality and yet you do the work of the corporations and the corporations from day to day are busily engaged in burying equality And you call me a socialist because I deny equality because I affirm just what you live up to The Republicans are foes to equality though most of them fight the battle against equality with the very word itself the slogan on their lips In the name of equality they destroy equality That was why I called them stupid As for myself I am an individualist I believe the race is to the swift the battle to the strong Such is the lesson I have learned from biology or at least think I have learned As I said I am an individualist and individualism is the hereditary and eternal foe of socialism But you frequent socialist meetings mister Morse challenged Certainly just as spies frequent hostile camps How else are you to learn about the enemy Besides I enjoy myself at their meetings They are good fighters and right or wrong they have read the books Any one of them knows far more about sociology and all the other ologies than the average captain of industry Yes I have been to half a dozen of their meetings but that doesn t make me a socialist any more than hearing Charley Hapgood orate made me a Republican I can t help it mister Morse said feebly but I still believe you incline that way Bless me Martin thought to himself he doesn t know what I was talking about He hasn t understood a word of it What did he do with his education anyway Thus in his development Martin found himself face to face with economic morality or the morality of class and soon it became to him a grisly monster Personally he was an intellectual moralist and more offending to him than platitudinous pomposity was the morality of those about him which was a curious hotchpotch of the economic the metaphysical the sentimental and the imitative A sample of this curious messy mixture he encountered nearer home His sister Marian had been keeping company with an industrious young mechanic of German extraction who after thoroughly learning the trade had set up for himself in a bicycle repair shop Also having got the agency for a low grade make of wheel he was prosperous Marian had called on Martin in his room a short time before to announce her engagement during which visit she had playfully inspected Martin s palm and told his fortune On her next visit she brought Hermann von Schmidt along with her Martin did the honors and congratulated both of them in language so easy and graceful as to affect disagreeably the peasant mind of his sister s lover This bad impression was further heightened by Martin s reading aloud the half dozen stanzas of verse with which he had commemorated Marian s previous visit It was a bit of society verse airy and delicate which he had named The Palmist He was surprised when he finished reading it to note no enjoyment in his sister s face Instead her eyes were fixed anxiously upon her betrothed and Martin following her gaze saw spread on that worthy s asymmetrical features nothing but black and sullen disapproval The incident passed over they made an early departure and Martin forgot all about it though for the moment he had been puzzled that any woman even of the working class should not have been flattered and delighted by having poetry written about her Several evenings later Marian again visited him this time alone Nor did she waste time in coming to the point upbraiding him sorrowfully for what he had done Why Marian he chided you talk as though you were ashamed of your relatives or of your brother at any rate And I am too she blurted out Martin was bewildered by the tears of mortification he saw in her eyes The mood whatever it was was genuine But Marian why should your Hermann be jealous of my writing poetry about my own sister He ain t jealous she sobbed He says it was indecent ob obscene Martin emitted a long low whistle of incredulity then proceeded to resurrect and read a carbon copy of The Palmist I can t see it he said finally proffering the manuscript to her Read it yourself and show me whatever strikes you as obscene that was the word wasn t it He says so and he ought to know was the answer with a wave aside of the manuscript accompanied by a look of loathing And he says you ve got to tear it up He says he won t have no wife of his with such things written about her which anybody can read He says it s a disgrace an he won t stand for it Now look here Marian this is nothing but nonsense Martin began then abruptly changed his mind He saw before him an unhappy girl knew the futility of attempting to convince her husband or her and though the whole situation was absurd and preposterous he resolved to surrender All right he announced tearing the manuscript into half a dozen pieces and throwing it into the waste basket He contented himself with the knowledge that even then the original type written manuscript was reposing in the office of a New York magazine Marian and her husband would never know and neither himself nor they nor the world would lose if the pretty harmless poem ever were published Marian starting to reach into the waste basket refrained Can I she pleaded He nodded his head regarding her thoughtfully as she gathered the torn pieces of manuscript and tucked them into the pocket of her jacket ocular evidence of the success of her mission She reminded him of Lizzie Connolly though there was less of fire and gorgeous flaunting life in her than in that other girl of the working class whom he had seen twice But they were on a par the pair of them in dress and carriage and he smiled with inward amusement at the caprice of his fancy which suggested the appearance of either of them in missus Morse s drawing room The amusement faded and he was aware of a great loneliness This sister of his and the Morse drawing room were milestones of the road he had travelled And he had left them behind He glanced affectionately about him at his few books They were all the comrades left to him Hello what s that he demanded in startled surprise Marian repeated her question Why don t I go to work He broke into a laugh that was only half hearted That Hermann of yours has been talking to you She shook her head Don t lie he commanded and the nod of her head affirmed his charge Well you tell that Hermann of yours to mind his own business that when I write poetry about the girl he s keeping company with it s his business but that outside of that he s got no say so Understand So you don t think I ll succeed as a writer eh he went on You think I m no good that I ve fallen down and am a disgrace to the family I think it would be much better if you got a job she said firmly and he saw she was sincere Hermann says Damn Hermann he broke out good naturedly What I want to know is when you re going to get married Also you find out from your Hermann if he will deign to permit you to accept a wedding present from me He mused over the incident after she had gone and once or twice broke out into laughter that was bitter as he saw his sister and her betrothed all the members of his own class and the members of Ruth s class directing their narrow little lives by narrow little formulas herd creatures flocking together and patterning their lives by one another s opinions failing of being individuals and of really living life because of the childlike formulas by which they were enslaved He summoned them before him in apparitional procession Bernard Higginbotham arm in arm with mister Butler Hermann von Schmidt cheek by jowl with Charley Hapgood and one by one and in pairs he judged them and dismissed them judged them by the standards of intellect and morality he had learned from the books Vainly he asked Where are the great souls the great men and women He found them not among the careless gross and stupid intelligences that answered the call of vision to his narrow room He felt a loathing for them such as Circe must have felt for her swine When he had dismissed the last one and thought himself alone a late comer entered unexpected and unsummoned Martin watched him and saw the stiff rim the square cut double breasted coat and the swaggering shoulders of the youthful hoodlum who had once been he You were like all the rest young fellow Martin sneered Your morality and your knowledge were just the same as theirs You did not think and act for yourself Your opinions like your clothes were ready made your acts were shaped by popular approval You were cock of your gang because others acclaimed you the real thing You fought and ruled the gang not because you liked to you know you really despised it but because the other fellows patted you on the shoulder You licked Cheese Face because you wouldn t give in and you wouldn t give in partly because you were an abysmal brute and for the rest because you believed what every one about you believed that the measure of manhood was the carnivorous ferocity displayed in injuring and marring fellow creatures anatomies Why you whelp you even won other fellows girls away from them not because you wanted the girls but because in the marrow of those about you those who set your moral pace was the instinct of the wild stallion and the bull seal Well the years have passed and what do you think about it now As if in reply the vision underwent a swift metamorphosis The stiff rim and the square cut vanished being replaced by milder garments the toughness went out of the face the hardness out of the eyes and the face chastened and refined was irradiated from an inner life of communion with beauty and knowledge The apparition was very like his present self and as he regarded it he noted the student lamp by which it was illuminated and the book over which it pored He glanced at the title and read The Science of AEsthetics Next he entered into the apparition trimmed the student lamp and himself went on reading The Science of AEsthetics CHAPTER XXX On a beautiful fall day a day of similar Indian summer to that which had seen their love declared the year before Martin read his Love cycle to Ruth It was in the afternoon and as before they had ridden out to their favorite knoll in the hills Now and again she had interrupted his reading with exclamations of pleasure and now as he laid the last sheet of manuscript with its fellows he waited her judgment She delayed to speak and at last she spoke haltingly hesitating to frame in words the harshness of her thought I think they are beautiful very beautiful she said but you can t sell them can you You see what I mean she said almost pleaded This writing of yours is not practical Something is the matter maybe it is with the market that prevents you from earning a living by it And please dear don t misunderstand me I am flattered and made proud and all that I could not be a true woman were it otherwise that you should write these poems to me But they do not make our marriage possible Don t you see Martin Don t think me mercenary It is love the thought of our future with which I am burdened A whole year has gone by since we learned we loved each other and our wedding day is no nearer Don t think me immodest in thus talking about our wedding for really I have my heart all that I am at stake Why don t you try to get work on a newspaper if you are so bound up in your writing Why not become a reporter for a while at least It would spoil my style was his answer in a low monotonous voice You have no idea how I ve worked for style But those storiettes she argued You called them hack work You wrote many of them Didn t they spoil your style No the cases are different The storiettes were ground out jaded at the end of a long day of application to style But a reporter s work is all hack from morning till night is the one paramount thing of life And it is a whirlwind life the life of the moment with neither past nor future and certainly without thought of any style but reportorial style and that certainly is not literature To become a reporter now just as my style is taking form crystallizing would be to commit literary suicide As it is every storiette every word of every storiette was a violation of myself of my self respect of my respect for beauty I tell you it was sickening I was guilty of sin And I was secretly glad when the markets failed even if my clothes did go into pawn But the joy of writing the Love cycle The creative joy in its noblest form That was compensation for everything Martin did not know that Ruth was unsympathetic concerning the creative joy She used the phrase it was on her lips he had first heard it She had read about it studied about it in the university in the course of earning her Bachelorship of Arts but she was not original not creative and all manifestations of culture on her part were but harpings of the harpings of others May not the editor have been right in his revision of your Sea Lyrics she questioned Remember an editor must have proved qualifications or else he would not be an editor That s in line with the persistence of the established he rejoined his heat against the editor folk getting the better of him What is is not only right but is the best possible The existence of anything is sufficient vindication of its fitness to exist to exist mark you as the average person unconsciously believes not merely in present conditions but in all conditions It is their ignorance of course that makes them believe such rot their ignorance which is nothing more nor less than the henidical mental process described by Weininger They think they think and such thinkless creatures are the arbiters of the lives of the few who really think He paused overcome by the consciousness that he had been talking over Ruth s head I m sure I don t know who this Weininger is she retorted And you are so dreadfully general that I fail to follow you What I was speaking of was the qualification of editors And I ll tell you he interrupted The chief qualification of ninety nine per cent of all editors is failure They have failed as writers Don t think they prefer the drudgery of the desk and the slavery to their circulation and to the business manager to the joy of writing They have tried to write and they have failed And right there is the cursed paradox of it Every portal to success in literature is guarded by those watch dogs the failures in literature The editors sub editors associate editors most of them and the manuscript readers for the magazines and book publishers most of them nearly all of them are men who wanted to write and who have failed And yet they of all creatures under the sun the most unfit are the very creatures who decide what shall and what shall not find its way into print they who have proved themselves not original who have demonstrated that they lack the divine fire sit in judgment upon originality and genius And after them come the reviewers just so many more failures Don t tell me that they have not dreamed the dream and attempted to write poetry or fiction for they have and they have failed Why the average review is more nauseating than cod liver oil But you know my opinion on the reviewers and the alleged critics There are great critics but they are as rare as comets If I fail as a writer I shall have proved for the career of editorship There s bread and butter and jam at any rate Ruth s mind was quick and her disapproval of her lover s views was buttressed by the contradiction she found in his contention But Martin if that be so if all the doors are closed as you have shown so conclusively how is it possible that any of the great writers ever arrived They arrived by achieving the impossible he answered They did such blazing glorious work as to burn to ashes those that opposed them They arrived by course of miracle by winning a thousand to one wager against them They arrived because they were Carlyle s battle scarred giants who will not be kept down And that is what I must do I must achieve the impossible But if you fail You must consider me as well Martin If I fail He regarded her for a moment as though the thought she had uttered was unthinkable Then intelligence illumined his eyes If I fail I shall become an editor and you will be an editor s wife She frowned at his facetiousness a pretty adorable frown that made him put his arm around her and kiss it away There that s enough she urged by an effort of will withdrawing herself from the fascination of his strength I have talked with father and mother I never before asserted myself so against them I demanded to be heard I was very undutiful They are against you you know but I assured them over and over of my abiding love for you and at last father agreed that if you wanted to you could begin right away in his office And then of his own accord he said he would pay you enough at the start so that we could get married and have a little cottage somewhere Which I think was very fine of him don t you Martin with the dull pain of despair at his heart mechanically reaching for the tobacco and paper which he no longer carried to roll a cigarette muttered something inarticulate and Ruth went on Frankly though and don t let it hurt you I tell you to show you precisely how you stand with him he doesn t like your radical views and he thinks you are lazy Of course I know you are not I know you work hard How hard even she did not know was the thought in Martin s mind Well then he said how about my views Do you think they are so radical He held her eyes and waited the answer I think them well very disconcerting she replied The question was answered for him and so oppressed was he by the grayness of life that he forgot the tentative proposition she had made for him to go to work And she having gone as far as she dared was willing to wait the answer till she should bring the question up again She had not long to wait Martin had a question of his own to propound to her He wanted to ascertain the measure of her faith in him and within the week each was answered Martin precipitated it by reading to her his The Shame of the Sun Why don t you become a reporter she asked when he had finished You love writing so and I am sure you would succeed You could rise in journalism and make a name for yourself There are a number of great special correspondents Their salaries are large and their field is the world They are sent everywhere to the heart of Africa like Stanley or to interview the Pope or to explore unknown Thibet Then you don t like my essay he rejoined You believe that I have some show in journalism but none in literature No no I do like it It reads well But I am afraid it s over the heads of your readers At least it is over mine It sounds beautiful but I don t understand it Your scientific slang is beyond me You are an extremist you know dear and what may be intelligible to you may not be intelligible to the rest of us I imagine it s the philosophic slang that bothers you was all he could say He was flaming from the fresh reading of the ripest thought he had expressed and her verdict stunned him No matter how poorly it is done he persisted don t you see anything in it in the thought of it I mean She shook her head No it is so different from anything I have read I read Maeterlinck and understand him His mysticism you understand that Martin flashed out Yes but this of yours which is supposed to be an attack upon him I don t understand Of course if originality counts He stopped her with an impatient gesture that was not followed by speech He became suddenly aware that she was speaking and that she had been speaking for some time After all your writing has been a toy to you she was saying Surely you have played with it long enough It is time to take up life seriously our life Martin Hitherto you have lived solely your own You want me to go to work he asked Yes Father has offered I understand all that he broke in but what I want to know is whether or not you have lost faith in me She pressed his hand mutely her eyes dim In your writing dear she admitted in a half whisper You ve read lots of my stuff he went on brutally What do you think of it Is it utterly hopeless How does it compare with other men s work But they sell theirs and you don t That doesn t answer my question Do you think that literature is not at all my vocation Then I will answer She steeled herself to do it I don t think you were made to write Forgive me dear You compel me to say it and you know I know more about literature than you do Yes you are a Bachelor of Arts he said meditatively and you ought to know But there is more to be said he continued after a pause painful to both I know what I have in me No one knows that so well as I I know I shall succeed I will not be kept down I am afire with what I have to say in verse and fiction and essay I do not ask you to have faith in that though I do not ask you to have faith in me nor in my writing What I do ask of you is to love me and have faith in love A year ago I believed for two years One of those years is yet to run And I do believe upon my honor and my soul that before that year is run I shall have succeeded You remember what you told me long ago that I must serve my apprenticeship to writing Well I have served it I have crammed it and telescoped it With you at the end awaiting me I have never shirked Do you know I have forgotten what it is to fall peacefully asleep A few million years ago I knew what it was to sleep my fill and to awake naturally from very glut of sleep I am awakened always now by an alarm clock If I fall asleep early or late I set the alarm accordingly and this and the putting out of the lamp are my last conscious actions When I begin to feel drowsy I change the heavy book I am reading for a lighter one And when I doze over that I beat my head with my knuckles in order to drive sleep away Somewhere I read of a man who was afraid to sleep Kipling wrote the story This man arranged a spur so that when unconsciousness came his naked body pressed against the iron teeth Well I ve done the same I look at the time and I resolve that not until midnight or not until one o clock or two o clock or three o clock shall the spur be removed And so it rowels me awake until the appointed time That spur has been my bed mate for months I have grown so desperate that five and a half hours of sleep is an extravagance I sleep four hours now I am starved for sleep There are times when I am light headed from want of sleep times when death with its rest and sleep is a positive lure to me times when I am haunted by Longfellow s lines The sea is still and deep All things within its bosom sleep A single step and all is o er A plunge a bubble and no more Of course this is sheer nonsense It comes from nervousness from an overwrought mind But the point is Why have I done this For you To shorten my apprenticeship To compel Success to hasten And my apprenticeship is now served I know my equipment I swear that I learn more each month than the average college man learns in a year I know it I tell you But were my need for you to understand not so desperate I should not tell you It is not boasting I measure the results by the books Your brothers to day are ignorant barbarians compared with me and the knowledge I have wrung from the books in the hours they were sleeping Long ago I wanted to be famous I care very little for fame now What I want is you I am more hungry for you than for food or clothing or recognition I have a dream of laying my head on your breast and sleeping an aeon or so and the dream will come true ere another year is gone His power beat against her wave upon wave and in the moment his will opposed hers most she felt herself most strongly drawn toward him The strength that had always poured out from him to her was now flowering in his impassioned voice his flashing eyes and the vigor of life and intellect surging in him And in that moment and for the moment she was aware of a rift that showed in her certitude a rift through which she caught sight of the real Martin Eden splendid and invincible and as animal trainers have their moments of doubt so she for the instant seemed to doubt her power to tame this wild spirit of a man And another thing he swept on You love me But why do you love me The thing in me that compels me to write is the very thing that draws your love You love me because I am somehow different from the men you have known and might have loved I was not made for the desk and counting house for petty business squabbling and legal jangling Make me do such things make me like those other men doing the work they do breathing the air they breathe developing the point of view they have developed and you have destroyed the difference destroyed me destroyed the thing you love My desire to write is the most vital thing in me Had I been a mere clod neither would I have desired to write nor would you have desired me for a husband But you forget she interrupted the quick surface of her mind glimpsing a parallel There have been eccentric inventors starving their families while they sought such chimeras as perpetual motion Doubtless their wives loved them and suffered with them and for them not because of but in spite of their infatuation for perpetual motion True was the reply But there have been inventors who were not eccentric and who starved while they sought to invent practical things and sometimes it is recorded they succeeded Certainly I do not seek any impossibilities You have called it achieving the impossible she interpolated I spoke figuratively I seek to do what men have done before me to write and to live by my writing Her silence spurred him on To you then my goal is as much a chimera as perpetual motion he demanded He read her answer in the pressure of her hand on his the pitying mother hand for the hurt child And to her just then he was the hurt child the infatuated man striving to achieve the impossible Toward the close of their talk she warned him again of the antagonism of her father and mother But you love me he asked I do I do she cried And I love you not them and nothing they do can hurt me Triumph sounded in his voice For I have faith in your love not fear of their enmity All things may go astray in this world but not love Love cannot go wrong unless it be a weakling that faints and stumbles by the way CHAPTER XXXI Martin had encountered his sister Gertrude by chance on Broadway as it proved a most propitious yet disconcerting chance Waiting on the corner for a car she had seen him first and noted the eager hungry lines of his face and the desperate worried look of his eyes In truth he was desperate and worried He had just come from a fruitless interview with the pawnbroker from whom he had tried to wring an additional loan on his wheel The muddy fall weather having come on Martin had pledged his wheel some time since and retained his black suit There s the black suit the pawnbroker who knew his every asset had answered You needn t tell me you ve gone and pledged it with that Jew Lipka Because if you have The man had looked the threat and Martin hastened to cry No no I ve got it But I want to wear it on a matter of business All right the mollified usurer had replied And I want it on a matter of business before I can let you have any more money You don t think I m in it for my health But it s a forty dollar wheel in good condition Martin had argued And you ve only let me have seven dollars on it No not even seven Six and a quarter you took the interest in advance If you want some more bring the suit had been the reply that sent Martin out of the stuffy little den so desperate at heart as to reflect it in his face and touch his sister to pity Scarcely had they met when the Telegraph Avenue car came along and stopped to take on a crowd of afternoon shoppers missus Higginbotham divined from the grip on her arm as he helped her on that he was not going to follow her She turned on the step and looked down upon him His haggard face smote her to the heart again Ain t you comin she asked The next moment she had descended to his side I m walking exercise you know he explained Then I ll go along for a few blocks she announced Mebbe it ll do me good I ain t ben feelin any too spry these last few days Martin glanced at her and verified her statement in her general slovenly appearance in the unhealthy fat in the drooping shoulders the tired face with the sagging lines and in the heavy fall of her feet without elasticity a very caricature of the walk that belongs to a free and happy body You d better stop here he said though she had already come to a halt at the first corner and take the next car My goodness if I ain t all tired a ready she panted But I m just as able to walk as you in them soles They re that thin they ll bu saint long before you git out to North Oakland I ve a better pair at home was the answer Come out to dinner to morrow she invited irrelevantly mister Higginbotham won t be there He s goin to San Leandro on business Martin shook his head but he had failed to keep back the wolfish hungry look that leapt into his eyes at the suggestion of dinner You haven t a penny Mart and that s why you re walkin Exercise She tried to sniff contemptuously but succeeded in producing only a sniffle Here lemme see And fumbling in her satchel she pressed a five dollar piece into his hand I guess I forgot your last birthday Mart she mumbled lamely Martin s hand instinctively closed on the piece of gold In the same instant he knew he ought not to accept and found himself struggling in the throes of indecision That bit of gold meant food life and light in his body and brain power to go on writing and who was to say maybe to write something that would bring in many pieces of gold Clear on his vision burned the manuscripts of two essays he had just completed He saw them under the table on top of the heap of returned manuscripts for which he had no stamps and he saw their titles just as he had typed them The High Priests of Mystery and The Cradle of Beauty He had never submitted them anywhere They were as good as anything he had done in that line If only he had stamps for them Then the certitude of his ultimate success rose up in him an able ally of hunger and with a quick movement he slipped the coin into his pocket I ll pay you back Gertrude a hundred times over he gulped out his throat painfully contracted and in his eyes a swift hint of moisture Mark my words he cried with abrupt positiveness Before the year is out I ll put an even hundred of those little yellow boys into your hand I don t ask you to believe me All you have to do is wait and see Nor did she believe Her incredulity made her uncomfortable and failing of other expedient she said I know you re hungry Mart It s sticking out all over you Come in to meals any time I ll send one of the children to tell you when mister Higginbotham ain t to be there An Mart He waited though he knew in his secret heart what she was about to say so visible was her thought process to him Don t you think it s about time you got a job You don t think I ll win out he asked She shook her head Nobody has faith in me Gertrude except myself His voice was passionately rebellious I ve done good work already plenty of it and sooner or later it will sell How do you know it is good Because He faltered as the whole vast field of literature and the history of literature stirred in his brain and pointed the futility of his attempting to convey to her the reasons for his faith Well because it s better than ninety nine per cent of what is published in the magazines I wish t you d listen to reason she answered feebly but with unwavering belief in the correctness of her diagnosis of what was ailing him I wish t you d listen to reason she repeated an come to dinner to morrow After Martin had helped her on the car he hurried to the post office and invested three of the five dollars in stamps and when later in the day on the way to the Morse home he stopped in at the post office to weigh a large number of long bulky envelopes he affixed to them all the stamps save three of the two cent denomination It proved a momentous night for Martin for after dinner he met Russ Brissenden How he chanced to come there whose friend he was or what acquaintance brought him Martin did not know Nor had he the curiosity to inquire about him of Ruth In short Brissenden struck Martin as anaemic and feather brained and was promptly dismissed from his mind An hour later he decided that Brissenden was a boor as well what of the way he prowled about from one room to another staring at the pictures or poking his nose into books and magazines he picked up from the table or drew from the shelves Though a stranger in the house he finally isolated himself in the midst of the company huddling into a capacious Morris chair and reading steadily from a thin volume he had drawn from his pocket As he read he abstractedly ran his fingers with a caressing movement through his hair Martin noticed him no more that evening except once when he observed him chaffing with great apparent success with several of the young women It chanced that when Martin was leaving he overtook Brissenden already half down the walk to the street Hello is that you Martin said The other replied with an ungracious grunt but swung alongside Martin made no further attempt at conversation and for several blocks unbroken silence lay upon them Pompous old ass The suddenness and the virulence of the exclamation startled Martin He felt amused and at the same time was aware of a growing dislike for the other What do you go to such a place for was abruptly flung at him after another block of silence Why do you Martin countered Bless me I don t know came back At least this is my first indiscretion There are twenty four hours in each day and I must spend them somehow Come and have a drink All right Martin answered The next moment he was nonplussed by the readiness of his acceptance At home was several hours hack work waiting for him before he went to bed and after he went to bed there was a volume of Weismann waiting for him to say nothing of Herbert Spencer s Autobiography which was as replete for him with romance as any thrilling novel Why should he waste any time with this man he did not like was his thought And yet it was not so much the man nor the drink as was it what was associated with the drink the bright lights the mirrors and dazzling array of glasses the warm and glowing faces and the resonant hum of the voices of men That was it it was the voices of men optimistic men men who breathed success and spent their money for drinks like men He was lonely that was what was the matter with him that was why he had snapped at the invitation as a bonita strikes at a white rag on a hook Not since with Joe at Shelly Hot Springs with the one exception of the wine he took with the Portuguese grocer had Martin had a drink at a public bar Mental exhaustion did not produce a craving for liquor such as physical exhaustion did and he had felt no need for it But just now he felt desire for the drink or rather for the atmosphere wherein drinks were dispensed and disposed of Such a place was the Grotto where Brissenden and he lounged in capacious leather chairs and drank Scotch and soda They talked They talked about many things and now Brissenden and now Martin took turn in ordering Scotch and soda Martin who was extremely strong headed marvelled at the other s capacity for liquor and ever and anon broke off to marvel at the other s conversation He was not long in assuming that Brissenden knew everything and in deciding that here was the second intellectual man he had met But he noted that Brissenden had what Professor Caldwell lacked namely fire the flashing insight and perception the flaming uncontrol of genius Living language flowed from him His thin lips like the dies of a machine stamped out phrases that cut and stung or again pursing caressingly about the inchoate sound they articulated the thin lips shaped soft and velvety things mellow phrases of glow and glory of haunting beauty reverberant of the mystery and inscrutableness of life and yet again the thin lips were like a bugle from which rang the crash and tumult of cosmic strife phrases that sounded clear as silver that were luminous as starry spaces that epitomized the final word of science and yet said something more the poet s word the transcendental truth elusive and without words which could express and which none the less found expression in the subtle and all but ungraspable connotations of common words He by some wonder of vision saw beyond the farthest outpost of empiricism where was no language for narration and yet by some golden miracle of speech investing known words with unknown significances he conveyed to Martin s consciousness messages that were incommunicable to ordinary souls Martin forgot his first impression of dislike Here was the best the books had to offer coming true Here was an intelligence a living man for him to look up to I am down in the dirt at your feet Martin repeated to himself again and again You ve studied biology he said aloud in significant allusion To his surprise Brissenden shook his head But you are stating truths that are substantiated only by biology Martin insisted and was rewarded by a blank stare Your conclusions are in line with the books which you must have read I am glad to hear it was the answer That my smattering of knowledge should enable me to short cut my way to truth is most reassuring As for myself I never bother to find out if I am right or not It is all valueless anyway Man can never know the ultimate verities You are a disciple of Spencer Martin cried triumphantly I haven t read him since adolescence and all I read then was his Education I wish I could gather knowledge as carelessly Martin broke out half an hour later He had been closely analyzing Brissenden s mental equipment You are a sheer dogmatist and that s what makes it so marvellous You state dogmatically the latest facts which science has been able to establish only by a posteriori reasoning You jump at correct conclusions You certainly short cut with a vengeance You feel your way with the speed of light by some hyperrational process to truth Yes that was what used to bother Father Joseph and Brother Dutton Brissenden replied Oh no he added I am not anything It was a lucky trick of fate that sent me to a Catholic college for my education Where did you pick up what you know And while Martin told him he was busy studying Brissenden ranging from a long lean aristocratic face and drooping shoulders to the overcoat on a neighboring chair its pockets sagged and bulged by the freightage of many books Brissenden s face and long slender hands were browned by the sun excessively browned Martin thought This sunburn bothered Martin It was patent that Brissenden was no outdoor man Then how had he been ravaged by the sun Something morbid and significant attached to that sunburn was Martin s thought as he returned to a study of the face narrow with high cheek bones and cavernous hollows and graced with as delicate and fine an aquiline nose as Martin had ever seen There was nothing remarkable about the size of the eyes They were neither large nor small while their color was a nondescript brown but in them smouldered a fire or rather lurked an expression dual and strangely contradictory Defiant indomitable even harsh to excess they at the same time aroused pity Martin found himself pitying him he knew not why though he was soon to learn Oh I m a lunger Brissenden announced offhand a little later having already stated that he came from Arizona I ve been down there a couple of years living on the climate Aren t you afraid to venture it up in this climate Afraid There was no special emphasis of his repetition of Martin s word But Martin saw in that ascetic face the advertisement that there was nothing of which it was afraid The eyes had narrowed till they were eagle like and Martin almost caught his breath as he noted the eagle beak with its dilated nostrils defiant assertive aggressive Magnificent was what he commented to himself his blood thrilling at the sight Aloud he quoted Under the bludgeoning of Chance My head is bloody but unbowed You like Henley Brissenden said his expression changing swiftly to large graciousness and tenderness Of course I couldn t have expected anything else of you Ah Henley A brave soul He stands out among contemporary rhymesters magazine rhymesters as a gladiator stands out in the midst of a band of eunuchs You don t like the magazines Martin softly impeached Do you was snarled back at him so savagely as to startle him I I write or rather try to write for the magazines Martin faltered That s better was the mollified rejoinder You try to write but you don t succeed I respect and admire your failure I know what you write I can see it with half an eye and there s one ingredient in it that shuts it out of the magazines It s guts and magazines have no use for that particular commodity What they want is wish wash and slush and God knows they get it but not from you I m not above hack work Martin contended On the contrary Brissenden paused and ran an insolent eye over Martin s objective poverty passing from the well worn tie and the saw edged collar to the shiny sleeves of the coat and on to the slight fray of one cuff winding up and dwelling upon Martin s sunken cheeks On the contrary hack work is above you so far above you that you can never hope to rise to it Why man I could insult you by asking you to have something to eat Martin felt the heat in his face of the involuntary blood and Brissenden laughed triumphantly A full man is not insulted by such an invitation he concluded You are a devil Martin cried irritably Anyway I didn t ask you You didn t dare Oh I don t know about that I invite you now Brissenden half rose from his chair as he spoke as if with the intention of departing to the restaurant forthwith Martin s fists were tight clenched and his blood was drumming in his temples Bosco He eats em alive Eats em alive Brissenden exclaimed imitating the spieler of a locally famous snake eater I could certainly eat you alive Martin said in turn running insolent eyes over the other s disease ravaged frame Only I m not worthy of it On the contrary Martin considered because the incident is not worthy He broke into a laugh hearty and wholesome I confess you made a fool of me Brissenden That I am hungry and you are aware of it are only ordinary phenomena and there s no disgrace You see I laugh at the conventional little moralities of the herd then you drift by say a sharp true word and immediately I am the slave of the same little moralities You were insulted Brissenden affirmed I certainly was a moment ago The prejudice of early youth you know I learned such things then and they cheapen what I have since learned They are the skeletons in my particular closet But you ve got the door shut on them now I certainly have Sure Sure Then let s go and get something to eat I ll go you Martin answered attempting to pay for the current Scotch and soda with the last change from his two dollars and seeing the waiter bullied by Brissenden into putting that change back on the table Martin pocketed it with a grimace and felt for a moment the kindly weight of Brissenden s hand upon his shoulder CHAPTER XXXII Promptly the next afternoon Maria was excited by Martin s second visitor But she did not lose her head this time for she seated Brissenden in her parlor s grandeur of respectability Hope you don t mind my coming Brissenden began No no not at all Martin answered shaking hands and waving him to the solitary chair himself taking to the bed But how did you know where I lived Called up the Morses Miss Morse answered the phone And here I am He tugged at his coat pocket and flung a thin volume on the table There s a book by a poet Read it and keep it And then in reply to Martin s protest What have I to do with books I had another hemorrhage this morning Got any whiskey No of course not Wait a minute He was off and away Martin watched his long figure go down the outside steps and on turning to close the gate noted with a pang the shoulders which had once been broad drawn in now over the collapsed ruin of the chest Martin got two tumblers and fell to reading the book of verse Henry Vaughn Marlow s latest collection No Scotch Brissenden announced on his return The beggar sells nothing but American whiskey But here s a quart of it I ll send one of the youngsters for lemons and we ll make a toddy Martin offered I wonder what a book like that will earn Marlow he went on holding up the volume in question Possibly fifty dollars came the answer Though he s lucky if he pulls even on it or if he can inveigle a publisher to risk bringing it out Then one can t make a living out of poetry Martin s tone and face alike showed his dejection Certainly not What fool expects to Out of rhyming yes There s Bruce and Virginia Spring and Sedgwick They do very nicely But poetry do you know how Vaughn Marlow makes his living teaching in a boys cramming joint down in Pennsylvania and of all private little hells such a billet is the limit I wouldn t trade places with him if he had fifty years of life before him And yet his work stands out from the ruck of the contemporary versifiers as a balas ruby among carrots And the reviews he gets Damn them all of them the crass manikins Too much is written by the men who can t write about the men who do write Martin concurred Why I was appalled at the quantities of rubbish written about Stevenson and his work Ghouls and harpies Brissenden snapped out with clicking teeth Yes I know the spawn complacently pecking at him for his Father Damien letter analyzing him weighing him Measuring him by the yardstick of their own miserable egos Martin broke in Yes that s it a good phrase mouthing and besliming the True and Beautiful and Good and finally patting him on the back and saying Good dog Fido Faugh The little chattering daws of men Richard Realf called them the night he died Pecking at star dust Martin took up the strain warmly at the meteoric flight of the master men I once wrote a squib on them the critics or the reviewers rather Let s see it Brissenden begged eagerly So Martin unearthed a carbon copy of Star dust and during the reading of it Brissenden chuckled rubbed his hands and forgot to sip his toddy Strikes me you re a bit of star dust yourself flung into a world of cowled gnomes who cannot see was his comment at the end of it Of course it was snapped up by the first magazine Martin ran over the pages of his manuscript book It has been refused by twenty seven of them Brissenden essayed a long and hearty laugh but broke down in a fit of coughing Say you needn t tell me you haven t tackled poetry he gasped Let me see some of it Don t read it now Martin pleaded I want to talk with you I ll make up a bundle and you can take it home Brissenden departed with the Love cycle and The Peri and the Pearl returning next day to greet Martin with I want more Not only did he assure Martin that he was a poet but Martin learned that Brissenden also was one He was swept off his feet by the other s work and astounded that no attempt had been made to publish it A plague on all their houses was Brissenden s answer to Martin s volunteering to market his work for him Love Beauty for its own sake was his counsel and leave the magazines alone Back to your ships and your sea that s my advice to you Martin Eden What do you want in these sick and rotten cities of men You are cutting your throat every day you waste in them trying to prostitute beauty to the needs of magazinedom What was it you quoted me the other day Oh yes Man the latest of the ephemera Well what do you the latest of the ephemera want with fame If you got it it would be poison to you You are too simple too elemental and too rational by my faith to prosper on such pap I hope you never do sell a line to the magazines Beauty is the only master to serve Serve her and damn the multitude Success What in hell s success if it isn t right there in your Stevenson sonnet which outranks Henley s Apparition in that Love cycle in those sea poems It is not in what you succeed in doing that you get your joy but in the doing of it You can t tell me I know it You know it Beauty hurts you It is an everlasting pain in you a wound that does not heal a knife of flame Why should you palter with magazines Let beauty be your end Why should you mint beauty into gold Anyway you can t so there s no use in my getting excited over it You can read the magazines for a thousand years and you won t find the value of one line of Keats Leave fame and coin alone sign away on a ship to morrow and go back to your sea Not for fame but for love Martin laughed Love seems to have no place in your Cosmos in mine Beauty is the handmaiden of Love Brissenden looked at him pityingly and admiringly You are so young Martin boy so young You will flutter high but your wings are of the finest gauze dusted with the fairest pigments Do not scorch them But of course you have scorched them already It required some glorified petticoat to account for that Love cycle and that s the shame of it It glorifies love as well as the petticoat Martin laughed The philosophy of madness was the retort So have I assured myself when wandering in hasheesh dreams But beware These bourgeois cities will kill you Look at that den of traitors where I met you Dry rot is no name for it One can t keep his sanity in such an atmosphere It s degrading There s not one of them who is not degrading man and woman all of them animated stomachs guided by the high intellectual and artistic impulses of clams He broke off suddenly and regarded Martin Then with a flash of divination he saw the situation The expression on his face turned to wondering horror And you wrote that tremendous Love cycle to her that pale shrivelled female thing The next instant Martin s right hand had shot to a throttling clutch on his throat and he was being shaken till his teeth rattled But Martin looking into his eyes saw no fear there naught but a curious and mocking devil Martin remembered himself and flung Brissenden by the neck sidelong upon the bed at the same moment releasing his hold Brissenden panted and gasped painfully for a moment then began to chuckle You had made me eternally your debtor had you shaken out the flame he said My nerves are on a hair trigger these days Martin apologized Hope I didn t hurt you Here let me mix a fresh toddy Ah you young Greek Brissenden went on I wonder if you take just pride in that body of yours You are devilish strong You are a young panther a lion cub Well well it is you who must pay for that strength What do you mean Martin asked curiously passing aim a glass Here down this and be good Because Brissenden sipped his toddy and smiled appreciation of it Because of the women They will worry you until you die as they have already worried you or else I was born yesterday Now there s no use in your choking me I m going to have my say This is undoubtedly your calf love but for Beauty s sake show better taste next time What under heaven do you want with a daughter of the bourgeoisie Leave them alone Pick out some great wanton flame of a woman who laughs at life and jeers at death and loves one while she may There are such women and they will love you just as readily as any pusillanimous product of bourgeois sheltered life Pusillanimous Martin protested Just so pusillanimous prattling out little moralities that have been prattled into them and afraid to live life They will love you Martin but they will love their little moralities more What you want is the magnificent abandon of life the great free souls the blazing butterflies and not the little gray moths Oh you will grow tired of them too of all the female things if you are unlucky enough to live But you won t live You won t go back to your ships and sea therefore you ll hang around these pest holes of cities until your bones are rotten and then you ll die You can lecture me but you can t make me talk back Martin said After all you have but the wisdom of your temperament and the wisdom of my temperament is just as unimpeachable as yours They disagreed about love and the magazines and many things but they liked each other and on Martin s part it was no less than a profound liking Day after day they were together if for no more than the hour Brissenden spent in Martin s stuffy room Brissenden never arrived without his quart of whiskey and when they dined together down town he drank Scotch and soda throughout the meal He invariably paid the way for both and it was through him that Martin learned the refinements of food drank his first champagne and made acquaintance with Rhenish wines But Brissenden was always an enigma With the face of an ascetic he was in all the failing blood of him a frank voluptuary He was unafraid to die bitter and cynical of all the ways of living and yet dying he loved life to the last atom of it He was possessed by a madness to live to thrill to squirm my little space in the cosmic dust whence I came as he phrased it once himself He had tampered with drugs and done many strange things in quest of new thrills new sensations As he told Martin he had once gone three days without water had done so voluntarily in order to experience the exquisite delight of such a thirst assuaged Who or what he was Martin never learned He was a man without a past whose future was the imminent grave and whose present was a bitter fever of living CHAPTER XXXIII Martin was steadily losing his battle Economize as he would the earnings from hack work did not balance expenses Thanksgiving found him with his black suit in pawn and unable to accept the Morses invitation to dinner Ruth was not made happy by his reason for not coming and the corresponding effect on him was one of desperation He told her that he would come after all that he would go over to San Francisco to the Transcontinental office collect the five dollars due him and with it redeem his suit of clothes In the morning he borrowed ten cents from Maria He would have borrowed it by preference from Brissenden but that erratic individual had disappeared Two weeks had passed since Martin had seen him and he vainly cudgelled his brains for some cause of offence The ten cents carried Martin across the ferry to San Francisco and as he walked up Market Street he speculated upon his predicament in case he failed to collect the money There would then be no way for him to return to Oakland and he knew no one in San Francisco from whom to borrow another ten cents The door to the Transcontinental office was ajar and Martin in the act of opening it was brought to a sudden pause by a loud voice from within which exclaimed But that is not the question mister Ford Ford Martin knew from his correspondence to be the editor s name The question is are you prepared to pay cash and cash down I mean I am not interested in the prospects of the Transcontinental and what you expect to make it next year What I want is to be paid for what I do And I tell you right now the Christmas Transcontinental don t go to press till I have the money in my hand Good day When you get the money come and see me The door jerked open and the man flung past Martin with an angry countenance and went down the corridor muttering curses and clenching his fists Martin decided not to enter immediately and lingered in the hallways for a quarter of an hour Then he shoved the door open and walked in It was a new experience the first time he had been inside an editorial office Cards evidently were not necessary in that office for the boy carried word to an inner room that there was a man who wanted to see mister Ford Returning the boy beckoned him from halfway across the room and led him to the private office the editorial sanctum Martin s first impression was of the disorder and cluttered confusion of the room Next he noticed a bewhiskered youthful looking man sitting at a roll top desk who regarded him curiously Martin marvelled at the calm repose of his face It was evident that the squabble with the printer had not affected his equanimity I I am Martin Eden Martin began the conversation And I want my five dollars was what he would have liked to say But this was his first editor and under the circumstances he did not desire to scare him too abruptly To his surprise mister Ford leaped into the air with a You don t say so and the next moment with both hands was shaking Martin s hand effusively Can t say how glad I am to see you mister Eden Often wondered what you were like Here he held Martin off at arm s length and ran his beaming eyes over Martin s second best suit which was also his worst suit and which was ragged and past repair though the trousers showed the careful crease he had put in with Maria s flat irons I confess though I conceived you to be a much older man than you are Your story you know showed such breadth and vigor such maturity and depth of thought A masterpiece that story I knew it when I had read the first half dozen lines Let me tell you how I first read it But no first let me introduce you to the staff Still talking mister Ford led him into the general office where he introduced him to the associate editor mister White a slender frail little man whose hand seemed strangely cold as if he were suffering from a chill and whose whiskers were sparse and silky And mister Ends mister Eden mister Ends is our business manager you know Martin found himself shaking hands with a cranky eyed bald headed man whose face looked youthful enough from what little could be seen of it for most of it was covered by a snow white beard carefully trimmed by his wife who did it on Sundays at which times she also shaved the back of his neck The three men surrounded Martin all talking admiringly and at once until it seemed to him that they were talking against time for a wager We often wondered why you didn t call mister White was saying I didn t have the carfare and I live across the Bay Martin answered bluntly with the idea of showing them his imperative need for the money Surely he thought to himself my glad rags in themselves are eloquent advertisement of my need Time and again whenever opportunity offered he hinted about the purpose of his business But his admirers ears were deaf They sang his praises told him what they had thought of his story at first sight what they subsequently thought what their wives and families thought but not one hint did they breathe of intention to pay him for it Did I tell you how I first read your story mister Ford said Of course I didn t I was coming west from New York and when the train stopped at Ogden the train boy on the new run brought aboard the current number of the Transcontinental My God Martin thought you can travel in a Pullman while I starve for the paltry five dollars you owe me A wave of anger rushed over him The wrong done him by the Transcontinental loomed colossal for strong upon him were all the dreary months of vain yearning of hunger and privation and his present hunger awoke and gnawed at him reminding him that he had eaten nothing since the day before and little enough then For the moment he saw red These creatures were not even robbers They were sneak thieves By lies and broken promises they had tricked him out of his story Well he would show them And a great resolve surged into his will to the effect that he would not leave the office until he got his money He remembered if he did not get it that there was no way for him to go back to Oakland He controlled himself with an effort but not before the wolfish expression of his face had awed and perturbed them They became more voluble than ever mister Ford started anew to tell how he had first read The Ring of Bells and mister Ends at the same time was striving to repeat his niece s appreciation of The Ring of Bells said niece being a school teacher in Alameda I ll tell you what I came for Martin said finally To be paid for that story all of you like so well Five dollars I believe is what you promised me would be paid on publication mister Ford with an expression on his mobile features of mediate and happy acquiescence started to reach for his pocket then turned suddenly to mister Ends and said that he had left his money home That mister Ends resented this was patent and Martin saw the twitch of his arm as if to protect his trousers pocket Martin knew that the money was there I am sorry said mister Ends but I paid the printer not an hour ago and he took my ready change It was careless of me to be so short but the bill was not yet due and the printer s request as a favor to make an immediate advance was quite unexpected Both men looked expectantly at mister White but that gentleman laughed and shrugged his shoulders His conscience was clean at any rate He had come into the Transcontinental to learn magazine literature instead of which he had principally learned finance The Transcontinental owed him four months salary and he knew that the printer must be appeased before the associate editor It s rather absurd mister Eden to have caught us in this shape mister Ford preambled airily All carelessness I assure you But I ll tell you what we ll do We ll mail you a check the first thing in the morning You have mister Eden s address haven t you mister Ends Yes mister Ends had the address and the check would be mailed the first thing in the morning Martin s knowledge of banks and checks was hazy but he could see no reason why they should not give him the check on this day just as well as on the next Then it is understood mister Eden that we ll mail you the check to morrow mister Ford said I need the money to day Martin answered stolidly The unfortunate circumstances if you had chanced here any other day mister Ford began suavely only to be interrupted by mister Ends whose cranky eyes justified themselves in his shortness of temper mister Ford has already explained the situation he said with asperity And so have I The check will be mailed I also have explained Martin broke in and I have explained that I want the money to day He had felt his pulse quicken a trifle at the business manager s brusqueness and upon him he kept an alert eye for it was in that gentleman s trousers pocket that he divined the Transcontinental s ready cash was reposing It is too bad mister Ford began But at that moment with an impatient movement mister Ends turned as if about to leave the room At the same instant Martin sprang for him clutching him by the throat with one hand in such fashion that mister Ends snow white beard still maintaining its immaculate trimness pointed ceilingward at an angle of forty five degrees To the horror of mister White and mister Ford they saw their business manager shaken like an Astrakhan rug Dig up you venerable discourager of rising young talent Martin exhorted Dig up or I ll shake it out of you even if it s all in nickels Then to the two affrighted onlookers Keep away If you interfere somebody s liable to get hurt mister Ends was choking and it was not until the grip on his throat was eased that he was able to signify his acquiescence in the digging up programme All together after repeated digs its trousers pocket yielded four dollars and fifteen cents Inside out with it Martin commanded An additional ten cents fell out Martin counted the result of his raid a second time to make sure You next he shouted at mister Ford I want seventy five cents more mister Ford did not wait but ransacked his pockets with the result of sixty cents Sure that is all Martin demanded menacingly possessing himself of it What have you got in your vest pockets In token of his good faith mister Ford turned two of his pockets inside out A strip of cardboard fell to the floor from one of them He recovered it and was in the act of returning it when Martin cried What s that A ferry ticket Here give it to me It s worth ten cents I ll credit you with it I ve now got four dollars and ninety five cents including the ticket Five cents is still due me He looked fiercely at mister White and found that fragile creature in the act of handing him a nickel Thank you Martin said addressing them collectively I wish you a good day Robber mister Ends snarled after him Sneak thief Martin retorted slamming the door as he passed out Martin was elated so elated that when he recollected that The Hornet owed him fifteen dollars for The Peri and the Pearl he decided forthwith to go and collect it But The Hornet was run by a set of clean shaven strapping young men frank buccaneers who robbed everything and everybody not excepting one another After some breakage of the office furniture the editor an ex college athlete ably assisted by the business manager an advertising agent and the porter succeeded in removing Martin from the office and in accelerating by initial impulse his descent of the first flight of stairs Come again mister Eden glad to see you any time they laughed down at him from the landing above Martin grinned as he picked himself up Phew he murmured back The Transcontinental crowd were nanny goats but you fellows are a lot of prize fighters More laughter greeted this I must say mister Eden the editor of The Hornet called down that for a poet you can go some yourself Where did you learn that right cross if I may ask Where you learned that half Nelson Martin answered Anyway you re going to have a black eye I hope your neck doesn t stiffen up the editor wished solicitously What do you say we all go out and have a drink on it not the neck of course but the little rough house I ll go you if I lose Martin accepted And robbers and robbed drank together amicably agreeing that the battle was to the strong and that the fifteen dollars for The Peri and the Pearl belonged by right to The Hornet s editorial staff CHAPTER XXXIV Arthur remained at the gate while Ruth climbed Maria s front steps She heard the rapid click of the type writer and when Martin let her in found him on the last page of a manuscript She had come to make certain whether or not he would be at their table for Thanksgiving dinner but before she could broach the subject Martin plunged into the one with which he was full Here let me read you this he cried separating the carbon copies and running the pages of manuscript into shape It s my latest and different from anything I ve done It is so altogether different that I am almost afraid of it and yet I ve a sneaking idea it is good You be judge It s an Hawaiian story I ve called it Wiki wiki His face was bright with the creative glow though she shivered in the cold room and had been struck by the coldness of his hands at greeting She listened closely while he read and though he from time to time had seen only disapprobation in her face at the close he asked Frankly what do you think of it I I don t know she answered Will it do you think it will sell I m afraid not was the confession It s too strong for the magazines But it s true on my word it s true But why do you persist in writing such things when you know they won t sell she went on inexorably The reason for your writing is to make a living isn t it Yes that s right but the miserable story got away with me I couldn t help writing it It demanded to be written But that character that Wiki Wiki why do you make him talk so roughly Surely it will offend your readers and surely that is why the editors are justified in refusing your work Because the real Wiki Wiki would have talked that way But it is not good taste It is life he replied bluntly It is real It is true And I must write life as I see it She made no answer and for an awkward moment they sat silent It was because he loved her that he did not quite understand her and she could not understand him because he was so large that he bulked beyond her horizon Well I ve collected from the Transcontinental he said in an effort to shift the conversation to a more comfortable subject The picture of the bewhiskered trio as he had last seen them mulcted of four dollars and ninety cents and a ferry ticket made him chuckle Then you ll come she cried joyously That was what I came to find out Come he muttered absently Where Why to dinner to morrow You know you said you d recover your suit if you got that money I forgot all about it he said humbly You see this morning the poundman got Maria s two cows and the baby calf and well it happened that Maria didn t have any money and so I had to recover her cows for her That s where the Transcontinental fiver went The Ring of Bells went into the poundman s pocket Then you won t come He looked down at his clothing I can t Tears of disappointment and reproach glistened in her blue eyes but she said nothing Next Thanksgiving you ll have dinner with me in Delmonico s he said cheerily or in London or Paris or anywhere you wish I know it I saw in the paper a few days ago she announced abruptly that there had been several local appointments to the Railway Mail You passed first didn t you He was compelled to admit that the call had come for him but that he had declined it I was so sure I am so sure of myself he concluded A year from now I ll be earning more than a dozen men in the Railway Mail You wait and see Oh was all she said when he finished She stood up pulling at her gloves I must go Martin Arthur is waiting for me He took her in his arms and kissed her but she proved a passive sweetheart There was no tenseness in her body her arms did not go around him and her lips met his without their wonted pressure She was angry with him he concluded as he returned from the gate But why It was unfortunate that the poundman had gobbled Maria s cows But it was only a stroke of fate Nobody could be blamed for it Nor did it enter his head that he could have done aught otherwise than what he had done Well yes he was to blame a little was his next thought for having refused the call to the Railway Mail And she had not liked Wiki Wiki He turned at the head of the steps to meet the letter carrier on his afternoon round The ever recurrent fever of expectancy assailed Martin as he took the bundle of long envelopes One was not long It was short and thin and outside was printed the address of The New York Outview He paused in the act of tearing the envelope open It could not be an acceptance He had no manuscripts with that publication Perhaps his heart almost stood still at the wild thought perhaps they were ordering an article from him but the next instant he dismissed the surmise as hopelessly impossible It was a short formal letter signed by the office editor merely informing him that an anonymous letter which they had received was enclosed and that he could rest assured the Outview s staff never under any circumstances gave consideration to anonymous correspondence The enclosed letter Martin found to be crudely printed by hand It was a hotchpotch of illiterate abuse of Martin and of assertion that the so called Martin Eden who was selling stories to magazines was no writer at all and that in reality he was stealing stories from old magazines typing them and sending them out as his own The envelope was postmarked San Leandro Martin did not require a second thought to discover the author Higginbotham s grammar Higginbotham s colloquialisms Higginbotham s mental quirks and processes were apparent throughout Martin saw in every line not the fine Italian hand but the coarse grocer s fist of his brother in law But why he vainly questioned What injury had he done Bernard Higginbotham The thing was so unreasonable so wanton There was no explaining it In the course of the week a dozen similar letters were forwarded to Martin by the editors of various Eastern magazines The editors were behaving handsomely Martin concluded He was wholly unknown to them yet some of them had even been sympathetic It was evident that they detested anonymity He saw that the malicious attempt to hurt him had failed In fact if anything came of it it was bound to be good for at least his name had been called to the attention of a number of editors Sometime perhaps reading a submitted manuscript of his they might remember him as the fellow about whom they had received an anonymous letter And who was to say that such a remembrance might not sway the balance of their judgment just a trifle in his favor It was about this time that Martin took a great slump in Maria s estimation He found her in the kitchen one morning groaning with pain tears of weakness running down her cheeks vainly endeavoring to put through a large ironing He promptly diagnosed her affliction as La Grippe dosed her with hot whiskey the remnants in the bottles for which Brissenden was responsible and ordered her to bed But Maria was refractory The ironing had to be done she protested and delivered that night or else there would be no food on the morrow for the seven small and hungry Silvas To her astonishment and it was something that she never ceased from relating to her dying day she saw Martin Eden seize an iron from the stove and throw a fancy shirt waist on the ironing board It was Kate Flanagan s best Sunday waist than whom there was no more exacting and fastidiously dressed woman in Maria s world Also Miss Flanagan had sent special instruction that said waist must be delivered by that night As every one knew she was keeping company with John Collins the blacksmith and as Maria knew privily Miss Flanagan and mister Collins were going next day to Golden Gate Park Vain was Maria s attempt to rescue the garment Martin guided her tottering footsteps to a chair from where she watched him with bulging eyes In a quarter of the time it would have taken her she saw the shirt waist safely ironed and ironed as well as she could have done it as Martin made her grant I could work faster he explained if your irons were only hotter To her the irons he swung were much hotter than she ever dared to use Your sprinkling is all wrong he complained next Here let me teach you how to sprinkle Pressure is what s wanted Sprinkle under pressure if you want to iron fast He procured a packing case from the woodpile in the cellar fitted a cover to it and raided the scrap iron the Silva tribe was collecting for the junkman With fresh sprinkled garments in the box covered with the board and pressed by the iron the device was complete and in operation Now you watch me Maria he said stripping off to his undershirt and gripping an iron that was what he called really hot An when he feenish da iron he washa da wools as she described it afterward He say Maria you are da greata fool I showa you how to washa da wools an he shows me too Ten minutes he maka da machine one barrel one wheel hub two poles justa like dat Martin had learned the contrivance from Joe at the Shelly Hot Springs The old wheel hub fixed on the end of the upright pole constituted the plunger Making this in turn fast to the spring pole attached to the kitchen rafters so that the hub played upon the woollens in the barrel he was able with one hand thoroughly to pound them No more Maria washa da wools her story always ended I maka da kids worka da pole an da hub an da barrel Him da smarta man Mister Eden Nevertheless by his masterly operation and improvement of her kitchen laundry he fell an immense distance in her regard The glamour of romance with which her imagination had invested him faded away in the cold light of fact that he was an ex laundryman All his books and his grand friends who visited him in carriages or with countless bottles of whiskey went for naught He was after all a mere workingman a member of her own class and caste He was more human and approachable but he was no longer mystery Martin s alienation from his family continued Following upon mister Higginbotham s unprovoked attack mister Hermann von Schmidt showed his hand The fortunate sale of several storiettes some humorous verse and a few jokes gave Martin a temporary splurge of prosperity Not only did he partially pay up his bills but he had sufficient balance left to redeem his black suit and wheel The latter by virtue of a twisted crank hanger required repairing and as a matter of friendliness with his future brother in law he sent it to Von Schmidt s shop The afternoon of the same day Martin was pleased by the wheel being delivered by a small boy Von Schmidt was also inclined to be friendly was Martin s conclusion from this unusual favor Repaired wheels usually had to be called for But when he examined the wheel he discovered no repairs had been made A little later in the day he telephoned his sister s betrothed and learned that that person didn t want anything to do with him in any shape manner or form Hermann von Schmidt Martin answered cheerfully I ve a good mind to come over and punch that Dutch nose of yours You come to my shop came the reply an I ll send for the police An I ll put you through too Oh I know you but you can t make no rough house with me I don t want nothin to do with the likes of you You re a loafer that s what an I ain t asleep You ain t goin to do no spongin off me just because I m marryin your sister Why don t you go to work an earn an honest livin eh Answer me that Martin s philosophy asserted itself dissipating his anger and he hung up the receiver with a long whistle of incredulous amusement But after the amusement came the reaction and he was oppressed by his loneliness Nobody understood him nobody seemed to have any use for him except Brissenden and Brissenden had disappeared God alone knew where Twilight was falling as Martin left the fruit store and turned homeward his marketing on his arm At the corner an electric car had stopped and at sight of a lean familiar figure alighting his heart leapt with joy It was Brissenden and in the fleeting glimpse ere the car started up Martin noted the overcoat pockets one bulging with books the other bulging with a quart bottle of whiskey CHAPTER XXXV Brissenden gave no explanation of his long absence nor did Martin pry into it He was content to see his friend s cadaverous face opposite him through the steam rising from a tumbler of toddy I too have not been idle Brissenden proclaimed after hearing Martin s account of the work he had accomplished He pulled a manuscript from his inside coat pocket and passed it to Martin who looked at the title and glanced up curiously Yes that s it Brissenden laughed Pretty good title eh Ephemera it is the one word And you re responsible for it what of your man who is always the erected the vitalized inorganic the latest of the ephemera the creature of temperature strutting his little space on the thermometer It got into my head and I had to write it to get rid of it Tell me what you think of it Martin s face flushed at first paled as he read on It was perfect art Form triumphed over substance if triumph it could be called where the last conceivable atom of substance had found expression in so perfect construction as to make Martin s head swim with delight to put passionate tears into his eyes and to send chills creeping up and down his back It was a long poem of six or seven hundred lines and it was a fantastic amazing unearthly thing It was terrific impossible and yet there it was scrawled in black ink across the sheets of paper It dealt with man and his soul gropings in their ultimate terms plumbing the abysses of space for the testimony of remotest suns and rainbow spectrums It was a mad orgy of imagination wassailing in the skull of a dying man who half sobbed under his breath and was quick with the wild flutter of fading heart beats The poem swung in majestic rhythm to the cool tumult of interstellar conflict to the onset of starry hosts to the impact of cold suns and the flaming up of nebular in the darkened void and through it all unceasing and faint like a silver shuttle ran the frail piping voice of man a querulous chirp amid the screaming of planets and the crash of systems There is nothing like it in literature Martin said when at last he was able to speak It s wonderful wonderful It has gone to my head I am drunken with it That great infinitesimal question I can t shake it out of my thoughts That questing eternal ever recurring thin little wailing voice of man is still ringing in my ears It is like the dead march of a gnat amid the trumpeting of elephants and the roaring of lions It is insatiable with microscopic desire I now I m making a fool of myself but the thing has obsessed me You are I don t know what you are you are wonderful that s all But how do you do it How do you do it Martin paused from his rhapsody only to break out afresh I shall never write again I am a dauber in clay You have shown me the work of the real artificer artisan Genius This is something more than genius It transcends genius It is truth gone mad It is true man every line of it I wonder if you realize that you dogmatist Science cannot give you the lie It is the truth of the sneer stamped out from the black iron of the Cosmos and interwoven with mighty rhythms of sound into a fabric of splendor and beauty And now I won t say another word I am overwhelmed crushed Yes I will too Let me market it for you Brissenden grinned There s not a magazine in Christendom that would dare to publish it you know that I know nothing of the sort I know there s not a magazine in Christendom that wouldn t jump at it They don t get things like that every day That s no mere poem of the year It s the poem of the century I d like to take you up on the proposition Now don t get cynical Martin exhorted The magazine editors are not wholly fatuous I know that And I ll close with you on the bet I ll wager anything you want that Ephemera is accepted either on the first or second offering There s just one thing that prevents me from taking you Brissenden waited a moment The thing is big the biggest I ve ever done I know that It s my swan song I am almighty proud of it I worship it It s better than whiskey It is what I dreamed of the great and perfect thing when I was a simple young man with sweet illusions and clean ideals And I ve got it now in my last grasp and I ll not have it pawed over and soiled by a lot of swine No I won t take the bet It s mine I made it and I ve shared it with you But think of the rest of the world Martin protested The function of beauty is joy making It s my beauty Don t be selfish I m not selfish Brissenden grinned soberly in the way he had when pleased by the thing his thin lips were about to shape I m as unselfish as a famished hog In vain Martin strove to shake him from his decision Martin told him that his hatred of the magazines was rabid fanatical and that his conduct was a thousand times more despicable than that of the youth who burned the temple of Diana at Ephesus Under the storm of denunciation Brissenden complacently sipped his toddy and affirmed that everything the other said was quite true with the exception of the magazine editors His hatred of them knew no bounds and he excelled Martin in denunciation when he turned upon them I wish you d type it for me he said You know how a thousand times better than any stenographer And now I want to give you some advice He drew a bulky manuscript from his outside coat pocket Here s your Shame of the Sun I ve read it not once but twice and three times the highest compliment I can pay you After what you ve said about Ephemera I must be silent But this I will say when The Shame of the Sun is published it will make a hit It will start a controversy that will be worth thousands to you just in advertising Martin laughed I suppose your next advice will be to submit it to the magazines By all means no that is if you want to see it in print Offer it to the first class houses Some publisher s reader may be mad enough or drunk enough to report favorably on it You ve read the books The meat of them has been transmuted in the alembic of Martin Eden s mind and poured into The Shame of the Sun and one day Martin Eden will be famous and not the least of his fame will rest upon that work So you must get a publisher for it the sooner the better Brissenden went home late that night and just as he mounted the first step of the car he swung suddenly back on Martin and thrust into his hand a small tightly crumpled wad of paper Here take this he said I was out to the races to day and I had the right dope The bell clanged and the car pulled out leaving Martin wondering as to the nature of the crinkly greasy wad he clutched in his hand Back in his room he unrolled it and found a hundred dollar bill He did not scruple to use it He knew his friend had always plenty of money and he knew also with profound certitude that his success would enable him to repay it In the morning he paid every bill gave Maria three months advance on the room and redeemed every pledge at the pawnshop Next he bought Marian s wedding present and simpler presents suitable to Christmas for Ruth and Gertrude And finally on the balance remaining to him he herded the whole Silva tribe down into Oakland He was a winter late in redeeming his promise but redeemed it was for the last least Silva got a pair of shoes as well as Maria herself Also there were horns and dolls and toys of various sorts and parcels and bundles of candies and nuts that filled the arms of all the Silvas to overflowing It was with this extraordinary procession trooping at his and Maria s heels into a confectioner s in quest if the biggest candy cane ever made that he encountered Ruth and her mother missus Morse was shocked Even Ruth was hurt for she had some regard for appearances and her lover cheek by jowl with Maria at the head of that army of Portuguese ragamuffins was not a pretty sight But it was not that which hurt so much as what she took to be his lack of pride and self respect Further and keenest of all she read into the incident the impossibility of his living down his working class origin There was stigma enough in the fact of it but shamelessly to flaunt it in the face of the world her world was going too far Though her engagement to Martin had been kept secret their long intimacy had not been unproductive of gossip and in the shop glancing covertly at her lover and his following had been several of her acquaintances She lacked the easy largeness of Martin and could not rise superior to her environment She had been hurt to the quick and her sensitive nature was quivering with the shame of it So it was when Martin arrived later in the day that he kept her present in his breast pocket deferring the giving of it to a more propitious occasion Ruth in tears passionate angry tears was a revelation to him The spectacle of her suffering convinced him that he had been a brute yet in the soul of him he could not see how nor why It never entered his head to be ashamed of those he knew and to take the Silvas out to a Christmas treat could in no way so it seemed to him show lack of consideration for Ruth On the other hand he did see Ruth s point of view after she had explained it and he looked upon it as a feminine weakness such as afflicted all women and the best of women CHAPTER XXXVI Come on I ll show you the real dirt Brissenden said to him one evening in January They had dined together in San Francisco and were at the Ferry Building returning to Oakland when the whim came to him to show Martin the real dirt He turned and fled across the water front a meagre shadow in a flapping overcoat with Martin straining to keep up with him At a wholesale liquor store he bought two gallon demijohns of old port and with one in each hand boarded a Mission Street car Martin at his heels burdened with several quart bottles of whiskey If Ruth could see me now was his thought while he wondered as to what constituted the real dirt Maybe nobody will be there Brissenden said when they dismounted and plunged off to the right into the heart of the working class ghetto south of Market Street In which case you ll miss what you ve been looking for so long And what the deuce is that Martin asked Men intelligent men and not the gibbering nonentities I found you consorting with in that trader s den You read the books and you found yourself all alone Well I m going to show you to night some other men who ve read the books so that you won t be lonely any more Not that I bother my head about their everlasting discussions he said at the end of a block I m not interested in book philosophy But you ll find these fellows intelligences and not bourgeois swine But watch out they ll talk an arm off of you on any subject under the sun Hope Norton s there he panted a little later resisting Martin s effort to relieve him of the two demijohns Norton s an idealist a Harvard man Prodigious memory Idealism led him to philosophic anarchy and his family threw him off Father s a railroad president and many times millionnaire but the son s starving in Frisco editing an anarchist sheet for twenty five a month Martin was little acquainted in San Francisco and not at all south of Market so he had no idea of where he was being led Go ahead he said tell me about them beforehand What do they do for a living How do they happen to be here Hope Hamilton s there Brissenden paused and rested his hands Strawn Hamilton s his name hyphenated you know comes of old Southern stock He s a tramp laziest man I ever knew though he s clerking or trying to in a socialist cooperative store for six dollars a week But he s a confirmed hobo Tramped into town I ve seen him sit all day on a bench and never a bite pass his lips and in the evening when I invited him to dinner restaurant two blocks away have him say Too much trouble old man Buy me a package of cigarettes instead He was a Spencerian like you till Kreis turned him to materialistic monism I ll start him on monism if I can Norton s another monist only he affirms naught but spirit He can give Kreis and Hamilton all they want too Who is Kreis Martin asked His rooms we re going to One time professor fired from university usual story A mind like a steel trap Makes his living any old way I know he s been a street fakir when he was down Unscrupulous Rob a corpse of a shroud anything Difference between him and the bourgeoisie is that he robs without illusion He ll talk Nietzsche or Schopenhauer or Kant or anything but the only thing in this world not excepting Mary that he really cares for is his monism Haeckel is his little tin god The only way to insult him is to take a slap at Haeckel Here s the hang out Brissenden rested his demijohn at the upstairs entrance preliminary to the climb It was the usual two story corner building with a saloon and grocery underneath The gang lives here got the whole upstairs to themselves But Kreis is the only one who has two rooms Come on No lights burned in the upper hall but Brissenden threaded the utter blackness like a familiar ghost He stopped to speak to Martin There s one fellow Stevens a theosophist Makes a pretty tangle when he gets going Just now he s dish washer in a restaurant Likes a good cigar I ve seen him eat in a ten cent hash house and pay fifty cents for the cigar he smoked afterward I ve got a couple in my pocket for him if he shows up And there s another fellow Parry an Australian a statistician and a sporting encyclopaedia Ask him the grain output of Paraguay for nineteen oh three or the English importation of sheetings into China for eighteen ninety or at what weight Jimmy Britt fought Battling Nelson or who was welter weight champion of the United States in sixty eight and you ll get the correct answer with the automatic celerity of a slot machine And there s Andy a stone mason has ideas on everything a good chess player and another fellow Harry a baker red hot socialist and strong union man By the way you remember Cooks and Waiters strike Hamilton was the chap who organized that union and precipitated the strike planned it all out in advance right here in Kreis s rooms Did it just for the fun of it but was too lazy to stay by the union Yet he could have risen high if he wanted to There s no end to the possibilities in that man if he weren t so insuperably lazy Brissenden advanced through the darkness till a thread of light marked the threshold of a door A knock and an answer opened it and Martin found himself shaking hands with Kreis a handsome brunette man with dazzling white teeth a drooping black mustache and large flashing black eyes Mary a matronly young blonde was washing dishes in the little back room that served for kitchen and dining room The front room served as bedchamber and living room Overhead was the week s washing hanging in festoons so low that Martin did not see at first the two men talking in a corner They hailed Brissenden and his demijohns with acclamation and on being introduced Martin learned they were Andy and Parry He joined them and listened attentively to the description of a prize fight Parry had seen the night before while Brissenden in his glory plunged into the manufacture of a toddy and the serving of wine and whiskey and sodas At his command Bring in the clan Andy departed to go the round of the rooms for the lodgers We re lucky that most of them are here Brissenden whispered to Martin There s Norton and Hamilton come on and meet them Stevens isn t around I hear I m going to get them started on monism if I can Wait till they get a few jolts in them and they ll warm up At first the conversation was desultory Nevertheless Martin could not fail to appreciate the keen play of their minds They were men with opinions though the opinions often clashed and though they were witty and clever they were not superficial He swiftly saw no matter upon what they talked that each man applied the correlation of knowledge and had also a deep seated and unified conception of society and the Cosmos Nobody manufactured their opinions for them they were all rebels of one variety or another and their lips were strangers to platitudes Never had Martin at the Morses heard so amazing a range of topics discussed There seemed no limit save time to the things they were alive to The talk wandered from missus Humphry Ward s new book to Shaw s latest play through the future of the drama to reminiscences of Mansfield They appreciated or sneered at the morning editorials jumped from labor conditions in New Zealand to Henry James and Brander Matthews passed on to the German designs in the Far East and the economic aspect of the Yellow Peril wrangled over the German elections and Bebel s last speech and settled down to local politics the latest plans and scandals in the union labor party administration and the wires that were pulled to bring about the Coast Seamen s strike Martin was struck by the inside knowledge they possessed They knew what was never printed in the newspapers the wires and strings and the hidden hands that made the puppets dance To Martin s surprise the girl Mary joined in the conversation displaying an intelligence he had never encountered in the few women he had met They talked together on Swinburne and Rossetti after which she led him beyond his depth into the by paths of French literature His revenge came when she defended Maeterlinck and he brought into action the carefully thought out thesis of The Shame of the Sun Several other men had dropped in and the air was thick with tobacco smoke when Brissenden waved the red flag Here s fresh meat for your axe Kreis he said a rose white youth with the ardor of a lover for Herbert Spencer Make a Haeckelite of him if you can Kreis seemed to wake up and flash like some metallic magnetic thing while Norton looked at Martin sympathetically with a sweet girlish smile as much as to say that he would be amply protected Kreis began directly on Martin but step by step Norton interfered until he and Kreis were off and away in a personal battle Martin listened and fain would have rubbed his eyes It was impossible that this should be much less in the labor ghetto south of Market The books were alive in these men They talked with fire and enthusiasm the intellectual stimulant stirring them as he had seen drink and anger stir other men What he heard was no longer the philosophy of the dry printed word written by half mythical demigods like Kant and Spencer It was living philosophy with warm red blood incarnated in these two men till its very features worked with excitement Now and again other men joined in and all followed the discussion with cigarettes going out in their hands and with alert intent faces Idealism had never attracted Martin but the exposition it now received at the hands of Norton was a revelation The logical plausibility of it that made an appeal to his intellect seemed missed by Kreis and Hamilton who sneered at Norton as a metaphysician and who in turn sneered back at them as metaphysicians Phenomenon and noumenon were bandied back and forth They charged him with attempting to explain consciousness by itself He charged them with word jugglery with reasoning from words to theory instead of from facts to theory At this they were aghast It was the cardinal tenet of their mode of reasoning to start with facts and to give names to the facts When Norton wandered into the intricacies of Kant Kreis reminded him that all good little German philosophies when they died went to Oxford A little later Norton reminded them of Hamilton s Law of Parsimony the application of which they immediately claimed for every reasoning process of theirs And Martin hugged his knees and exulted in it all But Norton was no Spencerian and he too strove for Martin s philosophic soul talking as much at him as to his two opponents You know Berkeley has never been answered he said looking directly at Martin Herbert Spencer came the nearest which was not very near Even the stanchest of Spencer s followers will not go farther I was reading an essay of Saleeby s the other day and the best Saleeby could say was that Herbert Spencer nearly succeeded in answering Berkeley You know what Hume said Hamilton asked Norton nodded but Hamilton gave it for the benefit of the rest He said that Berkeley s arguments admit of no answer and produce no conviction In his Hume s mind was the reply And Hume s mind was the same as yours with this difference he was wise enough to admit there was no answering Berkeley Norton was sensitive and excitable though he never lost his head while Kreis and Hamilton were like a pair of cold blooded savages seeking out tender places to prod and poke As the evening grew late Norton smarting under the repeated charges of being a metaphysician clutching his chair to keep from jumping to his feet his gray eyes snapping and his girlish face grown harsh and sure made a grand attack upon their position All right you Haeckelites I may reason like a medicine man but pray how do you reason You have nothing to stand on you unscientific dogmatists with your positive science which you are always lugging about into places it has no right to be Long before the school of materialistic monism arose the ground was removed so that there could be no foundation Locke was the man John Locke Two hundred years ago more than that even in his Essay concerning the Human Understanding he proved the non existence of innate ideas The best of it is that that is precisely what you claim To night again and again you have asserted the non existence of innate ideas And what does that mean It means that you can never know ultimate reality Your brains are empty when you are born Appearances or phenomena are all the content your minds can receive from your five senses Then noumena which are not in your minds when you are born have no way of getting in I deny Kreis started to interrupt You wait till I m done Norton shouted You can know only that much of the play and interplay of force and matter as impinges in one way or another on our senses You see I am willing to admit for the sake of the argument that matter exists and what I am about to do is to efface you by your own argument I can t do it any other way for you are both congenitally unable to understand a philosophic abstraction And now what do you know of matter according to your own positive science You know it only by its phenomena its appearances You are aware only of its changes or of such changes in it as cause changes in your consciousness Positive science deals only with phenomena yet you are foolish enough to strive to be ontologists and to deal with noumena Yet by the very definition of positive science science is concerned only with appearances As somebody has said phenomenal knowledge cannot transcend phenomena You cannot answer Berkeley even if you have annihilated Kant and yet perforce you assume that Berkeley is wrong when you affirm that science proves the non existence of God or as much to the point the existence of matter You know I granted the reality of matter only in order to make myself intelligible to your understanding Be positive scientists if you please but ontology has no place in positive science so leave it alone Spencer is right in his agnosticism but if Spencer But it was time to catch the last ferry boat for Oakland and Brissenden and Martin slipped out leaving Norton still talking and Kreis and Hamilton waiting to pounce on him like a pair of hounds as soon as he finished You have given me a glimpse of fairyland Martin said on the ferry boat It makes life worth while to meet people like that My mind is all worked up I never appreciated idealism before Yet I can t accept it I know that I shall always be a realist I am so made I guess But I d like to have made a reply to Kreis and Hamilton and I think I d have had a word or two for Norton I didn t see that Spencer was damaged any I m as excited as a child on its first visit to the circus I see I must read up some more I m going to get hold of Saleeby I still think Spencer is unassailable and next time I m going to take a hand myself But Brissenden breathing painfully had dropped off to sleep his chin buried in a scarf and resting on his sunken chest his body wrapped in the long overcoat and shaking to the vibration of the propellers CHAPTER XXXVII The first thing Martin did next morning was to go counter both to Brissenden s advice and command The Shame of the Sun he wrapped and mailed to The Acropolis He believed he could find magazine publication for it and he felt that recognition by the magazines would commend him to the book publishing houses Ephemera he likewise wrapped and mailed to a magazine Despite Brissenden s prejudice against the magazines which was a pronounced mania with him Martin decided that the great poem should see print He did not intend however to publish it without the other s permission His plan was to get it accepted by one of the high magazines and thus armed again to wrestle with Brissenden for consent Martin began that morning a story which he had sketched out a number of weeks before and which ever since had been worrying him with its insistent clamor to be created Apparently it was to be a rattling sea story a tale of twentieth century adventure and romance handling real characters in a real world under real conditions But beneath the swing and go of the story was to be something else something that the superficial reader would never discern and which on the other hand would not diminish in any way the interest and enjoyment for such a reader It was this and not the mere story that impelled Martin to write it For that matter it was always the great universal motif that suggested plots to him After having found such a motif he cast about for the particular persons and particular location in time and space wherewith and wherein to utter the universal thing Overdue was the title he had decided for it and its length he believed would not be more than sixty thousand words a bagatelle for him with his splendid vigor of production On this first day he took hold of it with conscious delight in the mastery of his tools He no longer worried for fear that the sharp cutting edges should slip and mar his work The long months of intense application and study had brought their reward He could now devote himself with sure hand to the larger phases of the thing he shaped and as he worked hour after hour he felt as never before the sure and cosmic grasp with which he held life and the affairs of life Overdue would tell a story that would be true of its particular characters and its particular events but it would tell too he was confident great vital things that would be true of all time and all sea and all life thanks to Herbert Spencer he thought leaning back for a moment from the table Ay thanks to Herbert Spencer and to the master key of life evolution which Spencer had placed in his hands He was conscious that it was great stuff he was writing It will go It will go was the refrain that kept sounding in his ears Of course it would go At last he was turning out the thing at which the magazines would jump The whole story worked out before him in lightning flashes He broke off from it long enough to write a paragraph in his note book This would be the last paragraph in Overdue but so thoroughly was the whole book already composed in his brain that he could write weeks before he had arrived at the end the end itself He compared the tale as yet unwritten with the tales of the sea writers and he felt it to be immeasurably superior There s only one man who could touch it he murmured aloud and that s Conrad And it ought to make even him sit up and shake hands with me and say Well done Martin my boy He toiled on all day recollecting at the last moment that he was to have dinner at the Morses Thanks to Brissenden his black suit was out of pawn and he was again eligible for dinner parties Down town he stopped off long enough to run into the library and search for Saleeby s books He drew out The Cycle of Life and on the car turned to the essay Norton had mentioned on Spencer As Martin read he grew angry His face flushed his jaw set and unconsciously his hand clenched unclenched and clenched again as if he were taking fresh grips upon some hateful thing out of which he was squeezing the life When he left the car he strode along the sidewalk as a wrathful man will stride and he rang the Morse bell with such viciousness that it roused him to consciousness of his condition so that he entered in good nature smiling with amusement at himself No sooner however was he inside than a great depression descended upon him He fell from the height where he had been up borne all day on the wings of inspiration Bourgeois trader s den Brissenden s epithets repeated themselves in his mind But what of that he demanded angrily He was marrying Ruth not her family It seemed to him that he had never seen Ruth more beautiful more spiritual and ethereal and at the same time more healthy There was color in her cheeks and her eyes drew him again and again the eyes in which he had first read immortality He had forgotten immortality of late and the trend of his scientific reading had been away from it but here in Ruth s eyes he read an argument without words that transcended all worded arguments He saw that in her eyes before which all discussion fled away for he saw love there And in his own eyes was love and love was unanswerable Such was his passionate doctrine The half hour he had with her before they went in to dinner left him supremely happy and supremely satisfied with life Nevertheless at table the inevitable reaction and exhaustion consequent upon the hard day seized hold of him He was aware that his eyes were tired and that he was irritable He remembered it was at this table at which he now sneered and was so often bored that he had first eaten with civilized beings in what he had imagined was an atmosphere of high culture and refinement He caught a glimpse of that pathetic figure of him so long ago a self conscious savage sprouting sweat at every pore in an agony of apprehension puzzled by the bewildering minutiae of eating implements tortured by the ogre of a servant striving at a leap to live at such dizzy social altitude and deciding in the end to be frankly himself pretending no knowledge and no polish he did not possess He glanced at Ruth for reassurance much in the same manner that a passenger with sudden panic thought of possible shipwreck will strive to locate the life preservers Well that much had come out of it love and Ruth All the rest had failed to stand the test of the books But Ruth and love had stood the test for them he found a biological sanction Love was the most exalted expression of life Nature had been busy designing him as she had been busy with all normal men for the purpose of loving She had spent ten thousand centuries ay a hundred thousand and a million centuries upon the task and he was the best she could do She had made love the strongest thing in him increased its power a myriad per cent with her gift of imagination and sent him forth into the ephemera to thrill and melt and mate His hand sought Ruth s hand beside him hidden by the table and a warm pressure was given and received She looked at him a swift instant and her eyes were radiant and melting So were his in the thrill that pervaded him nor did he realize how much that was radiant and melting in her eyes had been aroused by what she had seen in his Across the table from him cater cornered at mister Morse s right sat Judge Blount a local superior court judge Martin had met him a number of times and had failed to like him He and Ruth s father were discussing labor union politics the local situation and socialism and mister Morse was endeavoring to twit Martin on the latter topic At last Judge Blount looked across the table with benignant and fatherly pity Martin smiled to himself You ll grow out of it young man he said soothingly Time is the best cure for such youthful distempers He turned to mister Morse I do not believe discussion is good in such cases It makes the patient obstinate That is true the other assented gravely But it is well to warn the patient occasionally of his condition Martin laughed merrily but it was with an effort The day had been too long the day s effort too intense and he was deep in the throes of the reaction Undoubtedly you are both excellent doctors he said but if you care a whit for the opinion of the patient let him tell you that you are poor diagnosticians In fact you are both suffering from the disease you think you find in me As for me I am immune The socialist philosophy that riots half baked in your veins has passed me by Clever clever murmured the judge An excellent ruse in controversy to reverse positions Out of your mouth Martin s eyes were sparkling but he kept control of himself You see Judge I ve heard your campaign speeches By some henidical process henidical by the way is a favorite word of mine which nobody understands by some henidical process you persuade yourself that you believe in the competitive system and the survival of the strong and at the same time you indorse with might and main all sorts of measures to shear the strength from the strong My young man Remember I ve heard your campaign speeches Martin warned It s on record your position on interstate commerce regulation on regulation of the railway trust and Standard Oil on the conservation of the forests on a thousand and one restrictive measures that are nothing else than socialistic Do you mean to tell me that you do not believe in regulating these various outrageous exercises of power That s not the point I mean to tell you that you are a poor diagnostician I mean to tell you that I am not suffering from the microbe of socialism I mean to tell you that it is you who are suffering from the emasculating ravages of that same microbe As for me I am an inveterate opponent of socialism just as I am an inveterate opponent of your own mongrel democracy that is nothing else than pseudo socialism masquerading under a garb of words that will not stand the test of the dictionary I am a reactionary so complete a reactionary that my position is incomprehensible to you who live in a veiled lie of social organization and whose sight is not keen enough to pierce the veil You make believe that you believe in the survival of the strong and the rule of the strong I believe That is the difference When I was a trifle younger a few months younger I believed the same thing You see the ideas of you and yours had impressed me But merchants and traders are cowardly rulers at best they grunt and grub all their days in the trough of money getting and I have swung back to aristocracy if you please I am the only individualist in this room I look to the state for nothing I look only to the strong man the man on horseback to save the state from its own rotten futility Nietzsche was right I won t take the time to tell you who Nietzsche was but he was right The world belongs to the strong to the strong who are noble as well and who do not wallow in the swine trough of trade and exchange The world belongs to the true nobleman to the great blond beasts to the noncompromisers to the yes sayers And they will eat you up you socialists who are afraid of socialism and who think yourselves individualists Your slave morality of the meek and lowly will never save you Oh it s all Greek I know and I won t bother you any more with it But remember one thing There aren t half a dozen individualists in Oakland but Martin Eden is one of them He signified that he was done with the discussion and turned to Ruth I m wrought up to day he said in an undertone All I want to do is to love not talk He ignored mister Morse who said I am unconvinced All socialists are Jesuits That is the way to tell them We ll make a good Republican out of you yet said Judge Blount The man on horseback will arrive before that time Martin retorted with good humor and returned to Ruth But mister Morse was not content He did not like the laziness and the disinclination for sober legitimate work of this prospective son in law of his for whose ideas he had no respect and of whose nature he had no understanding So he turned the conversation to Herbert Spencer Judge Blount ably seconded him and Martin whose ears had pricked at the first mention of the philosopher s name listened to the judge enunciate a grave and complacent diatribe against Spencer From time to time mister Morse glanced at Martin as much as to say There my boy you see Chattering daws Martin muttered under his breath and went on talking with Ruth and Arthur But the long day and the real dirt of the night before were telling upon him and besides still in his burnt mind was what had made him angry when he read it on the car What is the matter Ruth asked suddenly alarmed by the effort he was making to contain himself There is no god but the Unknowable and Herbert Spencer is its prophet Judge Blount was saying at that moment Martin turned upon him A cheap judgment he remarked quietly I heard it first in the City Hall Park on the lips of a workingman who ought to have known better I have heard it often since and each time the clap trap of it nauseates me You ought to be ashamed of yourself To hear that great and noble man s name upon your lips is like finding a dew drop in a cesspool You are disgusting It was like a thunderbolt Judge Blount glared at him with apoplectic countenance and silence reigned mister Morse was secretly pleased He could see that his daughter was shocked It was what he wanted to do to bring out the innate ruffianism of this man he did not like Ruth s hand sought Martin s beseechingly under the table but his blood was up He was inflamed by the intellectual pretence and fraud of those who sat in the high places A Superior Court Judge It was only several years before that he had looked up from the mire at such glorious entities and deemed them gods Judge Blount recovered himself and attempted to go on addressing himself to Martin with an assumption of politeness that the latter understood was for the benefit of the ladies Even this added to his anger Was there no honesty in the world You can t discuss Spencer with me he cried You do not know any more about Spencer than do his own countrymen But it is no fault of yours I grant It is just a phase of the contemptible ignorance of the times I ran across a sample of it on my way here this evening I was reading an essay by Saleeby on Spencer You should read it It is accessible to all men You can buy it in any book store or draw it from the public library You would feel ashamed of your paucity of abuse and ignorance of that noble man compared with what Saleeby has collected on the subject It is a record of shame that would shame your shame The philosopher of the half educated he was called by an academic Philosopher who was not worthy to pollute the atmosphere he breathed I don t think you have read ten pages of Spencer but there have been critics assumably more intelligent than you who have read no more than you of Spencer who publicly challenged his followers to adduce one single idea from all his writings from Herbert Spencer s writings the man who has impressed the stamp of his genius over the whole field of scientific research and modern thought the father of psychology the man who revolutionized pedagogy so that to day the child of the French peasant is taught the three R s according to principles laid down by him And the little gnats of men sting his memory when they get their very bread and butter from the technical application of his ideas What little of worth resides in their brains is largely due to him It is certain that had he never lived most of what is correct in their parrot learned knowledge would be absent And yet a man like Principal Fairbanks of Oxford a man who sits in an even higher place than you Judge Blount has said that Spencer will be dismissed by posterity as a poet and dreamer rather than a thinker Yappers and blatherskites the whole brood of them First Principles is not wholly destitute of a certain literary power said one of them And others of them have said that he was an industrious plodder rather than an original thinker Yappers and blatherskites Yappers and blatherskites Martin ceased abruptly in a dead silence Everybody in Ruth s family looked up to Judge Blount as a man of power and achievement and they were horrified at Martin s outbreak The remainder of the dinner passed like a funeral the judge and mister Morse confining their talk to each other and the rest of the conversation being extremely desultory Then afterward when Ruth and Martin were alone there was a scene You are unbearable she wept But his anger still smouldered and he kept muttering The beasts The beasts When she averred he had insulted the judge he retorted By telling the truth about him I don t care whether it was true or not she insisted There are certain bounds of decency and you had no license to insult anybody Then where did Judge Blount get the license to assault truth Martin demanded Surely to assault truth is a more serious misdemeanor than to insult a pygmy personality such as the judge s He did worse than that He blackened the name of a great noble man who is dead Oh the beasts The beasts His complex anger flamed afresh and Ruth was in terror of him Never had she seen him so angry and it was all mystified and unreasonable to her comprehension And yet through her very terror ran the fibres of fascination that had drawn and that still drew her to him that had compelled her to lean towards him and in that mad culminating moment lay her hands upon his neck She was hurt and outraged by what had taken place and yet she lay in his arms and quivered while he went on muttering The beasts The beasts And she still lay there when he said I ll not bother your table again dear They do not like me and it is wrong of me to thrust my objectionable presence upon them Besides they are just as objectionable to me Faugh They are sickening And to think of it I dreamed in my innocence that the persons who sat in the high places who lived in fine houses and had educations and bank accounts were worth while CHAPTER XXXVIII Come on let s go down to the local So spoke Brissenden faint from a hemorrhage of half an hour before the second hemorrhage in three days The perennial whiskey glass was in his hands and he drained it with shaking fingers What do I want with socialism Martin demanded Outsiders are allowed five minute speeches the sick man urged Get up and spout Tell them why you don t want socialism Tell them what you think about them and their ghetto ethics Slam Nietzsche into them and get walloped for your pains Make a scrap of it It will do them good Discussion is what they want and what you want too You see I d like to see you a socialist before I m gone It will give you a sanction for your existence It is the one thing that will save you in the time of disappointment that is coming to you I never can puzzle out why you of all men are a socialist Martin pondered You detest the crowd so Surely there is nothing in the canaille to recommend it to your aesthetic soul He pointed an accusing finger at the whiskey glass which the other was refilling Socialism doesn t seem to save you I m very sick was the answer With you it is different You have health and much to live for and you must be handcuffed to life somehow As for me you wonder why I am a socialist I ll tell you It is because Socialism is inevitable because the present rotten and irrational system cannot endure because the day is past for your man on horseback The slaves won t stand for it They are too many and willy nilly they ll drag down the would be equestrian before ever he gets astride You can t get away from them and you ll have to swallow the whole slave morality It s not a nice mess I ll allow But it s been a brewing and swallow it you must You are antediluvian anyway with your Nietzsche ideas The past is past and the man who says history repeats itself is a liar Of course I don t like the crowd but what s a poor chap to do We can t have the man on horseback and anything is preferable to the timid swine that now rule But come on anyway I m loaded to the guards now and if I sit here any longer I ll get drunk And you know the doctor says damn the doctor I ll fool him yet It was Sunday night and they found the small hall packed by the Oakland socialists chiefly members of the working class The speaker a clever Jew won Martin s admiration at the same time that he aroused his antagonism The man s stooped and narrow shoulders and weazened chest proclaimed him the true child of the crowded ghetto and strong on Martin was the age long struggle of the feeble wretched slaves against the lordly handful of men who had ruled over them and would rule over them to the end of time To Martin this withered wisp of a creature was a symbol He was the figure that stood forth representative of the whole miserable mass of weaklings and inefficients who perished according to biological law on the ragged confines of life They were the unfit In spite of their cunning philosophy and of their antlike proclivities for cooperation Nature rejected them for the exceptional man Out of the plentiful spawn of life she flung from her prolific hand she selected only the best It was by the same method that men aping her bred race horses and cucumbers Doubtless a creator of a Cosmos could have devised a better method but creatures of this particular Cosmos must put up with this particular method Of course they could squirm as they perished as the socialists squirmed as the speaker on the platform and the perspiring crowd were squirming even now as they counselled together for some new device with which to minimize the penalties of living and outwit the Cosmos So Martin thought and so he spoke when Brissenden urged him to give them hell He obeyed the mandate walking up to the platform as was the custom and addressing the chairman He began in a low voice haltingly forming into order the ideas which had surged in his brain while the Jew was speaking In such meetings five minutes was the time allotted to each speaker but when Martin s five minutes were up he was in full stride his attack upon their doctrines but half completed He had caught their interest and the audience urged the chairman by acclamation to extend Martin s time They appreciated him as a foeman worthy of their intellect and they listened intently following every word He spoke with fire and conviction mincing no words in his attack upon the slaves and their morality and tactics and frankly alluding to his hearers as the slaves in question He quoted Spencer and Malthus and enunciated the biological law of development And so he concluded in a swift resume no state composed of the slave types can endure The old law of development still holds In the struggle for existence as I have shown the strong and the progeny of the strong tend to survive while the weak and the progeny of the weak are crushed and tend to perish The result is that the strong and the progeny of the strong survive and so long as the struggle obtains the strength of each generation increases That is development But you slaves it is too bad to be slaves I grant but you slaves dream of a society where the law of development will be annulled where no weaklings and inefficients will perish where every inefficient will have as much as he wants to eat as many times a day as he desires and where all will marry and have progeny the weak as well as the strong What will be the result No longer will the strength and life value of each generation increase On the contrary it will diminish There is the Nemesis of your slave philosophy Your society of slaves of by and for slaves must inevitably weaken and go to pieces as the life which composes it weakens and goes to pieces Remember I am enunciating biology and not sentimental ethics No state of slaves can stand How about the United States a man yelled from the audience And how about it Martin retorted The thirteen colonies threw off their rulers and formed the Republic so called The slaves were their own masters There were no more masters of the sword But you couldn t get along without masters of some sort and there arose a new set of masters not the great virile noble men but the shrewd and spidery traders and money lenders And they enslaved you over again but not frankly as the true noble men would do with weight of their own right arms but secretly by spidery machinations and by wheedling and cajolery and lies They have purchased your slave judges they have debauched your slave legislatures and they have forced to worse horrors than chattel slavery your slave boys and girls Two million of your children are toiling to day in this trader oligarchy of the United States Ten millions of you slaves are not properly sheltered nor properly fed But to return I have shown that no society of slaves can endure because in its very nature such society must annul the law of development No sooner can a slave society be organized than deterioration sets in It is easy for you to talk of annulling the law of development but where is the new law of development that will maintain your strength Formulate it Is it already formulated Then state it Martin took his seat amidst an uproar of voices A score of men were on their feet clamoring for recognition from the chair And one by one encouraged by vociferous applause speaking with fire and enthusiasm and excited gestures they replied to the attack It was a wild night but it was wild intellectually a battle of ideas Some strayed from the point but most of the speakers replied directly to Martin They shook him with lines of thought that were new to him and gave him insights not into new biological laws but into new applications of the old laws They were too earnest to be always polite and more than once the chairman rapped and pounded for order It chanced that a cub reporter sat in the audience detailed there on a day dull of news and impressed by the urgent need of journalism for sensation He was not a bright cub reporter He was merely facile and glib He was too dense to follow the discussion In fact he had a comfortable feeling that he was vastly superior to these wordy maniacs of the working class Also he had a great respect for those who sat in the high places and dictated the policies of nations and newspapers Further he had an ideal namely of achieving that excellence of the perfect reporter who is able to make something even a great deal out of nothing He did not know what all the talk was about It was not necessary Words like revolution gave him his cue Like a paleontologist able to reconstruct an entire skeleton from one fossil bone he was able to reconstruct a whole speech from the one word revolution He did it that night and he did it well and since Martin had made the biggest stir he put it all into his mouth and made him the arch anarch of the show transforming his reactionary individualism into the most lurid red shirt socialist utterance The cub reporter was an artist and it was a large brush with which he laid on the local color wild eyed long haired men neurasthenia and degenerate types of men voices shaken with passion clenched fists raised on high and all projected against a background of oaths yells and the throaty rumbling of angry men CHAPTER XXXIX Over the coffee in his little room Martin read next morning s paper It was a novel experience to find himself head lined on the first page at that and he was surprised to learn that he was the most notorious leader of the Oakland socialists He ran over the violent speech the cub reporter had constructed for him and though at first he was angered by the fabrication in the end he tossed the paper aside with a laugh Either the man was drunk or criminally malicious he said that afternoon from his perch on the bed when Brissenden had arrived and dropped limply into the one chair But what do you care Brissenden asked Surely you don t desire the approval of the bourgeois swine that read the newspapers Martin thought for a while then said No I really don t care for their approval not a whit On the other hand it s very likely to make my relations with Ruth s family a trifle awkward Her father always contended I was a socialist and this miserable stuff will clinch his belief Not that I care for his opinion but what s the odds I want to read you what I ve been doing to day It s Overdue of course and I m just about halfway through He was reading aloud when Maria thrust open the door and ushered in a young man in a natty suit who glanced briskly about him noting the oil burner and the kitchen in the corner before his gaze wandered on to Martin Sit down Brissenden said Martin made room for the young man on the bed and waited for him to broach his business I heard you speak last night mister Eden and I ve come to interview you he began Brissenden burst out in a hearty laugh A brother socialist the reporter asked with a quick glance at Brissenden that appraised the color value of that cadaverous and dying man And he wrote that report Martin said softly Why he is only a boy Why don t you poke him Brissenden asked I d give a thousand dollars to have my lungs back for five minutes The cub reporter was a trifle perplexed by this talking over him and around him and at him But he had been commended for his brilliant description of the socialist meeting and had further been detailed to get a personal interview with Martin Eden the leader of the organized menace to society You do not object to having your picture taken mister Eden he said I ve a staff photographer outside you see and he says it will be better to take you right away before the sun gets lower Then we can have the interview afterward A photographer Brissenden said meditatively Poke him Martin Poke him I guess I m getting old was the answer I know I ought but I really haven t the heart It doesn t seem to matter For his mother s sake Brissenden urged It s worth considering Martin replied but it doesn t seem worth while enough to rouse sufficient energy in me You see it does take energy to give a fellow a poking Besides what does it matter That s right that s the way to take it the cub announced airily though he had already begun to glance anxiously at the door But it wasn t true not a word of what he wrote Martin went on confining his attention to Brissenden It was just in a general way a description you understand the cub ventured and besides it s good advertising That s what counts It was a favor to you It s good advertising Martin old boy Brissenden repeated solemnly And it was a favor to me think of that was Martin s contribution Let me see where were you born mister Eden the cub asked assuming an air of expectant attention He doesn t take notes said Brissenden He remembers it all That is sufficient for me The cub was trying not to look worried No decent reporter needs to bother with notes That was sufficient for last night But Brissenden was not a disciple of quietism and he changed his attitude abruptly Martin if you don t poke him I ll do it myself if I fall dead on the floor the next moment How will a spanking do Martin asked Brissenden considered judicially and nodded his head The next instant Martin was seated on the edge of the bed with the cub face downward across his knees Now don t bite Martin warned or else I ll have to punch your face It would be a pity for it is such a pretty face His uplifted hand descended and thereafter rose and fell in a swift and steady rhythm The cub struggled and cursed and squirmed but did not offer to bite Brissenden looked on gravely though once he grew excited and gripped the whiskey bottle pleading Here just let me swat him once Sorry my hand played out Martin said when at last he desisted It is quite numb He uprighted the cub and perched him on the bed I ll have you arrested for this he snarled tears of boyish indignation running down his flushed cheeks I ll make you sweat for this You ll see The pretty thing Martin remarked He doesn t realize that he has entered upon the downward path It is not honest it is not square it is not manly to tell lies about one s fellow creatures the way he has done and he doesn t know it He has to come to us to be told Brissenden filled in a pause Yes to me whom he has maligned and injured My grocery will undoubtedly refuse me credit now The worst of it is that the poor boy will keep on this way until he deteriorates into a first class newspaper man and also a first class scoundrel But there is yet time quoth Brissenden Who knows but what you may prove the humble instrument to save him Why didn t you let me swat him just once I d like to have had a hand in it I ll have you arrested the pair of you you b b big brutes sobbed the erring soul No his mouth is too pretty and too weak Martin shook his head lugubriously I m afraid I ve numbed my hand in vain The young man cannot reform He will become eventually a very great and successful newspaper man He has no conscience That alone will make him great With that the cub passed out the door in trepidation to the last for fear that Brissenden would hit him in the back with the bottle he still clutched In the next morning s paper Martin learned a great deal more about himself that was new to him We are the sworn enemies of society he found himself quoted as saying in a column interview No we are not anarchists but socialists When the reporter pointed out to him that there seemed little difference between the two schools Martin had shrugged his shoulders in silent affirmation His face was described as bilaterally asymmetrical and various other signs of degeneration were described Especially notable were his thuglike hands and the fiery gleams in his blood shot eyes He learned also that he spoke nightly to the workmen in the City Hall Park and that among the anarchists and agitators that there inflamed the minds of the people he drew the largest audiences and made the most revolutionary speeches The cub painted a high light picture of his poor little room its oil stove and the one chair and of the death s head tramp who kept him company and who looked as if he had just emerged from twenty years of solitary confinement in some fortress dungeon The cub had been industrious He had scurried around and nosed out Martin s family history and procured a photograph of Higginbotham s Cash Store with Bernard Higginbotham himself standing out in front That gentleman was depicted as an intelligent dignified businessman who had no patience with his brother in law s socialistic views and no patience with the brother in law either whom he was quoted as characterizing as a lazy good for nothing who wouldn t take a job when it was offered to him and who would go to jail yet Hermann Von Schmidt Marian s husband had likewise been interviewed He had called Martin the black sheep of the family and repudiated him He tried to sponge off of me but I put a stop to that good and quick Von Schmidt had said to the reporter He knows better than to come bumming around here A man who won t work is no good take that from me This time Martin was genuinely angry Brissenden looked upon the affair as a good joke but he could not console Martin who knew that it would be no easy task to explain to Ruth As for her father he knew that he must be overjoyed with what had happened and that he would make the most of it to break off the engagement How much he would make of it he was soon to realize The afternoon mail brought a letter from Ruth Martin opened it with a premonition of disaster and read it standing at the open door when he had received it from the postman As he read mechanically his hand sought his pocket for the tobacco and brown paper of his old cigarette days He was not aware that the pocket was empty or that he had even reached for the materials with which to roll a cigarette It was not a passionate letter There were no touches of anger in it But all the way through from the first sentence to the last was sounded the note of hurt and disappointment She had expected better of him She had thought he had got over his youthful wildness that her love for him had been sufficiently worth while to enable him to live seriously and decently And now her father and mother had taken a firm stand and commanded that the engagement be broken That they were justified in this she could not but admit Their relation could never be a happy one It had been unfortunate from the first But one regret she voiced in the whole letter and it was a bitter one to Martin If only you had settled down to some position and attempted to make something of yourself she wrote But it was not to be Your past life had been too wild and irregular I can understand that you are not to be blamed You could act only according to your nature and your early training So I do not blame you Martin Please remember that It was simply a mistake As father and mother have contended we were not made for each other and we should both be happy because it was discovered not too late There is no use trying to see me she said toward the last It would be an unhappy meeting for both of us as well as for my mother I feel as it is that I have caused her great pain and worry I shall have to do much living to atone for it He read it through to the end carefully a second time then sat down and replied He outlined the remarks he had uttered at the socialist meeting pointing out that they were in all ways the converse of what the newspaper had put in his mouth Toward the end of the letter he was God s own lover pleading passionately for love Please answer he said and in your answer you have to tell me but one thing Do you love me That is all the answer to that one question But no answer came the next day nor the next Overdue lay untouched upon the table and each day the heap of returned manuscripts under the table grew larger For the first time Martin s glorious sleep was interrupted by insomnia and he tossed through long restless nights Three times he called at the Morse home but was turned away by the servant who answered the bell Brissenden lay sick in his hotel too feeble to stir out and though Martin was with him often he did not worry him with his troubles For Martin s troubles were many The aftermath of the cub reporter s deed was even wider than Martin had anticipated The Portuguese grocer refused him further credit while the greengrocer who was an American and proud of it had called him a traitor to his country and refused further dealings with him carrying his patriotism to such a degree that he cancelled Martin s account and forbade him ever to attempt to pay it The talk in the neighborhood reflected the same feeling and indignation against Martin ran high No one would have anything to do with a socialist traitor Poor Maria was dubious and frightened but she remained loyal The children of the neighborhood recovered from the awe of the grand carriage which once had visited Martin and from safe distances they called him hobo and bum The Silva tribe however stanchly defended him fighting more than one pitched battle for his honor and black eyes and bloody noses became quite the order of the day and added to Maria s perplexities and troubles Once Martin met Gertrude on the street down in Oakland and learned what he knew could not be otherwise that Bernard Higginbotham was furious with him for having dragged the family into public disgrace and that he had forbidden him the house Why don t you go away Martin Gertrude had begged Go away and get a job somewhere and steady down Afterwards when this all blows over you can come back Martin shook his head but gave no explanations How could he explain He was appalled at the awful intellectual chasm that yawned between him and his people He could never cross it and explain to them his position the Nietzschean position in regard to socialism There were not words enough in the English language nor in any language to make his attitude and conduct intelligible to them Their highest concept of right conduct in his case was to get a job That was their first word and their last It constituted their whole lexicon of ideas Get a job Go to work Poor stupid slaves he thought while his sister talked Small wonder the world belonged to the strong The slaves were obsessed by their own slavery A job was to them a golden fetich before which they fell down and worshipped He shook his head again when Gertrude offered him money though he knew that within the day he would have to make a trip to the pawnbroker Don t come near Bernard now she admonished him After a few months when he is cooled down if you want to you can get the job of drivin delivery wagon for him Any time you want me just send for me an I ll come Don t forget She went away weeping audibly and he felt a pang of sorrow shoot through him at sight of her heavy body and uncouth gait As he watched her go the Nietzschean edifice seemed to shake and totter The slave class in the abstract was all very well but it was not wholly satisfactory when it was brought home to his own family And yet if there was ever a slave trampled by the strong that slave was his sister Gertrude He grinned savagely at the paradox A fine Nietzsche man he was to allow his intellectual concepts to be shaken by the first sentiment or emotion that strayed along ay to be shaken by the slave morality itself for that was what his pity for his sister really was The true noble men were above pity and compassion Pity and compassion had been generated in the subterranean barracoons of the slaves and were no more than the agony and sweat of the crowded miserables and weaklings CHAPTER XL Overdue still continued to lie forgotten on the table Every manuscript that he had had out now lay under the table Only one manuscript he kept going and that was Brissenden s Ephemera His bicycle and black suit were again in pawn and the type writer people were once more worrying about the rent But such things no longer bothered him He was seeking a new orientation and until that was found his life must stand still After several weeks what he had been waiting for happened He met Ruth on the street It was true she was accompanied by her brother Norman and it was true that they tried to ignore him and that Norman attempted to wave him aside If you interfere with my sister I ll call an officer Norman threatened She does not wish to speak with you and your insistence is insult If you persist you ll have to call that officer and then you ll get your name in the papers Martin answered grimly And now get out of my way and get the officer if you want to I m going to talk with Ruth I want to have it from your own lips he said to her She was pale and trembling but she held up and looked inquiringly The question I asked in my letter he prompted Norman made an impatient movement but Martin checked him with a swift look She shook her head Is all this of your own free will he demanded It is She spoke in a low firm voice and with deliberation It is of my own free will You have disgraced me so that I am ashamed to meet my friends They are all talking about me I know That is all I can tell you You have made me very unhappy and I never wish to see you again Friends Gossip Newspaper misreports Surely such things are not stronger than love I can only believe that you never loved me A blush drove the pallor from her face After what has passed she said faintly Martin you do not know what you are saying I am not common You see she doesn t want to have anything to do with you Norman blurted out starting on with her Martin stood aside and let them pass fumbling unconsciously in his coat pocket for the tobacco and brown papers that were not there It was a long walk to North Oakland but it was not until he went up the steps and entered his room that he knew he had walked it He found himself sitting on the edge of the bed and staring about him like an awakened somnambulist He noticed Overdue lying on the table and drew up his chair and reached for his pen There was in his nature a logical compulsion toward completeness Here was something undone It had been deferred against the completion of something else Now that something else had been finished and he would apply himself to this task until it was finished What he would do next he did not know All that he did know was that a climacteric in his life had been attained A period had been reached and he was rounding it off in workman like fashion He was not curious about the future He would soon enough find out what it held in store for him Whatever it was it did not matter Nothing seemed to matter For five days he toiled on at Overdue going nowhere seeing nobody and eating meagrely On the morning of the sixth day the postman brought him a thin letter from the editor of The Parthenon A glance told him that Ephemera was accepted We have submitted the poem to mister Cartwright Bruce the editor went on to say and he has reported so favorably upon it that we cannot let it go As an earnest of our pleasure in publishing the poem let me tell you that we have set it for the August number our July number being already made up Kindly extend our pleasure and our thanks to mister Brissenden Please send by return mail his photograph and biographical data If our honorarium is unsatisfactory kindly telegraph us at once and state what you consider a fair price Since the honorarium they had offered was three hundred and fifty dollars Martin thought it not worth while to telegraph Then too there was Brissenden s consent to be gained Well he had been right after all Here was one magazine editor who knew real poetry when he saw it And the price was splendid even though it was for the poem of a century As for Cartwright Bruce Martin knew that he was the one critic for whose opinions Brissenden had any respect Martin rode down town on an electric car and as he watched the houses and cross streets slipping by he was aware of a regret that he was not more elated over his friend s success and over his own signal victory The one critic in the United States had pronounced favorably on the poem while his own contention that good stuff could find its way into the magazines had proved correct But enthusiasm had lost its spring in him and he found that he was more anxious to see Brissenden than he was to carry the good news The acceptance of The Parthenon had recalled to him that during his five days devotion to Overdue he had not heard from Brissenden nor even thought about him For the first time Martin realized the daze he had been in and he felt shame for having forgotten his friend But even the shame did not burn very sharply He was numb to emotions of any sort save the artistic ones concerned in the writing of Overdue So far as other affairs were concerned he had been in a trance For that matter he was still in a trance All this life through which the electric car whirred seemed remote and unreal and he would have experienced little interest and less shook if the great stone steeple of the church he passed had suddenly crumbled to mortar dust upon his head At the hotel he hurried up to Brissenden s room and hurried down again The room was empty All luggage was gone Did mister Brissenden leave any address he asked the clerk who looked at him curiously for a moment Haven t you heard he asked Martin shook his head Why the papers were full of it He was found dead in bed Suicide Shot himself through the head Is he buried yet Martin seemed to hear his voice like some one else s voice from a long way off asking the question No The body was shipped East after the inquest Lawyers engaged by his people saw to the arrangements They were quick about it I must say Martin commented Oh I don t know It happened five days ago Five days ago Yes five days ago Oh Martin said as he turned and went out At the corner he stepped into the Western Union and sent a telegram to The Parthenon advising them to proceed with the publication of the poem He had in his pocket but five cents with which to pay his carfare home so he sent the message collect Once in his room he resumed his writing The days and nights came and went and he sat at his table and wrote on He went nowhere save to the pawnbroker took no exercise and ate methodically when he was hungry and had something to cook and just as methodically went without when he had nothing to cook Composed as the story was in advance chapter by chapter he nevertheless saw and developed an opening that increased the power of it though it necessitated twenty thousand additional words It was not that there was any vital need that the thing should be well done but that his artistic canons compelled him to do it well He worked on in the daze strangely detached from the world around him feeling like a familiar ghost among these literary trappings of his former life He remembered that some one had said that a ghost was the spirit of a man who was dead and who did not have sense enough to know it and he paused for the moment to wonder if he were really dead did unaware of it Came the day when Overdue was finished The agent of the type writer firm had come for the machine and he sat on the bed while Martin on the one chair typed the last pages of the final chapter Finis he wrote in capitals at the end and to him it was indeed finis He watched the type writer carried out the door with a feeling of relief then went over and lay down on the bed He was faint from hunger Food had not passed his lips in thirty six hours but he did not think about it He lay on his back with closed eyes and did not think at all while the daze or stupor slowly welled up saturating his consciousness Half in delirium he began muttering aloud the lines of an anonymous poem Brissenden had been fond of quoting to him Maria listening anxiously outside his door was perturbed by his monotonous utterance The words in themselves were not significant to her but the fact that he was saying them was I have done was the burden of the poem I have done Put by the lute Song and singing soon are over As the airy shades that hover In among the purple clover I have done Put by the lute Once I sang as early thrushes Sing among the dewy bushes Now I m mute I am like a weary linnet For my throat has no song in it I have had my singing minute I have done Put by the lute Maria could stand it no longer and hurried away to the stove where she filled a quart bowl with soup putting into it the lion s share of chopped meat and vegetables which her ladle scraped from the bottom of the pot Martin roused himself and sat up and began to eat between spoonfuls reassuring Maria that he had not been talking in his sleep and that he did not have any fever After she left him he sat drearily with drooping shoulders on the edge of the bed gazing about him with lack lustre eyes that saw nothing until the torn wrapper of a magazine which had come in the morning s mail and which lay unopened shot a gleam of light into his darkened brain It is The Parthenon he thought the August Parthenon and it must contain Ephemera If only Brissenden were here to see He was turning the pages of the magazine when suddenly he stopped Ephemera had been featured with gorgeous head piece and Beardsley like margin decorations On one side of the head piece was Brissenden s photograph on the other side was the photograph of Sir John Value the British Ambassador A preliminary editorial note quoted Sir John Value as saying that there were no poets in America and the publication of Ephemera was The Parthenon s There take that Sir John Value Cartwright Bruce was described as the greatest critic in America and he was quoted as saying that Ephemera was the greatest poem ever written in America And finally the editor s foreword ended with We have not yet made up our minds entirely as to the merits of Ephemera perhaps we shall never be able to do so But we have read it often wondering at the words and their arrangement wondering where mister Brissenden got them and how he could fasten them together Then followed the poem Pretty good thing you died Briss old man Martin murmured letting the magazine slip between his knees to the floor The cheapness and vulgarity of it was nauseating and Martin noted apathetically that he was not nauseated very much He wished he could get angry but did not have energy enough to try He was too numb His blood was too congealed to accelerate to the swift tidal flow of indignation After all what did it matter It was on a par with all the rest that Brissenden had condemned in bourgeois society Poor Briss Martin communed he would never have forgiven me Rousing himself with an effort he possessed himself of a box which had once contained type writer paper Going through its contents he drew forth eleven poems which his friend had written These he tore lengthwise and crosswise and dropped into the waste basket He did it languidly and when he had finished sat on the edge of the bed staring blankly before him How long he sat there he did not know until suddenly across his sightless vision he saw form a long horizontal line of white It was curious But as he watched it grow in definiteness he saw that it was a coral reef smoking in the white Pacific surges Next in the line of breakers he made out a small canoe an outrigger canoe In the stern he saw a young bronzed god in scarlet hip cloth dipping a flashing paddle He recognized him He was Moti the youngest son of Tati the chief and this was Tahiti and beyond that smoking reef lay the sweet land of Papara and the chief s grass house by the river s mouth It was the end of the day and Moti was coming home from the fishing He was waiting for the rush of a big breaker whereon to jump the reef Then he saw himself sitting forward in the canoe as he had often sat in the past dipping a paddle that waited Moti s word to dig in like mad when the turquoise wall of the great breaker rose behind them Next he was no longer an onlooker but was himself in the canoe Moti was crying out they were both thrusting hard with their paddles racing on the steep face of the flying turquoise Under the bow the water was hissing as from a steam jet the air was filled with driven spray there was a rush and rumble and long echoing roar and the canoe floated on the placid water of the lagoon Moti laughed and shook the salt water from his eyes and together they paddled in to the pounded coral beach where Tati s grass walls through the cocoanut palms showed golden in the setting sun The picture faded and before his eyes stretched the disorder of his squalid room He strove in vain to see Tahiti again He knew there was singing among the trees and that the maidens were dancing in the moonlight but he could not see them He could see only the littered writing table the empty space where the type writer had stood and the unwashed window pane He closed his eyes with a groan and slept CHAPTER XLI He slept heavily all night and did not stir until aroused by the postman on his morning round Martin felt tired and passive and went through his letters aimlessly One thin envelope from a robber magazine contained for twenty two dollars He had been dunning for it for a year and a half He noted its amount apathetically The old time thrill at receiving a publisher s check was gone Unlike his earlier checks this one was not pregnant with promise of great things to come To him it was a check for twenty two dollars that was all and it would buy him something to eat Another check was in the same mail sent from a New York weekly in payment for some humorous verse which had been accepted months before It was for ten dollars An idea came to him which he calmly considered He did not know what he was going to do and he felt in no hurry to do anything In the meantime he must live Also he owed numerous debts Would it not be a paying investment to put stamps on the huge pile of manuscripts under the table and start them on their travels again One or two of them might be accepted That would help him to live He decided on the investment and after he had cashed the checks at the bank down in Oakland he bought ten dollars worth of postage stamps The thought of going home to cook breakfast in his stuffy little room was repulsive to him For the first time he refused to consider his debts He knew that in his room he could manufacture a substantial breakfast at a cost of from fifteen to twenty cents But instead he went into the Forum Cafe and ordered a breakfast that cost two dollars He tipped the waiter a quarter and spent fifty cents for a package of Egyptian cigarettes It was the first time he had smoked since Ruth had asked him to stop But he could see now no reason why he should not and besides he wanted to smoke And what did the money matter For five cents he could have bought a package of Durham and brown papers and rolled forty cigarettes but what of it Money had no meaning to him now except what it would immediately buy He was chartless and rudderless and he had no port to make while drifting involved the least living and it was living that hurt The days slipped along and he slept eight hours regularly every night Though now while waiting for more checks he ate in the Japanese restaurants where meals were served for ten cents his wasted body filled out as did the hollows in his cheeks He no longer abused himself with short sleep overwork and overstudy He wrote nothing and the books were closed He walked much out in the hills and loafed long hours in the quiet parks He had no friends nor acquaintances nor did he make any He had no inclination He was waiting for some impulse from he knew not where to put his stopped life into motion again In the meantime his life remained run down planless and empty and idle Once he made a trip to San Francisco to look up the real dirt But at the last moment as he stepped into the upstairs entrance he recoiled and turned and fled through the swarming ghetto He was frightened at the thought of hearing philosophy discussed and he fled furtively for fear that some one of the real dirt might chance along and recognize him Sometimes he glanced over the magazines and newspapers to see how Ephemera was being maltreated It had made a hit But what a hit Everybody had read it and everybody was discussing whether or not it was really poetry The local papers had taken it up and daily there appeared columns of learned criticisms facetious editorials and serious letters from subscribers Helen Della Delmar proclaimed with a flourish of trumpets and rolling of tomtoms to be the greatest woman poet in the United States denied Brissenden a seat beside her on Pegasus and wrote voluminous letters to the public proving that he was no poet The Parthenon came out in its next number patting itself on the back for the stir it had made sneering at Sir John Value and exploiting Brissenden s death with ruthless commercialism A newspaper with a sworn circulation of half a million published an original and spontaneous poem by Helen Della Delmar in which she gibed and sneered at Brissenden Also she was guilty of a second poem in which she parodied him Martin had many times to be glad that Brissenden was dead He had hated the crowd so and here all that was finest and most sacred of him had been thrown to the crowd Daily the vivisection of Beauty went on Every nincompoop in the land rushed into free print floating their wizened little egos into the public eye on the surge of Brissenden s greatness Quoth one paper We have received a letter from a gentleman who wrote a poem just like it only better some time ago Another paper in deadly seriousness reproving Helen Della Delmar for her parody said But unquestionably Miss Delmar wrote it in a moment of badinage and not quite with the respect that one great poet should show to another and perhaps to the greatest However whether Miss Delmar be jealous or not of the man who invented Ephemera it is certain that she like thousands of others is fascinated by his work and that the day may come when she will try to write lines like his Ministers began to preach sermons against Ephemera and one who too stoutly stood for much of its content was expelled for heresy The great poem contributed to the gayety of the world The comic verse writers and the cartoonists took hold of it with screaming laughter and in the personal columns of society weeklies jokes were perpetrated on it to the effect that Charley Frensham told Archie Jennings in confidence that five lines of Ephemera would drive a man to beat a cripple and that ten lines would send him to the bottom of the river Martin did not laugh nor did he grit his teeth in anger The effect produced upon him was one of great sadness In the crash of his whole world with love on the pinnacle the crash of magazinedom and the dear public was a small crash indeed Brissenden had been wholly right in his judgment of the magazines and he Martin had spent arduous and futile years in order to find it out for himself The magazines were all Brissenden had said they were and more Well he was done he solaced himself He had hitched his wagon to a star and been landed in a pestiferous marsh The visions of Tahiti clean sweet Tahiti were coming to him more frequently And there were the low Paumotus and the high Marquesas he saw himself often now on board trading schooners or frail little cutters slipping out at dawn through the reef at Papeete and beginning the long beat through the pearl atolls to Nukahiva and the Bay of Taiohae where Tamari he knew would kill a pig in honor of his coming and where Tamari s flower garlanded daughters would seize his hands and with song and laughter garland him with flowers The South Seas were calling and he knew that sooner or later he would answer the call In the meantime he drifted resting and recuperating after the long traverse he had made through the realm of knowledge When The Parthenon check of three hundred and fifty dollars was forwarded to him he turned it over to the local lawyer who had attended to Brissenden s affairs for his family Martin took a receipt for the check and at the same time gave a note for the hundred dollars Brissenden had let him have The time was not long when Martin ceased patronizing the Japanese restaurants At the very moment when he had abandoned the fight the tide turned But it had turned too late Without a thrill he opened a thick envelope from The Millennium scanned the face of a check that represented three hundred dollars and noted that it was the payment on acceptance for Adventure Every debt he owed in the world including the pawnshop with its usurious interest amounted to less than a hundred dollars And when he had paid everything and lifted the hundred dollar note with Brissenden s lawyer he still had over a hundred dollars in pocket He ordered a suit of clothes from the tailor and ate his meals in the best cafes in town He still slept in his little room at Maria s but the sight of his new clothes caused the neighborhood children to cease from calling him hobo and tramp from the roofs of woodsheds and over back fences Wiki Wiki his Hawaiian short story was bought by Warren s Monthly for two hundred and fifty dollars The Northern Review took his essay The Cradle of Beauty and Mackintosh s Magazine took The Palmist the poem he had written to Marian The editors and readers were back from their summer vacations and manuscripts were being handled quickly But Martin could not puzzle out what strange whim animated them to this general acceptance of the things they had persistently rejected for two years Nothing of his had been published He was not known anywhere outside of Oakland and in Oakland with the few who thought they knew him he was notorious as a red shirt and a socialist So there was no explaining this sudden acceptability of his wares It was sheer jugglery of fate After it had been refused by a number of magazines he had taken Brissenden s rejected advice and started The Shame of the Sun on the round of publishers After several refusals Singletree Darnley company accepted it promising fall publication When Martin asked for an advance on royalties they wrote that such was not their custom that books of that nature rarely paid for themselves and that they doubted if his book would sell a thousand copies Martin figured what the book would earn him on such a sale Retailed at a dollar on a royalty of fifteen per cent it would bring him one hundred and fifty dollars He decided that if he had it to do over again he would confine himself to fiction Adventure one fourth as long had brought him twice as much from The Millennium That newspaper paragraph he had read so long ago had been true after all The first class magazines did not pay on acceptance and they paid well Not two cents a word but four cents a word had The Millennium paid him And furthermore they bought good stuff too for were they not buying his This last thought he accompanied with a grin He wrote to Singletree Darnley company offering to sell out his rights in The Shame of the Sun for a hundred dollars but they did not care to take the risk In the meantime he was not in need of money for several of his later stories had been accepted and paid for He actually opened a bank account where without a debt in the world he had several hundred dollars to his credit Overdue after having been declined by a number of magazines came to rest at the Meredith Lowell Company Martin remembered the five dollars Gertrude had given him and his resolve to return it to her a hundred times over so he wrote for an advance on royalties of five hundred dollars To his surprise a check for that amount accompanied by a contract came by return mail He cashed the check into five dollar gold pieces and telephoned Gertrude that he wanted to see her She arrived at the house panting and short of breath from the haste she had made Apprehensive of trouble she had stuffed the few dollars she possessed into her hand satchel and so sure was she that disaster had overtaken her brother that she stumbled forward sobbing into his arms at the same time thrusting the satchel mutely at him I d have come myself he said But I didn t want a row with mister Higginbotham and that is what would have surely happened He ll be all right after a time she assured him while she wondered what the trouble was that Martin was in But you d best get a job first an steady down Bernard does like to see a man at honest work That stuff in the newspapers broke m all up I never saw m so mad before I m not going to get a job Martin said with a smile And you can tell him so from me I don t need a job and there s the proof of it He emptied the hundred gold pieces into her lap in a glinting tinkling stream You remember that fiver you gave me the time I didn t have carfare Well there it is with ninety nine brothers of different ages but all of the same size If Gertrude had been frightened when she arrived she was now in a panic of fear Her fear was such that it was certitude She was not suspicious She was convinced She looked at Martin in horror and her heavy limbs shrank under the golden stream as though it were burning her It s yours he laughed She burst into tears and began to moan My poor boy my poor boy He was puzzled for a moment Then he divined the cause of her agitation and handed her the Meredith Lowell letter which had accompanied the check She stumbled through it pausing now and again to wipe her eyes and when she had finished said An does it mean that you come by the money honestly More honestly than if I d won it in a lottery I earned it Slowly faith came back to her and she reread the letter carefully It took him long to explain to her the nature of the transaction which had put the money into his possession and longer still to get her to understand that the money was really hers and that he did not need it I ll put it in the bank for you she said finally You ll do nothing of the sort It s yours to do with as you please and if you won t take it I ll give it to Maria She ll know what to do with it I d suggest though that you hire a servant and take a good long rest I m goin to tell Bernard all about it she announced when she was leaving Martin winced then grinned Yes do he said And then maybe he ll invite me to dinner again Yes he will I m sure he will she exclaimed fervently as she drew him to her and kissed and hugged him CHAPTER XLII One day Martin became aware that he was lonely He was healthy and strong and had nothing to do The cessation from writing and studying the death of Brissenden and the estrangement from Ruth had made a big hole in his life and his life refused to be pinned down to good living in cafes and the smoking of Egyptian cigarettes It was true the South Seas were calling to him but he had a feeling that the game was not yet played out in the United States Two books were soon to be published and he had more books that might find publication Money could be made out of them and he would wait and take a sackful of it into the South Seas He knew a valley and a bay in the Marquesas that he could buy for a thousand Chili dollars The valley ran from the horseshoe land locked bay to the tops of the dizzy cloud capped peaks and contained perhaps ten thousand acres It was filled with tropical fruits wild chickens and wild pigs with an occasional herd of wild cattle while high up among the peaks were herds of wild goats harried by packs of wild dogs The whole place was wild Not a human lived in it And he could buy it and the bay for a thousand Chili dollars The bay as he remembered it was magnificent with water deep enough to accommodate the largest vessel afloat and so safe that the South Pacific Directory recommended it to the best careening place for ships for hundreds of miles around He would buy a schooner one of those yacht like coppered crafts that sailed like witches and go trading copra and pearling among the islands He would make the valley and the bay his headquarters He would build a patriarchal grass house like Tati s and have it and the valley and the schooner filled with dark skinned servitors He would entertain there the factor of Taiohae captains of wandering traders and all the best of the South Pacific riffraff He would keep open house and entertain like a prince And he would forget the books he had opened and the world that had proved an illusion To do all this he must wait in California to fill the sack with money Already it was beginning to flow in If one of the books made a strike it might enable him to sell the whole heap of manuscripts Also he could collect the stories and the poems into books and make sure of the valley and the bay and the schooner He would never write again Upon that he was resolved But in the meantime awaiting the publication of the books he must do something more than live dazed and stupid in the sort of uncaring trance into which he had fallen He noted one Sunday morning that the Bricklayers Picnic took place that day at Shell Mound Park and to Shell Mound Park he went He had been to the working class picnics too often in his earlier life not to know what they were like and as he entered the park he experienced a recrudescence of all the old sensations After all they were his kind these working people He had been born among them he had lived among them and though he had strayed for a time it was well to come back among them If it ain t Mart he heard some one say and the next moment a hearty hand was on his shoulder Where you ben all the time Off to sea Come on an have a drink It was the old crowd in which he found himself the old crowd with here and there a gap and here and there a new face The fellows were not bricklayers but as in the old days they attended all Sunday picnics for the dancing and the fighting and the fun Martin drank with them and began to feel really human once more He was a fool to have ever left them he thought and he was very certain that his sum of happiness would have been greater had he remained with them and let alone the books and the people who sat in the high places Yet the beer seemed not so good as of yore It didn t taste as it used to taste Brissenden had spoiled him for steam beer he concluded and wondered if after all the books had spoiled him for companionship with these friends of his youth He resolved that he would not be so spoiled and he went on to the dancing pavilion Jimmy the plumber he met there in the company of a tall blond girl who promptly forsook him for Martin Gee it s like old times Jimmy explained to the gang that gave him the laugh as Martin and the blonde whirled away in a waltz An I don t give a rap I m too damned glad to see m back Watch m waltz eh It s like silk Who d blame any girl But Martin restored the blonde to Jimmy and the three of them with half a dozen friends watched the revolving couples and laughed and joked with one another Everybody was glad to see Martin back No book of his been published he carried no fictitious value in their eyes They liked him for himself He felt like a prince returned from excile and his lonely heart burgeoned in the geniality in which it bathed He made a mad day of it and was at his best Also he had money in his pockets and as in the old days when he returned from sea with a pay day he made the money fly Once on the dancing floor he saw Lizzie Connolly go by in the arms of a young workingman and later when he made the round of the pavilion he came upon her sitting by a refreshment table Surprise and greetings over he led her away into the grounds where they could talk without shouting down the music From the instant he spoke to her she was his He knew it She showed it in the proud humility of her eyes in every caressing movement of her proudly carried body and in the way she hung upon his speech She was not the young girl as he had known her She was a woman now and Martin noted that her wild defiant beauty had improved losing none of its wildness while the defiance and the fire seemed more in control A beauty a perfect beauty he murmured admiringly under his breath And he knew she was his that all he had to do was to say Come and she would go with him over the world wherever he led Even as the thought flashed through his brain he received a heavy blow on the side of his head that nearly knocked him down It was a man s fist directed by a man so angry and in such haste that the fist had missed the jaw for which it was aimed Martin turned as he staggered and saw the fist coming at him in a wild swing Quite as a matter of course he ducked and the fist flew harmlessly past pivoting the man who had driven it Martin hooked with his left landing on the pivoting man with the weight of his body behind the blow The man went to the ground sidewise leaped to his feet and made a mad rush Martin saw his passion distorted face and wondered what could be the cause of the fellow s anger But while he wondered he shot in a straight left the weight of his body behind the blow The man went over backward and fell in a crumpled heap Jimmy and others of the gang were running toward them Martin was thrilling all over This was the old days with a vengeance with their dancing and their fighting and their fun While he kept a wary eye on his antagonist he glanced at Lizzie Usually the girls screamed when the fellows got to scrapping but she had not screamed She was looking on with bated breath leaning slightly forward so keen was her interest one hand pressed to her breast her cheek flushed and in her eyes a great and amazed admiration The man had gained his feet and was struggling to escape the restraining arms that were laid on him She was waitin for me to come back he was proclaiming to all and sundry She was waitin for me to come back an then that fresh guy comes buttin in Let go o me I tell yeh I m goin to fix m What s eatin yer Jimmy was demanding as he helped hold the young fellow back That guy s Mart Eden He s nifty with his mits lemme tell you that an he ll eat you alive if you monkey with m He can t steal her on me that way the other interjected He licked the Flyin Dutchman an you know him Jimmy went on expostulating An he did it in five rounds You couldn t last a minute against him See This information seemed to have a mollifying effect and the irate young man favored Martin with a measuring stare He don t look it he sneered but the sneer was without passion That s what the Flyin Dutchman thought Jimmy assured him Come on now let s get outa this There s lots of other girls Come on The young fellow allowed himself to be led away toward the pavilion and the gang followed after him Who is he Martin asked Lizzie And what s it all about anyway Already the zest of combat which of old had been so keen and lasting had died down and he discovered that he was self analytical too much so to live single heart and single hand so primitive an existence Lizzie tossed her head Oh he s nobody she said He s just ben keepin company with me I had to you see she explained after a pause I was gettin pretty lonesome But I never forgot Her voice sank lower and she looked straight before her I d throw m down for you any time Martin looking at her averted face knowing that all he had to do was to reach out his hand and pluck her fell to pondering whether after all there was any real worth in refined grammatical English and so forgot to reply to her You put it all over him she said tentatively with a laugh He s a husky young fellow though he admitted generously If they hadn t taken him away he might have given me my hands full Who was that lady friend I seen you with that night she asked abruptly Oh just a lady friend was his answer It was a long time ago she murmured contemplatively It seems like a thousand years But Martin went no further into the matter He led the conversation off into other channels They had lunch in the restaurant where he ordered wine and expensive delicacies and afterward he danced with her and with no one but her till she was tired He was a good dancer and she whirled around and around with him in a heaven of delight her head against his shoulder wishing that it could last forever Later in the afternoon they strayed off among the trees where in the good old fashion she sat down while he sprawled on his back his head in her lap He lay and dozed while she fondled his hair looked down on his closed eyes and loved him without reserve Looking up suddenly he read the tender advertisement in her face Her eyes fluttered down then they opened and looked into his with soft defiance I ve kept straight all these years she said her voice so low that it was almost a whisper In his heart Martin knew that it was the miraculous truth And at his heart pleaded a great temptation It was in his power to make her happy Denied happiness himself why should he deny happiness to her He could marry her and take her down with him to dwell in the grass walled castle in the Marquesas The desire to do it was strong but stronger still was the imperative command of his nature not to do it In spite of himself he was still faithful to Love The old days of license and easy living were gone He could not bring them back nor could he go back to them He was changed how changed he had not realized until now I am not a marrying man Lizzie he said lightly The hand caressing his hair paused perceptibly then went on with the same gentle stroke He noticed her face harden but it was with the hardness of resolution for still the soft color was in her cheeks and she was all glowing and melting I did not mean that she began then faltered Or anyway I don t care I don t care she repeated I m proud to be your friend I d do anything for you I m made that way I guess Martin sat up He took her hand in his He did it deliberately with warmth but without passion and such warmth chilled her Don t let s talk about it she said You are a great and noble woman he said And it is I who should be proud to know you And I am I am You are a ray of light to me in a very dark world and I ve got to be straight with you just as straight as you have been I don t care whether you re straight with me or not You could do anything with me You could throw me in the dirt an walk on me An you re the only man in the world that can she added with a defiant flash I ain t taken care of myself ever since I was a kid for nothin And it s just because of that that I m not going to he said gently You are so big and generous that you challenge me to equal generousness I m not marrying and I m not well loving without marrying though I ve done my share of that in the past I m sorry I came here to day and met you But it can t be helped now and I never expected it would turn out this way But look here Lizzie I can t begin to tell you how much I like you I do more than like you I admire and respect you You are magnificent and you are magnificently good But what s the use of words Yet there s something I d like to do You ve had a hard life let me make it easy for you A joyous light welled into her eyes then faded out again I m pretty sure of getting hold of some money soon lots of it In that moment he abandoned the idea of the valley and the bay the grass walled castle and the trim white schooner After all what did it matter He could go away as he had done so often before the mast on any ship bound anywhere I d like to turn it over to you There must be something you want to go to school or business college You might like to study and be a stenographer I could fix it for you Or maybe your father and mother are living I could set them up in a grocery store or something Anything you want just name it and I can fix it for you She made no reply but sat gazing straight before her dry eyed and motionless but with an ache in the throat which Martin divined so strongly that it made his own throat ache He regretted that he had spoken It seemed so tawdry what he had offered her mere money compared with what she offered him He offered her an extraneous thing with which he could part without a pang while she offered him herself along with disgrace and shame and sin and all her hopes of heaven Don t let s talk about it she said with a catch in her voice that she changed to a cough She stood up Come on let s go home I m all tired out The day was done and the merrymakers had nearly all departed But as Martin and Lizzie emerged from the trees they found the gang waiting for them Martin knew immediately the meaning of it Trouble was brewing The gang was his body guard They passed out through the gates of the park with straggling in the rear a second gang the friends that Lizzie s young man had collected to avenge the loss of his lady Several constables and special police officers anticipating trouble trailed along to prevent it and herded the two gangs separately aboard the train for San Francisco Martin told Jimmy that he would get off at Sixteenth Street Station and catch the electric car into Oakland Lizzie was very quiet and without interest in what was impending The train pulled in to Sixteenth Street Station and the waiting electric car could be seen the conductor of which was impatiently clanging the gong There she is Jimmy counselled Make a run for it an we ll hold em back Now you go Hit her up The hostile gang was temporarily disconcerted by the manoeuvre then it dashed from the train in pursuit The staid and sober Oakland folk who sat upon the car scarcely noted the young fellow and the girl who ran for it and found a seat in front on the outside They did not connect the couple with Jimmy who sprang on the steps crying to the motorman Slam on the juice old man and beat it outa here The next moment Jimmy whirled about and the passengers saw him land his fist on the face of a running man who was trying to board the car But fists were landing on faces the whole length of the car Thus Jimmy and his gang strung out on the long lower steps met the attacking gang The car started with a great clanging of its gong and as Jimmy s gang drove off the last assailants they too jumped off to finish the job The car dashed on leaving the flurry of combat far behind and its dumfounded passengers never dreamed that the quiet young man and the pretty working girl sitting in the corner on the outside seat had been the cause of the row Martin had enjoyed the fight with a recrudescence of the old fighting thrills But they quickly died away and he was oppressed by a great sadness He felt very old centuries older than those careless care free young companions of his others days He had travelled far too far to go back Their mode of life which had once been his was now distasteful to him He was disappointed in it all He had developed into an alien As the steam beer had tasted raw so their companionship seemed raw to him He was too far removed Too many thousands of opened books yawned between them and him He had exiled himself He had travelled in the vast realm of intellect until he could no longer return home On the other hand he was human and his gregarious need for companionship remained unsatisfied He had found no new home As the gang could not understand him as his own family could not understand him as the bourgeoisie could not understand him so this girl beside him whom he honored high could not understand him nor the honor he paid her His sadness was not untouched with bitterness as he thought it over Make it up with him he advised Lizzie at parting as they stood in front of the workingman s shack in which she lived near Sixth and Market He referred to the young fellow whose place he had usurped that day I can t now she said Oh go on he said jovially All you have to do is whistle and he ll come running I didn t mean that she said simply And he knew what she had meant She leaned toward him as he was about to say good night But she leaned not imperatively not seductively but wistfully and humbly He was touched to the heart His large tolerance rose up in him He put his arms around her and kissed her and knew that upon his own lips rested as true a kiss as man ever received My God she sobbed I could die for you I could die for you She tore herself from him suddenly and ran up the steps He felt a quick moisture in his eyes Martin Eden he communed You re not a brute and you re a damn poor Nietzscheman You d marry her if you could and fill her quivering heart full with happiness But you can t you can t And it s a damn shame A poor old tramp explains his poor old ulcers he muttered remembering his Henly Life is I think a blunder and a shame It is a blunder and a shame CHAPTER XLIII The Shame of the Sun was published in October As Martin cut the cords of the express package and the half dozen complimentary copies from the publishers spilled out on the table a heavy sadness fell upon him He thought of the wild delight that would have been his had this happened a few short months before and he contrasted that delight that should have been with his present uncaring coldness His book his first book and his pulse had not gone up a fraction of a beat and he was only sad It meant little to him now The most it meant was that it might bring some money and little enough did he care for money He carried a copy out into the kitchen and presented it to Maria I did it he explained in order to clear up her bewilderment I wrote it in the room there and I guess some few quarts of your vegetable soup went into the making of it Keep it It s yours Just to remember me by you know He was not bragging not showing off His sole motive was to make her happy to make her proud of him to justify her long faith in him She put the book in the front room on top of the family Bible A sacred thing was this book her lodger had made a fetich of friendship It softened the blow of his having been a laundryman and though she could not understand a line of it she knew that every line of it was great She was a simple practical hard working woman but she possessed faith in large endowment Just as emotionlessly as he had received The Shame of the Sun did he read the reviews of it that came in weekly from the clipping bureau The book was making a hit that was evident It meant more gold in the money sack He could fix up Lizzie redeem all his promises and still have enough left to build his grass walled castle Singletree Darnley company had cautiously brought out an edition of fifteen hundred copies but the first reviews had started a second edition of twice the size through the presses and ere this was delivered a third edition of five thousand had been ordered A London firm made arrangements by cable for an English edition and hot footed upon this came the news of French German and Scandinavian translations in progress The attack upon the Maeterlinck school could not have been made at a more opportune moment A fierce controversy was precipitated Saleeby and Haeckel indorsed and defended The Shame of the Sun for once finding themselves on the same side of a question Crookes and Wallace ranged up on the opposing side while Sir Oliver Lodge attempted to formulate a compromise that would jibe with his particular cosmic theories Maeterlinck s followers rallied around the standard of mysticism Chesterton set the whole world laughing with a series of alleged non partisan essays on the subject and the whole affair controversy and controversialists was well nigh swept into the pit by a thundering broadside from George Bernard Shaw Needless to say the arena was crowded with hosts of lesser lights and the dust and sweat and din became terrific It is a most marvellous happening Singletree Darnley company wrote Martin a critical philosophic essay selling like a novel You could not have chosen your subject better and all contributory factors have been unwarrantedly propitious We need scarcely to assure you that we are making hay while the sun shines Over forty thousand copies have already been sold in the United States and Canada and a new edition of twenty thousand is on the presses We are overworked trying to supply the demand Nevertheless we have helped to create that demand We have already spent five thousand dollars in advertising The book is bound to be a record breaker Please find herewith a contract in duplicate for your next book which we have taken the liberty of forwarding to you You will please note that we have increased your royalties to twenty per cent which is about as high as a conservative publishing house dares go If our offer is agreeable to you please fill in the proper blank space with the title of your book We make no stipulations concerning its nature Any book on any subject If you have one already written so much the better Now is the time to strike The iron could not be hotter On receipt of signed contract we shall be pleased to make you an advance on royalties of five thousand dollars You see we have faith in you and we are going in on this thing big We should like also to discuss with you the drawing up of a contract for a term of years say ten during which we shall have the exclusive right of publishing in book form all that you produce But more of this anon Martin laid down the letter and worked a problem in mental arithmetic finding the product of fifteen cents times sixty thousand to be nine thousand dollars He signed the new contract inserting The Smoke of Joy in the blank space and mailed it back to the publishers along with the twenty storiettes he had written in the days before he discovered the formula for the newspaper storiette And promptly as the United States mail could deliver and return came Singletree Darnley company s check for five thousand dollars I want you to come down town with me Maria this afternoon about two o clock Martin said the morning the check arrived Or better meet me at Fourteenth and Broadway at two o clock I ll be looking out for you At the appointed time she was there but shoes was the only clew to the mystery her mind had been capable of evolving and she suffered a distinct shock of disappointment when Martin walked her right by a shoe store and dived into a real estate office What happened thereupon resided forever after in her memory as a dream Fine gentlemen smiled at her benevolently as they talked with Martin and one another a type writer clicked signatures were affixed to an imposing document her own landlord was there too and affixed his signature and when all was over and she was outside on the sidewalk her landlord spoke to her saying Well Maria you won t have to pay me no seven dollars and a half this month Maria was too stunned for speech Or next month or the next or the next her landlord said She thanked him incoherently as if for a favor And it was not until she had returned home to North Oakland and conferred with her own kind and had the Portuguese grocer investigate that she really knew that she was the owner of the little house in which she had lived and for which she had paid rent so long Why don t you trade with me no more the Portuguese grocer asked Martin that evening stepping out to hail him when he got off the car and Martin explained that he wasn t doing his own cooking any more and then went in and had a drink of wine on the house He noted it was the best wine the grocer had in stock Maria Martin announced that night I m going to leave you And you re going to leave here yourself soon Then you can rent the house and be a landlord yourself You ve a brother in San Leandro or Haywards and he s in the milk business I want you to send all your washing back unwashed understand unwashed and to go out to San Leandro to morrow or Haywards or wherever it is and see that brother of yours Tell him to come to see me I ll be stopping at the Metropole down in Oakland He ll know a good milk ranch when he sees one And so it was that Maria became a landlord and the sole owner of a dairy with two hired men to do the work for her and a bank account that steadily increased despite the fact that her whole brood wore shoes and went to school Few persons ever meet the fairy princes they dream about but Maria who worked hard and whose head was hard never dreaming about fairy princes entertained hers in the guise of an ex laundryman In the meantime the world had begun to ask Who is this Martin Eden He had declined to give any biographical data to his publishers but the newspapers were not to be denied Oakland was his own town and the reporters nosed out scores of individuals who could supply information All that he was and was not all that he had done and most of what he had not done was spread out for the delectation of the public accompanied by snapshots and photographs the latter procured from the local photographer who had once taken Martin s picture and who promptly copyrighted it and put it on the market At first so great was his disgust with the magazines and all bourgeois society Martin fought against publicity but in the end because it was easier than not to he surrendered He found that he could not refuse himself to the special writers who travelled long distances to see him Then again each day was so many hours long and since he no longer was occupied with writing and studying those hours had to be occupied somehow so he yielded to what was to him a whim permitted interviews gave his opinions on literature and philosophy and even accepted invitations of the bourgeoisie He had settled down into a strange and comfortable state of mind He no longer cared He forgave everybody even the cub reporter who had painted him red and to whom he now granted a full page with specially posed photographs He saw Lizzie occasionally and it was patent that she regretted the greatness that had come to him It widened the space between them Perhaps it was with the hope of narrowing it that she yielded to his persuasions to go to night school and business college and to have herself gowned by a wonderful dressmaker who charged outrageous prices She improved visibly from day to day until Martin wondered if he was doing right for he knew that all her compliance and endeavor was for his sake She was trying to make herself of worth in his eyes of the sort of worth he seemed to value Yet he gave her no hope treating her in brotherly fashion and rarely seeing her Overdue was rushed upon the market by the Meredith Lowell Company in the height of his popularity and being fiction in point of sales it made even a bigger strike than The Shame of the Sun Week after week his was the credit of the unprecedented performance of having two books at the head of the list of best sellers Not only did the story take with the fiction readers but those who read The Shame of the Sun with avidity were likewise attracted to the sea story by the cosmic grasp of mastery with which he had handled it First he had attacked the literature of mysticism and had done it exceeding well and next he had successfully supplied the very literature he had exposited thus proving himself to be that rare genius a critic and a creator in one Money poured in on him fame poured in on him he flashed comet like through the world of literature and he was more amused than interested by the stir he was making One thing was puzzling him a little thing that would have puzzled the world had it known But the world would have puzzled over his bepuzzlement rather than over the little thing that to him loomed gigantic Judge Blount invited him to dinner That was the little thing or the beginning of the little thing that was soon to become the big thing He had insulted Judge Blount treated him abominably and Judge Blount meeting him on the street invited him to dinner Martin bethought himself of the numerous occasions on which he had met Judge Blount at the Morses and when Judge Blount had not invited him to dinner Why had he not invited him to dinner then he asked himself He had not changed He was the same Martin Eden What made the difference The fact that the stuff he had written had appeared inside the covers of books But it was work performed It was not something he had done since It was achievement accomplished at the very time Judge Blount was sharing this general view and sneering at his Spencer and his intellect Therefore it was not for any real value but for a purely fictitious value that Judge Blount invited him to dinner Martin grinned and accepted the invitation marvelling the while at his complacence And at the dinner where with their womankind were half a dozen of those that sat in high places and where Martin found himself quite the lion Judge Blount warmly seconded by Judge Hanwell urged privately that Martin should permit his name to be put up for the Styx the ultra select club to which belonged not the mere men of wealth but the men of attainment And Martin declined and was more puzzled than ever He was kept busy disposing of his heap of manuscripts He was overwhelmed by requests from editors It had been discovered that he was a stylist with meat under his style The Northern Review after publishing The Cradle of Beauty had written him for half a dozen similar essays which would have been supplied out of the heap had not Burton s Magazine in a speculative mood offered him five hundred dollars each for five essays He wrote back that he would supply the demand but at a thousand dollars an essay He remembered that all these manuscripts had been refused by the very magazines that were now clamoring for them And their refusals had been cold blooded automatic stereotyped They had made him sweat and now he intended to make them sweat Burton s Magazine paid his price for five essays and the remaining four at the same rate were snapped up by Mackintosh s Monthly The Northern Review being too poor to stand the pace Thus went out to the world The High Priests of Mystery The Wonder Dreamers The Yardstick of the Ego Philosophy of Illusion God and Clod Art and Biology Critics and Test tubes Star dust and The Dignity of Usury to raise storms and rumblings and mutterings that were many a day in dying down Editors wrote to him telling him to name his own terms which he did but it was always for work performed He refused resolutely to pledge himself to any new thing The thought of again setting pen to paper maddened him He had seen Brissenden torn to pieces by the crowd and despite the fact that him the crowd acclaimed he could not get over the shock nor gather any respect for the crowd His very popularity seemed a disgrace and a treason to Brissenden It made him wince but he made up his mind to go on and fill the money bag He received letters from editors like the following About a year ago we were unfortunate enough to refuse your collection of love poems We were greatly impressed by them at the time but certain arrangements already entered into prevented our taking them If you still have them and if you will be kind enough to forward them we shall be glad to publish the entire collection on your own terms We are also prepared to make a most advantageous offer for bringing them out in book form Martin recollected his blank verse tragedy and sent it instead He read it over before mailing and was particularly impressed by its sophomoric amateurishness and general worthlessness But he sent it and it was published to the everlasting regret of the editor The public was indignant and incredulous It was too far a cry from Martin Eden s high standard to that serious bosh It was asserted that he had never written it that the magazine had faked it very clumsily or that Martin Eden was emulating the elder Dumas and at the height of success was hiring his writing done for him But when he explained that the tragedy was an early effort of his literary childhood and that the magazine had refused to be happy unless it got it a great laugh went up at the magazine s expense and a change in the editorship followed The tragedy was never brought out in book form though Martin pocketed the advance royalties that had been paid Coleman s Weekly sent Martin a lengthy telegram costing nearly three hundred dollars offering him a thousand dollars an article for twenty articles He was to travel over the United States with all expenses paid and select whatever topics interested him The body of the telegram was devoted to hypothetical topics in order to show him the freedom of range that was to be his The only restriction placed upon him was that he must confine himself to the United States Martin sent his inability to accept and his regrets by wire collect Wiki Wiki published in Warren s Monthly was an instantaneous success It was brought out forward in a wide margined beautifully decorated volume that struck the holiday trade and sold like wildfire The critics were unanimous in the belief that it would take its place with those two classics by two great writers The Bottle Imp and The Magic Skin The public however received the Smoke of Joy collection rather dubiously and coldly The audacity and unconventionality of the storiettes was a shock to bourgeois morality and prejudice but when Paris went mad over the immediate translation that was made the American and English reading public followed suit and bought so many copies that Martin compelled the conservative house of Singletree Darnley company to pay a flat royalty of twenty five per cent for a third book and thirty per cent flat for a fourth These two volumes comprised all the short stories he had written and which had received or were receiving serial publication The Ring of Bells and his horror stories constituted one collection the other collection was composed of Adventure The Pot The Wine of Life The Whirlpool The Jostling Street and four other stories The Lowell Meredith Company captured the collection of all his essays and the Maxmillian Company got his Sea Lyrics and the Love cycle the latter receiving serial publication in the Ladies Home Companion after the payment of an extortionate price Martin heaved a sigh of relief when he had disposed of the last manuscript The grass walled castle and the white coppered schooner were very near to him Well at any rate he had discovered Brissenden s contention that nothing of merit found its way into the magazines His own success demonstrated that Brissenden had been wrong And yet somehow he had a feeling that Brissenden had been right after all The Shame of the Sun had been the cause of his success more than the stuff he had written That stuff had been merely incidental It had been rejected right and left by the magazines The publication of The Shame of the Sun had started a controversy and precipitated the landslide in his favor Had there been no Shame of the Sun there would have been no landslide and had there been no miracle in the go of The Shame of the Sun there would have been no landslide Singletree Darnley company attested that miracle They had brought out a first edition of fifteen hundred copies and been dubious of selling it They were experienced publishers and no one had been more astounded than they at the success which had followed To them it had been in truth a miracle They never got over it and every letter they wrote him reflected their reverent awe of that first mysterious happening They did not attempt to explain it There was no explaining it It had happened In the face of all experience to the contrary it had happened So it was reasoning thus that Martin questioned the validity of his popularity It was the bourgeoisie that bought his books and poured its gold into his money sack and from what little he knew of the bourgeoisie it was not clear to him how it could possibly appreciate or comprehend what he had written His intrinsic beauty and power meant nothing to the hundreds of thousands who were acclaiming him and buying his books He was the fad of the hour the adventurer who had stormed Parnassus while the gods nodded The hundreds of thousands read him and acclaimed him with the same brute non understanding with which they had flung themselves on Brissenden s Ephemera and torn it to pieces a wolf rabble that fawned on him instead of fanging him Fawn or fang it was all a matter of chance One thing he knew with absolute certitude Ephemera was infinitely greater than anything he had done It was infinitely greater than anything he had in him It was a poem of centuries Then the tribute the mob paid him was a sorry tribute indeed for that same mob had wallowed Ephemera into the mire He sighed heavily and with satisfaction He was glad the last manuscript was sold and that he would soon be done with it all CHAPTER XLIV mister Morse met Martin in the office of the Hotel Metropole Whether he had happened there just casually intent on other affairs or whether he had come there for the direct purpose of inviting him to dinner Martin never could quite make up his mind though he inclined toward the second hypothesis At any rate invited to dinner he was by mister Morse Ruth s father who had forbidden him the house and broken off the engagement Martin was not angry He was not even on his dignity He tolerated mister Morse wondering the while how it felt to eat such humble pie He did not decline the invitation Instead he put it off with vagueness and indefiniteness and inquired after the family particularly after missus Morse and Ruth He spoke her name without hesitancy naturally though secretly surprised that he had had no inward quiver no old familiar increase of pulse and warm surge of blood He had many invitations to dinner some of which he accepted Persons got themselves introduced to him in order to invite him to dinner And he went on puzzling over the little thing that was becoming a great thing Bernard Higginbotham invited him to dinner He puzzled the harder He remembered the days of his desperate starvation when no one invited him to dinner That was the time he needed dinners and went weak and faint for lack of them and lost weight from sheer famine That was the paradox of it When he wanted dinners no one gave them to him and now that he could buy a hundred thousand dinners and was losing his appetite dinners were thrust upon him right and left But why There was no justice in it no merit on his part He was no different All the work he had done was even at that time work performed mister and missus Morse had condemned him for an idler and a shirk and through Ruth had urged that he take a clerk s position in an office Furthermore they had been aware of his work performed Manuscript after manuscript of his had been turned over to them by Ruth They had read them It was the very same work that had put his name in all the papers and it was his name being in all the papers that led them to invite him One thing was certain the Morses had not cared to have him for himself or for his work Therefore they could not want him now for himself or for his work but for the fame that was his because he was somebody amongst men and why not because he had a hundred thousand dollars or so That was the way bourgeois society valued a man and who was he to expect it otherwise But he was proud He disdained such valuation He desired to be valued for himself or for his work which after all was an expression of himself That was the way Lizzie valued him The work with her did not even count She valued him himself That was the way Jimmy the plumber and all the old gang valued him That had been proved often enough in the days when he ran with them it had been proved that Sunday at Shell Mound Park His work could go hang What they liked and were willing to scrap for was just Mart Eden one of the bunch and a pretty good guy Then there was Ruth She had liked him for himself that was indisputable And yet much as she had liked him she had liked the bourgeois standard of valuation more She had opposed his writing and principally it seemed to him because it did not earn money That had been her criticism of his Love cycle She too had urged him to get a job It was true she refined it to position but it meant the same thing and in his own mind the old nomenclature stuck He had read her all that he wrote poems stories essays Wiki Wiki The Shame of the Sun everything And she had always and consistently urged him to get a job to go to work good God as if he hadn t been working robbing sleep exhausting life in order to be worthy of her So the little thing grew bigger He was healthy and normal ate regularly slept long hours and yet the growing little thing was becoming an obsession Work performed The phrase haunted his brain He sat opposite Bernard Higginbotham at a heavy Sunday dinner over Higginbotham s Cash Store and it was all he could do to restrain himself from shouting out It was work performed And now you feed me when then you let me starve forbade me your house and damned me because I wouldn t get a job And the work was already done all done And now when I speak you check the thought unuttered on your lips and hang on my lips and pay respectful attention to whatever I choose to say I tell you your party is rotten and filled with grafters and instead of flying into a rage you hum and haw and admit there is a great deal in what I say And why Because I m famous because I ve a lot of money Not because I m Martin Eden a pretty good fellow and not particularly a fool I could tell you the moon is made of green cheese and you would subscribe to the notion at least you would not repudiate it because I ve got dollars mountains of them And it was all done long ago it was work performed I tell you when you spat upon me as the dirt under your feet But Martin did not shout out The thought gnawed in his brain an unceasing torment while he smiled and succeeded in being tolerant As he grew silent Bernard Higginbotham got the reins and did the talking He was a success himself and proud of it He was self made No one had helped him He owed no man He was fulfilling his duty as a citizen and bringing up a large family And there was Higginbotham s Cash Store that monument of his own industry and ability He loved Higginbotham s Cash Store as some men loved their wives He opened up his heart to Martin showed with what keenness and with what enormous planning he had made the store And he had plans for it ambitious plans The neighborhood was growing up fast The store was really too small If he had more room he would be able to put in a score of labor saving and money saving improvements And he would do it yet He was straining every effort for the day when he could buy the adjoining lot and put up another two story frame building The upstairs he could rent and the whole ground floor of both buildings would be Higginbotham s Cash Store His eyes glistened when he spoke of the new sign that would stretch clear across both buildings Martin forgot to listen The refrain of Work performed in his own brain was drowning the other s clatter The refrain maddened him and he tried to escape from it How much did you say it would cost he asked suddenly His brother in law paused in the middle of an expatiation on the business opportunities of the neighborhood He hadn t said how much it would cost But he knew He had figured it out a score of times At the way lumber is now he said four thousand could do it Including the sign I didn t count on that It d just have to come onc t the buildin was there And the ground Three thousand more He leaned forward licking his lips nervously spreading and closing his fingers while he watched Martin write a check When it was passed over to him he glanced at the amount seven thousand dollars I I can t afford to pay more than six per cent he said huskily Martin wanted to laugh but instead demanded How much would that be Lemme see Six per cent six times seven four hundred an twenty That would be thirty five dollars a month wouldn t it Higginbotham nodded Then if you ve no objection well arrange it this way Martin glanced at Gertrude You can have the principal to keep for yourself if you ll use the thirty five dollars a month for cooking and washing and scrubbing The seven thousand is yours if you ll guarantee that Gertrude does no more drudgery Is it a go mister Higginbotham swallowed hard That his wife should do no more housework was an affront to his thrifty soul The magnificent present was the coating of a pill a bitter pill That his wife should not work It gagged him All right then Martin said I ll pay the thirty five a month and He reached across the table for the check But Bernard Higginbotham got his hand on it first crying I accept I accept When Martin got on the electric car he was very sick and tired He looked up at the assertive sign The swine he groaned The swine the swine When Mackintosh s Magazine published The Palmist featuring it with decorations by Berthier and with two pictures by Wenn Hermann von Schmidt forgot that he had called the verses obscene He announced that his wife had inspired the poem saw to it that the news reached the ears of a reporter and submitted to an interview by a staff writer who was accompanied by a staff photographer and a staff artist The result was a full page in a Sunday supplement filled with photographs and idealized drawings of Marian with many intimate details of Martin Eden and his family and with the full text of The Palmist in large type and republished by special permission of Mackintosh s Magazine It caused quite a stir in the neighborhood and good housewives were proud to have the acquaintances of the great writer s sister while those who had not made haste to cultivate it Hermann von Schmidt chuckled in his little repair shop and decided to order a new lathe Better than advertising he told Marian and it costs nothing We d better have him to dinner she suggested And to dinner Martin came making himself agreeable with the fat wholesale butcher and his fatter wife important folk they likely to be of use to a rising young man like Hermann Von Schmidt No less a bait however had been required to draw them to his house than his great brother in law Another man at table who had swallowed the same bait was the superintendent of the Pacific Coast agencies for the Asa Bicycle Company Him Von Schmidt desired to please and propitiate because from him could be obtained the Oakland agency for the bicycle So Hermann von Schmidt found it a goodly asset to have Martin for a brother in law but in his heart of hearts he couldn t understand where it all came in In the silent watches of the night while his wife slept he had floundered through Martin s books and poems and decided that the world was a fool to buy them And in his heart of hearts Martin understood the situation only too well as he leaned back and gloated at Von Schmidt s head in fancy punching it well nigh off of him sending blow after blow home just right the chuckle headed Dutchman One thing he did like about him however Poor as he was and determined to rise as he was he nevertheless hired one servant to take the heavy work off of Marian s hands Martin talked with the superintendent of the Asa agencies and after dinner he drew him aside with Hermann whom he backed financially for the best bicycle store with fittings in Oakland He went further and in a private talk with Hermann told him to keep his eyes open for an automobile agency and garage for there was no reason that he should not be able to run both establishments successfully With tears in her eyes and her arms around his neck Marian at parting told Martin how much she loved him and always had loved him It was true there was a perceptible halt midway in her assertion which she glossed over with more tears and kisses and incoherent stammerings and which Martin inferred to be her appeal for forgiveness for the time she had lacked faith in him and insisted on his getting a job He can t never keep his money that s sure Hermann von Schmidt confided to his wife He got mad when I spoke of interest an he said damn the principal and if I mentioned it again he d punch my Dutch head off That s what he said my Dutch head But he s all right even if he ain t no business man He s given me my chance an he s all right Invitations to dinner poured in on Martin and the more they poured the more he puzzled He sat the guest of honor at an Arden Club banquet with men of note whom he had heard about and read about all his life and they told him how when they had read The Ring of Bells in the Transcontinental and The Peri and the Pearl in The Hornet they had immediately picked him for a winner My God and I was hungry and in rags he thought to himself Why didn t you give me a dinner then Then was the time It was work performed If you are feeding me now for work performed why did you not feed me then when I needed it Not one word in The Ring of Bells nor in The Peri and the Pearl has been changed No you re not feeding me now for work performed You are feeding me because everybody else is feeding me and because it is an honor to feed me You are feeding me now because you are herd animals because you are part of the mob because the one blind automatic thought in the mob mind just now is to feed me And where does Martin Eden and the work Martin Eden performed come in in all this he asked himself plaintively then arose to respond cleverly and wittily to a clever and witty toast So it went Wherever he happened to be at the Press Club at the Redwood Club at pink teas and literary gatherings always were remembered The Ring of Bells and The Peri and the Pearl when they were first published And always was Martin s maddening and unuttered demand Why didn t you feed me then It was work performed The Ring of Bells and The Peri and the Pearl are not changed one iota They were just as artistic just as worth while then as now But you are not feeding me for their sake nor for the sake of anything else I have written You re feeding me because it is the style of feeding just now because the whole mob is crazy with the idea of feeding Martin Eden And often at such times he would abruptly see slouch in among the company a young hoodlum in square cut coat and under a stiff rim Stetson hat It happened to him at the Gallina Society in Oakland one afternoon As he rose from his chair and stepped forward across the platform he saw stalk through the wide door at the rear of the great room the young hoodlum with the square cut coat and stiff rim hat Five hundred fashionably gowned women turned their heads so intent and steadfast was Martin s gaze to see what he was seeing But they saw only the empty centre aisle He saw the young tough lurching down that aisle and wondered if he would remove the stiff rim which never yet had he seen him without Straight down the aisle he came and up the platform Martin could have wept over that youthful shade of himself when he thought of all that lay before him Across the platform he swaggered right up to Martin and into the foreground of Martin s consciousness disappeared The five hundred women applauded softly with gloved hands seeking to encourage the bashful great man who was their guest And Martin shook the vision from his brain smiled and began to speak The Superintendent of Schools good old man stopped Martin on the street and remembered him recalling seances in his office when Martin was expelled from school for fighting I read your Ring of Bells in one of the magazines quite a time ago he said It was as good as Poe Splendid I said at the time splendid Yes and twice in the months that followed you passed me on the street and did not know me Martin almost said aloud Each time I was hungry and heading for the pawnbroker Yet it was work performed You did not know me then Why do you know me now I was remarking to my wife only the other day the other was saying wouldn t it be a good idea to have you out to dinner some time And she quite agreed with me Yes she quite agreed with me Dinner Martin said so sharply that it was almost a snarl Why yes yes dinner you know just pot luck with us with your old superintendent you rascal he uttered nervously poking Martin in an attempt at jocular fellowship Martin went down the street in a daze He stopped at the corner and looked about him vacantly Well I ll be damned he murmured at last The old fellow was afraid of me CHAPTER XLV Kreis came to Martin one day Kreis of the real dirt and Martin turned to him with relief to receive the glowing details of a scheme sufficiently wild catty to interest him as a fictionist rather than an investor Kreis paused long enough in the midst of his exposition to tell him that in most of his Shame of the Sun he had been a chump But I didn t come here to spout philosophy Kreis went on What I want to know is whether or not you will put a thousand dollars in on this deal No I m not chump enough for that at any rate Martin answered But I ll tell you what I will do You gave me the greatest night of my life You gave me what money cannot buy Now I ve got money and it means nothing to me I d like to turn over to you a thousand dollars of what I don t value for what you gave me that night and which was beyond price You need the money I ve got more than I need You want it You came for it There s no use scheming it out of me Take it Kreis betrayed no surprise He folded the check away in his pocket At that rate I d like the contract of providing you with many such nights he said Too late Martin shook his head That night was the one night for me I was in paradise It s commonplace with you I know But it wasn t to me I shall never live at such a pitch again I m done with philosophy I want never to hear another word of it The first dollar I ever made in my life out of my philosophy Kreis remarked as he paused in the doorway And then the market broke missus Morse drove by Martin on the street one day and smiled and nodded He smiled back and lifted his hat The episode did not affect him A month before it might have disgusted him or made him curious and set him to speculating about her state of consciousness at that moment But now it was not provocative of a second thought He forgot about it the next moment He forgot about it as he would have forgotten the Central Bank Building or the City Hall after having walked past them Yet his mind was preternaturally active His thoughts went ever around and around in a circle The centre of that circle was work performed it ate at his brain like a deathless maggot He awoke to it in the morning It tormented his dreams at night Every affair of life around him that penetrated through his senses immediately related itself to work performed He drove along the path of relentless logic to the conclusion that he was nobody nothing Mart Eden the hoodlum and Mart Eden the sailor had been real had been he but Martin Eden the famous writer did not exist Martin Eden the famous writer was a vapor that had arisen in the mob mind and by the mob mind had been thrust into the corporeal being of Mart Eden the hoodlum and sailor But it couldn t fool him He was not that sun myth that the mob was worshipping and sacrificing dinners to He knew better He read the magazines about himself and pored over portraits of himself published therein until he was unable to associate his identity with those portraits He was the fellow who had lived and thrilled and loved who had been easy going and tolerant of the frailties of life who had served in the forecastle wandered in strange lands and led his gang in the old fighting days He was the fellow who had been stunned at first by the thousands of books in the free library and who had afterward learned his way among them and mastered them he was the fellow who had burned the midnight oil and bedded with a spur and written books himself But the one thing he was not was that colossal appetite that all the mob was bent upon feeding There were things however in the magazines that amused him All the magazines were claiming him Warren s Monthly advertised to its subscribers that it was always on the quest after new writers and that among others it had introduced Martin Eden to the reading public The White Mouse claimed him so did The Northern Review and Mackintosh s Magazine until silenced by The Globe which pointed triumphantly to its files where the mangled Sea Lyrics lay buried Youth and Age which had come to life again after having escaped paying its bills put in a prior claim which nobody but farmers children ever read The Transcontinental made a dignified and convincing statement of how it first discovered Martin Eden which was warmly disputed by The Hornet with the exhibit of The Peri and the Pearl The modest claim of Singletree Darnley company was lost in the din Besides that publishing firm did not own a magazine wherewith to make its claim less modest The newspapers calculated Martin s royalties In some way the magnificent offers certain magazines had made him leaked out and Oakland ministers called upon him in a friendly way while professional begging letters began to clutter his mail But worse than all this were the women His photographs were published broadcast and special writers exploited his strong bronzed face his scars his heavy shoulders his clear quiet eyes and the slight hollows in his cheeks like an ascetic s At this last he remembered his wild youth and smiled Often among the women he met he would see now one now another looking at him appraising him selecting him He laughed to himself He remembered Brissenden s warning and laughed again The women would never destroy him that much was certain He had gone past that stage Once walking with Lizzie toward night school she caught a glance directed toward him by a well gowned handsome woman of the bourgeoisie The glance was a trifle too long a shade too considerative Lizzie knew it for what it was and her body tensed angrily Martin noticed noticed the cause of it told her how used he was becoming to it and that he did not care anyway You ought to care she answered with blazing eyes You re sick That s what s the matter Never healthier in my life I weigh five pounds more than I ever did It ain t your body It s your head Something s wrong with your think machine Even I can see that an I ain t nobody He walked on beside her reflecting I d give anything to see you get over it she broke out impulsively You ought to care when women look at you that way a man like you It s not natural It s all right enough for sissy boys But you ain t made that way So help me I d be willing an glad if the right woman came along an made you care When he left Lizzie at night school he returned to the Metropole Once in his rooms he dropped into a Morris chair and sat staring straight before him He did not doze Nor did he think His mind was a blank save for the intervals when unsummoned memory pictures took form and color and radiance just under his eyelids He saw these pictures but he was scarcely conscious of them no more so than if they had been dreams Yet he was not asleep Once he roused himself and glanced at his watch It was just eight o clock He had nothing to do and it was too early for bed Then his mind went blank again and the pictures began to form and vanish under his eyelids There was nothing distinctive about the pictures They were always masses of leaves and shrub like branches shot through with hot sunshine A knock at the door aroused him He was not asleep and his mind immediately connected the knock with a telegram or letter or perhaps one of the servants bringing back clean clothes from the laundry He was thinking about Joe and wondering where he was as he said Come in He was still thinking about Joe and did not turn toward the door He heard it close softly There was a long silence He forgot that there had been a knock at the door and was still staring blankly before him when he heard a woman s sob It was involuntary spasmodic checked and stifled he noted that as he turned about The next instant he was on his feet Ruth he said amazed and bewildered Her face was white and strained She stood just inside the door one hand against it for support the other pressed to her side She extended both hands toward him piteously and started forward to meet him As he caught her hands and led her to the Morris chair he noticed how cold they were He drew up another chair and sat down on the broad arm of it He was too confused to speak In his own mind his affair with Ruth was closed and sealed He felt much in the same way that he would have felt had the Shelly Hot Springs Laundry suddenly invaded the Hotel Metropole with a whole week s washing ready for him to pitch into Several times he was about to speak and each time he hesitated No one knows I am here Ruth said in a faint voice with an appealing smile What did you say He was surprised at the sound of his own voice She repeated her words Oh he said then wondered what more he could possibly say I saw you come in and I waited a few minutes Oh he said again He had never been so tongue tied in his life Positively he did not have an idea in his head He felt stupid and awkward but for the life of him he could think of nothing to say It would have been easier had the intrusion been the Shelly Hot Springs laundry He could have rolled up his sleeves and gone to work And then you came in he said finally She nodded with a slightly arch expression and loosened the scarf at her throat I saw you first from across the street when you were with that girl Oh yes he said simply I took her down to night school Well aren t you glad to see me she said at the end of another silence Yes yes He spoke hastily But wasn t it rash of you to come here I slipped in Nobody knows I am here I wanted to see you I came to tell you I have been very foolish I came because I could no longer stay away because my heart compelled me to come because because I wanted to come She came forward out of her chair and over to him She rested her hand on his shoulder a moment breathing quickly and then slipped into his arms And in his large easy way desirous of not inflicting hurt knowing that to repulse this proffer of herself was to inflict the most grievous hurt a woman could receive he folded his arms around her and held her close But there was no warmth in the embrace no caress in the contact She had come into his arms and he held her that was all She nestled against him and then with a change of position her hands crept up and rested upon his neck But his flesh was not fire beneath those hands and he felt awkward and uncomfortable What makes you tremble so he asked Is it a chill Shall I light the grate He made a movement to disengage himself but she clung more closely to him shivering violently It is merely nervousness she said with chattering teeth I ll control myself in a minute There I am better already Slowly her shivering died away He continued to hold her but he was no longer puzzled He knew now for what she had come My mother wanted me to marry Charley Hapgood she announced Charley Hapgood that fellow who speaks always in platitudes Martin groaned Then he added And now I suppose your mother wants you to marry me He did not put it in the form of a question He stated it as a certitude and before his eyes began to dance the rows of figures of his royalties She will not object I know that much Ruth said She considers me quite eligible Ruth nodded And yet I am not a bit more eligible now than I was when she broke our engagement he meditated I haven t changed any I m the same Martin Eden though for that matter I m a bit worse I smoke now Don t you smell my breath In reply she pressed her open fingers against his lips placed them graciously and playfully and in expectancy of the kiss that of old had always been a consequence But there was no caressing answer of Martin s lips He waited until the fingers were removed and then went on I am not changed I haven t got a job I m not looking for a job Furthermore I am not going to look for a job And I still believe that Herbert Spencer is a great and noble man and that Judge Blount is an unmitigated ass I had dinner with him the other night so I ought to know But you didn t accept father s invitation she chided So you know about that Who sent him Your mother She remained silent Then she did send him I thought so And now I suppose she has sent you No one knows that I am here she protested Do you think my mother would permit this She d permit you to marry me that s certain She gave a sharp cry Oh Martin don t be cruel You have not kissed me once You are as unresponsive as a stone And think what I have dared to do She looked about her with a shiver though half the look was curiosity Just think of where I am I could die for you I could die for you Lizzie s words were ringing in his ears Why didn t you dare it before he asked harshly When I hadn t a job When I was starving When I was just as I am now as a man as an artist the same Martin Eden That s the question I ve been propounding to myself for many a day not concerning you merely but concerning everybody You see I have not changed though my sudden apparent appreciation in value compels me constantly to reassure myself on that point I ve got the same flesh on my bones the same ten fingers and toes I am the same I have not developed any new strength nor virtue My brain is the same old brain I haven t made even one new generalization on literature or philosophy I am personally of the same value that I was when nobody wanted me And what is puzzling me is why they want me now Surely they don t want me for myself for myself is the same old self they did not want Then they must want me for something else for something that is outside of me for something that is not I Shall I tell you what that something is It is for the recognition I have received That recognition is not I It resides in the minds of others Then again for the money I have earned and am earning But that money is not I It resides in banks and in the pockets of Tom Dick and Harry And is it for that for the recognition and the money that you now want me You are breaking my heart she sobbed You know I love you that I am here because I love you I am afraid you don t see my point he said gently What I mean is if you love me how does it happen that you love me now so much more than you did when your love was weak enough to deny me Forget and forgive she cried passionately I loved you all the time remember that and I am here now in your arms I m afraid I am a shrewd merchant peering into the scales trying to weigh your love and find out what manner of thing it is She withdrew herself from his arms sat upright and looked at him long and searchingly She was about to speak then faltered and changed her mind You see it appears this way to me he went on When I was all that I am now nobody out of my own class seemed to care for me When my books were all written no one who had read the manuscripts seemed to care for them In point of fact because of the stuff I had written they seemed to care even less for me In writing the stuff it seemed that I had committed acts that were to say the least derogatory Get a job everybody said She made a movement of dissent Yes yes he said except in your case you told me to get a position The homely word job like much that I have written offends you It is brutal But I assure you it was no less brutal to me when everybody I knew recommended it to me as they would recommend right conduct to an immoral creature But to return The publication of what I had written and the public notice I received wrought a change in the fibre of your love Martin Eden with his work all performed you would not marry Your love for him was not strong enough to enable you to marry him But your love is now strong enough and I cannot avoid the conclusion that its strength arises from the publication and the public notice In your case I do not mention royalties though I am certain that they apply to the change wrought in your mother and father Of course all this is not flattering to me But worst of all it makes me question love sacred love Is love so gross a thing that it must feed upon publication and public notice It would seem so I have sat and thought upon it till my head went around Poor dear head She reached up a hand and passed the fingers soothingly through his hair Let it go around no more Let us begin anew now I loved you all the time I know that I was weak in yielding to my mother s will I should not have done so Yet I have heard you speak so often with broad charity of the fallibility and frailty of humankind Extend that charity to me I acted mistakenly Forgive me Oh I do forgive he said impatiently It is easy to forgive where there is really nothing to forgive Nothing that you have done requires forgiveness One acts according to one s lights and more than that one cannot do As well might I ask you to forgive me for my not getting a job I meant well she protested You know that I could not have loved you and not meant well True but you would have destroyed me out of your well meaning Yes yes he shut off her attempted objection You would have destroyed my writing and my career Realism is imperative to my nature and the bourgeois spirit hates realism The bourgeoisie is cowardly It is afraid of life And all your effort was to make me afraid of life You would have formalized me You would have compressed me into a two by four pigeonhole of life where all life s values are unreal and false and vulgar He felt her stir protestingly Vulgarity a hearty vulgarity I ll admit is the basis of bourgeois refinement and culture As I say you wanted to formalize me to make me over into one of your own class with your class ideals class values and class prejudices He shook his head sadly And you do not understand even now what I am saying My words do not mean to you what I endeavor to make them mean What I say is so much fantasy to you Yet to me it is vital reality At the best you are a trifle puzzled and amused that this raw boy crawling up out of the mire of the abyss should pass judgment upon your class and call it vulgar She leaned her head wearily against his shoulder and her body shivered with recurrent nervousness He waited for a time for her to speak and then went on And now you want to renew our love You want us to be married You want me And yet listen if my books had not been noticed I d nevertheless have been just what I am now And you would have stayed away It is all those damned books Don t swear she interrupted Her reproof startled him He broke into a harsh laugh That s it he said at a high moment when what seems your life s happiness is at stake you are afraid of life in the same old way afraid of life and a healthy oath She was stung by his words into realization of the puerility of her act and yet she felt that he had magnified it unduly and was consequently resentful They sat in silence for a long time she thinking desperately and he pondering upon his love which had departed He knew now that he had not really loved her It was an idealized Ruth he had loved an ethereal creature of his own creating the bright and luminous spirit of his love poems The real bourgeois Ruth with all the bourgeois failings and with the hopeless cramp of the bourgeois psychology in her mind he had never loved She suddenly began to speak I know that much you have said is so I have been afraid of life I did not love you well enough I have learned to love better I love you for what you are for what you were for the ways even by which you have become I love you for the ways wherein you differ from what you call my class for your beliefs which I do not understand but which I know I can come to understand I shall devote myself to understanding them And even your smoking and your swearing they are part of you and I will love you for them too I can still learn In the last ten minutes I have learned much That I have dared to come here is a token of what I have already learned Oh Martin She was sobbing and nestling close against him For the first time his arms folded her gently and with sympathy and she acknowledged it with a happy movement and a brightening face It is too late he said He remembered Lizzie s words I am a sick man oh not my body It is my soul my brain I seem to have lost all values I care for nothing If you had been this way a few months ago it would have been different It is too late now It is not too late she cried I will show you I will prove to you that my love has grown that it is greater to me than my class and all that is dearest to me All that is dearest to the bourgeoisie I will flout I am no longer afraid of life I will leave my father and mother and let my name become a by word with my friends I will come to you here and now in free love if you will and I will be proud and glad to be with you If I have been a traitor to love I will now for love s sake be a traitor to all that made that earlier treason She stood before him with shining eyes I am waiting Martin she whispered waiting for you to accept me Look at me It was splendid he thought looking at her She had redeemed herself for all that she had lacked rising up at last true woman superior to the iron rule of bourgeois convention It was splendid magnificent desperate And yet what was the matter with him He was not thrilled nor stirred by what she had done It was splendid and magnificent only intellectually In what should have been a moment of fire he coldly appraised her His heart was untouched He was unaware of any desire for her Again he remembered Lizzie s words I am sick very sick he said with a despairing gesture How sick I did not know till now Something has gone out of me I have always been unafraid of life but I never dreamed of being sated with life Life has so filled me that I am empty of any desire for anything If there were room I should want you now You see how sick I am He leaned his head back and closed his eyes and like a child crying that forgets its grief in watching the sunlight percolate through the tear dimmed films over the pupils so Martin forgot his sickness the presence of Ruth everything in watching the masses of vegetation shot through hotly with sunshine that took form and blazed against this background of his eyelids It was not restful that green foliage The sunlight was too raw and glaring It hurt him to look at it and yet he looked he knew not why He was brought back to himself by the rattle of the door knob Ruth was at the door How shall I get out she questioned tearfully I am afraid Oh forgive me he cried springing to his feet I m not myself you know I forgot you were here He put his hand to his head You see I m not just right I ll take you home We can go out by the servants entrance No one will see us Pull down that veil and everything will be all right She clung to his arm through the dim lighted passages and down the narrow stairs I am safe now she said when they emerged on the sidewalk at the same time starting to take her hand from his arm No no I ll see you home he answered No please don t she objected It is unnecessary Again she started to remove her hand He felt a momentary curiosity Now that she was out of danger she was afraid She was in almost a panic to be quit of him He could see no reason for it and attributed it to her nervousness So he restrained her withdrawing hand and started to walk on with her Halfway down the block he saw a man in a long overcoat shrink back into a doorway He shot a glance in as he passed by and despite the high turned up collar he was certain that he recognized Ruth s brother Norman During the walk Ruth and Martin held little conversation She was stunned He was apathetic Once he mentioned that he was going away back to the South Seas and once she asked him to forgive her having come to him And that was all The parting at her door was conventional They shook hands said good night and he lifted his hat The door swung shut and he lighted a cigarette and turned back for his hotel When he came to the doorway into which he had seen Norman shrink he stopped and looked in in a speculative humor She lied he said aloud She made believe to me that she had dared greatly and all the while she knew the brother that brought her was waiting to take her back He burst into laughter Oh these bourgeois When I was broke I was not fit to be seen with his sister When I have a bank account he brings her to me As he swung on his heel to go on a tramp going in the same direction begged him over his shoulder Say mister can you give me a quarter to get a bed were the words But it was the voice that made Martin turn around The next instant he had Joe by the hand D ye remember that time we parted at the Hot Springs the other was saying I said then we d meet again I felt it in my bones An here we are You re looking good Martin said admiringly and you ve put on weight I sure have Joe s face was beaming I never knew what it was to live till I hit hoboin I m thirty pounds heavier an feel tiptop all the time Why I was worked to skin an bone in them old days Hoboin sure agrees with me But you re looking for a bed just the same Martin chided and it s a cold night Huh Lookin for a bed Joe shot a hand into his hip pocket and brought it out filled with small change That beats hard graft he exulted You just looked good that s why I battered you Martin laughed and gave in You ve several full sized drunks right there he insinuated Joe slid the money back into his pocket Not in mine he announced No gettin oryide for me though there ain t nothin to stop me except I don t want to I ve ben drunk once since I seen you last an then it was unexpected bein on an empty stomach When I work like a beast I drink like a beast When I live like a man I drink like a man a jolt now an again when I feel like it an that s all Martin arranged to meet him next day and went on to the hotel He paused in the office to look up steamer sailings The Mariposa sailed for Tahiti in five days Telephone over to morrow and reserve a stateroom for me he told the clerk No deck stateroom but down below on the weather side the port side remember that the port side You d better write it down Once in his room he got into bed and slipped off to sleep as gently as a child The occurrences of the evening had made no impression on him His mind was dead to impressions The glow of warmth with which he met Joe had been most fleeting The succeeding minute he had been bothered by the ex laundryman s presence and by the compulsion of conversation That in five more days he sailed for his loved South Seas meant nothing to him So he closed his eyes and slept normally and comfortably for eight uninterrupted hours He was not restless He did not change his position nor did he dream Sleep had become to him oblivion and each day that he awoke he awoke with regret Life worried and bored him and time was a vexation CHAPTER XLVI Say Joe was his greeting to his old time working mate next morning there s a Frenchman out on Twenty eighth Street He s made a pot of money and he s going back to France It s a dandy well appointed small steam laundry There s a start for you if you want to settle down Here take this buy some clothes with it and be at this man s office by ten o clock He looked up the laundry for me and he ll take you out and show you around If you like it and think it is worth the price twelve thousand let me know and it is yours Now run along I m busy I ll see you later Now look here Mart the other said slowly with kindling anger I come here this mornin to see you Savve I didn t come here to get no laundry I come a here for a talk for old friends sake and you shove a laundry at me I tell you what you can do You can take that laundry an go to hell He was out of the room when Martin caught him and whirled him around Now look here Joe he said if you act that way I ll punch your head An for old friends sake I ll punch it hard Savve you will will you Joe had clinched and attempted to throw him and he was twisting and writhing out of the advantage of the other s hold They reeled about the room locked in each other s arms and came down with a crash across the splintered wreckage of a wicker chair Joe was underneath with arms spread out and held and with Martin s knee on his chest He was panting and gasping for breath when Martin released him Now we ll talk a moment Martin said You can t get fresh with me I want that laundry business finished first of all Then you can come back and we ll talk for old sake s sake I told you I was busy Look at that A servant had just come in with the morning mail a great mass of letters and magazines How can I wade through that and talk with you You go and fix up that laundry and then we ll get together All right Joe admitted reluctantly I thought you was turnin me down but I guess I was mistaken But you can t lick me Mart in a stand up fight I ve got the reach on you We ll put on the gloves sometime and see Martin said with a smile Sure as soon as I get that laundry going Joe extended his arm You see that reach It ll make you go a few Martin heaved a sigh of relief when the door closed behind the laundryman He was becoming anti social Daily he found it a severer strain to be decent with people Their presence perturbed him and the effort of conversation irritated him They made him restless and no sooner was he in contact with them than he was casting about for excuses to get rid of them He did not proceed to attack his mail and for a half hour he lolled in his chair doing nothing while no more than vague half formed thoughts occasionally filtered through his intelligence or rather at wide intervals themselves constituted the flickering of his intelligence He roused himself and began glancing through his mail There were a dozen requests for autographs he knew them at sight there were professional begging letters and there were letters from cranks ranging from the man with a working model of perpetual motion and the man who demonstrated that the surface of the earth was the inside of a hollow sphere to the man seeking financial aid to purchase the Peninsula of Lower California for the purpose of communist colonization There were letters from women seeking to know him and over one such he smiled for enclosed was her receipt for pew rent sent as evidence of her good faith and as proof of her respectability Editors and publishers contributed to the daily heap of letters the former on their knees for his manuscripts the latter on their knees for his books his poor disdained manuscripts that had kept all he possessed in pawn for so many dreary months in order to find them in postage There were unexpected checks for English serial rights and for advance payments on foreign translations His English agent announced the sale of German translation rights in three of his books and informed him that Swedish editions from which he could expect nothing because Sweden was not a party to the Berne Convention were already on the market Then there was a nominal request for his permission for a Russian translation that country being likewise outside the Berne Convention He turned to the huge bundle of clippings which had come in from his press bureau and read about himself and his vogue which had become a furore All his creative output had been flung to the public in one magnificent sweep That seemed to account for it He had taken the public off its feet the way Kipling had that time when he lay near to death and all the mob animated by a mob mind thought began suddenly to read him Martin remembered how that same world mob having read him and acclaimed him and not understood him in the least had abruptly a few months later flung itself upon him and torn him to pieces Martin grinned at the thought Who was he that he should not be similarly treated in a few more months Well he would fool the mob He would be away in the South Seas building his grass house trading for pearls and copra jumping reefs in frail outriggers catching sharks and bonitas hunting wild goats among the cliffs of the valley that lay next to the valley of Taiohae In the moment of that thought the desperateness of his situation dawned upon him He saw cleared eyed that he was in the Valley of the Shadow All the life that was in him was fading fainting making toward death He realized how much he slept and how much he desired to sleep Of old he had hated sleep It had robbed him of precious moments of living Four hours of sleep in the twenty four had meant being robbed of four hours of life How he had grudged sleep Now it was life he grudged Life was not good its taste in his mouth was without tang and bitter This was his peril Life that did not yearn toward life was in fair way toward ceasing Some remote instinct for preservation stirred in him and he knew he must get away He glanced about the room and the thought of packing was burdensome Perhaps it would be better to leave that to the last In the meantime he might be getting an outfit He put on his hat and went out stopping in at a gun store where he spent the remainder of the morning buying automatic rifles ammunition and fishing tackle Fashions changed in trading and he knew he would have to wait till he reached Tahiti before ordering his trade goods They could come up from Australia anyway This solution was a source of pleasure He had avoided doing something and the doing of anything just now was unpleasant He went back to the hotel gladly with a feeling of satisfaction in that the comfortable Morris chair was waiting for him and he groaned inwardly on entering his room at sight of Joe in the Morris chair Joe was delighted with the laundry Everything was settled and he would enter into possession next day Martin lay on the bed with closed eyes while the other talked on Martin s thoughts were far away so far away that he was rarely aware that he was thinking It was only by an effort that he occasionally responded And yet this was Joe whom he had always liked But Joe was too keen with life The boisterous impact of it on Martin s jaded mind was a hurt It was an aching probe to his tired sensitiveness When Joe reminded him that sometime in the future they were going to put on the gloves together he could almost have screamed Remember Joe you re to run the laundry according to those old rules you used to lay down at Shelly Hot Springs he said No overworking No working at night And no children at the mangles No children anywhere And a fair wage Joe nodded and pulled out a note book Look at here I was workin out them rules before breakfast this A M What d ye think of them He read them aloud and Martin approved worrying at the same time as to when Joe would take himself off It was late afternoon when he awoke Slowly the fact of life came back to him He glanced about the room Joe had evidently stolen away after he had dozed off That was considerate of Joe he thought Then he closed his eyes and slept again In the days that followed Joe was too busy organizing and taking hold of the laundry to bother him much and it was not until the day before sailing that the newspapers made the announcement that he had taken passage on the Mariposa Once when the instinct of preservation fluttered he went to a doctor and underwent a searching physical examination Nothing could be found the matter with him His heart and lungs were pronounced magnificent Every organ so far as the doctor could know was normal and was working normally There is nothing the matter with you mister Eden he said positively nothing the matter with you You are in the pink of condition Candidly I envy you your health It is superb Look at that chest There and in your stomach lies the secret of your remarkable constitution Physically you are a man in a thousand in ten thousand Barring accidents you should live to be a hundred And Martin knew that Lizzie s diagnosis had been correct Physically he was all right It was his think machine that had gone wrong and there was no cure for that except to get away to the South Seas The trouble was that now on the verge of departure he had no desire to go The South Seas charmed him no more than did bourgeois civilization There was no zest in the thought of departure while the act of departure appalled him as a weariness of the flesh He would have felt better if he were already on board and gone The last day was a sore trial Having read of his sailing in the morning papers Bernard Higginbotham Gertrude and all the family came to say good by as did Hermann von Schmidt and Marian Then there was business to be transacted bills to be paid and everlasting reporters to be endured He said good by to Lizzie Connolly abruptly at the entrance to night school and hurried away At the hotel he found Joe too busy all day with the laundry to have come to him earlier It was the last straw but Martin gripped the arms of his chair and talked and listened for half an hour You know Joe he said that you are not tied down to that laundry There are no strings on it You can sell it any time and blow the money Any time you get sick of it and want to hit the road just pull out Do what will make you the happiest Joe shook his head No more road in mine thank you kindly Hoboin s all right exceptin for one thing the girls I can t help it but I m a ladies man I can t get along without em and you ve got to get along without em when you re hoboin The times I ve passed by houses where dances an parties was goin on an heard the women laugh an saw their white dresses and smiling faces through the windows Gee I tell you them moments was plain hell I like dancin an picnics an walking in the moonlight an all the rest too well Me for the laundry and a good front with big iron dollars clinkin in my jeans I seen a girl already just yesterday and d ye know I m feelin already I d just as soon marry her as not I ve ben whistlin all day at the thought of it She s a beaut with the kindest eyes and softest voice you ever heard Me for her you can stack on that Say why don t you get married with all this money to burn You could get the finest girl in the land Martin shook his head with a smile but in his secret heart he was wondering why any man wanted to marry It seemed an amazing and incomprehensible thing From the deck of the Mariposa at the sailing hour he saw Lizzie Connolly hiding in the skirts of the crowd on the wharf Take her with you came the thought It is easy to be kind She will be supremely happy It was almost a temptation one moment and the succeeding moment it became a terror He was in a panic at the thought of it His tired soul cried out in protest He turned away from the rail with a groan muttering Man you are too sick you are too sick He fled to his stateroom where he lurked until the steamer was clear of the dock In the dining saloon at luncheon he found himself in the place of honor at the captain s right and he was not long in discovering that he was the great man on board But no more unsatisfactory great man ever sailed on a ship He spent the afternoon in a deck chair with closed eyes dozing brokenly most of the time and in the evening went early to bed After the second day recovered from seasickness the full passenger list was in evidence and the more he saw of the passengers the more he disliked them Yet he knew that he did them injustice They were good and kindly people he forced himself to acknowledge and in the moment of acknowledgment he qualified good and kindly like all the bourgeoisie with all the psychological cramp and intellectual futility of their kind they bored him when they talked with him their little superficial minds were so filled with emptiness while the boisterous high spirits and the excessive energy of the younger people shocked him They were never quiet ceaselessly playing deck quoits tossing rings promenading or rushing to the rail with loud cries to watch the leaping porpoises and the first schools of flying fish He slept much After breakfast he sought his deck chair with a magazine he never finished The printed pages tired him He puzzled that men found so much to write about and puzzling dozed in his chair When the gong awoke him for luncheon he was irritated that he must awaken There was no satisfaction in being awake Once he tried to arouse himself from his lethargy and went forward into the forecastle with the sailors But the breed of sailors seemed to have changed since the days he had lived in the forecastle He could find no kinship with these stolid faced ox minded bestial creatures He was in despair Up above nobody had wanted Martin Eden for his own sake and he could not go back to those of his own class who had wanted him in the past He did not want them He could not stand them any more than he could stand the stupid first cabin passengers and the riotous young people Life was to him like strong white light that hurts the tired eyes of a sick person During every conscious moment life blazed in a raw glare around him and upon him It hurt It hurt intolerably It was the first time in his life that Martin had travelled first class On ships at sea he had always been in the forecastle the steerage or in the black depths of the coal hold passing coal In those days climbing up the iron ladders out the pit of stifling heat he had often caught glimpses of the passengers in cool white doing nothing but enjoy themselves under awnings spread to keep the sun and wind away from them with subservient stewards taking care of their every want and whim and it had seemed to him that the realm in which they moved and had their being was nothing else than paradise Well here he was the great man on board in the midmost centre of it sitting at the captain s right hand and yet vainly harking back to forecastle and stoke hole in quest of the Paradise he had lost He had found no new one and now he could not find the old one He strove to stir himself and find something to interest him He ventured the petty officers mess and was glad to get away He talked with a quartermaster off duty an intelligent man who promptly prodded him with the socialist propaganda and forced into his hands a bunch of leaflets and pamphlets He listened to the man expounding the slave morality and as he listened he thought languidly of his own Nietzsche philosophy But what was it worth after all He remembered one of Nietzsche s mad utterances wherein that madman had doubted truth And who was to say Perhaps Nietzsche had been right Perhaps there was no truth in anything no truth in truth no such thing as truth But his mind wearied quickly and he was content to go back to his chair and doze Miserable as he was on the steamer a new misery came upon him What when the steamer reached Tahiti He would have to go ashore He would have to order his trade goods to find a passage on a schooner to the Marquesas to do a thousand and one things that were awful to contemplate Whenever he steeled himself deliberately to think he could see the desperate peril in which he stood In all truth he was in the Valley of the Shadow and his danger lay in that he was not afraid If he were only afraid he would make toward life Being unafraid he was drifting deeper into the shadow He found no delight in the old familiar things of life The Mariposa was now in the northeast trades and this wine of wind surging against him irritated him He had his chair moved to escape the embrace of this lusty comrade of old days and nights The day the Mariposa entered the doldrums Martin was more miserable than ever He could no longer sleep He was soaked with sleep and perforce he must now stay awake and endure the white glare of life He moved about restlessly The air was sticky and humid and the rain squalls were unrefreshing He ached with life He walked around the deck until that hurt too much then sat in his chair until he was compelled to walk again He forced himself at last to finish the magazine and from the steamer library he culled several volumes of poetry But they could not hold him and once more he took to walking He stayed late on deck after dinner but that did not help him for when he went below he could not sleep This surcease from life had failed him It was too much He turned on the electric light and tried to read One of the volumes was a Swinburne He lay in bed glancing through its pages until suddenly he became aware that he was reading with interest He finished the stanza attempted to read on then came back to it He rested the book face downward on his breast and fell to thinking That was it The very thing Strange that it had never come to him before That was the meaning of it all he had been drifting that way all the time and now Swinburne showed him that it was the happy way out He wanted rest and here was rest awaiting him He glanced at the open port hole Yes it was large enough For the first time in weeks he felt happy At last he had discovered the cure of his ill He picked up the book and read the stanza slowly aloud From too much love of living From hope and fear set free We thank with brief thanksgiving Whatever gods may be That no life lives forever That dead men rise up never That even the weariest river Winds somewhere safe to sea He looked again at the open port Swinburne had furnished the key Life was ill or rather it had become ill an unbearable thing That dead men rise up never That line stirred him with a profound feeling of gratitude It was the one beneficent thing in the universe When life became an aching weariness death was ready to soothe away to everlasting sleep But what was he waiting for It was time to go He arose and thrust his head out the port hole looking down into the milky wash The Mariposa was deeply loaded and hanging by his hands his feet would be in the water He could slip in noiselessly No one would hear A smother of spray dashed up wetting his face It tasted salt on his lips and the taste was good He wondered if he ought to write a swan song but laughed the thought away There was no time He was too impatient to be gone Turning off the light in his room so that it might not betray him he went out the port hole feet first His shoulders stuck and he forced himself back so as to try it with one arm down by his side A roll of the steamer aided him and he was through hanging by his hands When his feet touched the sea he let go He was in a milky froth of water The side of the Mariposa rushed past him like a dark wall broken here and there by lighted ports She was certainly making time Almost before he knew it he was astern swimming gently on the foam crackling surface A bonita struck at his white body and he laughed aloud It had taken a piece out and the sting of it reminded him of why he was there In the work to do he had forgotten the purpose of it The lights of the Mariposa were growing dim in the distance and there he was swimming confidently as though it were his intention to make for the nearest land a thousand miles or so away It was the automatic instinct to live He ceased swimming but the moment he felt the water rising above his mouth the hands struck out sharply with a lifting movement The will to live was his thought and the thought was accompanied by a sneer Well he had will ay will strong enough that with one last exertion it could destroy itself and cease to be He changed his position to a vertical one He glanced up at the quiet stars at the same time emptying his lungs of air With swift vigorous propulsion of hands and feet he lifted his shoulders and half his chest out of water This was to gain impetus for the descent Then he let himself go and sank without movement a white statue into the sea He breathed in the water deeply deliberately after the manner of a man taking an anaesthetic When he strangled quite involuntarily his arms and legs clawed the water and drove him up to the surface and into the clear sight of the stars The will to live he thought disdainfully vainly endeavoring not to breathe the air into his bursting lungs Well he would have to try a new way He filled his lungs with air filled them full This supply would take him far down He turned over and went down head first swimming with all his strength and all his will Deeper and deeper he went His eyes were open and he watched the ghostly phosphorescent trails of the darting bonita As he swam he hoped that they would not strike at him for it might snap the tension of his will But they did not strike and he found time to be grateful for this last kindness of life Down down he swam till his arms and leg grew tired and hardly moved He knew that he was deep The pressure on his ear drums was a pain and there was a buzzing in his head His endurance was faltering but he compelled his arms and legs to drive him deeper until his will snapped and the air drove from his lungs in a great explosive rush The bubbles rubbed and bounded like tiny balloons against his cheeks and eyes as they took their upward flight Then came pain and strangulation This hurt was not death was the thought that oscillated through his reeling consciousness Death did not hurt It was life the pangs of life this awful suffocating feeling it was the last blow life could deal him His wilful hands and feet began to beat and churn about spasmodically and feebly But he had fooled them and the will to live that made them beat and churn He was too deep down They could never bring him to the surface He seemed floating languidly in a sea of dreamy vision Colors and radiances surrounded him and bathed him and pervaded him What was that It seemed a lighthouse but it was inside his brain a flashing bright white light It flashed swifter and swifter There was a long rumble of sound and it seemed to him that he was falling down a vast and interminable stairway And somewhere at the bottom he fell into darkness That much he knew He had fallen into darkness And at the instant he knew he ceased to know END OF
