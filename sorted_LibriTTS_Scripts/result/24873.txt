none	none	ve had this summer so far That big spotted one must weigh near a pound He s a beauty They re a good price over at the hotels now too I ll go home and get my dinner and go straight over with them That ll leave me time for another try at them about sunset Whew how hot it is I must take Ella May home a bunch of them blue flags They re real handsome He tied his skiff under the crowding alders gathered a big bunch of the purple flag lilies with their silky petals and started homeward whistling cheerily as he stepped briskly along the fern carpeted wood path that wound up the hill under the beeches and firs He was a freckled sunburned lad of thirteen years His neighbours all said that Danny was as smart as a steel trap and immediately added that they wondered where he got his smartness from certainly not from his father The elder Phillips had been denominated shiftless and slack twisted by all who ever had any dealings with him in his unlucky aimless life one of those improvident easygoing souls who sit contentedly down to breakfast with a very faint idea where their dinner is to come from When he had died no one had missed him unless it were his patient sad eyed wife who bravely faced her hard lot and toiled unremittingly to keep a home for her two children Dan and a girl two years younger who was a helpless cripple suffering from some form of spinal disease Dan who was old and steady for his years had gone manfully to work to assist his mother Though he had been disappointed in all his efforts to obtain steady employment he was active and obliging and earned many a small amount by odd jobs around the village and by helping the Carleton farmers in planting and harvest For the last two years however his most profitable source of summer income had been the trout pond The former owner had allowed anyone who wished to fish in his pond and Dan made a regular business of it selling his trout at the big hotels over at Mosquito Lake This in spite of its unattractive name was a popular summer resort and Dan always found a ready market for his catch When mister Walters purchased the property it somehow never occurred to Dan that the new owner might not be so complaisant as his predecessor in the matter of the best trouting pond in the country To be sure Dan often wondered why it was the pond was so deserted this summer He could not recall having seen a single person on it save himself Still it did not cross his mind that there could be any particular reason for this He always fished up in the cool dim creeks which long experience had taught him were best for trout and came and went by a convenient wood path but he had no thought of concealment in so doing He would not have cared had all Carleton seen him He had done very well with his fish so far and prices for trout at the Lake went up every day Dan was an enterprising boy and a general favourite with the hotel owners They knew that he could always be depended on missus Phillips met him at the door when he reached home See Mother said Dan exultantly as he held up his fish Just look at that fellow will you A pound if he s an ounce I ought to get a good price for these I can tell you Let me have my dinner now and I ll go right over to the Lake with them It s a long walk for you Danny replied his mother pityingly and it s too hot to go so far I m afraid you ll get sun struck or something You d better wait till the cool of the evening You re looking real pale and thin this while back Oh I m all right Mother assured Dan cheerfully I don t mind the heat a bit A fellow must put up with some inconveniences Wait till I bring home the money for these fish And I mean to have another catch tonight It s you that s looking tired I wish you didn t have to work so hard Mother If I could only get a good place you could take it easier Sam French says that mister Walters wants a boy up there at the factory but I know I wouldn t do I ain t big enough Perhaps something will turn up soon though When our ship comes in Mother we ll have our good times He picked up his flags and went into the little room where his sister lay See what I ve brought you Ella May he said as he thrust the cool moist clusters into her thin eager hands Did you ever see such beauties Oh Dan how lovely they are Thank you ever so much If you are going over to the Lake this afternoon will you please call at missus Henny s and get those nutmeg geranium slips she promised me Just look how nice my others are growing The pink one is going to bloom I ll bring you all the geranium slips at the Lake if you like When I get rich Ella May I ll build you a big conservatory and I ll get every flower in the world in it for you You shall just live and sleep among posies Is dinner ready Mother Trouting s hungry work I tell you What paper is this He picked up a folded newspaper from the table Oh that s only an old Lake Advertiser answered missus Phillips as she placed the potatoes on the table and wiped her moist hot face with the corner of her gingham apron Letty Mills brought it in around a parcel this morning It s four weeks old but I kept it to read if I ever get time It s so seldom we see a paper of any kind nowadays But I haven t looked at it yet Why Danny what on earth is the matter For Dan who had opened the paper and glanced over the first page suddenly gave a choked exclamation and turned pale staring stupidly at the sheet before him See Mother he gasped as she came up in alarm and looked over his shoulder This is what they read Notice Anyone found fishing on my pond at Carleton after date will be prosecuted according to law without respect of persons June First H C Walters Oh Danny what does it mean Dan went and carefully closed the door of Ella May s room before he replied His face was pale and his voice shaky Mean Well Mother it just means that I ve been stealing mister Walters s trout all summer stealing them That s what it means Oh Danny But you didn t know No but I ought to have remembered that he was the new owner and have asked him I never thought Mother what does prosecuted according to law mean I don t know I m sure Danny But if this is so there s only one thing to be done You must go straight to mister Walters and tell him all about it Mother I don t dare to He is a dreadfully hard man Sam French s father says I wouldn t believe a word Sam French s father says about mister Walters said missus Phillips firmly He s got a spite against him because he was dismissed Besides Danny it s the only right thing to do You know that We re poor but we have never done anything underhand yet Yes Mother I know said Dan gulping his fear bravely down I ll go of course right after dinner I was only scared at first I ll tell you what I ll do I ll clean these trout nicely and take them to mister Walters and tell him that if he ll only give me time I ll pay him back every cent of money I got for all I sold this summer Then maybe he ll let me off seeing as I didn t know about the notice I ll go with you Danny No I ll go alone Mother You needn t go with me said Dan heroically To himself he said that his mother had troubles enough He would never subject her to the added ordeal of an interview with the stern factory owner He would beard the lion in his den himself if it had to be done Don t tell Ella May anything about it It would worry her And don t cry Mother I guess it ll be all right Let me have my dinner now and I ll go straight off Dan ate his dinner rapidly then he carefully cleaned his trout put them in a long basket with rhubarb leaves over them and started with an assumed cheerfulness very far from his real feelings He had barely passed the gate when another boy came shuffling along a tall raw boned lad with an insinuating smile and shifty cunning eyes The newcomer nodded familiarly to Dan Hello sonny Going over to the Lake with your catch are you You ll fry up before you get there There ll be nothing left of you but a crisp No I m not going to the Lake I m going up to the factory to see mister Walters Sam French gave a long whistle of surprise Why Dan what s taking you there You surely ain t thinking of trying for that place are you Walters wouldn t look at you Why he wouldn t take me You haven t the ghost of a chance No I m not going for that Sam did you know that mister Walters had a notice in the Lake Advertiser that nobody could fish in his pond this summer Course I did the old skinflint He s too mean to live that s what He never goes near the pond himself Regular dog in the manger he is Dad says Sam why didn t you tell me about that notice Gracious didn t you know I s posed everybody did and here I ve been taking you for the cutest chap this side of sunset fishing away up in that creek where no one could see you and cutting home through the woods on the sly You don t mean to tell me you never saw that notice No I didn t Do you think I d have gone near the pond if I had I never saw it till today and I m going straight to mister Walters now to tell him about it Sam French stopped short in the dusty road and stared at Dan in undisguised amazement Dan Phillips he ejaculated have you plum gone out of your mind Boy alive you needn t be afraid that I d peach on you I m too blamed glad to see anyone get the better of that old Walters smart as he thinks himself Gee To dream of going to him and telling him you ve been fishing in his pond Why he ll put you in jail You don t know what sort of a man he is Dad says Never mind what your dad says Sam My mind s made up Dan you chump listen to me That notice says prosecuted according to law Why Danny he ll put you in prison or fine you or something dreadful I can t help it if he does said Danny stoutly You get out of here Sam French and don t be trying to scare me I mean to be honest and how can I be if I don t own up to mister Walters that I ve been stealing his trout all summer Stealing fiddlesticks Dan I used to think you were a chap with some sense but I see I was mistaken You ain t done no harm Walters will never miss them trout If you re so dreadful squeamish that you won t fish no more why you needn t But just let the matter drop and hold your tongue about it That s my advice Well it isn t my mother s then I mean to go by hers You needn t argue no more Sam I m going Go then said Sam stopping short in disgust You re a big fool Dan and serve you right if Walters lands you off to jail but I don t wish you no ill If I can do anything for your family after you re gone I will and I ll try and give your remains Christian burial if there are any remains So long Danny Give my love to old Walters Dan was not greatly encouraged by this interview He shrank more than ever from the thought of facing the stern factory owner His courage had almost evaporated when he entered the office at the factory and asked shakily for mister Walters He s in his office there replied the clerk but he s very busy Better leave your message with me I must see mister Walters himself please said Dan firmly but with inward trepidation The clerk swung himself impatiently from his stool and ushered Dan into mister Walters s private office Boy to see you sir he said briefly as he closed the ground glass door behind him Dan dizzy and trembling stood in the dreaded presence mister Walters was writing at a table covered with a businesslike litter of papers He laid down his pen and looked up with a frown as the clerk vanished He was a stern looking man with deep set grey eyes and a square clean shaven chin There was not an ounce of superfluous flesh on his frame and his voice and manner were those of the decided resolute masterful man of business He pointed to a capacious leather chair and said concisely What is your business with me boy Dan had carefully thought out a statement of facts beforehand but every word had vanished from his memory He had only a confused desperate consciousness that he had a theft to confess and that it must be done as soon as possible He did not sit down Please mister Walters he began desperately I came to tell you your notice I never saw it before and I ve been fishing on your pond all summer but I didn t know honest I ve brought you all I caught today and I ll pay back for them all some time An amused puzzled expression crossed mister Walters s noncommittal face He pushed the leather chair forward Sit down my boy he said kindly I don t quite understand this somewhat mixed up statement of yours You ve been fishing on my pond you say Didn t you see my notice in the Advertiser Dan sat down more composedly The revelation was over and he was still alive No sir We hardly ever see an Advertiser and nobody told me I d always been used to fishing there and I never thought but what it was all right to keep on I know I ought to have remembered and asked you but truly sir I didn t mean to steal your fish I used to sell them over at the hotels We saw the notice today Mother and me and I came right up I ve brought you the trout I caught this morning and if only you won t prosecute me sir I ll pay back every cent I got for the others every cent sir if you ll give me time mister Walters passed his hand across his mouth to conceal something like a smile Your name is Dan Phillips isn t it he said irrelevantly 
5133_30591_000017_000002	train-clean-360	and you 
none	none	live with your mother the Widow Phillips down there at Carleton Corners I understand Yes sir said Dan wondering how mister Walters knew so much about him and if these were the preliminaries of prosecution mister Walters took up his pen and drew a blank sheet towards him Well Dan I put that notice in because I found that many people who used to fish on my pond irrespective of leave or licence were accustomed to lunch or camp on my property and did not a little damage I don t care for trouting myself I ve no time for it However I hardly think you ll do much damage You can keep on fishing there I ll give you a written permission so that if any of my men see you they won t interfere with you As for these trout here I ll buy them from you at Mosquito Lake prices and will say no more about the matter How will that do Thank you sir stammered Dan He could hardly believe his ears He took the slip of paper mister Walters handed to him and rose to his feet Wait a minute Dan How was it you came to tell me this You might have stopped your depredations and I should not have been any the wiser That wouldn t have been honest sir said Dan looking squarely at him There was a brief silence mister Walters thrummed meditatively on the table Dan waited wonderingly Finally the factory owner said abruptly There s a vacant place for a boy down here I want it filled as soon as possible Will you take it mister Walters Me Dan thought the world must be turning upside down Yes you You are rather young but the duties are not hard or difficult to learn I think you ll do I was resolved not to fill that place until I could find a perfectly honest and trustworthy boy for it I believe I have found him I discharged the last boy because he lied to me about some trifling offence for which I would have forgiven him if he had told the truth I can bear with incompetency but falsehood and deceit I cannot and will not tolerate he said so sternly that Dan s face paled I am convinced that you are incapable of either Will you take the place Dan I will if you think I can fill it sir I will do my best Yes I believe you will Perhaps I know more about you than you think Businessmen must keep their eyes open We ll regard this matter as settled then Come up tomorrow at eight o clock And one word more Dan You have perhaps heard that I am an unjust and hard master I am not the former and you will never have occasion to find me the latter if you are always as truthful and straightforward as you have been today You might easily have deceived me in this matter That you did not do so is the best and only recommendation I require Take those trout up to my house and leave them That will do Good afternoon Dan somehow got his dazed self through the glass door and out of the building The whole interview had been such a surprise to him that he was hardly sure whether or not he had dreamed it all I feel as if I were some person else he said to himself as he started down the hot white road But Mother was right I ll stick to her motto I wonder what Sam will say to this A Christmas Inspiration Well I really think Santa Claus has been very good to us all said Jean Lawrence pulling the pins out of her heavy coil of fair hair and letting it ripple over her shoulders So do I said Nellie Preston as well as she could with a mouthful of chocolates Those blessed home folks of mine seem to have divined by instinct the very things I most wanted It was the dusk of Christmas Eve and they were all in Jean Lawrence s room at No sixteen Chestnut Terrace No sixteen was a boarding house and boarding houses are not proverbially cheerful places in which to spend Christmas but Jean s room at least was a pleasant spot and all the girls had brought their Christmas presents in to show each other Christmas came on Sunday that year and the Saturday evening mail at Chestnut Terrace had been an exciting one Jean had lighted the pink globed lamp on her table and the mellow light fell over merry faces as the girls chatted about their gifts On the table was a big white box heaped with roses that betokened a bit of Christmas extravagance on somebody s part Jean s brother had sent them to her from Montreal and all the girls were enjoying them in common No sixteen Chestnut Terrace was overrun with girls generally But just now only five were left all the others had gone home for Christmas but these five could not go and were bent on making the best of it Belle and Olive Reynolds who were sitting on the bed Jean could never keep them off it were High School girls they were said to be always laughing and even the fact that they could not go home for Christmas because a young brother had measles did not dampen their spirits Beth Hamilton who was hovering over the roses and Nellie Preston who was eating candy were art students and their homes were too far away to visit As for Jean Lawrence she was an orphan and had no home of her own She worked on the staff of one of the big city newspapers and the other girls were a little in awe of her cleverness but her nature was a chummy one and her room was a favourite rendezvous Everybody liked frank open handed and hearted Jean It was so funny to see the postman when he came this evening said Olive He just bulged with parcels They were sticking out in every direction We all got our share of them said Jean with a sigh of content Even the cook got six I counted Miss Allen didn t get a thing not even a letter said Beth quickly Beth had a trick of seeing things that other girls didn t I forgot Miss Allen No I don t believe she did answered Jean thoughtfully as she twisted up her pretty hair How dismal it must be to be so forlorn as that on Christmas Eve of all times Ugh I m glad I have friends I saw Miss Allen watching us as we opened our parcels and letters Beth went on I happened to look up once and such an expression as was on her face girls It was pathetic and sad and envious all at once It really made me feel bad for five minutes she concluded honestly Hasn t Miss Allen any friends at all asked Beth No I don t think she has answered Jean She has lived here for fourteen years so missus Pickrell says Think of that girls Fourteen years at Chestnut Terrace Is it any wonder that she is thin and dried up and snappy Nobody ever comes to see her and she never goes anywhere said Beth Dear me She must feel lonely now when everybody else is being remembered by their friends I can t forget her face tonight it actually haunts me Girls how would you feel if you hadn t anyone belonging to you and if nobody thought about you at Christmas Ow said Olive as if the mere idea made her shiver A little silence followed To tell the truth none of them liked Miss Allen They knew that she did not like them either but considered them frivolous and pert and complained when they made a racket The skeleton at the feast Jean called her and certainly the presence of the pale silent discontented looking woman at the No sixteen table did not tend to heighten its festivity Presently Jean said with a dramatic flourish Girls I have an inspiration a Christmas inspiration What is it cried four voices Just this Let us give Miss Allen a Christmas surprise She has not received a single present and I m sure she feels lonely Just think how we would feel if we were in her place
5029_30593_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 That is 
none	none	true said Olive thoughtfully Do you know girls this evening I went to her room with a message from missus Pickrell and I do believe she had been crying Her room looked dreadfully bare and cheerless too I think she is very poor What are we to do Jean Let us each give her something nice We can put the things just outside of her door so that she will see them whenever she opens it I ll give her some of Fred s roses too and I ll write a Christmassy letter in my very best style to go with them said Jean warming up to her ideas as she talked The other girls caught her spirit and entered into the plan with enthusiasm Splendid cried Beth Jean it is an inspiration sure enough Haven t we been horribly selfish thinking of nothing but our own gifts and fun and pleasure I really feel ashamed Let us do the thing up the very best way we can said Nellie forgetting even her beloved chocolates in her eagerness The shops are open yet Let us go up town and invest Five minutes later five capped and jacketed figures were scurrying up the street in the frosty starlit December dusk Miss Allen in her cold little room heard their gay voices and sighed She was crying by herself in the dark It was Christmas for everybody but her she thought drearily In an hour the girls came back with their purchases Now let s hold a council of war said Jean jubilantly I hadn t the faintest idea what Miss Allen would like so I just guessed wildly I got her a lace handkerchief and a big bottle of perfume and a painted photograph frame and I ll stick my own photo in it for fun That was really all I could afford Christmas purchases have left my purse dreadfully lean I got her a glove box and a pin tray said Belle and Olive got her a calendar and Whittier s poems And besides we are going to give her half of that big plummy fruit cake Mother sent us from home I m sure she hasn t tasted anything so delicious for years for fruit cakes don t grow on Chestnut Terrace and she never goes anywhere else for a meal Beth had bought a pretty cup and saucer and said she meant to give one of her pretty water colours too Nellie true to her reputation had invested in a big box of chocolate creams a gorgeously striped candy cane a bag of oranges and a brilliant lampshade of rose coloured crepe paper to top off with It makes such a lot of show for the money she explained I am bankrupt like Jean Well we ve got a lot of pretty things said Jean in a tone of satisfaction Now we must do them up nicely Will you wrap them in tissue paper girls and tie them with baby ribbon here s a box of it while I write that letter While the others chatted over their parcels Jean wrote her letter and Jean could write delightful letters She had a decided talent in that respect and her correspondents all declared her letters to be things of beauty and joy forever She put her best into Miss Allen s Christmas letter Since then she has written many bright and clever things but I do not believe she ever in her life wrote anything more genuinely original and delightful than that letter Besides it breathed the very spirit of Christmas and all the girls declared that it was splendid You must all sign it now said Jean and I ll put it in one of those big envelopes and Nellie won t you write her name on it in fancy letters Which Nellie proceeded to do and furthermore embellished the envelope by a border of chubby cherubs dancing hand in hand around it and a sketch of No sixteen Chestnut Terrace in the corner in lieu of a stamp Not content with this she hunted out a huge sheet of drawing paper and drew upon it an original pen and ink design after her own heart A dudish cat Miss Allen was fond of the No sixteen cat if she could be said to be fond of anything was portrayed seated on a rocker arrayed in smoking jacket and cap with a cigar waved airily aloft in one paw while the other held out a placard bearing the legend Merry Christmas A second cat in full street costume bowed politely hat in paw and waved a banner inscribed with Happy New Year while faintly suggested kittens gambolled around the border The girls laughed until they cried over it and voted it to be the best thing Nellie had yet done in original work All this had taken time and it was past eleven o clock Miss Allen had cried herself to sleep long ago and everybody else in Chestnut Terrace was abed when five figures cautiously crept down the hall headed by Jean with a dim lamp Outside of Miss Allen s door the procession halted and the girls silently arranged their gifts on the floor That s done whispered Jean in a tone of satisfaction as they tiptoed back And now let us go to bed or missus Pickrell bless her heart will be down on us for burning so much midnight oil Oil has gone up you know girls It was in the early morning that Miss Allen opened her door But early as it was another door down the hall was half open too and five rosy faces were peering cautiously out The girls had been up for an hour for fear they would miss the sight and were all in Nellie s room which commanded a view of Miss Allen s door That lady s face was a study Amazement incredulity wonder chased each other over it succeeded by a glow of pleasure On the floor before her was a snug little pyramid of parcels topped by Jean s letter On a chair behind it was a bowl of delicious hot house roses and Nellie s placard Miss Allen looked down the hall but saw nothing for Jean had slammed the door just in time Half an hour later when they were going down to breakfast Miss Allen came along the hall with outstretched hands to meet them She had been crying again but I think her tears were happy ones and she was smiling now A cluster of Jean s roses were pinned on her breast Oh girls girls she said with a little tremble in her voice I can never thank you enough It was so kind and sweet of you You don t know how much good you have done me Breakfast was an unusually cheerful affair at No sixteen that morning There was no skeleton at the feast and everybody was beaming Miss Allen laughed and talked like a girl herself Oh how surprised I was she said The roses were like a bit of summer and those cats of Nellie s were so funny and delightful And your letter too Jean I cried and laughed over it I shall read it every day for a year After breakfast everyone went to Christmas service The girls went uptown to the church they attended The city was very beautiful in the morning sunshine There had been a white frost in the night and the tree lined avenues and public squares seemed like glimpses of fairyland How lovely the world is said Jean This is really the very happiest Christmas morning I have ever known declared Nellie I never felt so really Christmassy in my inmost soul before I suppose said Beth thoughtfully that it is because we have discovered for ourselves the old truth that it is more blessed to give than to receive I ve always known it in a way but I never realized it before Blessing on Jean s Christmas inspiration said Nellie But girls let us try to make it an all the year round inspiration I say We can bring a little of our own sunshine into Miss Allen s life as long as we live with her Amen to that said Jean heartily Oh listen girls the Christmas chimes And over all the beautiful city was wafted the grand old message of peace on earth and good will to all the world A Christmas Mistake Tomorrow is Christmas announced Teddy Grant exultantly as he sat on the floor struggling manfully with a refractory bootlace that was knotted and tagless and stubbornly refused to go into the eyelets of Teddy s patched boots Ain t I glad though Hurrah His mother was washing the breakfast dishes in a dreary listless sort of way She looked tired and broken spirited Ted s enthusiasm seemed to grate on her for she answered sharply Christmas indeed I can t see that it is anything for us to rejoice over Other people may be glad enough but what with winter coming on I d sooner it was spring than Christmas Mary Alice do lift that child out of the ashes and put its shoes and stockings on Everything seems to be at sixes and sevens here this morning Keith the oldest boy was coiled up on the sofa calmly working out some algebra problems quite oblivious to the noise around him But he looked up from his slate with his pencil suspended above an obstinate equation to declaim with a flourish Christmas comes but once a year And then Mother wishes it wasn t here I don t then said Gordon son number two who was preparing his own noon lunch of bread and molasses at the table and making an atrocious mess of crumbs and sugary syrup over everything I know one thing to be thankful for and that is that there ll be no school We ll have a whole week of holidays Gordon was noted for his aversion to school and his affection for holidays And we re going to have turkey for dinner declared Teddy getting up off the floor and rushing to secure his share of bread and molasses and cranb ry sauce and and pound cake Ain t we Ma No you are not said missus Grant desperately dropping the dishcloth and snatching the baby on her knee to wipe the crust of cinders and molasses from the chubby pink and white face You may as well know it now children I ve kept it from you so far in hopes that something would turn up but nothing has We can t have any Christmas dinner tomorrow we can t afford it I ve pinched and saved every way I could for the last month hoping that I d be able to get a turkey for you anyhow but you ll have to do without it There s that doctor s bill to pay and a dozen other bills coming in and people say they can t wait I suppose they can t but it s kind of hard I must say The little Grants stood with open mouths and horrified eyes No turkey for Christmas Was the world coming to an end Wouldn t the government interfere if anyone ventured to dispense with a Christmas celebration The gluttonous Teddy stuffed his fists into his eyes and lifted up his voice Keith who understood better than the others the look on his mother s face took his blubbering young brother by the collar and marched him into the porch The twins seeing the summary proceeding swallowed the outcries they had intended to make although they couldn t keep a few big tears from running down their fat cheeks missus Grant looked pityingly at the disappointed faces about her Don t cry children you make me feel worse We are not the only ones who will have to do without a Christmas turkey We ought to be very thankful that we have anything to eat at all I hate to disappoint you but it can t be helped Never mind Mother said Keith comfortingly relaxing his hold upon the porch door whereupon it suddenly flew open and precipitated Teddy who had been tugging at the handle heels over head backwards We know you ve done your best It s been a hard year for you Just wait though I ll soon be grown up and then you and these greedy youngsters shall feast on turkey every day of the year Hello Teddy have you got on your feet again Mind sir no more blubbering When I m a man announced Teddy with dignity I d just like to see you put me in the porch And I mean to have turkey all the time and I won t give you any either All right you greedy small boy Only take yourself off to school now and let us hear no more squeaks out of you Tramp all of you and give Mother a chance to get her work done missus Grant got up and fell to work at her dishes with a brighter face Well we mustn t give in perhaps things will be better after a while I ll make a famous bread pudding and you can boil some molasses taffy and ask those little Smithsons next door to help you pull it They won t whine for turkey I ll be bound I don t suppose they ever tasted such a thing in all their lives If I could afford it I d have had them all in to dinner with us That sermon mister Evans preached last Sunday kind of stirred me up He said we ought always to try and share our Christmas joy with some poor souls who had never learned the meaning of the word I can t do as much as I d like to It was different when your father was alive The noisy group grew silent as they always did when their father was spoken of He had died the year before and since his death the little family had had a hard time Keith to hide his feelings began to hector the rest Mary Alice do hurry up Here you twin nuisances get off to school If you don t you ll be late and then the master will give you a whipping He won t answered the irrepressible Teddy He never whips us he doesn t He stands us on the floor sometimes though he added remembering the many times his own chubby legs had been seen to better advantage on the school platform That man said missus Grant alluding to the teacher makes me nervous He is the most abstracted creature I ever saw in my life It is a wonder to me he doesn t walk straight into the river some day You ll meet him meandering along the street gazing into vacancy and he ll never see you nor hear a word you say half the time Yesterday said Gordon chuckling over the remembrance he came in with a big piece of paper he d picked up on the entry floor in one hand and his hat in the other and he stuffed his hat into the coal scuttle and hung up the paper on a nail as grave as you please Never knew the difference till Ned Slocum went and told him He s always doing things like that Keith had collected his books and now marched his brothers and sisters off to school Left alone with the baby missus Grant betook herself to her work with a heavy heart But a second interruption broke the progress of her dish washing I declare she said with a surprised glance through the window if there isn t that absent minded schoolteacher coming through the yard What can he want Dear me I do hope Teddy hasn t been cutting capers in school again For the teacher s last call had been in October and had been occasioned by the fact that the irrepressible Teddy would persist in going to school with his pockets filled with live crickets and in driving them harnessed to strings up and down the aisle when the teacher s back was turned All mild methods of punishment having failed the teacher had called to talk it over with missus Grant with the happy result that Teddy s behaviour had improved in the matter of crickets at least But it was about time for another outbreak Teddy had been unnaturally good for too long a time Poor missus Grant feared that it was the calm before a storm and it was with nervous haste that she went to the door and greeted the young teacher He was a slight pale boyish looking fellow with an abstracted musing look in his large dark eyes missus Grant noticed with amusement that he wore a white straw hat in spite of the season His eyes were directed to her face with his usual unseeing gaze Just as though he was looking through me at something a thousand miles away said missus Grant afterwards I believe he was too His body was right there on the step before me but where his soul was is more than you or I or anybody can tell Good morning he said absently I have just called on my way to school with a message from Miss Millar She wants you all to come up and have Christmas dinner with her tomorrow For the land s sake said missus Grant blankly I don t understand To herself she thought I wish I dared take him and shake him to find if he s walking in his sleep or not You and all the children every one went on the teacher dreamily as if he were reciting a lesson learned beforehand She told me to tell you to be sure and come Shall I say that you will Oh yes that is I suppose I don t know said missus Grant incoherently I never expected yes you may tell her we ll come she concluded abruptly Thank you said the abstracted messenger gravely lifting his hat and looking squarely through missus Grant into unknown regions When he had gone missus Grant went in and sat down laughing in a sort of hysterical way I wonder if it is all right Could Cornelia really have told him She must I suppose but it is enough to take one s breath missus Grant and Cornelia Millar were cousins and had once been the closest of friends but that was years ago before some spiteful reports and ill natured gossip had come between them making only a little rift at first that soon widened into a chasm of coldness and alienation Therefore this invitation surprised missus Grant greatly Miss Cornelia was a maiden lady of certain years with a comfortable bank account and a handsome old fashioned house on the hill behind the village She always boarded the schoolteachers and looked after them maternally she was an active church worker and a tower of strength to struggling ministers and their families If Cornelia has seen fit at last to hold out the hand of reconciliation I m glad enough to take it Dear knows I ve wanted to make up often enough but I didn t think she ever would We ve both of us got too much pride and stubbornness It s the Turner blood in us that does it The Turners were all so set But I mean to do my part now she has done hers And missus Grant made a final attack on the dishes with a beaming face When the little Grants came home and heard the news Teddy stood on his head to express his delight the twins kissed each other and Mary Alice and Gordon danced around the kitchen Keith thought himself too big to betray any joy over a Christmas dinner but he whistled while doing the chores until the bare welkin in the yard rang and Teddy in spite of unheard of misdemeanours was not collared off into the porch once When the young teacher got home from school that evening he found the yellow house full of all sorts of delectable odours Miss Cornelia herself was concocting mince pies after the famous family recipe while her ancient and faithful handmaiden Hannah was straining into moulds the cranberry jelly The open pantry door revealed a tempting array of Christmas delicacies Did you call and invite the Smithsons up to dinner as I told you asked Miss Cornelia anxiously Yes was the dreamy response as he glided through the kitchen and vanished into the hall Miss Cornelia crimped the edges of her pies delicately with a relieved air I made certain he d forget it she said You just have to watch him as if he were a mere child Didn t I catch him yesterday starting off to school in his carpet slippers And in spite of me he got away today in that ridiculous summer hat You d better set that jelly in the out pantry to cool Hannah it looks good We ll give those poor little Smithsons a feast for once in their lives if they never get another At this juncture the hall door flew open and mister Palmer appeared on the threshold He seemed considerably agitated and for once his eyes had lost their look of space searching Miss Millar I am afraid I did make a mistake this morning it has just dawned on me I am almost sure that I called at missus Grant s and invited her and her family instead of the Smithsons And she said they would come Miss Cornelia s face was a study mister Palmer she said flourishing her crimping fork tragically do you mean to say you went and invited Linda Grant here tomorrow Linda Grant of all women in this world I did said the teacher with penitent wretchedness It was very careless of me I am very sorry What can I do I ll go down and tell them I made a mistake if you like You can t do that groaned Miss Cornelia sitting down and wrinkling up her forehead in dire perplexity It would never do in the world For pity s sake let me think for a minute Miss Cornelia did think to good purpose evidently for her forehead smoothed out as her meditations proceeded and her face brightened Then she got up briskly Well you ve done it and no mistake I don t know that I m sorry either Anyhow we ll leave it as it is But you must go straight down now and invite the Smithsons too And for pity s sake don t make any more mistakes When he had gone Miss Cornelia opened her heart to Hannah I never could have done it myself never the Turner is too strong in me But I m glad it is done I ve been wanting for years to make up with Linda And now the chance has come thanks to that blessed blundering boy I mean to make the most of it Mind Hannah you never whisper a word about its being a mistake Linda must never know Poor Linda She s had a hard time Hannah we must make some more pies and I must go straight down to the store and get some more Santa Claus stuff I ve only got enough to go around the Smithsons When missus Grant and her family arrived at the yellow house next morning Miss Cornelia herself ran out bareheaded to meet them The two women shook hands a little stiffly and then a rill of long repressed affection trickled out from some secret spring in Miss Cornelia s heart and she kissed her new found old friend tenderly Linda returned the kiss warmly and both felt that the old time friendship was theirs again The little Smithsons all came and they and the little Grants sat down on the long bright dining room to a dinner that made history in their small lives and was eaten over again in happy dreams for months How those children did eat And how beaming Miss Cornelia and grim faced soft hearted Hannah and even the absent minded teacher himself enjoyed watching them After dinner Miss Cornelia distributed among the delighted little souls the presents she had bought for them and then turned them loose in the big shining kitchen to have a taffy pull and they had it to their hearts content And as for the shocking taffyfied state into which they got their own rosy faces and that once immaculate domain well as Miss Cornelia and Hannah never said one word about it neither will I The four women enjoyed the afternoon in their own way and the schoolteacher buried himself in algebra to his own great satisfaction When her guests went home in the starlit December dusk Miss Cornelia walked part of the way with them and had a long confidential talk with missus Grant When she returned it was to find Hannah groaning in and over the kitchen and the schoolteacher dreamily trying to clean some molasses off his boots with the kitchen hairbrush Long suffering Miss Cornelia rescued her property and despatched mister Palmer into the woodshed to find the shoe brush Then she sat down and laughed Hannah what will become of that boy yet There s no counting on what he ll do next I don t know how he ll ever get through the world I m sure but I ll look after him while he s here at least I owe him a huge debt of gratitude for this Christmas blunder What an awful mess this place is in But Hannah did you ever in the world see anything so delightful as that little Tommy Smithson stuffing himself with plum cake not to mention Teddy Grant It did me good just to see them A Strayed Allegiance Will you go to the Cove with me this afternoon It was Marian Lesley who asked the question Esterbrook Elliott unpinned with a masterful touch the delicate cluster of Noisette rosebuds she wore at her throat and transferred them to his buttonhole as he answered courteously Certainly My time as you know is entirely at your disposal They were standing in the garden under the creamy bloom of drooping acacia trees One long plume of blossoms touched lightly the soft golden brown coils of the girl s hair and cast a wavering shadow over the beautiful flower like face beneath it Esterbrook Elliott standing before her thought proudly that he had never seen a woman who might compare with her In every detail she satisfied his critical fastidious taste There was not a discordant touch about her Esterbrook Elliott had always loved Marian Lesley or thought he had They had grown up together from childhood He was an only son and she an only daughter It had always been an understood thing between the two families that the boy and girl should marry 
4964-30587-0000	train-other-500	But Marian s father had decreed that no positive pledge should pass between them until Marian was twenty one Esterbrook accepted his mapped out destiny and selected bride with the conviction that he was an exceptionally lucky fellow
4964-30587-0001	train-other-500	Out of all the women in the world Marian was the very one whom he would have chosen as mistress of his fine old home She had been his boyhood s ideal He believed that he loved her sincerely
4964-30587-0002	train-other-500	but he was not too much in love to be blind to the worldly advantages of his marriage with his cousin His father had died two years previously leaving him wealthy and independent Marian had lost her mother in childhood
4964-30587-0003	train-other-500	her father died when she was eighteen Since then she had lived alone with her aunt Her life was quiet and lonely Esterbrook s companionship was all that brightened it but it was enough Marian lavished on him all the rich womanly love of her heart
4964-30587-0004	train-other-500	On her twenty first birthday they were formally betrothed They were to be married in the following autumn No shadow had drifted across the heaven of her happiness She believed herself secure in her lover s unfaltering devotion
none	none	 True at times she thought his manner lacked a lover s passionate ardour He was always attentive and courteous She had only to utter a wish to find that it had been anticipated he spent every spare minute at her side Yet sometimes she half wished he would betray more lover like impatience and intensity Were all lovers as calm and undemonstrative She reproached herself for this incipient disloyalty as often as it vexingly intruded its unwelcome presence across her inner consciousness Surely Esterbrook was fond and devoted enough to satisfy the most exacting demands of affection Marian herself was somewhat undemonstrative and reserved 
4964-30587-0005	train-other-500	Passing acquaintances called her cold and proud Only the privileged few knew the rich depths of womanly tenderness in her nature Esterbrook thought that he fully appreciated her
4964-30587-0006	train-other-500	As he had walked homeward the night of their betrothal he had reviewed with unconscious criticism his mental catalogue of Marian s graces and good qualities admitting with supreme satisfaction that there was not one thing about her that he could wish changed
none	none	 This afternoon under the acacias they had been planning about their wedding 
4964-30587-0007	train-other-500	There was no one to consult but themselves They were to be married early in September and then go abroad Esterbrook mapped out the details of their bridal tour with careful thoughtfulness
4964-30587-0008	train-other-500	They would visit all the old world places that Marian wished to see Afterwards they would come back home
none	none	 He discussed certain changes he wished to make in the old Elliott mansion to fit it for a young and beautiful mistress 
4964-30587-0009	train-other-500	He did most of the planning Marian was content to listen in happy silence Afterwards she had proposed this walk to the Cove What particular object of charity have you found at the Cove now asked Esterbrook with lazy interest as they walked along
4964-30587-0010	train-other-500	missus Barrett s little Bessie is very ill with fever answered Marian Then catching his anxious look she hastened to add It is nothing infectious some kind of a slow sapping variety There is no danger Esterbrook I was not afraid for myself he replied quietly
4964-30587-0011	train-other-500	My alarm was for you You are too precious to me Marian for me to permit you to risk health and life if it were dangerous What a Lady Bountiful you are to those people at the Cove When we are married you must take me in hand and teach me your creed of charity
4964-30587-0012	train-other-500	I m afraid I ve lived a rather selfish life You will change all that dear You will make a good man of me You are that now Esterbrook she said softly If you were not I could not love you
4964-30587-0013	train-other-500	It is a negative sort of goodness I fear I have never been tried or tempted severely Perhaps I should fail under the test I am sure you would not answered Marian proudly Esterbrook laughed her faith in him was pleasant
4964-30587-0014	train-other-500	He had no thought but that he would prove worthy of it The Cove so called was a little fishing hamlet situated on the low sandy shore of a small bay The houses clustered in one spot seemed like nothing so much as larger shells washed up by the sea
4964-30587-0015	train-other-500	so grey and bleached were they from long exposure to sea winds and spray Dozens of ragged children were playing about them mingled with several disreputable yellow curs that yapped noisily at the strangers
4964-30587-0016	train-other-500	Down on the sandy strip of beach below the houses groups of men were lounging about The mackerel season had not yet set in the spring herring netting was past It was holiday time among the sea folks They were enjoying it to the full
4964-30587-0017	train-other-500	a happy ragged colony careless of what the morrows might bring forth Out beyond the boats were at anchor floating as gracefully on the twinkling water as sea birds their tall masts bowing landward on the swell
4964-30587-0018	train-other-500	A lazy dreamful calm had fallen over the distant seas the horizon blues were pale and dim faint purple hazes blurred the outlines of far off headlands and cliffs the yellow sands sparkled in the sunshine as if powdered with jewels
4964-30587-0019	train-other-500	A murmurous babble of life buzzed about the hamlet pierced through by the shrill undertones of the wrangling children
none	none	 most of whom had paused in their play to scan the visitors with covert curiosity 
4964-30587-0020	train-other-500	Marian led the way to a house apart from the others at the very edge of the shelving rock The dooryard was scrupulously clean and unlittered
none	none	 the little footpath through it was neatly bordered by white clam shells several thrifty geraniums in bloom looked out from the muslin curtained windows A weary faced woman came forward to meet them Bessie s much the same Miss Lesley she said in answer to Marian s inquiry The doctor you sent was here today and did all he could for her He seemed quite hopeful She don t complain or nothing just lies there and moans Sometimes she gets restless It s very kind of you to come so often Miss Lesley Here Magdalen will you put this basket the lady s brought up there on the shelf A girl who had been sitting unnoticed with her back to the visitors at the head of the child s cot in one corner of the room stood up and slowly turned around Marian and Esterbrook Elliott both started with involuntary surprise Esterbrook caught his breath like a man suddenly awakened from sleep In the name of all that was wonderful who or what could this girl be so little in harmony with her surroundings 
4964-30587-0021	train-other-500	Standing in the crepuscular light of the corner her marvellous beauty shone out with the vivid richness of some rare painting She was tall and the magnificent proportions of her figure were enhanced rather than marred by the severely plain dress of dark print that she wore
4964-30587-0022	train-other-500	The heavy masses of her hair a shining auburn dashed with golden foam were coiled in a rich glossy knot at the back of the classically modelled head and rippled back from a low brow whose waxen fairness even the breezes of the ocean had spared
4964-30587-0023	train-other-500	The girl s face was a full perfect oval with features of faultless regularity and the large full eyes were of tawny hazel darkened into inscrutable gloom in the dimness of the corner Not even Marian Lesley s face was more delicately tinted
none	none	 but not a trace of colour appeared in the smooth marble like cheeks yet the waxen pallor bore no trace of disease or weakness and the large curving mouth was of an intense crimson She stood quite motionless 
4964-30587-0024	train-other-500	There was no trace of embarrassment or self consciousness in her pose When missus Barrett said This is my niece Magdalen Crawford she merely inclined her head in grave silent acknowledgement
none	none	 As she moved forward to take Marian s basket she seemed oddly out of place in the low crowded room Her presence seemed to throw a strange restraint over the group 
4964-30587-0025	train-other-500	Marian rose and went over to the cot laying her slender hand on the hot forehead of the little sufferer The child opened its brown eyes questioningly How are you today Bessie Mad len I want Mad len
4964-30587-0026	train-other-500	moaned the little plaintive voice Magdalen came over and stood beside Marian Lesley She wants me she said in a low thrilling voice free from all harsh accent or intonation I am the only one she seems to know always
4964-30587-0027	train-other-500	Yes darling Mad len is here right beside you She will not leave you She knelt by the little cot and passed her arm under the child s neck drawing the curly head close to her throat with a tender soothing motion
4964-30587-0028	train-other-500	Esterbrook Elliott watched the two women intently the one standing by the cot arrayed in simple yet costly apparel with her beautiful high bred face and the other kneeling on the bare sanded floor in her print dress with her splendid head bent low over the child
4964-30587-0029	train-other-500	and the long fringe of burnished lashes sweeping the cold pallor of the oval cheek From the moment that Magdalen Crawford s haunting eyes had looked straight into his for one fleeting second an unnamable thrill of pain and pleasure stirred his heart
4964-30587-0030	train-other-500	a thrill so strong and sudden and passionate that his face paled with emotion the room seemed to swim before his eyes in a mist out of which gleamed that wonderful face with its mesmeric darkly radiant eyes
none	none	 burning their way into deeps and abysses of his soul hitherto unknown to him 
4964-30587-0031	train-other-500	When the mist cleared away and his head grew steadier he wondered at himself Yet he trembled in every limb and the only clear idea that struggled out of his confused thoughts was an overmastering desire to take that cold face between his hands and kiss it
none	none	 until its passionless marble glowed into warm and throbbing life Who is that girl he said abruptly when they had left the cottage She is the most beautiful woman I have ever seen present company always excepted he concluded with a depreciatory laugh The delicate bloom on Marian s face deepened slightly You had much better to have omitted that last sentence she said quietly it was so palpably an afterthought Yes she is wonderfully lovely a strange beauty I fancied There seemed something odd and uncanny about it to me She must be missus Barrett s niece I remember that when I was down here about a month ago missus Barrett told me she expected a niece of hers to live with her for a time at least Her parents were both dead the father having died recently missus Barrett seemed troubled about her She said that the girl had been well brought up and used to better things than the Cove could give her and she feared that she would be very discontented and unhappy I had forgotten all about it until I saw the girl today She certainly seems to be a very superior person she will find the Cove very lonely I am sure It is not probable she will stay there long 
4964-30587-0032	train-other-500	I must see what I can do for her but her manner seemed rather repellent don t you think Hardly responded Esterbrook curtly She seemed surprisingly dignified and self possessed I fancied for a girl in her position A princess could not have looked and bowed more royally
none	none	 There was not a shadow of embarrassment in her manner in spite of the incongruity of her surroundings 
4964-30587-0033	train-other-500	You had much better leave her alone Marian In all probability she would resent any condescension on your part What wonderful deep lovely eyes she has Again the sensitive colour flushed Marian s cheek
4964-30587-0034	train-other-500	as his voice lapsed unconsciously into a dreamy retrospective tone and a slight restraint came over her manner which did not depart Esterbrook went away at sunset Marian asked him to remain for the evening
4964-30587-0035	train-other-500	but he pleaded some excuse I shall come tomorrow afternoon he said as he stooped to drop a careless good bye kiss on her face Marian watched him wistfully as he rode away with an unaccountable pain in her heart
4964-30587-0036	train-other-500	She felt more acutely than ever that there were depths in her lover s nature that she was powerless to stir into responsive life Had any other that power She thought of the girl at the Cove with her deep eyes and wonderful face
4964-30587-0037	train-other-500	A chill of premonitory fear seized upon her I feel exactly as if Esterbrook had gone away from me forever she said slowly to herself
4964-30587-0038	train-other-500	stooping to brush her cheek against a dew cold milk white acacia bloom and would never come back to me again If that could happen I wonder what there would be left to live for
4964-30587-0039	train-other-500	Esterbrook Elliott meant or honestly thought he meant to go home when he left Marian
4964-30587-0040	train-other-500	Nevertheless when he reached the road branching off to the Cove he turned his horse down it with a flush on his dark cheek He realized that the motive of the action was disloyal to Marian and he felt ashamed of his weakness But the desire to see Magdalen Crawford once more and to look into the depths of her eyes was stronger than all else and overpowered every throb of duty and resistance
4964-30587-0041	train-other-500	He saw nothing of her when he reached the Cove He could think of no excuse for calling at the Barrett cottage so he rode slowly past the hamlet and along the shore The sun red as a smouldering ember
4964-30587-0042	train-other-500	was half buried in the silken violet rim of the sea the west was a vast lake of saffron and rose and ethereal green through which floated the curved shallop of a thin new moon
none	none	 slowly deepening from lustreless white 
4964-30587-0043	train-other-500	through gleaming silver into burnished gold and attended by one solitary pearl white star The vast concave of sky above was of violet infinite and flawless
none	none	 Far out dusky amethystine islets clustered like gems on the shining breast of the bay 
4964-30587-0044	train-other-500	The little pools of water along the low shores glowed like mirrors of polished jacinth The small pine fringed headlands ran out into the water cutting its lustrous blue expanse like purple wedges
4964-30587-0045	train-other-500	As Esterbrook turned one of them he saw Magdalen standing out on the point of the next a short distance away Her back was towards him and her splendid figure was outlined darkly against the vivid sky
4964-30587-0046	train-other-500	Esterbrook sprang from his horse and left the animal standing by itself while he walked swiftly out to her His heart throbbed suffocatingly He was conscious of no direct purpose save merely to see her She turned when he reached her with a slight start of surprise
4964-30587-0047	train-other-500	His footsteps had made no sound on the tide rippled sand For a few moments they faced each other so eyes burning into eyes with mute soul probing and questioning The sun had disappeared leaving a stain of fiery red to mark his grave
4964-30587-0048	train-other-500	the weird radiant light was startlingly vivid and clear Little crisp puffs and flakes of foam scurried over the point like elfin things The fresh wind blowing up the bay tossed the lustrous rings of hair about Magdalen s pale face
4964-30587-0049	train-other-500	all the routed shadows of the hour had found refuge in her eyes Not a trace of colour appeared in her face under Esterbrook Elliott s burning gaze But when he said Magdalen
4964-30587-0050	train-other-500	a single hot scorch of crimson flamed up into her cheeks protestingly She lifted her hand with a splendid gesture but no word passed her lips Magdalen
4964-30587-0051	train-other-500	have you nothing to say to me he asked coming closer to her with an imploring passion in his face never seen by Marian Lesley s eyes He reached out his hand but she stepped back from his touch What should I have to say to you Say that you are glad to see me
none	none	 I am not glad to see you You have no right to come here 
4964-30587-0052	train-other-500	But I knew you would come You knew it How Your eyes told me so today I am not blind I can see further than those dull fisher folks Yes I knew you would come
none	none	 That is why I came here tonight so that you would find me alone and I could tell you that you were not to come again 
4964-30587-0053	train-other-500	Why must you tell me that Magdalen
none	none	 Because as I have told you you have no right to come 
4964-30587-0054	train-other-500	But if I will not obey you If I will come in defiance of your prohibition She turned her steady luminous eyes on his pale set face You would stamp yourself as a madman then she said coldly I know that you are Miss Lesley s promised husband
4964-30587-0055	train-other-500	Therefore you are either false to her or insulting to me In either case the companionship of Magdalen Crawford is not what you must seek Go She turned away from him with an imperious gesture of dismissal
4964-30587-0056	train-other-500	Esterbrook Elliott stepped forward and caught one firm white wrist I shall not obey you he said in a low intense tone his fine eyes burned into hers You may send me away but I will come back again and yet again until you have learned to welcome me
4964-30587-0057	train-other-500	Why should you meet me like an enemy Why can we not be friends The girl faced him once more Because she said proudly
4964-30587-0058	train-other-500	I am not your equal There can be no friendship between us There ought not to be Magdalen Crawford the fisherman s niece is no companion for you You will be foolish as well as disloyal if you ever try to see me again
4964-30587-0059	train-other-500	Go back to the beautiful high bred woman you love and forget me Perhaps you think I am talking strangely Perhaps you think me bold and unwomanly to speak so plainly to you a stranger But there are some circumstances in life when plain speaking is best I do not want to see you again
4964-30587-0060	train-other-500	Now go back to your own world Esterbrook Elliott slowly turned from her and walked in silence back to the shore
4964-30587-0061	train-other-500	In the shadows of the point he stopped to look back at her standing out like some inspired prophetess against the fiery background of the sunset sky and silver blue water The sky overhead was thick sown with stars
none	none	 the night breeze was blowing up from its lair in distant echoing sea caves On his right the lights of the Cove twinkled out through the dusk I feel like a coward and a traitor he said slowly Good God what is this madness that has come over me Is this my boasted strength of manhood A moment later the hoof beats of his horse died away up the shore 
4964-30587-0062	train-other-500	Magdalen Crawford lingered on the point until the last dull red faded out into the violet gloom of the June sea dusk than which nothing can be rarer or diviner
4964-30587-0063	train-other-500	and listened to the moan and murmur of the sea far out over the bay with sorrowful eyes and sternly set lips
none	none	 The next day when the afternoon sun hung hot and heavy over the water Esterbrook Elliott came again to the Cove 
4964-30587-0064	train-other-500	He found it deserted A rumour of mackerel had come and every boat had sailed out
none	none	 in the rose red dawn to the fishing grounds But down on a strip of sparkling yellow sand he saw Magdalen Crawford standing her hand on the rope that fastened a small white dory to the fragment of a half embedded wreck 
4964-30587-0065	train-other-500	She was watching a huddle of gulls clustered on the tip of a narrow sandy spit
none	none	 running out to the left She turned at the sound of his hurried 
4964-30587-0066	train-other-500	foot fall behind her Her face paled slightly and into the depths of her eyes leapt a passionate mesmeric glow that faded as quickly as it came You see I have come back in spite of your command Magdalen I do see it
4964-30587-0067	train-other-500	she answered in a gravely troubled voice
none	none	 You are a madman who refuses to be warned 
4964-30587-0068	train-other-500	Where are you going Magdalen She had loosened the rope from the wreck I am going to row over to Chapel Point for salt They think the boats will come in tonight loaded with mackerel
none	none	 look at them away out there by the score and salt will be needed 
4964-30587-0069	train-other-500	Can you row so far alone Easily
none	none	 I learned to row long ago for a pastime then 
4964-30587-0070	train-other-500	Since coming here I find it of great service to me She stepped lightly into the tiny shallop and picked up an oar The brilliant sunshine streamed about her
none	none	 burnishing the rich tints of her hair into ruddy gold She balanced herself to the swaying of the dory with the grace of a sea bird 
4964-30587-0071	train-other-500	The man looking at her felt his brain reel Good bye mister Elliott For answer he sprang into the dory and snatching an oar pushed against the old wreck with such energy that the dory shot out from the shore like a foam bell
4964-30587-0072	train-other-500	His sudden spring had set it rocking violently Magdalen almost lost her footing and caught blindly at his arm As her fingers closed on his wrist a thrill as of fire shot through his every vein
4964-30587-0073	train-other-500	Why have you done this mister Elliott You must go back But I will not he said masterfully looking straight into her eyes with an imperiousness that sat well upon him I am going to row you over to Chapel Point I have the oars I will be master this once at least
4964-30587-0074	train-other-500	For an instant her eyes flashed defiant protest then drooped before his A sudden hot blush crimsoned her pale face His will had mastered hers the girl trembled from head to foot and the proud sensitive mouth quivered
4964-30587-0075	train-other-500	Into the face of the man watching her breathlessly flashed a triumphant passionate joy He put out his hand and gently pushed her down into the seat Sitting opposite he took up the oars and pulled out over the sheet of sparkling blue water
4964-30587-0076	train-other-500	through which at first the bottom of white sand glimmered wavily but afterwards deepened to translucent dim depths of greenness His heart throbbed tumultuously Once the thought of Marian drifted across his mind like a chill breath of wind
4964-30587-0077	train-other-500	but it was forgotten when his eyes met Magdalen s Tell me about yourself Magdalen he said at last breaking the tremulous charmed sparkling silence
none	none	 There is nothing to tell she answered with characteristic straightforwardness My life has been a very uneventful one I have never been rich or very well educated but it used to be different from now I had some chance before before Father died You must have found it very lonely and strange when you came here first Yes At first I thought I should die but I do not mind it now I have made friends with the sea it has taught me a great deal There is a kind of inspiration in the sea When one listens to its never ceasing murmur afar out there always sounding at midnight and midday one s soul goes out to meet Eternity Sometimes it gives me so much pleasure that it is almost pain She stopped abruptly I don t know why I am talking to you like this You are a strange girl Magdalen Have you no other companion than the sea No Why should I wish to have I shall not be here long Elliott s face contracted with a spasm of pain You are not going away Magdalen Yes in the fall I have my own living to earn you know I am very poor Uncle and Aunt are very kind but I cannot consent to burden them any longer than I can help A sigh that was almost a moan broke from Esterbrook Elliott s lips 
4964-30587-0078	train-other-500	You must not go away Magdalen You must stay here with me You forget yourself she said proudly How dare you speak to me so Have you forgotten Miss Lesley Or are you a traitor to us both
4964-30587-0079	train-other-500	Esterbrook made no answer He bowed his pale miserable face before her self condemned The breast of the bay sparkled with its countless gems like the breast of a fair woman
4964-30587-0080	train-other-500	The shores were purple and amethystine in the distance Far out bluish phantom like sails clustered against the pallid horizon The dory danced like a feather over the ripples They were close under the shadow of Chapel Point
4964-30587-0081	train-other-500	Marian Lesley waited in vain for her lover that afternoon
4964-30587-0082	train-other-500	When he came at last in the odorous dusk of the June night she met him on the acacia shadowed verandah with cold sweetness Perhaps some subtle woman instinct whispered to her where and how he had spent the afternoon for she offered him no kiss
none	none	 nor did she ask him why he had failed to come sooner 
4964-30587-0083	train-other-500	His eyes lingered on her in the dim light taking in every detail of her sweet womanly refinement and loveliness and with difficulty he choked back a groan
4964-30587-0084	train-other-500	Again he asked himself what madness had come over him and again for an answer rose up the vision of Magdalen Crawford s face as he had seen it that day crimsoning beneath his gaze It was late when he left
none	none	 Marian watched him out of sight standing under the acacias She shivered as with a sudden chill I feel as I think Vashti must have felt she murmured aloud when discrowned and unqueened she crept out of the gates of Shushan to hide her broken heart I wonder if Esther has already usurped my sceptre Has that girl at the Cove with her pale priestess like face and mysterious eyes stolen his heart from me Perhaps not 
4964-30587-0085	train-other-500	for it may never have been mine I know that Esterbrook Elliott will be true to the letter of his vows to me no matter what it may cost him But I want no pallid shadow of the love that belongs to another The hour of abdication is at hand I fear And what will be left for throneless Vashti then
4964-30587-0086	train-other-500	Esterbrook Elliott walking home through the mocking calm of the night fought a hard battle with himself He was face to face with the truth at last the bitter knowledge that he had never loved Marian Lesley save with a fond brotherly affection
4964-30587-0087	train-other-500	and that he did love Magdalen Crawford with a passion that threatened to sweep before it every vestige of his honour and loyalty He had seen her but three times and his throbbing heart lay in the hollow of her cold white hand He shut his eyes and groaned
4964-30587-0088	train-other-500	What madness What unutterable folly He was not free he was bound to another by every cord of honour and self respect And even were he free Magdalen Crawford would be no fit wife for him
4964-30587-0089	train-other-500	in the eyes of the world at least A girl from the Cove a girl with little education and no social standing aye but he loved her He groaned again and again in his misery
none	none	 Afar down the slope the bay waters lay like an inky strip and the distant murmurous plaint of the sea came out of the stillness of the night the lights at the Cove glimmered faintly In the week that followed he went to the Cove every day Sometimes he did not see Magdalen at other times he did But at the end of the week he had conquered in the bitter heart crushing struggle with himself 
4964-30587-0090	train-other-500	If he had weakly given way to the first mad sweep of a new passion the strength of his manhood reasserted itself at last Faltering and wavering were over though there was passionate pain in his voice when he said at last
4964-30587-0091	train-other-500	I am not coming back again Magdalen They were standing in the shadow of the pine fringed point that ran out to the left of the Cove They had been walking together along the shore watching the splendour of the sea sunset that flamed and glowed in the west
4964-30587-0092	train-other-500	where there was a sea of mackerel clouds crimson and amber tinted with long ribbon like strips of apple green sky between
none	none	 They had walked in silence hand in hand as children might have done 
4964-30587-0093	train-other-500	yet with the stir and throb of a mighty passion seething in their hearts Magdalen turned as Esterbrook spoke and looked at him in a long silence The bay stretched out before them tranced and shimmering
4964-30587-0094	train-other-500	a few stars shone down through the gloom of dusk Right across the translucent greens and roses and blues of the west hung a dark unsightly cloud like the blurred outline of a monstrous bat In the dim reflected light the girl s mournful face
4964-30587-0095	train-other-500	took on a weird unearthly beauty
none	none	 She turned her eyes from Esterbrook Elliott s set white face to the radiant gloom of the sea 
4964-30587-0096	train-other-500	That is best she answered at last slowly Best yes Better that we had never met I love you you know it words are idle between us
4964-30587-0097	train-other-500	I never loved before I thought I did I made a mistake and I must pay the penalty of that mistake You understand me I understand she answered simply I do not excuse myself I have been weak and cowardly and disloyal
4964-30587-0098	train-other-500	But I have conquered myself I will be true to the woman to whom I am pledged You and I must not meet again I will crush this madness to death I think I have been delirious ever since that day I saw you first Magdalen
4964-30587-0099	train-other-500	My brain is clearer now I see my duty and I mean to do it at any cost I dare not trust myself to say more
none	none	 Magdalen I have much for which to ask your forgiveness There is nothing to forgive she said steadily I have been as much to blame as you If I had been as resolute as I ought to have been if I had sent you away the second time as I did the first this would not have come to pass 
4964-30587-0100	train-other-500	I have been weak too and I deserve to atone for my weakness by suffering There is only one path open to us Esterbrook good bye
none	none	 Her voice quivered with an uncontrollable spasm of pain but the misty mournful eyes did not swerve from his The man stepped forward and caught her in his arms 
4964-30587-0101	train-other-500	Magdalen good bye my darling Kiss me once only once before I go She loosened his arms and stepped back proudly No
none	none	 No man kisses my lips unless he is to be my husband Good bye dear 
4964-30587-0102	train-other-500	He bowed his head silently and went away looking back not once else he might have seen her kneeling on the damp sand weeping noiselessly and passionately
4964-30587-0103	train-other-500	Marian Lesley looked at his pale determined face the next evening and read it like an open book She had grown paler herself
none	none	 there were purple shadows under the sweet violet eyes that might have hinted of her own sleepless nights She greeted him calmly holding out a steady white hand of welcome 
4964-30587-0104	train-other-500	She saw the traces of the struggle through which he had passed and knew that he had come off victor The knowledge made her task a little harder It would have been easier to let slip the straining cable than to cast it from her when it lay unresistingly in her hand For an instant
none	none	 her heart thrilled with an unutterably sweet hope 
4964-30587-0105	train-other-500	Might he not forget in time Need she snap in twain the weakened bond between them after all Perhaps she might win back her lost sceptre yet if Womanly pride throttled the struggling hope
4964-30587-0106	train-other-500	No divided allegiance no hollow semblance of queenship for her
none	none	 Her opportunity came when Esterbrook asked with grave earnestness if their marriage might not be hastened a little 
4964-30587-0107	train-other-500	could he not have his bride in August For a fleeting second Marian closed her eyes and the slender hands lying among the laces in her lap clasped each other convulsively Then she said quietly
4964-30587-0108	train-other-500	Sometimes I have thought Esterbrook that it might be better if we were never married at all Esterbrook turned a startled face upon her Not married at all Marian what do you mean Just what I say
4964-30587-0109	train-other-500	I do not think we are as well suited to each other after all as we have fancied
none	none	 We have loved each other as brother and sister might 
4964-30587-0110	train-other-500	that is all I think it will be best to be brother and sister forever nothing more Esterbrook sprang to his feet Marian do you know what you are saying
none	none	 You surely cannot have heard no one could have told you I have heard nothing she interrupted hurriedly No one has told me anything I have only said what I have been thinking of late I am sure we have made a mistake It is not too late to remedy it You will not refuse my request Esterbrook You will set me free Good heavens Marian he said hoarsely I cannot realize that you are in earnest 
4964-30587-0111	train-other-500	Have you ceased to care for me The rigidly locked hands were clasped a little tighter No I shall always care for you as my friend if you will let me But I know we could not make each other happy
4964-30587-0112	train-other-500	the time for that has gone by I would never be satisfied nor would you Esterbrook will you release me from a promise which has become an irksome fetter He looked down on her upturned face mistily
4964-30587-0113	train-other-500	A great joy was surging up in his heart yet it was mingled with great regret He knew none better what was passing out of his life what he was losing when he lost that pure womanly nature If you really mean this Marian he said slowly
4964-30587-0114	train-other-500	if you really have come to feel that your truest love is not and never can be mine that I cannot make you happy then there is nothing for me to do but to grant your request You are free
4964-30587-0115	train-other-500	Thank you dear she said gently as she stood up She slipped his ring from her finger and held it out to him He took it mechanically He still felt dazed and unreal Marian held out her hand
4964-30587-0116	train-other-500	Good night Esterbrook she said a little wearily I feel tired I am glad you see it all in the same light as I do Marian he said earnestly clasping the outstretched hand are you sure that you will be happy
4964-30587-0117	train-other-500	are you sure that you are doing a wise thing Quite sure she answered with a faint smile I am not acting rashly I have thought it all over carefully Things are much better so dear We will always be friends
none	none	 Your joys and sorrows will be to me as my own 
4964-30587-0118	train-other-500	When another love comes to bless your life Esterbrook I will be glad And now good night I want to be alone now
none	none	 At the doorway he turned to look back at her standing in all her sweet stateliness in the twilight duskness and the keen realization of all he had lost made him bow his head with a quick pang of regret 
4964-30587-0119	train-other-500	Then he went out into the darkness of the summer night An hour later he stood alone on the little point where he had parted with Magdalen the night before A restless night wind was moaning through the pines that fringed the bank behind him
4964-30587-0120	train-other-500	the moon shone down radiantly turning the calm expanse of the bay into a milk white sheen He took Marian s ring from his pocket and kissed it reverently Then he threw it from him far out over the water
none	none	 For a second the diamond flashed in the moonlight 
4964-30587-0121	train-other-500	then with a tiny splash it fell among the ripples Esterbrook turned his face to the Cove
none	none	 lying dark and silent in the curve between the crescent headlands A solitary light glimmered from the low eaves of the Barrett cottage Tomorrow was his unspoken thought I will be free to go back to Magdalen An Invitation Given on Impulse It was a gloomy Saturday morning The trees in the Oaklawn grounds were tossing wildly in the gusts of wind and sodden brown leaves were blown up against the windows of the library where a score of girls were waiting for the principal to bring the mail in The big room echoed with the pleasant sound of girlish voices and low laughter for in a fortnight school would close for the holidays and they were all talking about their plans and anticipations Only Ruth Mannering was as usual sitting by herself near one of the windows looking out on the misty lawn She was a pale slender girl with a sad face and was dressed in rather shabby black She had no special friend at Oaklawn and the other girls did not know much about her If they had thought about it at all they would probably have decided that they did not like her but for the most part they simply overlooked her This was not altogether their fault Ruth was poor and apparently friendless but it was not her poverty that was against her Lou Scott who was as poor as a church mouse to quote her own frank admission was the most popular girl in the seminary the boon companion of the richest girls and in demand with everybody But Lou was jolly and frank and offhanded while Ruth was painfully shy and reserved and that was the secret of the whole matter There was no fun in her the girls said and so it came about that she was left out of their social life and was almost as solitary at Oaklawn as if she had been the only girl there She was there for the special purpose of studying music and expected to earn her own living by teaching it when she left She believed that the girls looked down on her on this account this was unjust of course but Ruth had no idea how much her own coldness and reserve had worked against her Across the room Carol Golden was as usual the centre of an animated group Golden Carol as her particular friends sometimes called her partly because of her beautiful voice and partly because of her wonderful fleece of golden hair Carol was one of the seminary pets and seemed to Ruth Mannering to have everything that she had not Presently the mail was brought in and there was a rush to the table followed by exclamations of satisfaction or disappointment In a few minutes the room was almost deserted Only two girls remained Carol Golden who had dropped into a big chair to read her many letters and Ruth Mannering who had not received any and had gone silently back to her part of the window Presently Carol gave a little cry of delight Her mother had written that she might invite any friend she wished home with her to spend the holidays Carol had asked for this permission and now that it had come was ready to dance for joy As to whom she would ask there could be only one answer to that Of course it must be her particular friend Maud Russell who was the cleverest and prettiest girl at Oaklawn at least so her admirers said She was undoubtedly the richest and was the acknowledged leader The girls affectionately called her Princess and Carol adored her with that romantic affection that is found only among school girls She knew too that Maud would surely accept her invitation because she did not intend to go home Her parents were travelling in Europe and she expected to spend her holidays with some cousins who were almost strangers to her Carol was so much pleased that she felt as if she must talk to somebody so she turned to Ruth Isn t it delightful to think that we ll all be going home in a fortnight Yes very for those that have homes to go to said Ruth drearily Carol felt a quick pang of pity and self reproach Haven t you she asked Ruth shook her head In spite of herself the kindness of Carol s tone brought the tears to her eyes My mother died a year ago she said in a trembling voice and since then I have had no real home We were quite alone in the world Mother and I and now I have nobody Oh I m so sorry for you cried Carol impulsively She leaned forward and took Ruth s hand in a gentle way And do you mean to say that you ll have to stay here all through the holidays Why it will be horrid Oh I shall not mind it much said Ruth quickly with study and practice most of the time Only now when everyone is talking about it it makes me wish that I had some place to go Carol dropped Ruth s hand suddenly in the shock of a sudden idea that darted into her mind A stray girl passing through the hall called out Ruth Miss Siviter wishes to see you about something in Room C Ruth got up quickly She was glad to get away for it seemed to her that in another minute she would break down altogether Carol Golden hardly noticed her departure She gathered up her letters and went abstractedly to her room unheeding a gay call for Golden Carol from a group of girls in the corridor Maud Russell was not in and Carol was glad She wanted to be alone and fight down that sudden idea It is ridiculous to think of it she said aloud with a petulance very unusual in Golden Carol whose disposition was as sunny as her looks Why I simply cannot I have always been longing to ask Maud to visit me and now that the chance has come I am not going to throw it away I am very sorry for Ruth of course It must be dreadful to be all alone like that But it isn t my fault And she is so fearfully quiet and dowdy what would they all think of her at home Frank and Jack would make such fun of her I shall ask Maud just as soon as she comes in Maud did come in presently but Carol did not give her the invitation Instead she was almost snappish to her idol and the Princess soon went out again in something of a huff Oh dear cried Carol now I ve offended her What has got into me What a disagreeable thing a conscience is although I m sure I don t know why mine should be prodding me so I don t want to invite Ruth Mannering home with me for the holidays but I feel exactly as if I should not have a minute s peace of mind all the time if I didn t Mother would think it all right of course She would not mind if Ruth dressed in calico and never said anything but yes and no But how the boys would laugh I simply won t do it conscience or no conscience In view of this decision it was rather strange that the next morning Carol Golden went down to Ruth Mannering s lonely little room on Corridor Two and said Ruth will you go home with me for the holidays Mother wrote me to invite anyone I wished to Don t say you can t come dear because you must Carol never as long as she lived forgot Ruth s face at that moment It was absolutely transfigured she said afterwards I never saw anyone look so happy in my life A fortnight later unwonted silence reigned at Oaklawn The girls were scattered far and wide and Ruth Mannering and Carol Golden were at the latter s home Carol was a very much surprised girl Under the influence of kindness and pleasure Ruth seemed transformed into a different person Her shyness and reserve melted away in the sunny atmosphere of the Golden home missus Golden took her into her motherly heart at once and as for Frank and Jack whose verdict Carol had so dreaded they voted Ruth splendid She certainly got along very well with them and if she did not make the social sensation that pretty Maud Russell might have made the Goldens all liked her and Carol was content Just four days more sighed Carol one afternoon and then we must go back to Oaklawn Can you realize it Ruth Ruth looked up from her book with a smile Even in appearance she had changed There was a faint pink in her cheeks and a merry light in her eyes I shall not be sorry to go back to work she said I feel just like it because I have had so pleasant a time here that it has heartened me up for next term I think it will be very different from last I begin to see that I kept to myself too much and brooded over fancied slights And then you are to room with me since Maud is not coming back said Carol What fun we shall have Did you ever toast marshmallows over the gas Why I declare there is mister Swift coming up the walk Look Ruth He is the richest man in Westleigh Ruth peeped out of the window over Carol s shoulder He reminds me of somebody she said absently but I can t think who it is Of course I have never seen him before What a good face he has He is as good as he looks said Carol enthusiastically Next to Father mister Swift is the nicest man in the world I have always been quite a pet of his His wife is dead and so is his only daughter She was a lovely girl and died only two years ago It nearly broke mister Swift s heart And he has lived alone ever since in that great big house up at the head of Warner Street the one you admired so Ruth the last time we were uptown There s the bell for the second time Mary can t have heard it I ll go myself As Carol showed the caller into the room Ruth rose to leave and thus came face to face with him mister Swift started perceptibly mister Swift this is my school friend Miss Mannering said Carol mister Swift seemed strangely agitated as he took Ruth s timidly offered hand My dear young lady he said hurriedly I am going to ask you what may seem a very strange question What was your mother s name Agnes Hastings answered Ruth in surprise And then Carol really thought that mister Swift had gone crazy for he drew Ruth into his arms and kissed her I knew it he said I was sure you were Agnes daughter for you are the living image of what she was when I last saw her Child you don t know me but I am your Uncle Robert Your mother was my half sister Oh mister Swift cried Carol and then she ran for her mother Ruth turned pale and dropped into a chair and mister Swift sat down beside her To think that I have found you at last child How puzzled you look Did your mother never speak of me How is she Where is she Mother died last year said Ruth Poor Agnes And I never knew Don t cry little girl I want you to tell me all about it She was much younger than I was and when our mother died my stepfather went away and took her with him I remained with my father s people and eventually lost all trace of my sister I was a poor boy then but things have looked up with me and I have often tried to find her By this time Carol had returned with her father and mother and there was a scene laughing crying explaining and I don t really know which of the two girls was the more excited Carol or Ruth As for mister Swift he was overjoyed to find his niece and wanted to carry her off with him then and there but missus Golden insisted on her finishing her visit When the question of returning to Oaklawn came up mister Swift would not hear of it at first but finally yielded to Carol s entreaties and Ruth s own desire I shall graduate next year Uncle and then I can come back to you for good That evening when Ruth was alone in her room trying to collect her thoughts and realize that the home and love that she had so craved were really to be hers at last Golden Carol was with her mother in the room below talking it all over Just think Mother if I had not asked Ruth to come here this would not have happened And I didn t want to I wanted to ask Maud so much and I was dreadfully disappointed when I couldn t for I really couldn t I could not help remembering the look in Ruth s eyes when she said that she had no home to go to and so I asked her instead of Maud How dreadful it would have been if I hadn t Detected by the Camera One summer I was attacked by the craze for amateur photography It became chronic afterwards and I and my camera have never since been parted We have had some odd adventures together and one of the most novel of our experiences was that in which we played the part of chief witness against Ned Brooke I may say that my name is Amy Clarke and that I believe I am considered the best amateur photographer in our part of the country That is all I need tell you about myself mister Carroll had asked me to photograph his place for him when the apple orchards were in bloom He has a picturesque old fashioned country house behind a lawn of the most delightful old trees and flanked on each side by the orchards So I went one June afternoon with all my accoutrements prepared to take the Carroll establishment in my best style mister Carroll was away but was expected home soon so we waited for him as all the family wished to be photographed under the big maple at the front door I prowled around among the shrubbery at the lower end of the lawn and after a great deal of squinting from various angles I at last fixed upon the spot from which I thought the best view of the house might be obtained Then Gertie and Lilian Carroll and I got into the hammocks and swung at our leisure enjoying the cool breeze sweeping through the maples Ned Brooke was hanging around as usual watching us furtively Ned was one of the hopeful members of a family that lived in a tumble down shanty just across the road from the Carrolls They were wretchedly poor and old Brooke as he was called and Ned were employed a good deal by mister Carroll more out of charity than anything else I fancy The Brookes had a rather shady reputation They were notoriously lazy and it was suspected that their line of distinction between their own and their neighbours goods was not very clearly drawn Many people censured mister Carroll for encouraging them at all but he was too kind hearted to let them suffer actual want and as a consequence one or the other of them was always dodging about his place Ned was a lank tow headed youth of about fourteen with shifty twinkling eyes that could never look you straight in the face His appearance was anything but prepossessing and I always felt when I looked at him that if anyone wanted to do a piece of shady work by proxy Ned Brooke would be the very lad for the business mister Carroll came at last and we all went down to meet him at the gate Ned Brooke also came shuffling along to take the horse and mister Carroll tossed the reins to him and at the same time handed a pocketbook to his wife Just as well to be careful where you put that he said laughingly There s a sum in it not to be picked up on every gooseberry bush Gilman Harris paid me this morning for that bit of woodland I sold him last fall five hundred dollars I promised that you and the girls should have it to get a new piano so there it is for you Thank you said missus Carroll delightedly However you d better put it back in your pocket till we go in Amy is in a hurry mister Carroll took back the pocketbook and dropped it carelessly into the inside pocket of the light overcoat that he wore I happened to glance at Ned Brooke just then and I could not help noticing the sudden crafty eager expression that flashed over his face He eyed the pocketbook in mister Carroll s hands furtively after which he went off with the horse in a great hurry The girls were exclaiming and thanking their father and nobody noticed Ned Brooke s behaviour but myself and it soon passed out of my mind Come to take the place are you Amy said mister Carroll Well everything is ready I think I suppose we d better proceed Where shall we stand You had better group us as you think best Whereupon I proceeded to arrange them in due order under the maple missus Carroll sat in a chair while her husband stood behind her Gertie stood on the steps with a basket of flowers in her hand and Lilian was at one side The two little boys Teddy and Jack climbed up into the maple and little Dora the dimpled six year old stood gravely in the foreground with an enormous grey cat hugged in her chubby arms It was a pretty group in a pretty setting and I thrilled with professional pride as I stepped back for a final knowing squint at it all Then I went to my camera slipped in the plate gave them due warning and took off the cap I took two plates to make sure and then the thing was over but as I had another plate left I thought I might as well take a view of the house by itself so I carried my camera to a new place and had just got everything ready to lift the cap when mister Carroll came down and said If you girls want to see something pretty come to the back field with me That will wait till you come back won t it Amy So we all betook ourselves to the back field a short distance away where mister Carroll proudly displayed two of the prettiest little Jersey cows I had ever seen We returned to the house by way of the back lane and as we came in sight of the main road my brother Cecil drove up and said that if I were ready I had better go home with him and save myself a hot dusty walk The Carrolls all went down to the fence to speak to Cecil but I dashed hurriedly down through the orchard leaped over the fence into the lawn and ran to the somewhat remote corner where I had left my camera I was in a desperate hurry for I knew Cecil s horse did not like to be kept waiting so I never even glanced at the house but snatched off the cap counted two and replaced it Then I took out my plate put it in the holder and gathered up my traps I suppose I was about five minutes at it all and I had my back to the house the whole time and when I laid all my things ready and emerged from my retreat there was nobody to be seen about the place As I hurried up through the lawn I noticed Ned Brooke walking at a smart pace down the lane but the fact did not make any particular impression on me at the time and was not recalled until afterwards Cecil was waiting for me so I got in the buggy and we drove off On arriving home I shut myself up in my dark room and proceeded to develop the first two negatives of the Carroll housestead They were both excellent the first one being a trifle the better so that I decided to finish from it I intended also to develop the third but just as I finished the others a half dozen city cousins swooped down upon us and I had to put away my paraphernalia emerge from my dark retreat and fly around to entertain them The next day Cecil came in and said Did you hear Amy that mister Carroll has lost a pocketbook with five hundred dollars in it No I exclaimed How When Where Don t overwhelm a fellow I can answer only one question last night As to the how they don t know and as to the where well if they knew that there might be some hope of finding it The girls are in a bad way The money was to get them their longed for piano it seems and now it s gone But how did it happen Cecil Well mister Carroll says that missus Carroll handed the pocketbook back to him at the gate yesterday and he dropped it in the inside pocket of his over coat I saw him do it I cried Yes and then before he went to be photographed he hung his coat up in the hall It hung there until the evening and nobody seems to have thought about the money each supposing that someone else had put it carefully away After tea mister Carroll put on the coat and went to see somebody over at Netherby He says the thought of the pocketbook never crossed his mind he had forgotten all about putting it in that coat pocket He came home across the fields about eleven o clock and found that the cows had broken into the clover hay and he had a great chase before he got them out When he went in just as he entered the door the remembrance of the money flashed over him He felt in his pocket but there was no pocketbook there he asked his wife if she had taken it out She had not and nobody else had There was a hole in the pocket but mister Carroll says it was too small for the pocketbook to have worked through However it must have done so unless someone took it out of his pocket at Netherby and that is not possible because he never had his coat off and it was in an inside pocket It s not likely that they will ever see it again Someone may pick it up of course but the chances are slim mister Carroll doesn t know his exact path across the fields and if he lost it while he was after the cows it s a bluer show still They ve been searching all day of course The girls are awfully disappointed A sudden recollection came to me of Ned Brooke s face as I had seen it the day before at the gate coupled with the remembrance of seeing him walking down the lane at a quick pace so unlike his usual shambling gait while I ran through the lawn How do they know it was lost I said Perhaps it was stolen before mister Carroll went to Netherby They think not said Cecil Who would have stolen it Ned Brooke I saw him hanging around And you never saw such a look as came over his face when he heard mister Carroll say there was five hundred dollars in that pocketbook Well I did suggest to them that Ned might know something about it for I remembered having seen him go down the lane while I was waiting for you but they won t hear of such a thing The Brookes are kind of proteges of theirs you know and they won t believe anything bad of them If Ned did take it however there s not a shadow of evidence against him No I suppose not I answered thoughtfully but the more I think it over the more I m convinced that he took it You know we all went to the back field to look at the Jerseys and all that time the coat was hanging there in the hall and not a soul in the house And it was just after we came back that I saw Ned scuttling down the lane so fast I mentioned my suspicions to the Carrolls a few days afterwards when I went down with the photographs and found that they had discovered no trace of the lost pocketbook But they seemed positively angry when I hinted that Ned Brooke might know more about its whereabouts than anyone else They declared that they would as soon think of suspecting one of themselves as Ned and altogether they seemed so offended at my suggestion that I held my peace and didn t irritate them by any more suppositions Afterwards in the excitement of our cousins visit the matter passed out of my mind completely They stayed two weeks and I was so busy the whole time that I never got a chance to develop that third plate and in fact I had forgotten all about it One morning soon after they went away I remembered the plate and decided to go and develop it Cecil went with me and we shut ourselves up in our den lit our ruby lantern and began operations I did not expect much of the plate because it had been exposed and handled carelessly and I thought that it might prove to be underexposed or light struck So I left Cecil to develop it while I prepared the fixing bath Cecil was whistling away when suddenly he gave a tremendous whew of astonishment and sprang to his feet Amy Amy look here he cried I rushed to his side and looked at the plate as he held it up in the rosy light It was a splendid one and the Carroll house came out clear with the front door and the steps in full view And there just in the act of stepping from the threshold was the figure of a boy with an old straw hat on his head and in his hand the pocketbook He was standing with his head turned towards the corner of the house as if listening with one hand holding his ragged coat open and the other poised in mid air with the pocketbook as if he were just going to put it in his inside pocket The whole scene was as clear as noonday and nobody with eyes in his head could have failed to recognize Ned Brooke Goodness I gasped In with it quick And we doused the thing into the fixing bath and then sat down breathlessly and looked at each other I say Amy said Cecil what a sell this will be on the Carrolls Ned Brooke couldn t do such a thing oh no The poor injured boy at whom everyone has such an unlawful pick I wonder if this will convince them Do you think they can get it all back I asked It s not likely he would have dared to use any of it yet I don t know We ll have a try anyhow How long before this plate will be dry enough to carry down to the Carrolls as circumstantial evidence Three hours or thereabouts I answered but perhaps sooner I ll take two prints off when it is ready I wonder what the Carrolls will say It s a piece of pure luck that the plate should have turned out so well after the slap dash way in which it was taken and used I say Amy isn t this quite an adventure At last the plate was dry and I printed two proofs We wrapped them up carefully and marched down to mister Carroll s You never saw people so overcome with astonishment as the Carrolls were when Cecil with the air of a statesman unfolding the evidence of some dreadful conspiracy against the peace and welfare of the nation produced the plate and the proofs and held them out before them mister Carroll and Cecil took the proofs and went over to the Brooke shanty They found only Ned and his mother at home At first Ned when taxed with his guilt denied it but when mister Carroll confronted him with the proofs he broke down in a spasm of terror and confessed all His mother produced the pocketbook and the money they had not dared to spend a single cent of it and mister Carroll went home in triumph Perhaps Ned Brooke ought not to have been let off so easily as he was but his mother cried and pleaded and mister Carroll was too kind hearted to resist So he did not punish them at all save by utterly discarding the whole family and their concerns The place got too hot for them after the story came out and in less than a month all moved away much to the benefit of Mapleton In Spite of Myself My trunk was packed and I had arranged with my senior partner I was the junior member of a law firm for a month s vacation Aunt Lucy had written that her husband had gone on a sea trip and she wished me to superintend the business of his farm and mills in his absence if I could arrange to do so She added that Gussie thought it was a pity to trouble me and wanted to do the overseeing herself but that she Aunt Lucy preferred to have a man at the head of affairs I had never seen my step cousin Augusta Ashley but I knew from Aunt Lucy s remarks concerning her pretty much what sort of person she was just the precise kind I disliked immeasurably I had no idea what her age was but doubtless she was over thirty tall determined aggressive with a faculty for managing a sharp probing nose and a y formation between her eyebrows I knew the type and I was assured that the period of sojourn with my respected aunt would be one of strife between Miss Ashley and myself I wrote to Aunt Lucy to expect me made all necessary arrangements and went to bid Nellie goodbye I had made up my mind to marry Nellie I had never openly avowed myself her suitor but we were cousins and had grown up together so that I knew her well enough to be sure of my ground I liked her so well that it was easy to persuade myself that I was in love with her She more nearly fulfilled the requirements of my ideal wife than anyone I knew She was pleasant to look upon without being distractingly pretty small and fair and womanly She dressed nicely sang and played agreeably danced well and had a cheerful affectionate disposition She was not alarmingly clever had no hobbies and looked up to me as heir to all the wisdom of the ages what man does not like to be thought clever and brilliant I had no formidable rival and our families were anxious for the match I considered myself a lucky fellow I felt that I would be very lonely without Nellie when I was away and she admitted frankly that she would miss me awfully She looked so sweet that I was on the point of asking her then and there to marry me Well fate interfered in the guise of a small brother so I said goodbye and left mentally comparing her to my idea of Miss Augusta Ashley much to the latter s disadvantage When I stepped from the train at a sleepy country station next day I was promptly waylaid by a black eyed urchin who informed me that missus Ashley had sent him with an express wagon for my luggage and that Miss Gussie was waiting with the carriage at the store pointing down to a small building before whose door a girl was trying to soothe her frightened horse As I went down the slope towards her I noticed she was tall quite too tall for my taste I dislike women who can look into my eyes on a level but I had to admit that her form was remarkably symmetrical and graceful She put out her hand it was ungloved and large but white and firm with a cool pleasant touch and said with a composure akin to indifference mister Carslake I presume Mother could not come to meet you so she sent me Will you be kind enough to hold my horse for a few minutes I want to get something in the store Whereupon she calmly transferred the reins to me and disappeared At the time she certainly did not impress me as pretty yet neither could I call her plain Taken separately her features were good Her nose was large and straight the mouth also a trifle large but firm and red the brow wide and white shadowed by a straying dash of brown curl or two She had a certain cool statuesque paleness accentuated by straight fine black brows and her eyes were a bluish grey but the pupils as I afterward found out had a trick of dilating into wells of blackness which added to a long fringe of very dark lashes made her eyes quite the most striking feature of her face Her expression was open and frank and her voice clear and musical without being sweet She looked about twenty two At the time I did not fancy her appearance and made a mental note to the effect that I would never like Miss Ashley I had no use for cool businesslike women women should have no concern with business Nellie would never have troubled her dear curly head over it Miss Ashley came out with her arms full of packages stowed them away in the carriage got in told me which road to take and did not again speak till we were out of the village and driving along a pretty country lane arched over with crimson maples and golden brown beeches The purplish haze of a sunny autumn day mellowed over the fields and the bunch of golden rod at my companion s belt was akin to the plumed ranks along the fences I hazarded the remark that it was a fine day Miss Ashley gravely admitted that it was Then a deep smile seemed to rise somewhere in her eyes and creep over her face discovering a dimple here and there as it proceeded Don t let s talk about the weather the subject is rather stale she said I suppose you are wondering why on earth Mother had to drag you away out here I tried to show her how foolish it was but I didn t succeed Mother thinks there must be a man at the head of affairs or they ll never go right I could have taken full charge easily enough I haven t been Father s boy all my life for nothing There was no need to take you away from your business I protested I said I was going to take a vacation anyway and business was not pressing just then I also hinted that while I had no doubt of her capacity she might have found the duties of superintendent rather arduous Not at all she said with a serenity that made me groan inwardly I like it Father always said I was a born business manager You ll find Ashley s Mills very quiet I m afraid It s a sort of charmed Sleepy Hollow See there s home as we turned a maple blazoned corner and looked from the crest of one hill across to that of another Home was a big white green shuttered house buried amid a riot of autumn colour with a big grove of dark green spruces at the back Below them was a glimpse of a dark blue mill pond and beyond it long sweeps of golden brown meadow land sloping up till they dimmed in horizon mists of pearl and purple How pretty I exclaimed admiringly Isn t it said Gussie proudly I love it Her pupils dilated into dark pools and I rather unwillingly admitted that Miss Ashley was a fine looking girl As we drove up Aunt Lucy was standing on the steps of the verandah over whose white roof trailed a luxuriant creeper its leaves tinged by October frosts into lovely wine reds and tawny yellows Gussie sprang out barely touching my offered hand with her fingertips There s Mother waiting to pounce on you and hear all the family news she said so go and greet her like a dutiful nephew I must take out your horse for you first I said politely Not at all said Miss Ashley taking the reins from my hands in a way not to be disputed I always unharness Charley myself No one understands him half so well Besides I m used to it Didn t I tell you I d always been Father s boy I well believe it I thought in disgust as she led the horse over to the well and I went up to Aunt Lucy Through the sitting room windows I kept a watchful eye on Miss Ashley as she watered and deftly unharnessed Charley and led him into his stable with sundry pats on his nose Then I saw no more of her till she came in to tell us tea was ready and led the way out to the dining room It was evident Miss Gussie held the reins of household government and no doubt worthily Those firm capable white hands of hers looked as though they might be equal to a good many emergencies She talked little leaving the conversation to Aunt Lucy and myself though she occasionally dropped in an apt word Toward the end of the meal however she caught hold of an unfortunate opinion I had incautiously advanced and tore it into tatters The result was a spirited argument in which Miss Gussie held her own with such ability that I was utterly routed and found another grievance against her It was very humiliating to be worsted by a girl a country girl at that who had passed most of her life on a farm No doubt she was strong minded and wanted to vote I was quite prepared to believe anything of her After tea Miss Ashley proposed a walk around the premises in order to initiate me into my duties Apart from his farm mister Ashley owned large grist and saw mills and did a flourishing business with the details of which Miss Gussie seemed so conversant that I lost all doubt of her ability to run the whole thing as she had claimed I felt quite ignorant in the light of her superior knowledge and our walk was enlivened by some rather too lively discussions between us We walked about together however till the shadows of the firs by the mills stretched nearly across the pond and the white moon began to put on a silvery burnish Then we wound up by a bitter dispute during which Gussie s eyes were very black and each cheek had a round red stain on it She had a little air of triumph at having defeated me I have to go now and see about putting away the milk and I dare say you re not sorry to be rid of me she said with a demureness I had not credited her with but if you come to the verandah in half an hour I ll bring you out a glass of new milk and some pound cake I made today by a recipe that s been in the family for one hundred years and I hope it will choke you for all the snubs you ve been giving me She walked away after this amiable wish and I stood by the pond till the salmon tints faded from its waters and stars began to mirror themselves brokenly in its ripples The mellow air was full of sweet mingled eventide sounds as I walked back to the house Aunt Lucy was knitting on the verandah Gussie brought out cake and milk and chatted to us while we ate in an inconsequent girlish way or fed bits of cake to a green eyed goblin in the likeness of a black cat She appeared in such an amiable light that I was half inclined to reconsider my opinion of her When I went to my room the vase full of crimson leaves on my table suggested Gussie and I repented of my unfriendliness for a moment and only for a moment Gussie and her mother passed through the hall below and Aunt Lucy s soft voice floated up through my half open door Well how do you like your cousin my dear Whereat that decided young lady promptly answered I think he is the most conceited youth I ve met for some time Pleasant wasn t it I thought of Nellie s meek admiration of all my words and ways and got her photo out to soothe my vanity For the first time it struck me that her features were somewhat insipid The thought seemed like disloyalty so I banished it and went to bed I expected to dream of that disagreeable Gussie but I did not and I slept so soundly that it was ten o clock the next morning before I woke I sprang out of bed in dismay dressed hastily and ran down not a little provoked at myself Through the window I saw Gussie in the garden digging up some geraniums She was enveloped in a clay stained brown apron a big flapping straw hat half hid her face and she wore a pair of muddy old kid gloves Her whole appearance was disreputable and the face she turned to me as I said Good morning had a diagonal streak of clay across it I added slovenliness to my already long list of her demerits Good afternoon rather Don t you know what time it is The men were here three hours ago for their orders I thought it a pity to disturb your peaceful dreams so I gave them myself and sent them off I was angrier than ever A nice beginning I had made And was that girl laughing at me I expected to be called in time certainly I said stiffly I am not accustomed to oversleep myself I promise it will not occur again My dignity was quite lost on Gussie She peeled off her gloves cheerfully and said I suppose you d like some breakfast Just wait till I wash my hands and I ll get you some Then if you re pining to be useful you can help me take up these geraniums There was no help for it After I had breakfasted I went with many misgivings We got on fairly well however Gussie was particularly lively and kept me too busy for argument I quite enjoyed the time and we did not quarrel until nearly the last when we fell out bitterly over some horticultural problem and went in to dinner in sulky silence Gussie disappeared after dinner and I saw no more of her I was glad of this but after a time I began to find it a little dull Even a dispute would have been livelier I visited the mills looked over the farm and then carelessly asked Aunt Lucy where Miss Ashley was Aunt Lucy replied that she had gone to visit a friend and would not be back till the next day This was satisfactory of course highly so What a relief it was to be rid of that girl with her self assertiveness and independence I said to myself that I hoped her friend would keep her for a week I forgot to be disappointed that she had not when next afternoon I saw Gussie coming in at the gate with a tolerably large satchel and an armful of golden rod I sauntered down to relieve her and we had a sharp argument under way before we were halfway up the lane As usual Gussie refused to give in that she was wrong Her walk had brought a faint clear tint to her cheeks and her rippling dusky hair had half slipped down on her neck She said she had to make some cookies for tea and if I had nothing better to do I might go and talk to her while she mixed them It was not a gracious invitation but I went rather than be left to my own company By the end of the week I was as much at home at Ashley Mills as if I had lived there all my life Gussie and I were thrown together a good deal for lack of other companions and I saw no reason to change my opinion of her She could be lively and entertaining when she chose and at times she might be called beautiful Still I did not approve of her at least I thought so most of the time Once in a while came a state of feeling which I did not quite understand One evening I went to prayer meeting with Aunt Lucy and Gussie I had not seen the minister of Ashley Mills before though Gussie and her mother seemed to know him intimately I had an idea that he was old and silvery haired and benevolent looking So I was rather surprised to find him as young as myself a tall pale intellectual looking man with a high white brow and dark earnest eyes decidedly attractive I was still more surprised when after the service he joined Gussie at the door and went down the steps with her I felt distinctly ill treated as I fell back with Aunt Lucy There was no reason why I should none it ought to have been a relief reverend Carroll Martin had every right to see Miss Ashley home if he chose Doubtless a girl who knew all there was to be known about business farming and milling to say nothing of housekeeping and gardening could discuss theology also It was none of my business I don t know what kept me awake so late that night As a consequence I overslept myself I had managed to redeem my reputation on this point but here it was lost again I felt cross and foolish and cantankerous when I went out There was some unusual commotion at the well It was an old fashioned open one with a chain and windlass Aunt Lucy was peering anxiously down its mouth from which a ladder was sticking Just as I got there Gussie emerged from its depths with a triumphant face Her skirt was muddy and draggled her hair had tumbled down and she held a dripping black cat Coco must have fallen into the well last night she explained as I helped her to the ground I missed him at milking time and when I came to the well this morning I heard the most ear splitting yowls coming up from it I couldn t think where he could possibly be for the water was quite calm until I saw he had crept into a little crevice in the stones on the side So I got a ladder and went down after him You should have called me I said sourly You might have killed yourself going down there And Coco might have tumbled in and drowned while you were getting up retorted Gussie Besides what was the need I could go down as well as you No doubt I said more sharply than I had any business to I don t dream of disputing your ability to do anything you may take it into your head to do Most young ladies are not in the habit of going down wells however Perhaps not she rejoined with freezing calmness But as you may have discovered I am not most young ladies I am myself Augusta Ashley and accountable to nobody but myself if I choose to go down the well every day for pure love of it She walked off in her wet dress with her muddy cat Gussie Ashley was the only girl I ever saw who could be dignified under such circumstances I was in a very bad humour with myself as I went off to see about having the well cleaned out I had offended Gussie and I knew she would not be easily appeased Nor was she For a week she kept me politely studiously at a distance in spite of my most humble advances reverend Carroll was a frequent caller ostensibly to make arrangements about a Sunday school they were organizing in a poor part of the community Gussie and he held long conversations on this enthralling subject Then Gussie went on another visit to her friend and when she came back so did reverend Carroll One calm hazy afternoon I was coming slowly up from the mills Happening to glance at the kitchen roof I gasped It was on fire in one place Evidently the dry shingles had caught fire from a spark There was not a soul about save Gussie Aunt Lucy and myself I dashed wildly into the kitchen where Gussie was peeling apples The house is on fire I exclaimed Gussie dropped her knife and turned pale Don t wake Mother was all she said as she snatched a bucket of water from the table The ladder was still lying by the well In a second I had raised it to the roof and while Gussie went up it like a squirrel and dashed the water on the flames I had two more buckets ready for her Fortunately the fire had made little headway though a few minutes more would have given it a dangerous start The flames hissed and died out as Gussie threw on the water and in a few seconds only a small black hole in the shingles remained Gussie slid down the ladder She trembled in every limb but she put out her wet hand to me with a faint triumphant smile We shook hands across the ladder with a cordiality never before expressed For the next week in spite of reverend Carroll I was happy when I thought of Gussie and miserable when I thought of Nellie I held myself in some way bound to her and was she not my ideal Undoubtedly One day I got a letter from my sister It was long and newsy and the eighth page was most interesting If you don t come home and look after Nellie wrote Kate you ll soon not have her to look after You remember that old lover of hers Rod Allen Well he s home from the west now immensely rich they say and his attentions to Nellie are the town talk I think she likes him too If you bury yourself any longer at Ashley Mills I won t be responsible for the consequences This lifted an immense weight from my mind but the ninth page hurled it back again You never say anything of Miss Ashley in your letters What is she like young or old ugly or pretty clever or dull I met a lady recently who knows her and thinks she is charming She also said Miss Ashley was to be married soon to reverend Something or Other Is it true Aye was it Quite likely Kate s letter made a very miserable man of me Gussie found me a dull companion that day After several vain attempts to rouse me to interest she gave it up There s no use talking to you she said impatiently I believe you are homesick That letter you got this morning looked suspicious Anyhow I hope you ll get over it before I get back Are you going away again I asked Yes I am going to stay a few days with Flossie Flossie was that inseparable chum of hers You seem to spend a good deal of your time with her I remarked discontentedly Gussie opened her eyes at my tone Why of course she said Flossie and I have always been chums And she needs me more than ever just now for she is awfully busy She is to be married next month Oh I see and you I m to be bridesmaid of course and we ve heaps to do Flossie wanted to wait until Christmas but mister Martin is in a mister Martin I interrupted Is mister Martin going to marry your friend Why yes Didn t you know They just suit each other There he comes now He s going to drive me over and I m not ready Talk to him for pity s sake while I go and dress I never enjoyed a conversation more reverend Carroll Martin was a remarkably interesting man Nellie married Rod Allen at Christmas and I was best man Nellie made a charming little bride and Rod fairly worshipped her My own wedding did not come off until spring as Gussie said she could not get ready before that Kismet The fifth heat in the free for all was just over Lu Lu had won and the crowd on the grand stand and the hangers on around the track were cheering themselves hoarse Clear through the noisy clamour shrilled a woman s cry
5133_30591_000002_000000	train-clean-360	 Ah I have dropped my scorecard 
5133_30591_000003_000000	train-clean-360	A man in front of her turned 
none	none	I have an extra one madame 
5133_30591_000004_000001	train-clean-360	Will you accept it 
5133_30591_000005_000000	train-clean-360	Her small modishly gloved hand closed eagerly on it before she lifted her eyes to his face 
5133_30591_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Both started convulsively 
none	none	The man turned very pale but the woman s ripe tinted face coloured darkly
5133_30591_000006_000000	train-clean-360	 You she faltered 
5133_30591_000007_000000	train-clean-360	His lips parted in the coldly grave smile she remembered and hated 
5133_30591_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 You are not glad to see me he said calmly but that I suppose was not to be expected 
5133_30591_000008_000001	train-clean-360	I did not come here to annoy you 
none	none	This meeting is as unexpected to me as to you 
5133_30591_000008_000003	train-clean-360	I had no suspicion that for the last half hour I had been standing next to my 
5133_30591_000009_000000	train-clean-360	She interrupted him by an imperious gesture 
none	none	Still clutching the scorecard she half turned from him 
5133_30591_000009_000002	train-clean-360	Again he smiled this time with a tinge of scorn and shifted his eyes to the track 
5133_30591_000010_000000	train-clean-360	None of the people around them had noticed the little by play 
5133_30591_000010_000001	train-clean-360	All eyes were on the track which was being cleared for the first heat of another race 
none	none	The free for all horses were being led away blanketed The crowd cheered Lu Lu as she went past a shapeless oddity 
5133_30591_000010_000003	train-clean-360	The backers of Mascot the rival favourite looked gloomy 
5133_30591_000011_000000	train-clean-360	The woman noticed nothing of all this 
none	none	She was small very pretty still young and gowned in a quite unmistakable way 
5133_30591_000011_000002	train-clean-360	She studied the man s profile furtively 
5133_30591_000011_000003	train-clean-360	He looked older than when she had seen him last there were some silver threads gleaming in his close clipped dark hair and short pointed beard 
5133_30591_000011_000004	train-clean-360	Otherwise there was little change in the quiet features and somewhat stern grey eyes 
none	none	She wondered if he had cared at all 
5133_30591_000012_000000	train-clean-360	They had not met for five years 
5133_30591_000012_000001	train-clean-360	She shut her eyes and looked in on her past 
5133_30591_000012_000002	train-clean-360	It all came back very vividly 
5133_30591_000012_000003	train-clean-360	She had been eighteen when they were married a gay high spirited girl and the season s beauty He was much older and a quiet serious student 
none	none	Her friends had wondered why she married him sometimes she wondered herself but she had loved him or thought so 
5133_30591_000013_000000	train-clean-360	The marriage had been an unhappy one 
5133_30591_000013_000001	train-clean-360	She was fond of society and gaiety he wanted quiet and seclusion 
5133_30591_000013_000002	train-clean-360	She Was impulsive and impatient he deliberate and grave 
5133_30591_000013_000003	train-clean-360	The strong wills clashed 
5133_30591_000013_000004	train-clean-360	After two years of an unbearable sort of life they had separated quietly and without scandal of any sort 
5133_30591_000013_000005	train-clean-360	She had wanted a divorce but he would not agree to that so she had taken her own independent fortune and gone back to her own way of life 
5133_30591_000013_000006	train-clean-360	In the following five years she had succeeded in burying all remembrance well out of sight 
5133_30591_000013_000007	train-clean-360	No one knew if she were satisfied or not her world was charitable to her and she lived a gay and quite irreproachable life 
5133_30591_000013_000008	train-clean-360	She wished that she had not come to the races 
5133_30591_000013_000009	train-clean-360	It was such an irritating encounter 
5133_30591_000013_000010	train-clean-360	She opened her eyes wearily the dusty track the flying horses the gay dresses of the women on the grandstand the cloudless blue sky the brilliant September sunshine the purple distances all commingled in a glare that made her head ache 
5133_30591_000013_000011	train-clean-360	Before it all she saw the tall figure by her side his face turned from her watching the track intently 
5133_30591_000014_000000	train-clean-360	She wondered with a vague curiosity what induced him to come to the races 
5133_30591_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Such things were not greatly in his line 
5133_30591_000014_000002	train-clean-360	Evidently their chance meeting had not disturbed him 
5133_30591_000014_000003	train-clean-360	It was a sign that he did not care 
5133_30591_000014_000004	train-clean-360	She sighed a little wearily and closed her eyes 
5133_30591_000014_000005	train-clean-360	When the heat was over he turned to her 
none	none	May I ask how you have been since since we met last 
5133_30591_000015_000001	train-clean-360	You are looking extremely well 
5133_30591_000015_000002	train-clean-360	Has Vanity Fair palled in any degree 
5133_30591_000016_000000	train-clean-360	She was angry at herself and him 
none	none	Where had her careless society manner and well bred composure gone 
5133_30591_000016_000002	train-clean-360	She felt weak and hysterical What if she should burst into tears before the whole crowd before those coldly critical grey eyes 
5133_30591_000016_000003	train-clean-360	She almost hated him 
5133_30591_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 No why should it 
5133_30591_000017_000001	train-clean-360	I have found it very pleasant and I have been well very well 
none	none	And you 
5133_30591_000018_000000	train-clean-360	He jotted down the score carefully before he replied 
none	none	I 
5133_30591_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Oh a book worm and recluse always leads a placid life 
5133_30591_000019_000002	train-clean-360	I never cared for excitement you know 
5133_30591_000019_000003	train-clean-360	I came down here to attend a sale of some rare editions and a well meaning friend dragged me out to see the races 
5133_30591_000019_000004	train-clean-360	I find it rather interesting I must confess much more so than I should have fancied 
5133_30591_000019_000005	train-clean-360	Sorry I can t stay until the end 
5133_30591_000019_000006	train-clean-360	I must go as soon as the free for all is over if not before 
5133_30591_000019_000007	train-clean-360	I have backed Mascot you 
none	none	Lu Lu she answered quickly it almost seemed defiantly How horribly unreal it was this carrying on of small talk as if they were the merest of chance met acquaintances
5133_30591_000020_000002	train-clean-360	 She belongs to a friend of mine so I am naturally interested 
none	none	She and Mascot are ties now both have won two heats 
5133_30591_000021_000001	train-clean-360	One more for either will decide it 
5133_30591_000021_000002	train-clean-360	This is a good day for the races 
5133_30591_000021_000003	train-clean-360	Excuse me 
5133_30591_000022_000000	train-clean-360	He leaned over and brushed a scrap of paper from her grey cloak 
5133_30591_000022_000001	train-clean-360	She shivered slightly 
5133_30591_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 You are cold 
5133_30591_000023_000001	train-clean-360	This stand is draughty 
5133_30591_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 I am not at all cold thank you 
5133_30591_000024_000001	train-clean-360	What race is this oh the three minute one 
5133_30591_000025_000000	train-clean-360	She bent forward with assumed interest to watch the scoring 
5133_30591_000025_000001	train-clean-360	She was breathing heavily 
5133_30591_000025_000002	train-clean-360	There were tears in her eyes she bit her lips savagely and glared at the track until they were gone 
5133_30591_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Presently he spoke again in the low even tone demanded by circumstances 
5133_30591_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 This is a curious meeting is it not quite a flavor of romance By the way do you read as many novels as ever 
5133_30591_000028_000000	train-clean-360	She fancied there was mockery in his tone 
none	none	She remembered how very frivolous he used to consider her novel reading 
5133_30591_000028_000002	train-clean-360	Besides she resented the personal tinge 
5133_30591_000028_000003	train-clean-360	What right had he 
5133_30591_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Almost as many she answered carelessly 
5133_30591_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 I was very intolerant wasn t I he said after a pause 
5133_30591_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 You thought so you were right 
5133_30591_000030_000002	train-clean-360	You have been happier since you left me 
5133_30591_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes she said defiantly looking straight into his eyes 
5133_30591_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 And you do not regret it 
5133_30591_000033_000000	train-clean-360	He bent down a little 
5133_30591_000033_000001	train-clean-360	His sleeve brushed against her shoulder Something in his face arrested the answer she meant to make 
5133_30591_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 I I did not say that she murmured faintly 
5133_30591_000035_000000	train-clean-360	There was a burst of cheering 
5133_30591_000035_000001	train-clean-360	The free for all horses were being brought out for the sixth heat 
5133_30591_000035_000002	train-clean-360	She turned away to watch them 
5133_30591_000035_000003	train-clean-360	The scoring began and seemed likely to have no end 
5133_30591_000035_000004	train-clean-360	She was tired of it all 
none	none	It didn t matter a pin to her whether Lu Lu or Mascot won What did matter 
5133_30591_000035_000006	train-clean-360	Had Vanity Fair after all been a satisfying exchange for love 
none	none	He had loved her once and they had been happy at first 
5133_30591_000035_000008	train-clean-360	She had never before said even in her own heart I am sorry but suddenly she felt his hand on her shoulder and looked up 
5133_30591_000035_000009	train-clean-360	Their eyes met 
5133_30591_000035_000010	train-clean-360	He stooped and said almost in a whisper 
5133_30591_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Will you come back to me 
5133_30591_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t know she whispered breathlessly as one half fascinated 
5133_30591_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 We were both to blame but I the most 
5133_30591_000038_000001	train-clean-360	I was too hard on you I ought to have made more allowance 
5133_30591_000038_000002	train-clean-360	We are wiser now both of us 
5133_30591_000038_000003	train-clean-360	Come back to me my wife 
5133_30591_000039_000000	train-clean-360	His tone was cold and his face expressionless 
5133_30591_000039_000001	train-clean-360	It was on her lips to cry out No passionately 
5133_30591_000040_000000	train-clean-360	But the slender scholarly hand on her shoulder was trembling with the intensity of his repressed emotion 
none	none	He did care then 
5133_30591_000040_000002	train-clean-360	A wild caprice flashed into her brain 
5133_30591_000040_000003	train-clean-360	She sprang up 
5133_30591_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 See she cried they re off now 
5133_30591_000041_000001	train-clean-360	This heat will probably decide the race 
5133_30591_000041_000002	train-clean-360	If Lu Lu wins I will not go back to you if Mascot does I will 
5133_30591_000041_000003	train-clean-360	That is my decision 
5133_30591_000042_000000	train-clean-360	He turned paler but bowed in assent 
5133_30591_000042_000001	train-clean-360	He knew by bitter experience how unchangeable her whims were how obstinately she clung to even the most absurd 
5133_30591_000043_000000	train-clean-360	She leaned forward breathlessly 
5133_30591_000043_000001	train-clean-360	The crowd hung silently on the track Lu Lu and Mascot were neck and neck getting in splendid work Half way round the course Lu Lu forged half a neck ahead and her backers went mad 
5133_30591_000043_000002	train-clean-360	But one woman dropped her head in her hands and dared look no more 
5133_30591_000043_000003	train-clean-360	One man with white face and set lips watched the track unswervingly 
5133_30591_000044_000000	train-clean-360	Again Mascot crawled up inch by inch 
5133_30591_000044_000001	train-clean-360	They were on the home stretch they were equal the cheering broke out then silence then another terrific burst shouts yells and clappings Mascot had won the free for all 
5133_30591_000044_000002	train-clean-360	In the front row a woman stood up swayed and shaken as a leaf in the wind 
5133_30591_000044_000003	train-clean-360	She straightened her scarlet hat and readjusted her veil unsteadily 
none	none	There was a smile on her lips and tears in her eyes 
5133_30591_000044_000005	train-clean-360	No one noticed her 
5133_30591_000044_000006	train-clean-360	A man beside her drew her hand through his arm in a quiet proprietary fashion 
none	none	They left the grand stand together 
5044-30592-0000	train-other-500	Lilian s Business Venture Lilian Mitchell turned into the dry goods store on Randall Street just as Esther Miller and Ella Taylor came out They responded coldly to her greeting and exchanged significant glances as they walked away
5044-30592-0001	train-other-500	Lilian s pale face crimsoned
none	none	 She was a tall slender girl of about seventeen 
5044-30592-0002	train-other-500	and dressed in mourning These girls had been her close friends once But that was before the Mitchells had lost their money Since then Lilian had been cut by many of her old chums and she felt it keenly The clerks in the store were busy and Lilian sat down to wait her turn
5044-30592-0003	train-other-500	Near to her two ladies were also waiting and chatting Helen wants me to let her have a birthday party missus Saunders was saying wearily She has been promised it so long and I hate to disappoint the child
5044-30592-0004	train-other-500	but our girl left last week and I cannot possibly make all the cakes and things myself I haven t the time or strength so Helen must do without her party Talking of girls said missus Reeves impatiently I am almost discouraged
5044-30592-0005	train-other-500	It is so hard to get a good all round one The last one I had was so saucy I had to discharge her and the one I have now cannot make decent bread I never had good luck with bread myself either That is missus Porter s great grievance too
none	none	 It is no light task to bake bread for all those boarders Have you made your jelly yet No Maria cannot make it she says and I detest messing with jelly 
5044-30592-0006	train-other-500	But I really must see to it soon At this point a saleswoman came up to Lilian who made her small purchases and went out There goes Lilian Mitchell said missus Reeves in an undertone She looks very pale
5044-30592-0007	train-other-500	They say they are dreadfully poor since Henry Mitchell died His affairs were in a bad condition I am told I am sorry for missus Mitchell responded missus Saunders She is such a sweet woman Lilian will have to do something I suppose
none	none	 and there is so little chance for a girl here 
5044-30592-0008	train-other-500	Lilian walking down the street was wearily turning over in her mind the problems of her young existence
none	none	 Her father had died the preceding spring 
5044-30592-0009	train-other-500	He had been a supposedly prosperous merchant the Mitchells had always lived well and Lilian was a petted and only child Then came the shock of Henry Mitchell s sudden death and of financial ruin His affairs were found to be hopelessly involved
5044-30592-0010	train-other-500	when all the debts were paid there was left only the merest pittance barely enough for house rent for Lilian and her mother to live upon
none	none	 They had moved into a tiny cottage in an unfashionable locality 
5044-30592-0011	train-other-500	and during the summer Lilian had tried hard to think of something to do missus Mitchell was a delicate woman and the burden of their situation fell on Lilian s young shoulders There seemed to be no place for her She could not teach and had no particular talent in any line
5044-30592-0012	train-other-500	There was no opening for her in Willington which was a rather sleepy little place
none	none	 and Lilian was almost in despair There really doesn t seem to be any real place in the world for me Mother she said rather dolefully at the supper table I ve no talent at all it is dreadful to have been born without one And yet I must do something and do it soon And Lilian after she had washed up the tea dishes went upstairs and had a good cry But the darkest hour so the proverb goes is just before the dawn 
5044-30592-0013	train-other-500	and after Lilian had had her cry out and was sitting at her window in the dusk watching a thin new moon shining over the trees down the street her inspiration came to her A minute later she whirled into the tiny sitting room where her mother was sewing Mother our fortune is made I have an idea
5044-30592-0014	train-other-500	Don t lose it then said missus Mitchell with a smile What is it my dear Lilian sobered herself sat down by her mother s side and proceeded to recount the conversation she had heard in the store that afternoon Now Mother this is where my brilliant idea comes in
none	none	 You have often told me I am a born cook 
5044-30592-0015	train-other-500	and I always have good luck Now tomorrow morning I shall go to missus Saunders and offer to furnish all the good things for Helen s birthday party and then I ll ask missus Reeves and missus Porter if I may make their bread for them That will do for a beginning I like cooking you know
5044-30592-0016	train-other-500	and I believe that in time I can work up a good business It seems to be a good idea said missus Mitchell thoughtfully
none	none	 and I am willing that you should try 
5044-30592-0017	train-other-500	But have you thought it all out carefully There will be many difficulties I know I don t expect smooth sailing right along and perhaps I ll fail altogether but somehow I don t believe I will A great many of your old friends will think
5044-30592-0018	train-other-500	Oh yes I know that too
none	none	 but I am not going to mind it Mother 
5044-30592-0019	train-other-500	I don t think there is any disgrace in working for my living I m going to do my best and not care what people say Early next morning Lilian started out She had carefully thought over the details of her small venture considered ways and means
5044-30592-0020	train-other-500	and decided on the most advisable course She would not attempt too much and she felt sure of success To secure competent servants was one of the problems of Willington people At Drayton a large neighbouring town were several factories
5044-30592-0021	train-other-500	and into these all the working girls from Willington had crowded
none	none	 leaving very few who were willing to go out to service 
5044-30592-0022	train-other-500	Many of those who did were poor cooks and Lilian shrewdly suspected that many a harassed housekeeper in the village would be glad to avail herself of the new enterprise Lilian was as she had said of herself a born cook
none	none	 This was her capital and she meant to make the most of it 
5044-30592-0023	train-other-500	missus Saunders listened to her businesslike details with surprise and delight It is the very thing she said Helen is so eager for that party but I could not undertake it myself Her birthday is Friday Can you have everything ready by then
5044-30592-0024	train-other-500	Yes I think so said Lilian briskly producing her notebook Please give me the list of what you want and I will do my best From missus Saunders she went to missus Reeves and found a customer as soon as she had told the reason of her call
5044-30592-0025	train-other-500	I ll furnish all the bread and rolls you need she said and they will be good too Now about your jelly I can make good jelly and I ll be very glad to make yours When she left Lilian had an order for two dozen glasses of apple jelly as well as a standing one for bread and rolls
5044-30592-0026	train-other-500	missus Porter was next visited and grasped eagerly at the opportunity I know your bread will be good she said and you may count on me as a regular customer Lilian thought she had enough on hand for a first attempt and went home satisfied
5044-30592-0027	train-other-500	On her way she called at the grocery store with an order that surprised mister Hooper When she told him of her plan he opened his eyes I must tell my wife about that She isn t strong and she doesn t like cooking After dinner Lilian went to work enveloped in a big apron
5044-30592-0028	train-other-500	and whipped eggs stoned raisins stirred concocted and baked until dark When bedtime came she was so tired that she could hardly crawl upstairs but she felt happy too for the day had been a successful one And so also were the days and weeks and months that followed
5044-30592-0029	train-other-500	It was hard and constant work but it brought its reward Lilian had not promised more than she could perform and her customers were satisfied In a short time she found herself with a regular and growing business on her hands for new customers were gradually added and always came to stay
none	none	 People who gave parties found it very convenient to follow missus Saunders s example and order their supplies from Lilian 
5044-30592-0030	train-other-500	She had a very busy winter and of course it was not all plain sailing She had many difficulties to contend with Sometimes days came on which everything seemed to go wrong when the stove smoked or the oven wouldn t heat properly
5044-30592-0031	train-other-500	when cakes fell flat and bread was sour and pies behaved as only totally depraved pies can when she burned her fingers and felt like giving up in despair
none	none	 Then again she found herself cut by several of her old acquaintances But she was too sensible to worry much over this 
5044-30592-0032	train-other-500	The friends really worth having were still hers her mother s face had lost its look of care and her business was prospering She was hopeful and wide awake kept her wits about her and looked out for hints and learned to laugh over her failures
5044-30592-0033	train-other-500	During the winter she and her mother had managed to do most of the work themselves hiring little Mary Robinson next door on especially busy days
none	none	 and now and then calling in the assistance of Jimmy Bowen and his hand sled to carry orders to customers 
5044-30592-0034	train-other-500	But when spring came Lilian prepared to open up her summer campaign on a much larger scale Mary Robinson was hired for the season
none	none	 and John Perkins was engaged to act as carrier with his express wagon 
5044-30592-0035	train-other-500	A summer kitchen was boarded in in the backyard and a new range bought Lilian began operations with a striking advertisement in the Willington News and an attractive circular sent around to all her patrons Picnics and summer weddings were frequent
5044-30592-0036	train-other-500	In bread and rolls her trade was brisk and constant She also took orders for pickles preserves and jellies and this became such a flourishing branch that a second assistant had to be hired
5044-30592-0037	train-other-500	It was a cardinal rule with Lilian never to send out any article that was not up to her standard She bore the loss of her failures
none	none	 and sometimes stayed up half of the night to fill an order on time 
5044-30592-0038	train-other-500	Prompt and perfect was her motto The long hot summer days were very trying and sometimes she got very tired of it all But when on the anniversary of her first venture she made up her accounts she was well pleased To be sure she had not made a fortune but she had paid all their expenses
5044-30592-0039	train-other-500	had a hundred dollars clear and had laid the solid foundations of a profitable business Mother she said jubilantly as she wiped a dab of flour from her nose and proceeded to concoct the icing for Blanche Remington s wedding cake don t you think my business venture has been a decided success
none	none	 missus Mitchell surveyed her busy daughter with a motherly smile Yes I think it has she said Miriam s Lover 
5029_30593_000003_000000	train-clean-360	I had been reading a ghost story to missus Sefton and I laid it down at the end with a little shrug of contempt 
5029_30593_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 What utter nonsense I said 
5029_30593_000005_000000	train-clean-360	missus Sefton nodded abstractedly above her fancywork 
none	none	That is 
5029_30593_000006_000001	train-clean-360	It is a very commonplace story indeed 
none	none	I don t believe the spirits of the departed trouble themselves to revisit the glimpses of the moon for the purpose of frightening honest mortals or even for the sake of hanging around the favourite haunts of their existence in the flesh 
5029_30593_000006_000003	train-clean-360	If they ever appear it must be for a better reason than that 
none	none	You don t surely think that they ever do appear I said incredulously
5029_30593_000008_000000	train-clean-360	 We have no proof that they do not my dear 
5029_30593_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Surely Mary I exclaimed you don t mean to say that you believe people ever do or can see spirits ghosts as the word goes 
5029_30593_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 I didn t say I believed it 
5029_30593_000010_000001	train-clean-360	I never saw anything of the sort 
none	none	I neither believe nor disbelieve 
5029_30593_000010_000003	train-clean-360	But you know queer things do happen at times things you can t account for 
5029_30593_000010_000004	train-clean-360	At least people who you know wouldn t lie say so 
5029_30593_000010_000005	train-clean-360	Of course they may be mistaken 
5029_30593_000010_000006	train-clean-360	And I don t think that everybody can see spirits either provided they are to be seen 
5029_30593_000010_000007	train-clean-360	It requires people of a certain organization with a spiritual eye as it were 
none	none	We haven t all got that in fact I think very few of us have 
5029_30593_000010_000009	train-clean-360	I dare say you think I m talking nonsense 
5029_30593_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 Well yes I think you are 
none	none	You really surprise me Mary I always thought you the least likely person in the world to take up with such ideas 
5029_30593_000011_000003	train-clean-360	Something must have come under your observation to develop such theories in your practical head 
none	none	Tell me what it was
5029_30593_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 To what purpose 
5029_30593_000012_000001	train-clean-360	You would remain as sceptical as ever 
5029_30593_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 Possibly not 
5029_30593_000013_000001	train-clean-360	Try me I may be convinced 
5029_30593_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 No returned missus Sefton calmly 
none	none	Nobody ever is convinced by hearsay 
5029_30593_000014_000002	train-clean-360	When a person has once seen a spirit or thinks he has he thenceforth believes it 
5029_30593_000014_000003	train-clean-360	And when somebody else is intimately associated with that person and knows all the circumstances well he admits the possibility at least 
none	none	That is my position 
5029_30593_000014_000005	train-clean-360	But by the time it gets to the third person the outsider it loses power 
5029_30593_000014_000006	train-clean-360	Besides in this particular instance the story isn t very exciting 
none	none	But then it s true
5029_30593_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 You have excited my curiosity 
5029_30593_000015_000001	train-clean-360	You must tell me the story 
5029_30593_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Well first tell me what you think of this 
5029_30593_000016_000001	train-clean-360	Suppose two people both sensitively organized individuals loved each other with a love stronger than life 
none	none	If they were apart do you think it might be possible for their souls to communicate with each other in some inexplicable way And if anything happened to one don t you think that that one could and would let the spirit of the other know
5029_30593_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 You re getting into too deep waters for me Mary I said shaking my head 
5029_30593_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 I m not an authority on telepathy or whatever you call it 
5029_30593_000017_000002	train-clean-360	But I ve no belief in such theories 
none	none	In fact I think they are all nonsense 
5029_30593_000017_000004	train-clean-360	I m sure you must think so too in your rational moments 
5029_30593_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 I dare say it is all nonsense said missus Sefton slowly but if you had lived a whole year in the same house with Miriam Gordon you would have been tainted too 
5029_30593_000018_000001	train-clean-360	Not that she had theories at least she never aired them if she had 
5029_30593_000018_000002	train-clean-360	But there was simply something about the girl herself that gave a person strange impressions 
5029_30593_000018_000003	train-clean-360	When I first met her I had the most uncanny feeling that she was all spirit soul what you will no flesh anyhow 
5029_30593_000018_000004	train-clean-360	That feeling wore off after a while but she never seemed like other people to me 
5029_30593_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 She was mister Sefton s niece 
5029_30593_000019_000001	train-clean-360	Her father had died when she was a child When Miriam was twenty her mother had married a second time and went to Europe with her husband 
5029_30593_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Miriam came to live with us while they were away 
5029_30593_000019_000003	train-clean-360	Upon their return she was herself to be married 
none	none	I had never seen Miriam before 
5029_30593_000020_000001	train-clean-360	Her arrival was unexpected and I was absent from home when she came 
none	none	I returned in the evening and when I saw her first she was standing under the chandelier in the drawing room 
5029_30593_000020_000003	train-clean-360	Talk about spirits 
5029_30593_000020_000004	train-clean-360	For five seconds I thought I had seen one 
5029_30593_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Miriam was a beauty 
5029_30593_000021_000001	train-clean-360	I had known that before though I think I hardly expected to see such wonderful loveliness 
5029_30593_000021_000002	train-clean-360	She was tall and extremely graceful dark at least her hair was dark but her skin was wonderfully fair and clear 
5029_30593_000021_000003	train-clean-360	Her hair was gathered away from her face and she had a high pure white forehead and the straightest finest blackest brows 
5029_30593_000021_000004	train-clean-360	Her face was oval with very large and dark eyes 
5029_30593_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 I soon realized that Miriam was in some mysterious fashion different from other people 
5029_30593_000022_000001	train-clean-360	I think everyone who met her felt the same way 
5029_30593_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Yet it was a feeling hard to define 
none	none	For my own part I simply felt as if she belonged to another world and that part of the time she her soul you know was back there again You must not suppose that Miriam was a disagreeable person to have in the house 
5029_30593_000023_000001	train-clean-360	On the contrary it was the very reverse 
5029_30593_000023_000002	train-clean-360	Everybody liked her 
none	none	She was one of the sweetest most winsome girls I ever knew and I soon grew to love her dearly 
5029_30593_000023_000004	train-clean-360	As for what Dick called her little queernesses well we got used to them in time 
none	none	Miriam was engaged as I have told you to a young Harvard man named Sidney Claxton 
5029_30593_000024_000001	train-clean-360	I knew she loved him very deeply 
5029_30593_000024_000002	train-clean-360	When she showed me his photograph I liked his appearance and said so 
5029_30593_000024_000003	train-clean-360	Then I made some teasing remark about her love letters just for a joke you know Miriam looked at me with an odd little smile and said quickly 
5029_30593_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Sidney and I never write to each other 
none	none	Why Miriam I exclaimed in astonishment
5029_30593_000026_000001	train-clean-360	 Do you mean to tell me you never hear from him at all 
5029_30593_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 No I did not say that 
5029_30593_000027_000001	train-clean-360	I hear from him every day every hour 
none	none	We do not need to write letters 
5029_30593_000027_000003	train-clean-360	There are better means of communication between two souls that are in perfect accord with each other 
none	none	Miriam you uncanny creature what do you mean I asked
5029_30593_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 But Miriam only gave another queer smile and made no answer at all Whatever her beliefs or theories were she would never discuss them 
none	none	She had a habit of dropping into abstracted reveries at any time or place 
5029_30593_000030_000001	train-clean-360	No matter where she was this whatever it was would come over her 
5029_30593_000030_000002	train-clean-360	She would sit there perhaps in the centre of a gay crowd and gaze right out into space not hearing or seeing a single thing that went on around her 
none	none	I remember one day in particular we were sewing in my room 
5029_30593_000031_000001	train-clean-360	I looked up and saw that Miriam s work had dropped on her knee and she was leaning forward her lips apart her eyes gazing upward with an unearthly expression 
5029_30593_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t look like that Miriam I said with a little shiver 
none	none	You seem to be looking at something a thousand miles away Miriam came out of her trance or reverie and said with a little laugh
5029_30593_000034_000000	train-clean-360	 How do you know but that I was 
5029_30593_000035_000000	train-clean-360	 She bent her head for a minute or two 
5029_30593_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Then she lifted it again and looked at me with a sudden contraction of her level brows that betokened vexation 
5029_30593_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 I wish you hadn t spoken to me just then she said 
none	none	You interrupted the message I was receiving 
5029_30593_000036_000002	train-clean-360	I shall not get it at all now 
none	none	Miriam I implored I so wish my dear girl that you wouldn t talk so 
5029_30593_000037_000002	train-clean-360	It makes people think there is something queer about you 
none	none	Who in the world was sending you a message as you call it
5029_30593_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Sidney said Miriam simply 
none	none	Nonsense You think it is nonsense because you don t understand it was her calm response
5029_30593_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 I recall another event was when some caller dropped in and we had drifted into a discussion about ghosts and the like and I ve no doubt we all talked some delicious nonsense 
5029_30593_000041_000001	train-clean-360	Miriam said nothing at the time but when we were alone I asked her what she thought of it 
5029_30593_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 I thought you were all merely talking against time she retorted evasively 
5029_30593_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 But Miriam do you really think it is possible for ghosts 
none	none	I detest that word
5029_30593_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 Well spirits then to return after death or to appear to anyone apart from the flesh 
5029_30593_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 I will tell you what I know 
none	none	If anything were to happen to Sidney if he were to die or be killed he would come to me himself and tell me One day Miriam came down to lunch looking pale and worried 
5029_30593_000047_000001	train-clean-360	After Dick went out I asked her if anything were wrong 
5029_30593_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Something has happened to Sidney she replied some painful accident I don t know what 
5029_30593_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 How do you know I cried 
5029_30593_000049_000001	train-clean-360	Then as she looked at me strangely I added hastily You haven t been receiving any more unearthly messages have you 
none	none	Surely Miriam you are not so foolish as to really believe in that
5029_30593_000050_000000	train-clean-360	 I know she answered quickly 
5029_30593_000050_000001	train-clean-360	 Belief or disbelief has nothing to do with it 
5029_30593_000050_000002	train-clean-360	Yes I have had a message 
5029_30593_000050_000003	train-clean-360	I know that some accident has happened to Sidney painful and inconvenient but not particularly dangerous 
none	none	I do not know what it is 
5029_30593_000050_000005	train-clean-360	Sidney will write me that 
5029_30593_000050_000006	train-clean-360	He writes when it is absolutely necessary 
5029_30593_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 Aerial communication isn t perfected yet then I said mischievously 
none	none	But observing how really worried she seemed I added Don t fret Miriam 
5029_30593_000051_000002	train-clean-360	You may be mistaken 
5029_30593_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 Well two days afterwards she got a note from her lover the first I had ever known her to receive in which he said he had been thrown from his horse and had broken his left arm 
none	none	It had happened the very morning Miriam received her message
5029_30593_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 Miriam had been with us about eight months when one day she came into my room hurriedly 
5029_30593_000053_000001	train-clean-360	She was very pale 
5029_30593_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 Sidney is ill dangerously ill 
5029_30593_000054_000001	train-clean-360	What shall I do 
5029_30593_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 I knew she must have had another of those abominable messages or thought she had and really remembering the incident of the broken arm I couldn t feel as sceptical as I pretended to 
5029_30593_000055_000001	train-clean-360	I tried to cheer her but did not succeed 
5029_30593_000055_000002	train-clean-360	Two hours later she had a telegram from her lover s college chum saying that mister Claxton was dangerously ill with typhoid fever 
5029_30593_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 I was quite alarmed about Miriam in the days that followed 
5029_30593_000056_000001	train-clean-360	She grieved and fretted continually 
none	none	One of her troubles was that she received no more messages she said it was because Sidney was too ill to send them 
5029_30593_000056_000003	train-clean-360	Anyhow she had to content herself with the means of communication used by ordinary mortals 
5029_30593_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 Sidney s mother who had gone to nurse him wrote every day and at last good news came 
5029_30593_000057_000001	train-clean-360	The crisis was over and the doctor in attendance thought Sidney would recover 
5029_30593_000057_000002	train-clean-360	Miriam seemed like a new creature then and rapidly recovered her spirits 
5029_30593_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 For a week reports continued favourable 
5029_30593_000058_000001	train-clean-360	One night we went to the opera to hear a celebrated prima donna 
none	none	When we returned home Miriam and I were sitting in her room chatting over the events of the evening
5029_30593_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 Suddenly she sat straight up with a sort of convulsive shudder and at the same time you may laugh if you like the most horrible feeling came over me 
none	none	I didn t see anything but I just felt that there was something or someone in the room besides ourselves
5029_30593_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Miriam was gazing straight before her 
5029_30593_000060_000001	train-clean-360	She rose to her feet and held out her hands 
5029_30593_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 Sidney she said 
5029_30593_000062_000000	train-clean-360	 Then she fell to the floor in a dead faint 
5029_30593_000063_000000	train-clean-360	 I screamed for Dick rang the bell and rushed to her 
5029_30593_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 In a few minutes the whole household was aroused and Dick was off posthaste for the doctor for we could not revive Miriam from her death like swoon 
5029_30593_000064_000001	train-clean-360	She seemed as one dead 
none	none	We worked over her for hours 
5029_30593_000064_000003	train-clean-360	She would come out of her faint for a moment give us an unknowing stare and go shudderingly off again 
5029_30593_000065_000000	train-clean-360	 The doctor talked of some fearful shock but I kept my own counsel At dawn Miriam came back to life at last 
5029_30593_000065_000001	train-clean-360	When she and I were left alone she turned to me 
5029_30593_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 Sidney is dead she said quietly 
none	none	I saw him just before I fainted 
5029_30593_000066_000002	train-clean-360	I looked up and he was standing between me and you 
none	none	He had come to say farewell What could I say 
5029_30593_000067_000001	train-clean-360	Almost while we were talking a telegram came 
5029_30593_000067_000002	train-clean-360	He was dead he had died at the very hour at which Miriam had seen him 
none	none	missus Sefton paused and the lunch bell rang
5029_30593_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 What do you think of it she queried as we rose 
none	none	Honestly I don t know what I think of it I answered frankly Miss Calista s Peppermint Bottle Miss Calista was perplexed Her nephew Caleb Cramp who had been her right hand man for years and whom she had got well broken into her ways had gone to the Klondike leaving her to fill his place with the next best man but the next best man was slow to appear and meanwhile Miss Calista was looking about her warily She could afford to wait a while for the crop was all in and the fall ploughing done so that the need of a successor to Caleb was not as pressing as it might otherwise have been There was no lack of applicants such as they were Miss Calista was known to be a kind and generous mistress although she had her ways and insisted calmly and immovably upon wholehearted compliance with them She had a small well cultivated farm and a comfortable house and her hired men lived in clover Caleb Cramp had been perfection after his kind and Miss Calista did not expect to find his equal Nevertheless she set up a certain standard of requirements and although three weeks during which Miss Calista had been obliged to put up with the immature services of a neighbour s boy had elapsed since Caleb s departure no one had as yet stepped into his vacant and coveted shoes Certainly Miss Calista was somewhat hard to please but she was not thinking of herself as she sat by her front window in the chilly November twilight Instead she was musing on the degeneration of hired men and reflecting that it was high time the wheat was thrashed the house banked and sundry other duties attended to Ches Maybin had been up that afternoon to negotiate for the vacant place and had offered to give satisfaction for smaller wages than Miss Calista had ever paid But he had met with a brusque refusal scarcely as civil as Miss Calista had bestowed on drunken Jake Stinson from the Morrisvale Road Not that Miss Calista had any particular prejudice against Ches Maybin or knew anything positively to his discredit She was simply unconsciously following the example of a world that exerts itself to keep a man down when he is down and prevent all chance of his rising Nothing succeeds like success and the converse of this is likewise true that nothing fails like failure There was not a person in Cooperstown who would not have heartily endorsed Miss Calista s refusal Ches Maybin was only eighteen although he looked several years older and although no flagrant misdoing had ever been proved against him suspicion of such was not wanting He came of a bad stock people said sagely adding that what was bred in the bone was bound to come out in the flesh His father old Sam Maybin had been a shiftless and tricky rascal as everybody knew and had ended his days in the poorhouse Ches s mother had died when he was a baby and he had come up somehow in a hand to mouth fashion with all the cloud of heredity hanging over him He was always looked at askance and when any mischief came to light in the village it was generally fastened on him as a convenient and handy scapegoat He was considered sulky and lazy and the local prophets united in predicting a bad end for him sooner or later and moreover diligently endeavoured by their general treatment of him to put him in a fair way to fulfil their predictions Miss Calista when she had shut Chester Maybin out into the chill gloom of the November dusk dismissed him from her thoughts There were other things of more moment to her just then than old Sam Maybin s hopeful son There was nobody in the house but herself and although this was neither alarming nor unusual it was unusual and Miss Calista considered it alarming that the sum of five hundred dollars should at that very moment be in the upper right hand drawer of the sideboard which sum had been up to the previous day safe in the coffers of the Millageville bank But certain unfavourable rumours were in course of circulation about that same institution and Miss Calista who was nothing if not prudent had gone to the bank that very morning and withdrawn her deposit She intended to go over to Kerrytown the very next day and deposit it in the Savings Bank there Not another day would she keep it in the house and indeed it worried her to think she must keep it even for the night as she had told missus Galloway that afternoon during a neighbourly back yard chat Not but what it s safe enough she said for not a soul but you knows I ve got it But I m not used to have so much by me and there are always tramps going round It worries me somehow I wouldn t give it a thought if Caleb was here I s pose being all alone makes me nervous Miss Calista was still rather nervous when she went to bed that night but she was a woman of sound sense and was determined not to give way to foolish fears She locked doors and windows carefully as was her habit and saw that the fastenings were good and secure The one on the dining room window looking out on the back yard wasn t in fact it was broken altogether but as Miss Calista told herself it had been broken just so for the last six years and nobody had ever tried to get in at it yet and it wasn t likely anyone would begin tonight Miss Calista went to bed and despite her worry slept soon and soundly It was well on past midnight when she suddenly wakened and sat bolt upright in bed She was not accustomed to waken in the night and she had the impression of having been awakened by some noise She listened breathlessly Her room was directly over the dining room and an empty stovepipe hole opened up through the ceiling of the latter at the head of her bed There was no mistake about it Something or some person was moving about stealthily in the room below It wasn t the cat Miss Calista had shut him in the woodshed before she went to bed and he couldn t possibly get out It must certainly be a beggar or tramp of some description Miss Calista might be given over to nervousness in regard to imaginary thieves but in the presence of real danger she was cool and self reliant As noiselessly and swiftly as any burglar himself Miss Calista slipped out of bed and into her clothes Then she tip toed out into the hall The late moonlight streaming in through the hall windows was quite enough illumination for her purpose and she got downstairs and was fairly in the open doorway of the dining room before a sound betrayed her presence Standing at the sideboard hastily ransacking the neat contents of an open drawer stood a man s figure dimly visible in the moonlight gloom As Miss Calista s grim form appeared in the doorway the midnight marauder turned with a start and then with an inarticulate cry sprang not at the courageous lady but at the open window behind him Miss Calista realizing with a flash of comprehension that he was escaping her had a woman like impulse to get a blow in anyhow she grasped and hurled at her unceremonious caller the first thing that came to hand a bottle of peppermint essence that was standing on the sideboard The missile hit the escaping thief squarely on the shoulder as he sprang out of the window and the fragments of glass came clattering down on the sill The next moment Miss Calista found herself alone standing by the sideboard in a half dazed fashion for the whole thing had passed with such lightning like rapidity that it almost seemed as if it were the dissolving end of a bad dream But the open drawer and the window where the bits of glass were glistening in the moonlight were no dream Miss Calista recovered herself speedily closed the window lit the lamp gathered up the broken glass and set up the chairs which the would be thief had upset in his exit An examination of the sideboard showed the precious five hundred safe and sound in an undisturbed drawer Miss Calista kept grim watch and ward there until morning and thought the matter over exhaustively In the end she resolved to keep her own counsel She had no clue whatever to the thief s whereabouts or identity and no good would come of making a fuss which might only end in throwing suspicion on someone who might be quite innocent When the morning came Miss Calista lost no time in setting out for Kerrytown where the money was soon safely deposited in the bank She heaved a sigh of relief when she left the building I feel as if I could enjoy life once more she said to herself Goodness me if I d had to keep that money by me for a week itself I d have been a raving lunatic by the end of it Miss Calista had shopping to do and friends to visit in town so that the dull autumn day was well nigh spent when she finally got back to Cooperstown and paused at the corner store to get a bundle of matches The store was full of men smoking and chatting around the fire and Miss Calista whose pet abomination was tobacco smoke was not at all minded to wait any longer than she could help But Abiram Fell was attending to a previous customer and Miss Calista sat grimly down by the counter to wait her turn The door opened letting in a swirl of raw November evening wind and Ches Maybin He nodded sullenly to mister Fell and passed down the store to mutter a message to a man at the further end Miss Calista lifted her head as he passed and sniffed the air as a charger who scents battle The smell of tobacco was strong and so was that of the open boxes of dried herring on the counter but plainly above all the commingled odours of a country grocery Miss Calista caught a whiff of peppermint so strong as to leave no doubt of its origin There had been no hint of it before Ches Maybin s entrance The latter did not wait long He was out and striding along the shadowy road when Miss Calista left the store and drove smartly after him It never took Miss Calista long to make up her mind about anything and she had weighed and passed judgement on Ches Maybin s case while mister Fell was doing up her matches The lad glanced up furtively as she checked her fat grey pony beside him Good evening Chester she said with brisk kindness I can give you a lift if you are going my way Jump in quick Dapple is a little restless A wave of crimson duskily perceptible under his sunburned skin surged over Ches Maybin s face It almost seemed as if he were going to blurt out a blunt refusal But Miss Calista s face was so guileless and her tone so friendly that he thought better of it and sprang in beside her and Dapple broke into an impatient trot down the long hill lined with its bare wind writhen maples After a few minutes silence Miss Calista turned to her moody companion Chester she said as tranquilly as if about to ask him the most ordinary question in the world why did you climb into my house last night and try to steal my money Ches Maybin started convulsively as if he meant to spring from the buggy at once but Miss Calista s hand was on his arm in a grasp none the less firm because of its gentleness and there was a warning gleam in her grey eyes It won t mend matters trying to get clear of me Chester I know it was you and I want an answer a truthful one mind you to my question I am your friend and I am not going to harm you if you tell me the truth Her clear and incisive gaze met and held irresistibly the boy s wavering one The sullen obstinacy of his face relaxed Well he muttered finally I was just desperate that s why I ve never done anything real bad in my life before but people have always been down on me I m blamed for everything and nobody wants anything to do with me I m willing to work but I can t get a thing to do I m in rags and I haven t a cent and winter s coming on I heard you telling missus Galloway yesterday about the money I was behind the fir hedge and you didn t see me I went away and planned it all out I d get in some way and I meant to use the money to get away out west as far from here as I could and begin life there where nobody knew me and where I d have some sort of a chance I ve never had any here You can put me in jail now if you like they ll feed and clothe me there anyhow and I ll be on a level with the rest The boy had blurted it all out sullenly and half chokingly A world of rebellion and protest against the fate that had always dragged him down was couched in his voice Miss Calista drew Dapple to a standstill before her gate I m not going to send you to jail Chester I believe you ve told me the truth Yesterday you wanted me to give you Caleb s place and I refused Well I offer it to you now If you ll come I ll hire you and give you as good wages as I gave him Ches Maybin looked incredulous Miss Calista you can t mean it I do mean it every word You say you have never had a chance Well I am going to give you one a chance to get on the right road and make a man of yourself Nobody shall ever know about last night s doings from me and I ll make it my business to forget them if you deserve it What do you say Ches lifted his head and looked her squarely in the face I ll come he said huskily It ain t no use to try and thank you Miss Calista But I ll live my thanks And he did The good people of Cooperstown held up their hands in horror when they heard that Miss Calista had hired Ches Maybin and prophesied that the deluded woman would live to repent her rash step But not all prophecies come true Miss Calista smiled serenely and kept on her own misguided way And Ches Maybin proved so efficient and steady that the arrangement was continued and in due time people outlived their old suspicions and came to regard him as a thoroughly smart and trustworthy young man Miss Calista has made a man of Ches Maybin said the oracles He ought to be very grateful to her And he was But only he and Miss Calista and the peppermint bottle ever knew the precise extent of his gratitude and they never told The Jest That Failed I think it is simply a disgrace to have a person like that in our class said Edna Hayden in an injured tone And she doesn t seem a bit ashamed of it either said Agnes Walters Rather proud of it I should say returned her roommate spitefully It seems to me that if I were so poor that I had to room myself and dress as dowdily as she does that I really couldn t look anybody in the face What must the boys think of her And if it wasn t for her being in it our class would be the smartest and dressiest in the college even those top lofty senior girls admit that It s a shame said Agnes conclusively But she needn t expect to associate with our set I for one won t have anything to do with her Nor I I think it is time she should be taught her place If we could only manage to inflict some decided snub on her she might take the hint and give up trying to poke herself in where she doesn t belong The idea of her consenting to be elected on the freshmen executive But she seems impervious to snubs Edna let s play a joke on her It will serve her right Let us send an invitation in somebody s name to the senior prom The very thing And sign Sidney Hill s name to it He s the handsomest and richest fellows at Payzant and belongs to one of the best families in town and he s awfully fastidious besides No doubt she will feel immensely flattered and of course she ll accept Just think how silly she ll feel when she finds out he never sent it Let s write it now and send it at once There is no time to lose for the prom is on Thursday night The freshmen company eds at Payzant College did not like Grace Seeley that is to say the majority of them They were a decidedly snobbish class that year No one could deny that Grace was clever but she was poor dressed very plainly dowdily the girls said and roomed herself that phrase meaning that she rented a little unfurnished room and cooked her own meals over an oil stove The senior prom as it was called was the annual reception which the senior class gave in the middle of every autumn term It was the smartest and gayest of all the college functions and a Payzant company ed who received an invitation to it counted herself fortunate The senior girls were included as a matter of course but a junior soph or freshie could not go unless one of the senior boys invited her Grace Seeley was studying Greek in her tiny room that afternoon when the invitation was brought to her It was scrupulously orthodox in appearance and form and Grace never doubted that it was genuine although she felt much surprised that Sidney Hill the leader of his class and the foremost figure in all college sports and societies should have asked her to go with him to the senior prom But she was girlishly pleased at the prospect She was as fond of a good time as any other girl and she had secretly wished very much that she could go to the brilliant and much talked about senior prom Grace was quite unaware of her own unpopularity among her class company eds although she thought it was very hard to get acquainted with them Without any false pride herself and of a frank independent nature it never occurred to her that the other Payzant freshies could look down on her because she was poor or resent her presence among them because she dressed plainly She straightway wrote a note of acceptance to Sidney Hill and that young man naturally felt much mystified when he opened and read it in the college library next morning Grace Seeley he pondered That s the jolly girl with the brown eyes that I met at the philomathic the other night She thanks me for my invitation to the senior prom and accepts with pleasure Why I certainly never invited her or anyone else to go with me to the senior prom There must be some mistake Grace passed him at this moment on her way to the Latin classroom She bowed and smiled in a friendly fashion and Sidney Hill felt decidedly uncomfortable What was he to do He did not like to think of putting Miss Seeley in a false position because somebody had sent her an invitation in his name I suppose it is some cad who has a spite at me that has done it he reflected but if so I ll spoil his game I ll take Miss Seeley to the prom as if I had never intended doing anything else She shan t be humiliated just because there is someone at Payzant who would stoop to that sort of thing So he walked up the hall with Grace and expressed his pleasure at her acceptance and on the evening of the prom he sent her a bouquet of white carnations whose spicy fragrance reminded her of her own little garden at home Grace thought it extremely nice of him and dressed in a flutter of pleasant anticipation Her gown was a very simple one of sheer white organdie and was the only evening dress she had She knew there would be many smarter dresses at the reception but the knowledge did not disturb her sensible head in the least She fingered the dainty white frills lovingly as she remembered the sunny summer days at home in the little sewing room where cherry boughs poked their blossoms in at the window when her mother and sisters had helped her to make it with laughing prophesies and speculations as to its first appearance Into seam and puff and frill many girlish hopes and dreams had been sewn and they all came back to Grace as she put it on and helped to surround her with an atmosphere of happiness When she was ready she picked up her bouquet and looked herself over in the mirror from the top of her curly head to the tips of her white shoes with a little nod of satisfaction Grace was not exactly pretty but she had such a bright happy face and such merry brown eyes and such a friendly smile that she was very pleasant to look upon and a great many people thought so that night Grace had never in all her life before had so good a time as she had at that senior prom The seniors were quick to discover her unaffected originality and charm and everywhere she went she was the centre of a merry group In short Grace as much to her own surprise as anyone s found herself a social success Presently Sidney brought his brother up to be introduced and the latter said Miss Seeley will you excuse my asking if you have a brother or any relative named Max Seeley Grace nodded Oh yes my brother Max He is a doctor out west I was sure of it said Murray Hill triumphantly You resemble him so strongly Please don t consider me as a stranger a minute longer for Max and I are like brothers Indeed I owe my life to him Last summer I was out there on a surveying expedition and I took typhoid in a little out of the way place where good nursing was not to be had for love or money Your brother attended me and he managed to pull me through He never left me day or night until I was out of danger and he worked like a Trojan for me Dear old Max said Grace her brown eyes shining with pride and pleasure That is so like him He is such a dear brother and I haven t seen him for four years To see somebody who knows him so well is next best thing to seeing himself He is an awfully fine fellow said mister Hill heartily and I m delighted to have met the little sister he used to talk so much about I want you to come ever and meet my mother and sister They have heard me talk so much about Max that they think almost as much of him as I do and they will be glad to meet his sister missus Hill a handsome dignified lady who was one of the chaperones of the prom received Grace warmly while Beatrice Hill an extremely pretty smartly gowned girl made her feel at home immediately You came with Sid didn t you she whispered Sid is so sly he never tells us whom he is going to take anywhere But when I saw you come in with him I knew I was going to like you you looked so jolly And you re really the sister of that splendid doctor Seeley who saved Murray s life last summer And to think you ve been at Payzant nearly a whole term and we never knew it Well how have you enjoyed our prom Miss Seeley asked Sid as they walked home together under the arching elms of the college campus Oh it was splendid said Grace enthusiastically Everybody was so nice And then to meet someone who could tell me so much about Max I must write them home all about it before I sleep just to calm my head a bit Mother and the girls will be so interested and I must send Lou and Mab a carnation apiece for their scrapbooks Give me one back please said Sid And Grace with a little blush did so That night while Grace was slipping the stems of her carnations and putting them into water three little bits of conversation were being carried on which it is necessary to report in order to round up this story neatly and properly as all stories should be rounded up In the first place Beatrice Hill was saying to Sidney Oh Sid that Miss Seeley you had at the prom is a lovely girl I don t know when I ve met anyone I liked so much She was so jolly and friendly and she didn t put on learned airs at all as so many of those Payzant girls do I asked her all about herself and she told me and all about her mother and sisters and home and the lovely times they had together and how hard they worked to send her to college too and how she taught school in vacations and roomed herself to help along Isn t it so brave and plucky of her I know we are going to be great friends I hope so said Sidney briefly because I have an idea that she and I are going to be very good friends too And Sidney went upstairs and put away a single white carnation very carefully In the second place missus Hill was saying to her eldest son I liked that Miss Seeley very much She seemed a very sweet girl And finally Agnes Walters and Edna Hayden were discussing the matter in great mystification in their room I can t understand it at all said Agnes slowly Sid Hill took her to the prom and he must have sent her those carnations too She could never have afforded them herself And did you see the fuss his people made over her I heard Beatrice telling her that she was coming to call on her tomorrow and missus Hill said she must look upon Beechlawn as her second home while she was at Payzant If the Hills are going to take her up we ll have to be nice to her I suppose said Edna conclusively the truth of the matter is that Sid Hill meant to ask her anyway I dare say he asked her long ago and she would know our invitation was a fraud So the joke is on ourselves after all But as you and I know that with the exception of the last sentence was not the truth of the matter at all The Penningtons Girl Winslow had been fishing or pretending to all the morning and he was desperately thirsty He boarded with the Beckwiths on the Riverside East Shore but he was nearer Riverside West and he knew the Penningtons well He had often been there for bait and milk and had listened times out of mind to missus Pennington s dismal tales of her tribulations with hired girls She never could get along with them and they left on an average after a fortnight s trial She was on the lookout for one now he knew and would likely be cross but he thought she would give him a drink He rowed his skiff into the shore and tied it to a fir that hung out from the bank A winding little footpath led up to the Pennington farmhouse which crested the hill about three hundred yards from the shore Winslow made for the kitchen door and came face to face with a girl carrying a pail of water missus Pennington s latest thing in hired girls of course Winslow s first bewildered thought was What a goddess and he wondered as he politely asked for a drink where on earth missus Pennington had picked her up She handed him a shining dipper half full and stood pail in hand while he drank it She was rather tall and wore a somewhat limp faded print gown and a big sunhat beneath which a glossy knot of chestnut showed itself Her skin was very fair somewhat freckled and her mouth was delicious As for her eyes they were grey but beyond that simply defied description Will you have some more she asked in a soft drawling voice No thank you That was delicious Is missus Pennington home No She has gone away for the day Well I suppose I can sit down here and rest a while You ve no serious objections have you Oh no She carried her pail into the kitchen and came out again presently with a knife and a pan of apples Sitting down on a bench under the poplars she proceeded to peel them with a disregard of his presence that piqued Winslow who was not used to being ignored in this fashion Besides as a general rule he had been quite good friends with missus Pennington s hired girls She had had three strapping damsels during his sojourn in Riverside and he used to sit on this very doorstep and chaff them They had all been saucy and talkative This girl was evidently a new species Do you think you ll get along with missus Pennington he asked finally As a rule she fights with her help although she is a most estimable woman The girl smiled quite broadly I guess p r aps she s rather hard to suit was the answer but I like her pretty well so far I think we ll get along with each other If we don t I can leave like the others did What is your name Nelly Ray Well Nelly I hope you ll be able to keep your place Let me give you a bit of friendly advice Don t let the cats get into the pantry That is what missus Pennington has quarrelled with nearly every one of her girls about It is quite a bother to keep them out ain t it said Nelly calmly There s dozens of cats about the place What on earth makes them keep so many mister Pennington has a mania for cats He and missus Pennington have a standing disagreement about it The last girl left here because she couldn t stand the cats they affected her nerves she said I hope you don t mind them Oh no I kind of like cats I ve been tryin to count them Has anyone ever done that Not that I know of I tried but I had to give up in despair never could tell when I was counting the same cat over again Look at that black goblin sunning himself on the woodpile I say Nelly you re not going are you I must It s time to get dinner mister Pennington will be in from the fields soon The next minute he heard her stepping briskly about the kitchen shooing out intruding cats and humming a darky air to herself He went reluctantly back to the shore and rowed across the river in a brown study I don t know whether Winslow was afflicted with chronic thirst or not or whether the East side water wasn t so good as that of the West side but I do know that he fairly haunted the Pennington farmhouse after that missus Pennington was home the next time he went and he asked her about her new girl To his surprise the good lady was unusually reticent She couldn t really say very much about Nelly No she didn t belong anywhere near Riverside In fact she missus Pennington didn t think she had any settled home at present Her father was travelling over the country somewhere Nelly was a good little girl and very obliging Beyond this Winslow could get no more information so he went around and talked to Nelly who was sitting on the bench under the poplars and seemed absorbed in watching the sunset She dropped her g s badly and made some grammatical errors that caused Winslow s flesh to creep on his bones But any man could have forgiven mistakes from such dimpled lips in such a sweet voice He asked her to go for a row up the river in the twilight and she assented she handled an oar very well he found out and the exercise became her Winslow tried to get her to talk about herself but failed signally and had to content himself with missus Pennington s meagre information He told her about himself frankly enough how he had had fever in the spring and had been ordered to spend the summer in the country and do nothing useful until his health was fully restored and how lonesome it was in Riverside in general and at the Beckwith farm in particular He made out quite a dismal case for himself and if Nelly wasn t sorry for him she should have been At the end of a fortnight Riverside folks began to talk about Winslow and the Penningtons hired girl He was reported to be dead gone on her he took her out rowing every evening drove her to preaching up the Bend on Sunday nights and haunted the Pennington farmhouse Wise folks shook their heads over it and wondered that missus Pennington allowed it Winslow was a gentleman and that Nelly Ray whom nobody knew anything about not even where she came from was only a common hired girl and he had no business to be hanging about her She was pretty to be sure but she was absurdly stuck up and wouldn t associate with other Riverside help at all Well pride must have a fall there must be something queer about her when she was so awful sly as to her past life Winslow and Nelly did not trouble themselves in the least over all this gossip in fact they never even heard it Winslow was hopelessly in love when he found this out he was aghast He thought of his father the ambitious railroad magnate of his mother the brilliant society leader of his sisters the beautiful and proud he was honestly frightened It would never do he must not go to see Nelly again He kept this prudent resolution for twenty four hours and then rowed over to the West shore He found Nelly sitting on the bank in her old faded print dress and he straightway forgot everything he ought to have remembered Nelly herself never seemed to be conscious of the social gulf between them At least she never alluded to it in any way and accepted Winslow s attentions as if she had a perfect right to them She had broken the record by staying with missus Pennington four weeks and even the cats were in subjection Winslow was well enough to have gone back to the city and in fact his father was writing for him But he couldn t leave Beckwiths apparently At any rate he stayed on and met Nelly every day and cursed himself for a cad and a cur and a weak brained idiot One day he took Nelly for a row up the river They went further than usual around the Bend Winslow didn t want to go too far for he knew that a party of his city friends chaperoned by missus Keyton Wells were having a picnic somewhere up along the river shore that day But Nelly insisted on going on and on and of course she had her way When they reached a little pine fringed headland they came upon the picnickers within a stone s throw Everybody recognized Winslow Why there is Burton he heard missus Keyton Wells exclaim and he knew she was putting up her glasses Will Evans who was an especial chum of his ran down to the water s edge Bless me Win where did you come from Come right in We haven t had tea yet Bring your friend too he added becoming conscious that Winslow s friend was a mighty pretty girl Winslow s face was crimson He avoided Nelly s eye Are them people friends of yours she asked in a low tone Yes he muttered Well let us go ashore if they want us to she said calmly I don t mind For three seconds Winslow hesitated Then he pulled ashore and helped Nelly to alight on a jutting rock There was a curious set expression about his fine mouth as he marched Nelly up to missus Keyton Wells and introduced her missus Keyton Wells s greeting was slightly cool but very polite She supposed Miss Ray was some little country girl with whom Burton Winslow was carrying on a summer flirtation respectable enough no doubt and must be treated civilly but of course wouldn t expect to be made an equal of exactly The other women took their cue from her but the men were more cordial Miss Ray might be shabby but she was distinctly fetching and Winslow looked savage Nelly was not a whit abashed seemingly by the fashionable circle in which she found herself and she talked away to Will Evans and the others in her soft drawl as if she had known them all her life All might have gone passably well had not a little Riverside imp by name of Rufus Hent who had been picked up by the picnickers to run their errands come up just then with a pail of water Golly he ejaculated in very audible tones If there ain t missus Pennington s hired girl missus Keyton Wells stiffened with horror Winslow darted a furious glance at the tell tale that would have annihilated anything except a small boy Will Evans grinned and went on talking to Nelly who had failed to hear or at least to heed the exclamation The mischief was done the social thermometer went down to zero in Nelly s neighbourhood The women ignored her altogether Winslow set his teeth together and registered a mental vow to wring Rufus Hent s sunburned neck at the first opportunity He escorted Nelly to the table and waited on her with ostentatious deference while missus Keyton Wells glanced at him stonily and made up her mind to tell his mother when she went home Nelly s social ostracism did not affect her appetite But after lunch was over she walked down to the skiff Winslow followed her Do you want to go home he asked Yes it s time I went for the cats may be raidin the pantry But you must not come your friends here want you Nonsense said Winslow sulkily If you are going I am too But Nelly was too quick for him she sprang into the skiff unwound the rope and pushed off before he guessed her intention I can row myself home and I mean to she announced taking up the oars defiantly Nelly he implored Nelly looked at him wickedly You d better go back to your friends That old woman with the eyeglasses is watchin you Winslow said something strong under his breath as he went back to the others Will Evans and his chums began to chaff him about Nelly but he looked so dangerous that they concluded to stop There is no denying that Winslow was in a fearful temper just then with missus Keyton Wells Evans himself Nelly in fact with all the world His friends drove him home in the evening on their way to the station and dropped him at the Beckwith farm At dusk he went moodily down to the shore Far up the Bend was dim and shadowy and stars were shining above the wooded shores Over the river the Pennington farmhouse lights twinkled out alluringly Winslow watched them until he could stand it no longer Nelly had made off with his skiff but Perry Beckwith s dory was ready to hand In five minutes Winslow was grounding her on the West shore Nelly was sitting on a rock at the landing place He went over and sat down silently beside her A full moon was rising above the dark hills up the Bend and in the faint light the girl was wonderfully lovely I thought you weren t comin over at all tonight she said smiling up at him and I was sorry because I wanted to say goodbye to you Goodbye Nelly you re not going away Yes The cats were in the pantry when I got home Nelly Well to be serious I m not goin for that but I really am goin I had a letter from Dad this evenin Did you have a good time after I left this afternoon Did missus Keyton Wells thaw out Hang missus Keyton Wells Nelly where are you going To Dad of course We used to live down south together but two months ago we broke up housekeepin and come north We thought we could do better up here you know Dad started out to look for a place to settle down and I came here while he was prospectin He s got a house now he says and wants me to go right off I m goin tomorrow Nelly you mustn t go you mustn t I tell you exclaimed Winslow in despair I love you I love you you must stay with me forever You don t know what you re sayin mister Winslow said Nelly coldly Why you can t marry me a common servant girl I can and I will if you ll have me answered Winslow recklessly I can t ever let you go I ve loved you ever since I first saw you Nelly won t you be my wife Don t you love me Well yes I do confessed Nelly suddenly and then it was fully five minutes before Winslow gave her a chance to say anything else Oh what will your people say she contrived to ask at last Won t they be in a dreadful state Oh it will never do for you to marry me Won t it said Winslow in a tone of satisfaction I rather think it will Of course my family will rampage a bit at first I daresay Father ll turn me out Don t worry over that Nelly I m not afraid of work I m not afraid of anything except losing you You ll have to see what Dad says remarked Nelly after another eloquent interlude He won t object will he I ll write to him or go and see him Where is he He is in town at the Arlington The Arlington Winslow was amazed The Arlington was the most exclusive and expensive hotel in town What is he doing there Transacting a real estate or railroad deal with your father I believe or something of that sort Nelly Well What do you mean Just what I say Winslow got up and looked at her Nelly who are you Helen Ray Scott at your service sir Not Helen Ray Scott the daughter of the railroad king The same Are you sorry that you re engaged to her If you are she ll stay Nelly Ray Winslow dropped back on the seat with a long breath Nelly I don t understand Why did you deceive me I feel stunned Oh do forgive me she said merrily I shouldn t have I suppose but you know you took me for the hired girl the very first time you saw me and you patronized me and called me Nelly so I let you think so just for fun I never thought it would come to this When Father and I came north I took a fancy to come here and stay with missus Pennington who is an old nurse of mine until Father decided where to take up our abode I got here the night before we met My trunk was delayed so I put on an old cotton dress her niece had left here and you came and saw me I made missus Pennington keep the secret she thought it great fun and I really was a great hand to do little chores and keep the cats in subjection too I made mistakes in grammar and dropped my g s on purpose it was such fun to see you wince when I did it It was cruel to tease you so I suppose but it was so sweet just to be loved for myself not because I was an heiress and a belle I couldn t bear to tell you the truth Did you think I couldn t read your thoughts this afternoon when I insisted on going ashore You were a little ashamed of me you know you were I didn t blame you for that but if you hadn t gone ashore and taken me as you did I would never have spoken to you again missus Keyton Wells won t snub me next time we meet And some way I don t think your father will turn you out either Have you forgiven me yet Burton I shall never call you anything but Nelly said Winslow irrelevantly The Red Room You would have me tell you the story Grandchild Tis a sad one and best forgotten few remember it now There are always sad and dark stories in old families such as ours Yet I have promised and must keep my word So sit down here at my feet and rest your bright head on my lap that I may not see in your young eyes the shadows my story will bring across their bonny blue I was a mere child when it all happened yet I remember it but too well and I can recall how pleased I was when my father s stepmother missus Montressor she not liking to be called grandmother seeing she was but turned of fifty and a handsome woman still 
5000-30597-0000	train-other-500	wrote to my mother that she must send little Beatrice up to Montressor Place for the Christmas holidays So I went joyfully though my mother grieved to part with me she had little to love save me my father Conrad Montressor having been lost at sea when but three months wed
5000-30597-0001	train-other-500	My aunts were wont to tell me how much I resembled him being so they said a Montressor to the backbone and this I took to mean commendation for the Montressors were a well descended and well thought of family and the women were noted for their beauty This I could well believe
5000-30597-0002	train-other-500	since of all my aunts there was not one but was counted a pretty woman
none	none	 Therefore I took heart of grace when I thought of my dark face and spindling shape 
5000-30597-0003	train-other-500	hoping that when I should be grown up I might be counted not unworthy of my race The Place was an old fashioned mysterious house such as I delighted in
none	none	 and missus Montressor was ever kind to me albeit a little stern for she was a proud woman and cared but little for children having none of her own But there were books there to pore over without let or hindrance for nobody questioned of my whereabouts if I but kept out of the way 
5000-30597-0004	train-other-500	and strange dim family portraits on the walls to gaze upon until I knew each proud old face well and had visioned a history for it in my own mind for I was given to dreaming and was older and wiser than my years having no childish companions to keep me still a child
none	none	 There were always some of my aunts at the Place to kiss and make much of me for my father s sake for he had been their favourite brother My aunts there were eight of them 
5000-30597-0005	train-other-500	had all married well so said people who knew and lived not far away
none	none	 coming home often to take tea with missus Montressor 
5000-30597-0006	train-other-500	who had always gotten on well with her step daughters or to help prepare for some festivity or other for they were notable housekeepers every one
none	none	 They were all at Montressor Place for Christmas and I got more petting than I deserved albeit they looked after me somewhat more strictly than did missus Montressor 
5000-30597-0007	train-other-500	and saw to it that I did not read too many fairy tales or sit up later at nights than became my years But it was not for fairy tales and sugarplums nor yet for petting that I rejoiced to be at the Place at that time
5000-30597-0008	train-other-500	Though I spoke not of it to anyone I had a great longing to see my Uncle Hugh s wife concerning whom I had heard much both good and bad
none	none	 My Uncle Hugh albeit the oldest of the family had never married until now 
5000-30597-0009	train-other-500	and all the countryside rang with talk of his young wife I did not hear as much as I wished for the gossips took heed to my presence when I drew anear and turned to other matters
none	none	 Yet being somewhat keener of comprehension than they knew I heard and understood not a little of their talk And so I came to know that neither proud missus Montressor nor my good aunts nor even my gentle mother looked with overmuch favour on what my Uncle Hugh had done 
5000-30597-0010	train-other-500	And I did hear that missus Montressor had chosen a wife for her stepson of good family and some beauty
none	none	 but that my Uncle Hugh would have none of her a thing missus Montressor found hard to pardon 
5000-30597-0011	train-other-500	yet might so have done had not my uncle on his last voyage to the Indies for he went often in his own vessels married and brought home a foreign bride of whom no one knew aught save that her beauty was a thing to dazzle the day and that she was of some strange alien blood
5000-30597-0012	train-other-500	such as ran not in the blue veins of the Montressors Some had much to say of her pride and insolence and wondered if missus Montressor would tamely yield her mistress ship to the stranger
5000-30597-0013	train-other-500	But others who were taken with her loveliness and grace said that the tales told were born of envy and malice and that Alicia Montressor was well worthy of her name and station So I halted between two opinions and thought to judge for myself
5000-30597-0014	train-other-500	but when I went to the Place my Uncle Hugh and his bride were gone for a time and I had even to swallow my disappointment and bide their return with all my small patience But my aunts and their stepmother talked much of Alicia and they spoke slightingly of her
5000-30597-0015	train-other-500	saying that she was but a light woman and that no good would come of my Uncle Hugh s having wed her with other things of a like nature Also they spoke of the company she gathered around her thinking her to have strange and unbecoming companions for a Montressor
none	none	 All this I heard and pondered much over 
5000-30597-0016	train-other-500	although my good aunts supposed that such a chit as I would take no heed to their whisperings When I was not with them helping to whip eggs and stone raisins and being watched to see that I ate not more than one out of five I was surely to be found in the wing hall poring over my book and grieving
5000-30597-0017	train-other-500	that I was no more allowed to go into the Red Room
none	none	 The wing hall was a narrow one and dim connecting the main rooms of the Place with an older wing 
5000-30597-0018	train-other-500	built in a curious way The hall was lighted by small square paned windows and at its end a little flight of steps led up to the Red Room Whenever I had been at the Place before and this was often I had passed much of my time in this same Red Room
none	none	 It was missus Montressor s sitting room then where she wrote her letters and examined household accounts and sometimes had an old gossip in to tea 
5000-30597-0019	train-other-500	The room was low ceilinged and dim hung with red damask and with odd square windows high up under the eaves and a dark wainscoting all around it And there I loved to sit quietly on the red sofa and read my fairy tales or talk dreamily
5000-30597-0020	train-other-500	to the swallows fluttering crazily against the tiny panes
none	none	 When I had gone this Christmas to the Place I soon bethought myself of the Red Room for I had a great love for it 
5000-30597-0021	train-other-500	But I had got no further than the steps when missus Montressor came sweeping down the hall in haste and catching me by the arm pulled me back as roughly as if it had been Bluebeard s chamber itself into which I was venturing Then seeing my face
none	none	 which I doubt not was startled enough she seemed to repent of her haste and patted me gently on the head 
5000-30597-0022	train-other-500	There there little Beatrice Did I frighten you child Forgive an old woman s thoughtlessness
none	none	 But be not too ready to go where you are not bidden and never venture foot in the Red Room now for it belongs to your Uncle Hugh s wife 
5000-30597-0023	train-other-500	and let me tell you she is not over fond of intruders
none	none	 I felt sorry overmuch to hear this nor could I see why my new aunt should care if I went in once in a while 
5000-30597-0024	train-other-500	as had been my habit to talk to the swallows and misplace nothing But missus Montressor saw to it that I obeyed her and I went no more to the Red Room but busied myself with other matters For there were great doings at the Place and much coming and going My aunts were never idle
5000-30597-0025	train-other-500	there was to be much festivity Christmas week and a ball on Christmas Eve And my aunts had promised me though not till I had wearied them of my coaxing that I should stay up that night and see as much of the gaiety as was good for me
none	none	 So I did their errands and went early to bed every night without complaint 
5000-30597-0026	train-other-500	though I did this the more readily for that when they thought me safely asleep they would come in and talk around my bedroom fire saying that of Alicia which I should not have heard
none	none	 At last came the day when my Uncle Hugh and his wife were expected home 
5000-30597-0027	train-other-500	though not until my scanty patience was well nigh wearied out
none	none	 and we were all assembled to meet them in the great hall where a ruddy firelight was gleaming My Aunt Frances had dressed me in my best white frock and my crimson sash 
5000-30597-0028	train-other-500	with much lamenting over my skinny neck and arms and bade me behave prettily as became my bringing up So I slipped in a corner my hands and feet cold with excitement for I think every drop of blood in my body had gone to my head
none	none	 and my heart beat so hardly that it even pained me 
5000-30597-0029	train-other-500	Then the door opened and Alicia for so I was used to hearing her called
none	none	 nor did I ever think of her as my aunt in my own mind came in and a little in the rear my tall dark uncle 
5000-30597-0030	train-other-500	She came proudly forward to the fire and stood there superbly while she loosened her cloak
none	none	 nor did she see me at all at first but nodded a little disdainfully it seemed to missus Montressor and my aunts who were grouped about the drawing room door very ladylike and quiet 
5000-30597-0031	train-other-500	But I neither saw nor heard aught at the time save her only for her beauty when she came forth from her crimson cloak and hood was something so wonderful that I forgot my manners and stared at her as one fascinated as indeed I was
5000-30597-0032	train-other-500	for never had I seen such loveliness and hardly dreamed it
none	none	 Pretty women I had seen in plenty for my aunts and my mother were counted fair 
5000-30597-0033	train-other-500	but my uncle s wife was as little like to them as a sunset glow to pale moonshine or a crimson rose to white day lilies
none	none	 Nor can I paint her to you in words as I saw her then with the long tongues of firelight licking her white neck 
5000-30597-0034	train-other-500	and wavering over the rich masses of her red gold hair She was tall so tall that my aunts looked but insignificant beside her and they were of no mean height as became their race yet no queen could have carried herself more royally
5000-30597-0035	train-other-500	and all the passion and fire of her foreign nature burned in her splendid eyes that might have been dark or light for aught that I could ever tell but which seemed always like pools of warm flame now tender now fierce
none	none	 Her skin was like a delicate white rose leaf and when she spoke 
5000-30597-0036	train-other-500	I told my foolish self that never had I heard music before nor do I ever again think to hear a voice so sweet so liquid as that which rippled over her ripe lips I had often in my own mind pictured this my first meeting with Alicia
5000-30597-0037	train-other-500	now in one way now in another but never had I dreamed of her speaking to me at all so that it came to me as a great surprise when she turned and holding out her lovely hands said very graciously
none	none	 And is this the little Beatrice I have heard much of you 
5000-30597-0038	train-other-500	come kiss me child And I went despite my Aunt Elizabeth s black frown for the glamour of her loveliness was upon me and I no longer wondered that my Uncle Hugh should have loved her
none	none	 Very proud of her was he too 
5000-30597-0039	train-other-500	yet I felt rather than saw for I was sensitive and quick of perception as old young children ever are that there was something other than pride and love in his face when he looked on her and more in his manner than the fond lover as it were a sort of lurking mistrust
none	none	 Nor could I think though to me the thought seemed as treason that she loved her husband overmuch for she seemed half condescending and half disdainful to him yet one thought not of this in her presence but only remembered it when she had gone When she went out it seemed to me that nothing was left so I crept lonesomely away to the wing hall and sat down by a window to dream of her 
5000-30597-0040	train-other-500	and she filled my thoughts so fully that it was no surprise when I raised my eyes and saw her coming down the hall alone her bright head shining against the dark old walls
5000-30597-0041	train-other-500	When she paused by me and asked me lightly of what I was dreaming since I had such a sober face I answered her truly that it was of her whereat she laughed as one not ill pleased and said half mockingly
none	none	 Waste not your thoughts so little Beatrice But come with me child if you will for I have taken a strange fancy to your solemn eyes 
5000-30597-0042	train-other-500	Perchance the warmth of your young life may thaw out the ice that has frozen around my heart ever since I came among these cold Montressors
none	none	 And though I understood not her meaning I went glad to see the Red Room once more So she made me sit down and talk to her which I did for shyness was no failing of mine and she asked me many questions and some that I thought she should not have asked 
5000-30597-0043	train-other-500	but I could not answer them so twere little harm After that I spent a part of every day with her in the Red Room And my Uncle Hugh was there often and he would kiss her and praise her loveliness not heeding my presence for I was but a child
5000-30597-0044	train-other-500	Yet it ever seemed to me that she endured rather than welcomed his caresses and at times the ever burning flame in her eyes glowed so luridly that a chill dread would creep over me
none	none	 and I would remember what my Aunt Elizabeth 
5000-30597-0045	train-other-500	had said she being a bitter tongued woman though kind at heart that this strange creature would bring on us all some evil fortune yet Then would I strive to banish such thoughts and chide myself for doubting one so kind to me
5000-30597-0046	train-other-500	When Christmas Eve drew nigh my silly head was full of the ball day and night But a grievous disappointment befell me for I awakened that day very ill with a most severe cold
5000-30597-0047	train-other-500	and though I bore me bravely my aunts discovered it soon when despite my piteous pleadings I was put to bed where I cried bitterly and would not be comforted For I thought I should not see the fine folk and more than all Alicia
5000-30597-0048	train-other-500	But that disappointment at least was spared me for at night she came into my room knowing of my longing
none	none	 she was ever indulgent to my little wishes 
5000-30597-0049	train-other-500	And when I saw her I forgot my aching limbs and burning brow and even the ball I was not to see for never was mortal creature so lovely as she standing there by my bed Her gown was of white and there was nothing I could liken the stuff to save moonshine
5000-30597-0050	train-other-500	falling athwart a frosted pane and out from it swelled her gleaming breast and arms so bare that it seemed to me a shame to look upon them Yet it could not be denied they were of wondrous beauty white as polished marble
5000-30597-0051	train-other-500	And all about her snowy throat and rounded arms and in the masses of her splendid hair were sparkling gleaming stones with hearts of pure light
none	none	 which I know now to have been diamonds but knew not then for never had I seen aught of their like 
5000-30597-0052	train-other-500	And I gazed at her drinking in her beauty until my soul was filled as she stood like some goddess before her worshipper
none	none	 I think she read my thought in my face and liked it for she was a vain woman 
5000-30597-0053	train-other-500	and to such even the admiration of a child is sweet Then she leaned down to me until her splendid eyes looked straight into my dazzled ones
none	none	 Tell me little Beatrice 
5000-30597-0054	train-other-500	for they say the word of a child is to be believed
none	none	 tell me do you think me beautiful 
5000-30597-0055	train-other-500	I found my voice and told her truly that I thought her beautiful beyond my dreams of angels as indeed she was Whereat she smiled as one well pleased Then my Uncle Hugh came in and though I thought
5000-30597-0056	train-other-500	that his face darkened as he looked on the naked splendour of her breast and arms as if he liked not that the eyes of other men should gloat on it yet he kissed her with all a lover s fond pride while she looked at him half mockingly Then said he
5000-30597-0057	train-other-500	Sweet will you grant me a favour And she answered It may be that I will And he said Do not dance with that man tonight Alicia I mistrust him much
none	none	 His voice had more of a husband s command than a lover s entreaty 
5000-30597-0058	train-other-500	She looked at him with some scorn but when she saw his face grow black for the Montressors brooked scant disregard of their authority as I had good reason to know she seemed to change and a smile came to her lips though her eyes glowed balefully
none	none	 Then she laid her arms about his neck and though it seemed to me that she had as soon strangled 
5000-30597-0059	train-other-500	as embraced him her voice was wondrous sweet and caressing as she murmured in his ear He laughed and his brow cleared though he said still sternly Do not try me too far Alicia Then they went out
none	none	 she a little in advance and very stately 
5000-30597-0060	train-other-500	After that my aunts also came in very beautifully and modestly dressed but they seemed to me as nothing after Alicia For I was caught in the snare of her beauty and the longing to see her again so grew upon me that after a time I did an undutiful and disobedient thing
5000-30597-0061	train-other-500	I had been straitly charged to stay in bed which I did not but got up and put on a gown For it was in my mind to go quietly down
none	none	 if by chance I might again see Alicia 
5000-30597-0062	train-other-500	myself unseen But when I reached the great hall I heard steps approaching and having a guilty conscience I slipped aside into the blue parlour and hid me behind the curtains lest my aunts should see me Then Alicia came in
none	none	 and with her a man whom I had never before seen 
5000-30597-0063	train-other-500	Yet I instantly bethought myself of a lean black snake with a glittering and evil eye which I had seen in missus Montressor s garden two summers agone and which was like to have bitten me
5000-30597-0064	train-other-500	John the gardener had killed it and I verily thought that if it had a soul it must have gotten into this man Alicia sat down and he beside her and when he had put his arms about her he kissed her face and lips
5000-30597-0065	train-other-500	Nor did she shrink from his embrace but even smiled and leaned nearer to him with a little smooth motion as they talked to each other in some strange foreign tongue I was but a child and innocent nor knew I aught of honour and dishonour
none	none	 Yet it seemed to me that no man should kiss her save only my Uncle Hugh 
5000-30597-0066	train-other-500	and from that hour I mistrusted Alicia though I understood not then what I afterwards did And as I watched them not thinking of playing the spy I saw her face grow suddenly cold and she straightened herself up and pushed away her lover s arms
5000-30597-0067	train-other-500	Then I followed her guilty eyes to the door where stood my Uncle Hugh and all the pride and passion of the Montressors sat on his lowering brow Yet he came forward quietly as Alicia and the snake drew apart and stood up
5000-30597-0068	train-other-500	At first he looked not at his guilty wife but at her lover and smote him heavily in the face
none	none	 Whereat he being a coward at heart as are all villains turned white and slunk from the room 
5000-30597-0069	train-other-500	with a muttered oath nor was he stayed My uncle turned to Alicia and very calmly and terribly he said From this hour you are no longer wife of mine
5000-30597-0070	train-other-500	And there was that in his tone which told that his forgiveness and love should be hers nevermore Then he motioned her out and she went like a proud queen with her glorious head erect and no shame on her brow As for me
5000-30597-0071	train-other-500	when they were gone I crept away dazed and bewildered enough
none	none	 and went back to my bed having seen and heard more than I had a mind for 
5000-30597-0072	train-other-500	as disobedient people and eavesdroppers ever do But my Uncle Hugh kept his word and Alicia was no more wife to him save only in name Yet of gossip or scandal there was none for the pride of his race kept secret his dishonour
5000-30597-0073	train-other-500	nor did he ever seem other than a courteous and respectful husband Nor did missus Montressor and my aunts though they wondered much among themselves learn aught for they dared question neither their brother nor Alicia who carried herself as loftily as ever
5000-30597-0074	train-other-500	and seemed to pine for neither lover nor husband As for me no one dreamed I knew aught of it and I kept my own counsel as to what I had seen in the blue parlour on the night of the Christmas ball
5000-30597-0075	train-other-500	After the New Year I went home but ere long missus Montressor sent for me again saying that the house was lonely without little Beatrice So I went again and found all unchanged though the Place was very quiet and Alicia went out but little from the Red Room
5000-30597-0076	train-other-500	Of my Uncle Hugh I saw little save when he went and came on the business of his estate somewhat more gravely and silently than of yore or brought to me books and sweetmeats from town But every day I was with Alicia in the Red Room
5000-30597-0077	train-other-500	where she would talk to me oftentimes wildly and strangely but always kindly
none	none	 And though I think missus Montressor liked our intimacy none too well she said no word and I came and went as I listed with Alicia 
5000-30597-0078	train-other-500	though never quite liking her strange ways
none	none	 and the restless fire in her eyes Nor would I ever kiss her after I had seen her lips pressed by the snake s 
5000-30597-0079	train-other-500	though she sometimes coaxed me and grew pettish and vexed when I would not but she guessed not my reason March came in that year like a lion exceedingly hungry and fierce and my Uncle Hugh had ridden away through the storm nor thought to be back for some days
5000-30597-0080	train-other-500	In the afternoon I was sitting in the wing hall dreaming wondrous day dreams when Alicia called me to the Red Room And as I went I marvelled anew at her loveliness for the blood was leaping in her face and her jewels were dim before the lustre of her eyes
5000-30597-0081	train-other-500	Her hand when she took mine was burning hot and her voice had a strange ring Come little Beatrice she said come talk to me for I know not what to do with my lone self today Time hangs heavily in this gloomy house I do verily think this Red Room has an evil influence over me
none	none	 See if your childish prattle can drive away the ghosts that riot in these dark old corners 
5000-30597-0082	train-other-500	ghosts of a ruined and shamed life Nay shrink not do I talk wildly I mean not all I say my brain seems on fire little Beatrice Come it may be you know some grim old legend of this room it must surely have one
none	none	 Never was place fitter for a dark deed 
5000-30597-0083	train-other-500	Tush never be so frightened child forget my vagaries Tell me now and I will listen Whereat she cast herself lithely on the satin couch and turned her lovely face on me
none	none	 So I gathered up my small wits and told her what I was not supposed to know 
5000-30597-0084	train-other-500	how that generations agone a Montressor had disgraced himself and his name and that when he came home to his mother she had met him in that same Red Room and flung at him taunts and reproaches forgetting whose breast had nourished him
none	none	 and that he frantic with shame and despair turned his sword against his own heart and so died 
5000-30597-0085	train-other-500	But his mother went mad with her remorse and was kept a prisoner in the Red Room until her death So lamely told I the tale as I had heard my Aunt Elizabeth tell it when she knew not I listened or understood Alicia heard me through and said nothing
5000-30597-0086	train-other-500	save that it was a tale worthy of the Montressors Whereat I bridled for I too was a Montressor and proud of it But she took my hand soothingly in hers and said Little Beatrice if tomorrow or the next day they should tell you those cold proud women
5000-30597-0087	train-other-500	that Alicia was unworthy of your love tell me would you believe them And I remembering what I had seen in the blue parlour was silent for I could not lie So she flung my hand away with a bitter laugh
5000-30597-0088	train-other-500	and picked lightly from the table anear a small dagger with a jewelled handle It seemed to me a cruel looking toy and I said so whereat she smiled and drew her white fingers down the thin shining blade in a fashion that made me cold
5000-30597-0089	train-other-500	Such a little blow with this she said such a little blow and the heart beats no longer the weary brain rests the lips and eyes smile never again Twere a short path out of all difficulties my Beatrice
5000-30597-0090	train-other-500	And I understanding her not yet shivering begged her to cast it aside which she did carelessly and putting a hand under my chin she turned up my face to hers Little grave eyed Beatrice tell me truly
5000-30597-0091	train-other-500	would it grieve you much if you were never again to sit here with Alicia in this same Red Room And I made answer earnestly that it would glad that I could say so much truly Then her face grew tender and she sighed deeply
none	none	 Presently she opened a quaint inlaid box and took from it a shining gold chain of rare workmanship and exquisite design 
5000-30597-0092	train-other-500	and this she hung around my neck
none	none	 nor would suffer me to thank her but laid her hand gently on my lips Now go she said But ere you leave me little Beatrice grant me but the one favour 
5000-30597-0093	train-other-500	it may be that I shall never ask another of you Your people I know those cold Montressors care little for me
none	none	 but with all my faults I have ever been kind to you 
5000-30597-0094	train-other-500	So when the morrow s come and they tell you that Alicia is as one worse than dead think not of me with scorn only but grant me a little pity for I was not always what I am now
none	none	 and might never have become so had a little child like you been always anear me to keep me pure and innocent And I would have you but the once lay your arms about my neck and kiss me 
5000-30597-0095	train-other-500	And I did so wondering much at her manner for it had in it a strange tenderness and some sort of hopeless longing Then she gently put me from the room and I sat musing by the hall window until night fell darkly
none	none	 and a fearsome night it was of storm and blackness And I thought how well it was that my Uncle Hugh had not to return in such a tempest 
5000-30597-0096	train-other-500	Yet ere the thought had grown cold the door opened and he strode down the hall his cloak drenched and wind twisted in one hand a whip as though he had but then sprung from his horse in the other what seemed like a crumpled letter
5000-30597-0097	train-other-500	Nor was the night blacker than his face and he took no heed of me as I ran after him thinking selfishly of the sweetmeats he had promised to bring me but I thought no more of them when I got to the door of the Red Room
5000-30597-0098	train-other-500	Alicia stood by the table hooded and cloaked as for a journey but her hood had slipped back and her face rose from it marble white save where her wrathful eyes burned out with dread and guilt and hatred in their depths
5000-30597-0099	train-other-500	while she had one arm raised as if to thrust him back As for my uncle he stood before her and I saw not his face but his voice was low and terrible speaking words I understood not then though long afterwards I came to know their meaning
none	none	 And he cast foul scorn at her that she should have thought to fly with her lover 
5000-30597-0100	train-other-500	and swore that naught should again thwart his vengeance with other threats wild and dreadful enough Yet she said no word until he had done and then she spoke but what she said I know not save that it was full of hatred and defiance and wild accusation
5000-30597-0101	train-other-500	such as a mad woman might have uttered And she defied him even then to stop her flight
none	none	 though he told her to cross that threshold would mean her death 
5000-30597-0102	train-other-500	for he was a wronged and desperate man
none	none	 and thought of nothing save his 
5000-30597-0103	train-other-500	own dishonour Then she made as if to pass him but he caught her by her white wrist she turned on him with fury and I saw her right hand reach stealthily out over the table behind her where lay the dagger
none	none	 Let me go she hissed 
5000-30597-0104	train-other-500	And he said I will not Then she turned herself about and struck at him with the dagger and never saw I such a face as was hers at the moment He fell heavily yet held her even in death so that she had to wrench herself free
none	none	 with a shriek that rings yet in my ears on a night when the wind wails over the rainy moors 
5000-30597-0105	train-other-500	She rushed past me unheeding and fled down the hall like a hunted creature and I heard the heavy door clang hollowly behind her As for me I stood there looking at the dead man for I could neither move nor speak and was like to have died of horror
5000-30597-0106	train-other-500	And presently I knew nothing nor did I come to my recollection for many a day when I lay abed sick of a fever and more like to die than live
5000-30597-0107	train-other-500	So that when at last I came out from the shadow of death my Uncle Hugh had been long cold in his grave and the hue and cry for his guilty wife was well nigh over since naught had been seen or heard of her since she fled the country with her foreign lover
none	none	 When I came rightly to my remembrance they questioned me as to what I had seen and heard in the Red Room And I told them as best I could though much aggrieved that to my questions they would answer nothing save to bid me to stay still and think not of the matter Then my mother sorely vexed over my adventures which in truth were but sorry ones for a child took me home 
5000-30597-0108	train-other-500	Nor would she let me keep Alicia s chain but made away with it
none	none	 how I knew not and little cared for the sight of it was loathsome to me It was many years ere I went again to Montressor Place 
5000-30597-0109	train-other-500	and I never saw the Red Room more for missus Montressor had the old wing torn down deeming its sorrowful memories dark heritage enough for the next Montressor
none	none	 So Grandchild the sad tale is ended and you will not see the Red Room when you go next month to Montressor Place The swallows still build under the eaves though I know not if you will understand their speech as I did The Setness of Theodosia When Theodosia Ford married Wesley Brooke after a courtship of three years everybody concerned was satisfied There was nothing particularly romantic in either the courtship or marriage Wesley was a steady well meaning rather slow fellow comfortably off He was not at all handsome But Theodosia was a very pretty girl with the milky colouring of an auburn blonde and large china blue eyes She looked mild and Madonna like and was known to be sweet tempered Wesley s older brother Irving Brooke had married a woman who kept him in hot water all the time so Heatherton folks said but they thought there was no fear of that with Wesley and Theodosia They would get along together all right Only old Jim Parmelee shook his head and said They might and then again they mightn t he knew the stock they came of and it was a kind you could never predict about Wesley and Theodosia were third cousins this meant that old Henry Ford had been the great great grandfather of them both Jim Parmelee who was ninety had been a small boy when this remote ancestor was still alive I mind him well said old Jim on the morning of Theodosia s wedding day There was a little group about the blacksmith s forge Old Jim was in the centre He was a fat twinkling eyed old man fresh and ruddy in spite of his ninety years And he went on he was about the settest man you d ever see or want to see When old Henry Ford made up his mind on any p int a cyclone wouldn t turn him a hairsbreadth no nor an earthquake neither Didn t matter a mite how much he suffered for it he d stick to it if it broke his heart There was always some story or other going round about old Henry s setness The family weren t quite so bad only Tom He was Dosia s great grandfather and a regular chip of the old block Since then it s cropped out now and again all through the different branches of the family I mistrust if Dosia hasn t got a spice of it and Wes Brooke too but mebbe not Old Jim was the only croaker Wesley and Theodosia were married in the golden prime of the Indian summer and settled down on their snug little farm Dosia was a beautiful bride and Wesley s pride in her was amusingly apparent He thought nothing too good for her the Heatherton people said It was a sight to make an old heart young to see him march up the aisle of the church on Sunday in all the glossy splendour of his wedding suit his curly black head held high and his round boyish face shining with happiness stopping and turning proudly at his pew to show Theodosia in They always sat alone together in the big pew and Alma Spencer who sat behind them declared that they held each other s hands all through the service This lasted until spring then came a sensation and scandal such as decorous Heatherton had not known since the time Isaac Allen got drunk at Centreville Fair and came home and kicked his wife One evening in early April Wesley came home from the store at the Corner where he had lingered to talk over politics and farming methods with his cronies This evening he was later than usual and Theodosia had his supper kept warm for him She met him on the porch and kissed him He kissed her in return and held her to him for a minute with her bright head on his shoulder The frogs were singing down in the south meadow swamp and there was a splendour of silvery moonrise over the wooded Heatherton hills Theodosia always remembered that moment When they went in Wesley full of excitement began to talk of what he had heard at the store Ogden Greene and Tom Cary were going to sell out and go to Manitoba There were better chances for a man out there he said in Heatherton he might slave all his life and never make more than a bare living Out west he might make a fortune Wesley talked on in this strain for some time rehashing all the arguments he had heard Greene and Cary use He had always been rather disposed to grumble at his limited chances in Heatherton and now the great West seemed to stretch before him full of alluring prospects and visions Ogden and Tom wanted him to go too he said He had half a notion to Heatherton was a stick in the mud sort of place anyhow What say Dosia He looked across the table at her his eyes bright and questioning Theodosia had listened in silence as she poured his tea and passed him her hot flaky biscuits There was a little perpendicular wrinkle between her straight eyebrows I think Ogden and Tom are fools she said crisply They have good farms here What do they want to go west for or you either Don t get silly notions in your head Wes Wesley flushed Wouldn t you go with me Dosia he said trying to speak lightly No I wouldn t said Theodosia in her calm sweet voice Her face was serene but the little wrinkle had grown deeper Old Jim Parmelee would have known what it meant He had seen the same expression on old Henry Ford s face many a time Wesley laughed good humouredly as if at a child His heart was suddenly set on going west and he was sure he could soon bring Theodosia around He did not say anything more about it just then Wesley thought he knew how to manage women When he broached the subject again two days later Theodosia told him plainly that it was no use She would never consent to leave Heatherton and all her friends and go out to the prairies The idea was just rank foolishness and he would soon see that himself All this Theodosia said calmly and sweetly without any trace of temper or irritation Wesley still believed that he could persuade her and he tried perseveringly for a fortnight By the end of that time he discovered that Theodosia was not a great great granddaughter of old Henry Ford for nothing Not that Theodosia ever got angry Neither did she laugh at him She met his arguments and pleadings seriously enough but she never wavered If you go to Manitoba Wes you ll go alone she said I ll never go so there is no use in any more talking Wesley was a descendant of old Henry Ford too Theodosia s unexpected opposition roused all the latent stubbornness of his nature He went over to Centreville oftener and kept his blood at fever heat talking to Greene and Cary who wanted him to go with them and spared no pains at inducement The matter was gossiped about in Heatherton of course People knew that Wesley Brooke had caught the western fever and wanted to sell out and go to Manitoba while Theodosia was opposed to it They thought Dosia would have to give in in the end but said it was a pity Wes Brooke couldn t be contented to stay where he was well off Theodosia s family naturally sided with her and tried to dissuade Wesley But he was mastered by that resentful irritation roused in a man by opposition where he thinks he should be master which will drive him into any cause One day he told Theodosia that he was going She was working her butter in her little snowy clean dairy under the great willows by the well Wesley was standing in the doorway his stout broad shouldered figure filling up the sunlit space He was frowning and sullen I m going west in two weeks time with the boys Dosia he said stubbornly You can come with me or stay here just exactly as you please But I m going Theodosia went on spatting her balls of golden butter on the print in silence She was looking very neat and pretty in her big white apron her sleeves rolled up high above her plump dimpled elbows and her ruddy hair curling about her face and her white throat She looked as pliable as her butter Her silence angered her husband He shuffled impatiently Well what have you to say Dosia Nothing said Theodosia If you have made up your mind to go go you will I suppose But I will not There is no use in talking We ve been over the ground often enough Wes The matter is settled Up to that moment Wesley had always believed that his wife would yield at last when she saw that he was determined Now he realized that she never would Under that exterior of milky dimpled flesh and calm blue eyes was all the iron will of old dead and forgotten Henry Ford This mildest and meekest of girls and wives was not to be moved a hairsbreadth by all argument or entreaty or insistence on a husband s rights A great sudden anger came over the man He lifted his hand and for one moment it seemed to Theodosia as if he meant to strike her Then he dropped it with the first oath that had ever crossed his lips You listen to me he said thickly If you won t go with me I ll never come back here never When you want to do your duty as a wife you can come to me But I ll never come back He turned on his heel and strode away Theodosia kept on spatting her butter The little perpendicular wrinkle had come between her brows again At that moment an odd almost uncanny resemblance to the old portrait of her great great grandfather which hung on the parlour wall at home came out on her girlish face The fortnight passed by Wesley was silent and sullen never speaking to his wife when he could avoid it Theodosia was as sweet and serene as ever She made an extra supply of shirts and socks for him put up his lunch basket and packed his trunk carefully But she never spoke of his journey He did not sell his farm Irving Brooke rented it Theodosia was to live in the house The business arrangements were simple and soon concluded Heatherton folks gossiped a great deal They all condemned Theodosia Even her own people sided against her now They hated to be mixed up in a local scandal and since Wes was bound to go they told Theodosia that it was her duty to go with him no matter how much she disliked it It would be disgraceful not to They might as well have talked to the four winds Theodosia was immoveable They coaxed and argued and blamed it all came to the same thing Even those of them who could be set enough themselves on occasion could not understand Theodosia who had always been so tractable They finally gave up as Wesley had done baffled Time would bring her to her senses they said you just had to leave that still stubborn kind alone On the morning of Wesley s departure Theodosia arose at sunrise and prepared a tempting breakfast Irving Brooke s oldest son Stanley who was to drive Wesley to the station came over early with his express wagon Wesley s trunk corded and labelled stood on the back platform The breakfast was a very silent meal When it was over Wesley put on his hat and overcoat and went to the door around which Theodosia s morning glory vines were beginning to twine The sun was not yet above the trees and the long shadows lay on the dewy grass The wet leaves were flickering on the old maples that grew along the fence between the yard and the clover field beyond The skies were all pearly blue cleanswept of clouds From the little farmhouse the green meadows sloped down to the valley where a blue haze wound in and out like a glistening ribbon Theodosia went out and stood looking inscrutably on while Wesley and Irving hoisted the trunk into the wagon and tied it Then Wesley came up the porch steps and looked at her Dosia he said a little huskily I said I wouldn t ask you to go again but I will Will you come with me yet No said Theodosia gently He held out his hand He did not offer to kiss her Goodbye Dosia Goodbye Wes There was no tremor of an eyelash with her Wesley smiled bitterly and turned away When the wagon reached the end of the little lane he turned and looked back for the last time Through all the years that followed he carried with him the picture of his wife as he saw her then standing amid the airy shadows and wavering golden lights of the morning the wind blowing the skirt of her pale blue wrapper about her feet and ruffling the locks of her bright hair into a delicate golden cloud Then the wagon disappeared around a curve in the road and Theodosia turned and went back into her desolate home For a time there was a great buzz of gossip over the affair People wondered over it Old Jim Parmelee understood better than the others When he met Theodosia he looked at her with a curious twinkle in his keen old eyes Looks as if a man could bend her any way he d a mind to doesn t she he said Looks is deceiving It ll come out in her face by and by she s too young yet but it s there It does seem unnatteral to see a woman so stubborn you d kinder look for it more in a man Wesley wrote a brief letter to Theodosia when he reached his destination He said he was well and was looking about for the best place to settle He liked the country fine He was at a place called Red Butte and guessed he d locate there Two weeks later he wrote again He had taken up a claim of three hundred acres Greene and Cary had done the same They were his nearest neighbours and were three miles away He had knocked up a little shack was learning to cook his own meals and was very busy He thought the country was a grand one and the prospects good Theodosia answered his letter and told him all the Heatherton news She signed herself Theodosia Brooke but otherwise there was nothing in the letter to indicate that it was written by a wife to her husband At the end of a year Wesley wrote and once more asked her to go out to him He was getting on well and was sure she would like the place It was a little rough to be sure but time would improve that Won t you let bygones be bygones Dosia he wrote and come out to me Do my dear wife Theodosia wrote back refusing to go She never got any reply nor did she write again People had given up talking about the matter and asking Theodosia when she was going out to Wes Heatherton had grown used to the chronic scandal within its decorous borders Theodosia never spoke of her husband to anyone and it was known that they did not correspond She took her youngest sister to live with her She had her garden and hens and a cow The farm brought her enough to live on and she was always busy When fifteen years had gone by there were naturally some changes in Heatherton sleepy and unprogressive as it was Most of the old people were in the little hillside burying ground that fronted the sunrise Old Jim Parmelee was there with his recollections of four generations Men and women who had been in their prime when Wesley went away were old now and the children were grown up and married Theodosia was thirty five and was nothing like the slim dimpled girl who had stood on the porch steps and watched her husband drive away that morning fifteen years ago She was stout and comely the auburn hair was darker and arched away from her face in smooth shining waves instead of the old time curls Her face was unlined and fresh coloured but no woman could live in subjection to her own unbending will for so many years and not show it Nobody looking at Theodosia now would have found it hard to believe that a woman with such a determined immoveable face could stick to a course of conduct in defiance of circumstances Wesley Brooke was almost forgotten People knew through correspondents of Greene and Cary that he had prospered and grown rich The curious old story had crystallized into accepted history A life may go on without ripple or disturbance for so many years that it may seem to have settled into a lasting calm then a sudden wind of passion may sweep over it and leave behind a wake of tempestuous waters Such a time came at last to Theodosia One day in August missus Emory Merritt dropped in Emory Merritt s sister was Ogden Greene s wife and the Merritts kept up an occasional correspondence with her Hence Cecilia Merritt always knew what was to be known about Wesley Brooke and always told Theodosia because she had never been expressly forbidden to do so Today she looked slightly excited Secretly she was wondering if the news she brought would have any effect whatever on Theodosia s impassive calm Do you know Dosia Wesley s real sick In fact Phoebe Greene says they have very poor hopes of him He was kind of ailing all the spring it seems and about a month ago he was took down with some kind of slow fever they have out there Phoebe says they have a hired nurse from the nearest town and a good doctor but she reckons he won t get over it That fever goes awful hard with a man of his years Cecilia Merritt who was the fastest talker in Heatherton had got this out before she was brought up by a queer sound half gasp half cry from Theodosia The latter looked as if someone had struck her a physical blow Mercy Dosia you ain t going to faint I didn t suppose you d care You never seemed to care Did you say asked Theodosia thickly that Wesley was sick dying Well that s what Phoebe said She may be mistaken Dosia Brooke you re a queer woman I never could make you out and I never expect to I guess only the Lord who made you can translate you Theodosia stood up The sun was getting low and the valley beneath them ripening to harvest was like a river of gold She folded up her sewing with a steady hand It s five o clock so I ll ask you to excuse me Cecilia I have a good deal to attend to You can ask Emory if he ll drive me to the station in the morning I m going out to Wes Well for the land s sake said Cecilia Merritt feebly as she tied on her gingham sunbonnet She got up and went home in a daze Theodosia packed her trunk and worked all night dry eyed with agony and fear tearing at her heart The iron will had snapped at last like a broken reed and fierce self condemnation seized on her I ve been a wicked woman she moaned A week from that day Theodosia climbed down from the dusty stage that had brought her from the station over the prairies to the unpretentious little house where Wesley Brooke lived A young girl so like what Ogden Greene s wife had been fifteen years before that Theodosia involuntarily exclaimed Phoebe came to the door Beyond her Theodosia saw the white capped nurse Her voice trembled Does does Wesley Brooke live here she asked The girl nodded Yes But he is very ill at present Nobody is allowed to see him Theodosia put up her hand and loosened her bonnet strings as if they were choking her She had been sick with the fear that Wesley would be dead before she got to him The relief was almost overwhelming But I must see him she cried hysterically she the calm easy going Dosia hysterical I am his wife and oh if he had died before I got here The nurse came forward In that case I suppose you must she conceded But he does not expect you I must prepare him for the surprise She turned to the door of a room opening off the kitchen but Theodosia who had hardly heard her was before her She was inside the room before the nurse could prevent her Then she stood afraid and trembling her eyes searching the dim apartment hungrily When they fell on the occupant of the bed Theodosia started in bitter surprise All unconsciously she had been expecting to find Wesley as he had been when they parted Could this gaunt haggard creature with the unkempt beard and prematurely grey hair and the hollow beseeching eyes be the ruddy boyish faced husband of her youth She gave a choking cry of pain and shame and the sick man turned his head Their eyes met Amazement incredulity hope dread all flashed in succession over Wesley Brooke s lined face He raised himself feebly up Dosia he murmured Theodosia staggered across the room and fell on her knees by the bed She clasped his head to her breast and kissed him again and again Oh Wes Wes can you forgive me I ve been a wicked stubborn woman and I ve spoiled our lives Forgive me He held his thin trembling arms around her and devoured her face with his eyes Dosia when did you come Did you know I was sick Wes I can t talk till you say you ve forgiven me Oh Dosia you have just as much to forgive We were both too set I should have been more considerate Just say I forgive you Dosia she entreated I forgive you Dosia he said gently and oh it s so good to see you once more darling There hasn t been an hour since I left you that I haven t longed for your sweet face If I had thought you really cared I d have gone back But I thought you didn t It broke my heart You did though didn t you Oh yes yes yes she said holding him more closely with her tears falling When the young doctor from Red Butte came that evening he found a great improvement in his patient Joy and happiness those world old physicians had done what drugs and medicines had failed to do I m going to get better Doc said Wesley My wife has come and she s going to stay You didn t know I was married did you I ll tell you the story some day I proposed going back east but Dosia says she d rather stay here I m the happiest man in Red Butte Doc He squeezed Theodosia s hand as he had used to do long ago in Heatherton church and Dosia smiled down at him There were no dimples now but her smile was very sweet The ghostly finger of old Henry Ford pointing down through the generations had lost its power to brand with its malediction the life of these his descendants Wesley and Theodosia had joined hands with their long lost happiness The Story of an Invitation Bertha Sutherland hurried home from the post office and climbed the stairs of her boarding house to her room on the third floor Her roommate Grace Maxwell was sitting on the divan by the window looking out into the twilight A year ago Bertha and Grace had come to Dartmouth to attend the Academy and found themselves roommates Bertha was bright pretty and popular the favourite of her classmates and teachers Grace was a grave quiet girl dressed in mourning She was quite alone in the world the aunt who had brought her up having recently died At first she had felt shy with bright and brilliant Bertha but they soon became friends and the year that followed was a very pleasant one It was almost ended now for the terminal exams had begun and in a week s time the school would close for the holidays Have some chocolates Grace said Bertha gaily I got such good news in my letter tonight that I felt I must celebrate it fittingly So I went into Carter s and invested all my spare cash in caramels It s really fortunate the term is almost out for I m nearly bankrupt I have just enough left to furnish a tuck out for commencement night and no more What is your good news may I ask said Grace You know I have an Aunt Margaret commonly called Aunt Meg out at Riversdale don t you There never was such a dear sweet jolly aunty in the world I had a letter from her tonight Listen I ll read you what she says I want you to spend your holidays with me my dear Mary Fairweather and Louise Fyshe and Lily Dennis are coming too So there is just room for one more and that one must be yourself Come to Riversdale when school closes and I ll feed you on strawberries and cream and pound cake and doughnuts and mince pies and all the delicious indigestible things that school girls love and careful mothers condemn Mary and Lou and Lil are girls after your own heart I know and you shall all do just as you like and we ll have picnics and parties and merry doings galore There said Bertha looking up with a laugh Isn t that lovely How delightful it must be to have friends like that to love you and plan for you said Grace wistfully I am sure you will have a pleasant vacation Bertie As for me I am going into Clarkman s bookstore until school reopens I saw mister Clarkman today and he agreed to take me Bertha looked surprised She had not known what Grace s vacation plans were I don t think you ought to do that Grace she said thoughtfully You are not strong and you need a good rest It will be awfully trying to work at Clarkman s all summer There is nothing else for me to do said Grace trying to speak cheerfully You know I m as poor as the proverbial church mouse Bertie and the simple truth is that I can t afford to pay my board all summer and get my winter outfit unless I do something to earn it I shall be too busy to be lonesome and I shall expect long newsy letters from you telling me all your fun passing your vacation on to me at second hand you see Well I must set to work at those algebra problems I tried them before dark but I couldn t solve them My head ached and I felt so stupid How glad I shall be when exams are over I suppose I must revise that senior English this evening said Bertha absently But she made no move to do so She was studying her friend s face How very pale and thin Grace looked surely much paler and thinner than when she had come to the Academy and she had not by any means been plump and rosy then I believe she could not stand two months at Clarkman s thought Bertha If I were not going to Aunt Meg s I would ask her to go home with me Or even if Aunt Meg had room for another guest I d just write her all about Grace and ask if I could bring her with me Aunt Meg would understand she always understands But she hasn t so it can t be Just then a thought darted into Bertha s brain What nonsense she said aloud so suddenly and forcibly that Grace fairly jumped What is Oh nothing much said Bertha getting up briskly See here I m going to get to work I ve wasted enough time She curled herself up on the divan and tried to study her senior English But her thoughts wandered hopelessly and finally she gave it up in despair and went to bed There she could not sleep she lay awake and wrestled with herself It was after midnight when she sat up in bed and said solemnly I will do it Next day Bertha wrote a confidential letter to Aunt Meg She thanked her for her invitation and then told her all about Grace And what I want to ask Aunt Meg is that you will let me transfer my invitation to Grace and ask her to go to Riversdale this summer in my place Don t think me ungrateful No I m sure you won t you always understand things But you can t have us both and I d rather Grace should go It will do her so much good and I have a lovely home of my own to go to and she has none Aunt Meg understood as usual and was perfectly willing So she wrote to Bertha and enclosed a note of invitation for Grace I shall have to manage this affair very carefully reflected Bertha Grace must never suspect that I did it on purpose I will tell her that circumstances have prevented me from accepting Aunt Meg s invitation That is true enough no need to say that the circumstances are hers not mine And I ll say I just asked Aunt Meg to invite her in my place and that she has done so When Grace came home from her history examination that day Bertha told her story and gave her Aunt Meg s cordial note You must come to me in Bertha s place wrote the latter I feel as if I knew you from her letters and I will consider you as a sort of honorary niece and I ll treat you as if you were Bertha herself Isn t it splendid of Aunt Meg said Bertha diplomatically Of course you ll go Gracie Oh I don t know said Grace in bewilderment Are you sure you don t want to go Bertha Indeed I do want to go dreadfully said Bertha frankly But as I ve told you it is impossible But if I am disappointed Aunt Meg musn t be You must go Grace and that is all there is about it In the end Grace did go a little puzzled and doubtful still but thankful beyond words to escape the drudgery of the counter and the noise and heat of the city Bertha went home feeling a little bit blue in secret it cannot be denied but also feeling quite sure that if she had to do it all over again she would do just the same The summer slipped quickly by and finally two letters came to Bertha one from Aunt Meg and one from Grace I ve had a lovely time wrote the latter and oh Bertie what do you think I am to stay here always Oh of course I am going back to school next month but this is to be my home after this Aunt Meg she makes me call her that says I must stay with her for good In Aunt Meg s letter was this paragraph Grace is writing to you and will have told you that I intend to keep her here You know I have always wanted a daughter of my own but my greedy brothers and sisters would never give me one of theirs So I intend to adopt Grace She is the sweetest girl in the world and I am very grateful to you for sending her here You will not know her when you see her She has grown plump and rosy Bertha folded her letters up with a smile I have a vague delightful feeling that I am the good angel in a storybook she said The Touch of Fate missus Major Hill was in her element This did not often happen for in the remote prairie town of the Canadian Northwest where her husband was stationed there were few opportunities for match making And missus Hill was or believed herself to be a born matchmaker Major Hill was in command of the detachment of Northwest Mounted Police at Dufferin Bluff missus Hill was wont to declare that it was the most forsaken place to be found in Canada or out of it but she did her very best to brighten it up and it is only fair to say that the N W M P officers and men seconded her efforts When Violet Thayer came west to pay a long promised visit to her old schoolfellow missus Hill s cup of happiness bubbled over In her secret soul she vowed that Violet should never go back east unless it were post haste to prepare a wedding trousseau There were at least half a dozen eligibles among the M P s and missus Hill after some reflection settled on Ned Madison as the flower of the flock He and Violet are simply made for each other she told Major Hill the evening before Miss Thayer s arrival He has enough money and he is handsome and fascinating And Violet is a beauty and a clever woman into the bargain They can t help falling in love I m sure it s fate Perhaps Miss Thayer may be booked elsewhere already suggested Major Hill He had seen more than one of his wife s card castles fall into heartbreaking ruin Oh no Violet would have told me if that were the case It s really quite time for her to think of settling down She is twenty five you know The men all go crazy over her but she s dreadfully hard to please However she can t help liking Ned He hasn t a single fault I firmly believe it is foreordained And in this belief missus Hill rested securely but nevertheless did not fail to concoct several feminine artifices for the helping on of foreordination It was a working belief with her that it was always well to have the gods in your debt Violet Thayer came saw and conquered Within thirty six hours of her arrival at Dufferin Bluff she had every one of the half dozen eligibles at her feet not to mention a score or more ineligibles She would have been surprised indeed had it been otherwise Miss Thayer knew her power and was somewhat unduly fond of exercising it But she was a very nice girl into the bargain and so thought one and all of the young men who frequented missus Hill s drawing room and counted it richly worth while merely to look at Miss Thayer after having seen nothing for weeks except flabby half breed girls and blue haired squaws Madison was foremost in the field of course Madison was really a nice fellow and quite deserved all missus Hill s encomiums He was good looking and well groomed could sing and dance divinely and play the violin to perfection The other M P s were all jealous of him and more so than ever when Violet Thayer came They did not consider that any one of them had the ghost of a chance if Madison entered the lists against them Violet liked Madison and was very chummy with him after her own fashion She thought all the M P s were nice boys and they amused her for which she was grateful She had expected Dufferin Bluff to be very dull and doubtless it would pall after a time but for a change it was delightful The sixth evening after her arrival found missus Hill s room crowded as usual with M P s Violet was looking her best in a distracting new gown Sergeant Fox afterwards described it to a brother officer as a stunning sort of rig between a cream and a blue and a brown she flirted impartially with all the members of her circle at first but gradually narrowed down to Ned Madison much to the delight of missus Hill who was hovering around like a small brilliant butterfly Violet was talking to Madison and watching John Spencer out of the tail of her eye Spencer was not an M P He had some government post at Dufferin Bluff and this was his first call at Lone Poplar Villa since Miss Thayer s arrival He did not seem to be dazzled by her at all and after his introduction had promptly retired to a corner with Major Hill where they talked the whole evening about the trouble on the Indian reservation at Loon Lake Possibly this indifference piqued Miss Thayer Possibly she considered it refreshing after the servile adulation of the M P s At any rate when all the latter were gathered about the piano singing a chorus with gusto she shook Madison off and went over to the corner where Spencer deserted by the Major whose bass was wanted was sitting in solitary state He looked up indifferently as Violet shimmered down on the divan beside him Sergeant Robinson who was watching them jealously from the corner beyond the palms and would have given his eyes or at least one of them for such a favour mentally vowed that Spencer was the dullest fellow he had ever put those useful members on Don t you sing mister Spencer asked Violet by way of beginning a conversation as she turned her splendid eyes full upon him Robinson would have lost his head under them but Spencer kept his heroically No was his calmly brief reply given without any bluntness but with no evident intention of saying anything more In spite of her social experience Violet felt disconcerted If he doesn t want to talk to me I won t try to make him she thought crossly No man had ever snubbed her so before Spencer listened immovably to the music for a time Then he turned to his companion with a palpable effort to be civilly sociable How do you like the west Miss Thayer he said Violet smiled the smile most men found dangerous Very much so far as I have seen it There is a flavour about the life here that I like but I dare say it would soon pall It must be horribly lonesome here most of the time especially in winter The M P s are always growling that it is returned Spencer with a slight smile For my own part I never find it so Violet decided that his smile was very becoming to him and that she liked the way his dark hair grew over his forehead I don t think I ve seen you at Lone Poplar Villa before she said No I haven t been here for some time I came up tonight to see the Major about the Loon Lake trouble Otherwise you wouldn t have come thought Violet Flattering very Aloud she said Is it serious Oh no A mere squabble among the Indians Have you ever visited the Reservation Miss Thayer No Well you should get some of your M P friends to take you out It would be worth while Why don t you ask me to go yourself said Violet audaciously Spencer smiled again Have I failed in politeness by not doing so I fear you would find me an insufferably dull companion So he was not going to ask her after all Violet felt piqued She was also conscious of a sensation very near akin to disappointment She looked across at Madison How trim and dapper he was I hate a bandbox man she said to herself Spencer meanwhile had picked up one of missus Hill s novels from the stand beside him Fools of Habit he said glancing at the cover I see it is making quite a sensation down east I suppose you ve read it Yes It is very frivolous and clever all froth but delightful froth Did you like it Spencer balanced the novel reflectively on his slender brown hand Well yes rather But I don t care for novels as a rule I don t understand them The hero of this book now do you believe that a man in love would act as he did I don t know said Violet amusedly You ought to be a better judge than I You are a man I have never loved anybody so I am in no position to decide said Spencer There was as little self consciousness in his voice as if he were telling her a fact concerning the Loon Lake trouble Violet rose to the occasion You have an interesting experience to look forward to she said Spencer turned his deep set grey eyes squarely upon her I don t know that When I said I had never loved I meant more than the love of a man for some particular woman I meant love in every sense I do not know what it is to have an affection for any human being My parents died before I can remember My only living relative was a penurious old uncle who brought me up for shame s sake and kicked me out on the world as soon as he could I don t make friends easily I have a few acquaintances whom I like but there is not a soul on earth for whom I care or who cares for me What a revelation love will be to you when it comes said Violet softly Again he looked into her eyes Do you think it will come he asked Before she could reply missus Hill pounced upon them Violet was wanted to sing mister Spencer would excuse her wouldn t he mister Spencer did so obligingly Moreover he got up and bade his hostess good night Violet gave him her hand You will call again she said Spencer looked across at Madison perhaps it was accidental I think not he said If as you say love will come some time it would be a very unpleasant revelation if it came in hopeless guise and one never knows what may happen Miss Thayer was conscious of a distinct fluttering of her heart as she went across to the piano This was a new sensation for her and worthy of being analyzed After the M P s had gone she asked missus Hill who mister Spencer was Oh John Spencer said missus Hill carelessly He s at the head of the Land Office here That s really all I know about him Jack says he is a downright good fellow and all that you know But he s no earthly good in a social way he can t talk or he won t He s flat So different from mister Madison isn t he Very said Violet emphatically After missus Hill had gone out Violet walked to the nearest mirror and looked at herself with her forefinger in the dimple of her chin It is very odd she said She did not mean the dimple Spencer had told her he was not coming back She did not believe this but she did not expect him for a few days Consequently when he appeared the very next evening she was surprised Madison to whom she was talking when Spencer entered does not know to this day what she had started to say to him for she never finished her sentence I wonder if it is the Loon Lake affair again she thought nervously missus Hill came up at this point and whisked Madison off for a waltz Spencer seeing his chance came straight across the room to her Sergeant Robinson who was watching them as usual is willing to make affidavit that Miss Thayer changed colour After his greeting Spencer said nothing He sat beside her and they watched missus Hill and Madison dancing Violet wondered why she did not feel bored When she saw Madison coming back to her she was conscious of an unreasonable anger with him She got up abruptly Let us go out on the verandah she said imperiously It is absolutely stifling in here They went out It was very cool and dusky The lights of the town twinkled out below them and the prairie bluffs behind them were dark and sibilant I am going to drive over to Loon Lake tomorrow afternoon to look into affairs there said Spencer Will you go with me Violet reflected a moment You didn t ask me as if you really wanted me to go she said Spencer put his hand over the white fingers that rested on the railing He bent forward until his breath stirred the tendrils of hair on her forehead Yes I do he said distinctly I want you to go with me to Loon Lake tomorrow more than I ever wanted any thing in my life before Later on when everybody had gone Violet had her bad quarter of an hour with missus Hill That lady felt herself aggrieved I think you treated poor Ned very badly tonight Vi He felt really blue over it And it was awfully bad form to go out with Spencer as you did and stay there so long And you oughtn t to flirt with him he doesn t understand the game I m not going to flirt with him said Miss Thayer calmly Oh I suppose it s just your way Only don t turn the poor fellow s head By the way Ned is coming up with his camera tomorrow afternoon to take us all I m afraid he won t find me at home said Violet sweetly I am going out to Loon Lake with mister Spencer missus Hill flounced off to bed in a pet She was disgusted with everything she declared to the Major Things had been going so nicely and now they were all muddled Isn t Madison coming up to time queried the Major sleepily Madison It s Violet She is behaving abominably She treated poor Ned shamefully tonight You saw yourself how she acted with Spencer and she s going to Loon Lake with him tomorrow she says I m sure I don t know what she can see in him He s the dullest pokiest fellow alive so different from her in every way Perhaps that is why she likes him suggested the Major The attraction of opposites and all that you know But missus Hill crossly told him he didn t know anything about it so being a wise man he held his tongue During the next two weeks missus Hill was the most dissatisfied woman in the four districts and every M P down to the rawest recruit anathemized Spencer in secret a dozen times a day Violet simply dropped everyone else including Madison in the coolest most unmistakable way One night Spencer did not come to Lone Poplar Villa Violet looked for him to the last When she realized that he was not coming she went to the verandah to have it out with herself As she sat huddled up in a dim corner beneath a silkily rustling western maple two M P s came out and not seeing her went on with their conversation Heard about Spencer questioned one No What of him Well they say Miss Thayer s thrown him over Yesterday I was passing here about four in the afternoon and I saw Spencer coming in I went down to the Land Office and was chatting to Cribson when the door opened about half an hour later and Spencer burst in He was pale as the dead and looked wild Has Fyshe gone to Rainy River about those Crown Lands yet he jerked out Cribson said No Then tell him he needn t I m going myself said Spencer and out he bolted He posted off to Rainy River today and won t be back for a fortnight She ll be gone then Rather rough on Spencer after the way she encouraged him returned the other as they passed out of earshot Violet got up All the callers were gone and she swept in to missus Hill dramatically Edith she said in the cold steady voice that to those who knew her meant breakers ahead for somebody mister Spencer was here yesterday when I was riding with the Major was he not What did you tell him about me missus Hill looked at Violet s blazing eyes and wilted I didn t tell him anything much What was it missus Hill began to sob Don t look at me like that Violet He just dropped in and we were talking about you at least I was and I had heard that Harry saint Maur was paying you marked attention before you came west and and that some people thought you were engaged and so and so You told mister Spencer that I was engaged to Harry saint Maur No o o I just hinted I didn t mean an any harm I never dreamed you d really c care I thought you were just amusing yourself and so did everybody and I wanted Ned Madison Violet had turned very pale I love him she said hoarsely and you ve sent him away He s gone to Rainy River I shall never see him again Oh yes you will gasped missus Hill faintly He ll come back when he knows you c can write and tell him Do you suppose I am going to write and ask him to come back said Violet wildly I ve enough pride left yet to keep me from doing that for a man at whose head I ve thrown myself openly yes openly and who has never in words at least told me he cared anything about me I will never forgive you Edith Then missus Hill found herself alone with her lacerated feelings After soothing them with a good cry she set to work thinking seriously There was no doubt she had muddled things badly but there was no use leaving them in a muddle when a word or two fitly spoken might set them straight missus Hill sat down and wrote a very diplomatic letter before she went to bed and the next morning she waylaid Sergeant Fox and asked him if he would ride down to Rainy River with a very important message for mister Spencer Sergeant Fox wondered what it could be but it was not his to reason why it was his only to mount and ride with all due speed for missus Hill s whims and wishes were as stringent and binding as the rules of the force That evening when missus Hill and Violet the latter very silent and regal were sitting on the verandah a horseman came galloping up the Rainy River trail missus Hill excused herself and went in Five minutes later John Spencer covered with the alkali dust of his twenty miles ride dismounted at Violet s side The M P s gave a concert at the barracks that night and missus Hill and her Major went to it as well as everyone else of any importance in town except Violet and Spencer They sat on Major Hill s verandah and watched the moon rising over the bluffs and making milk white reflections in the prairie lakes It seems a year of misery since last night sighed Violet happily You couldn t have been quite as miserable as I was said Spencer earnestly You were everything absolutely everything to me Other men have little rills and driblets of affection for sisters and cousins and aunts but everything in me went out to you Do you remember you told me the first time we met that love would be a revelation to me It has been more It has been a new gospel I hardly dared hope you could care for me Even yet I don t know why you do I love you said Violet gravely because you are you Than which of course there could be no better reason The Waking of Helen Robert Reeves looked somewhat curiously at the girl who was waiting on him at his solitary breakfast He had not seen her before arriving at his summer boarding house only the preceding night It was a shabby farmhouse on the inland shore of a large bay that was noted for its tides and had wonderful possibilities of light and shade for an impressionist Reeves was an enthusiastic artist It mattered little to him that the boarding accommodations were most primitive the people uncultured and dull the place itself utterly isolated as long as he could revel in those transcendent sunsets and sunrises those marvellous moonlights those wonderful purple shores and sweeps of shimmering blue water The owner of the farm was Angus Fraser and he and his wife seemed to be a reserved uncouth pair with no apparent interest in life save to scratch a bare living out of their few stony acres He had an impression that they were childless and was at a loss to place this girl who poured his tea and brought in his toast She did not resemble either Fraser or his wife She was certainly not beautiful being very tall and rather awkward and dressed in a particularly unbecoming dark print wrapper Her luxuriant hair was thick and black and was coiled in a heavy knot at the nape of her neck Her features were delicate but irregular and her skin was very brown Her eyes attracted Reeves s notice especially they were large and dark and full of a half unconscious wistful longing as if a prisoned soul behind them were vainly trying to reveal itself Reeves could find out nothing of her from herself for she responded to his tentative questions about the place in the briefest fashion Afterwards he interviewed missus Fraser cautiously and ascertained that the girl s name was Helen Fraser and that she was Angus s niece Her father and mother are dead and we ve brought her up Helen s a good girl in most ways a little obstinate and sulky now and then but generally she s steady enough and as for work there ain t a girl in Bay Beach can come up to her in house or field Angus calculates she saves him a man s wages clear No I ain t got nothing to say against Helen Nevertheless Reeves felt somehow that missus Fraser did not like her husband s niece He often heard her scolding or nagging Helen at her work and noticed that the latter never answered back But once after missus Angus s tongue had been especially bitter he met the girl hurrying along the hall from the kitchen with her eyes full of tears Reeves felt as if someone had struck him a blow He went to Angus and his wife that afternoon He wished to paint a shore picture he said and wanted a model Would they allow Miss Fraser to pose for him He would pay liberally for her time Angus and his wife had no objection They would pocket the money and Helen could be spared a spell every day as well as not Reeves told Helen of his plan himself meeting her in the evening as she was bringing the cows home from the low shore pastures beyond the marsh He was surprised at the sudden illumination of her face It almost transfigured her from a plain sulky looking girl into a beautiful woman But the glow passed quickly She assented to his plan quietly almost lifelessly He walked home with her behind the cows and talked of the sunset and the mysterious beauty of the bay and the purple splendour of the distant coasts She listened in silence Only once when he spoke of the distant murmur of the open sea she lifted her head and looked at him What does it say to you she asked It speaks of eternity And to you It calls me she answered simply and then I want to go out and meet it and it hurts me too I can t tell how or why Sometimes it makes me feel as if I were asleep and wanted to wake and didn t know how She turned and looked out over the bay A dying gleam of sunset broke through a cloud and fell across her hair For a moment she seemed the spirit of the shore personified all its mystery all its uncertainty all its elusive charm She has possibilities thought Reeves Next day he began his picture At first he had thought of painting her as the incarnation of a sea spirit but decided that her moods were too fitful So he began to sketch her as Waiting a woman looking out across the bay with a world of hopeless longing in her eyes The subject suited her well and the picture grew apace When he was tired of work he made her walk around the shore with him or row up the head of the bay in her own boat He tried to draw her out at first with indifferent success She seemed to be frightened of him He talked to her of many things the far outer world whose echoes never reached her foreign lands where he had travelled famous men and women whom he had met music art and books When he spoke of books he touched the right chord One of those transfiguring flashes he delighted to evoke now passed over her plain face That is what I ve always wanted she said hungrily and I never get them Aunt hates to see me reading She says it is a waste of time And I love it so I read every scrap of paper I can get hold of but I hardly ever see a book The next day Reeves took his Tennyson to the shore and began to read the Idylls of the King to her It is beautiful was her sole verbal comment but her rapt eyes said everything After that he never went out with her without a book now one of the poets now some prose classic He was surprised by her quick appreciation of and sympathy with the finest passages Gradually too she forgot her shyness and began to talk She knew nothing of his world but her own world she knew and knew well She was a mine of traditional history about the bay She knew the rocky coast by heart and every old legend that clung to it They drifted into making excursions along the shore and explored its wildest retreats The girl had an artist s eye for scenery and colour effect You should have been an artist Reeves told her one day when she had pointed out to him the exquisite loveliness of a shaft of light falling through a cleft in the rocks across a dark green pool at their base I would rather be a writer she said slowly if I could only write something like those books you have read to me What a glorious destiny it must be to have something to say that the whole world is listening for and to be able to say it in words that will live forever It must be the noblest human lot Yet some of those men and women were neither good nor noble said Reeves gently and many of them were unhappy Helen dismissed the subject as abruptly as she always did when the conversation touched too nearly on the sensitive edge of her soul dreams Do you know where I am taking you today she said No where To what the people here call the Kelpy s Cave I hate to go there I believe there is something uncanny about it but I think you will like to see it It is a dark little cave in the curve of a small cove and on each side the headlands of rock run far out At low tide we can walk right around but when the tide comes in it fills the Kelpy s Cave If you were there and let the tide come past the points you would be drowned unless you could swim for the rocks are so steep and high it is impossible to climb them Reeves was interested Was anyone ever caught by the tide Yes returned Helen with a shudder Once long ago before I was born a girl went around the shore to the cave and fell asleep there and the tide came in and she was drowned She was young and very pretty and was to have been married the next week I ve been afraid of the place ever since The treacherous cave proved to be a picturesque and innocent looking spot with the beach of glittering sand before it and the high gloomy walls of rock on either hand I must come here some day and sketch it said Reeves enthusiastically and you must be the Kelpy Helen and sit in the cave with your hair wrapped about you and seaweed clinging to it Do you think a kelpy would look like that said the girl dreamily I don t I think it is a wild wicked little sea imp malicious and mocking and cruel and it sits here and watches for victims Well never mind your sea kelpies Reeves said fishing out his Longfellow They are a tricky folk if all tales be true and it is supposed to be a very rash thing to talk about them in their own haunts I want to read you The Building of the Ship You will like it I m sure When the tide turned they went home We haven t seen the kelpy after all said Reeves I think I shall see him some day said Helen gravely I think he is waiting for me there in that gloomy cave of his and some time or other he will get me Reeves smiled at the gloomy fancy and Helen smiled back at him with one of her sudden radiances The tide was creeping swiftly up over the white sands The sun was low and the bay was swimming in a pale blue glory They parted at Clam Point Helen to go for the cows and Reeves to wander on up the shore He thought of Helen at first and the wonderful change that had come over her of late then he began to think of another face a marvellously lovely one with blue eyes as tender as the waters before him Then Helen was forgotten The summer waned swiftly One afternoon Reeves took a fancy to revisit the Kelpy s Cave Helen could not go It was harvest time and she was needed in the field Don t let the kelpy catch you she said to him half seriously The tide will turn early this afternoon and you are given to day dreaming I ll be careful he promised laughingly and he meant to be careful But somehow when he reached the cave its unwholesome charm overcame him and he sat down on the boulder at its mouth An hour yet before tide time he said Just enough time to read that article on impressionists in my review and then stroll home by the sandshore From reading he passed to day dreaming and day dreaming drifted into sleep with his head pillowed on the rocky walls of the cave How long he had slept he did not know but he woke with a start of horror He sprang to his feet realizing his position instantly The tide was in far in past the headlands already Above and beyond him towered the pitiless unscalable rocks There was no way of escape Reeves was no coward but life was sweet to him and to die like that like a drowned rat in a hole to be able to do nothing but wait for that swift and sure oncoming death He reeled against the damp rock wall and for a moment sea and sky and prisoning headlands and white lined tide whirled before his eyes Then his head grew clearer He tried to think How long had he Not more than twenty minutes at the outside Well death was sure and he would meet it bravely But to wait to wait helplessly He should go mad with the horror of it before those endless minutes would have passed He took something from his pocket and bent his head over it pressing his lips to it repeatedly And then when he raised his face again a dory was coming around the headland on his right and Helen Fraser was in it Reeves was dizzy again with the shock of joy and thankfulness He ran down over the little stretch of sand still uncovered by the tide and around to the rocks of the headlands against which the dory was already grating He sprang forward impulsively and caught the girl s cold hands in his as she dropped the oars and stood up Helen you have saved me How can I ever thank you I He broke off abruptly for she was looking up at him breathlessly and voicelessly with her whole soul in her eyes He saw in them a revelation that amazed him he dropped her hands and stepped back as if she had struck him in the face Helen did not notice the change in him She clasped her hands together and her voice trembled Oh I was afraid I should be too late When I came in from the field Aunt Hannah said you had not come back and I knew it was tide time and I felt somehow that it had caught you in the cave I ran down over the marsh and took Joe Simmon s dory If I had not got here in time She broke off shiveringly Reeves stepped into the dory and took up the oars The kelpy would have been sure of its victim then he said trying to speak lightly It would have almost served me right for neglecting your warning I was very careless You must let me row back I am afraid you have overtasked your strength trying to cheat the kelpy Reeves rowed homeward in an absolute silence Helen did not speak and he could not When they reached the dory anchorage he helped her out I think I ll go out to the Point for a walk he said I want to steady my nerves You must go right home and rest Don t be anxious I won t take any more chances with sea kelpies Helen went away without a word and Reeves walked slowly out to the Point He was grieved beyond measure at the discovery he believed he had made He had never dreamed of such a thing He was not a vain man and was utterly free from all tendency to flirtation It had never occurred to him that the waking of the girl s deep nature might be attended with disastrous consequences He had honestly meant to help her and what had he done He felt very uncomfortable he could not conscientiously blame himself but he saw that he had acted foolishly And of course he must go away at once And he must also tell her something she ought to know He wished he had told her long ago The following afternoon was a perfect one Reeves was sketching on the sandshore when Helen came She sat down on a camp stool a little to one side and did not speak After a few moments Reeves pushed away his paraphernalia impatiently I don t feel in a mood for work he said It is too dreamy a day one ought to do nothing to be in keeping Besides I m getting lazy now that my vacation is nearly over I must go in a few days He avoided looking at her so he did not see the sudden pallor of her face So soon she said in a voice expressive of no particular feeling Yes I ought not to have lingered so long My world will be forgetting me and that will not do It has been a very pleasant summer and I shall be sorry to leave Bay Beach But you will come back next summer asked Helen quickly You said you would Reeves nerved himself for his very distasteful task Perhaps he said with an attempt at carelessness but if I do so I shall not come alone Somebody who is very dear to me will come with me as my wife I have never told you about her Helen but you and I are such good friends that I do not mind doing so now I am engaged to a very sweet girl and we expect to be married next spring There was a brief silence Reeves had been vaguely afraid of a scene and was immensely relieved to find his fear unrealized Helen sat very still He could not see her face Did she care after all Was he mistaken When she spoke her voice was perfectly calm Thank you it is very kind of you to tell me about her I suppose she is very beautiful Yes here is her picture You can judge for yourself Helen took the portrait from his hand and looked at it steadily It was a miniature painted on ivory and the face looking out from it was certainly lovely It is no wonder you love her said the girl in a low tone as she handed it back It must be strange to be so beautiful as that Reeves picked up his Tennyson Shall I read you something What will you have Read Elaine please I want to hear that once more Reeves felt a sudden dislike to her choice Wouldn t you prefer something else he asked hurriedly turning over the leaves Elaine is rather sad Shan t I read Guinevere instead No said Helen in the same lifeless tone I have no sympathy for Guinevere She suffered and her love was unlawful but she was loved in return she did not waste her love on someone who did not want or care for it Elaine did and her life went with it Read me the story Reeves obeyed When he had finished he held the book out to her Helen will you take this Tennyson from me in remembrance of our friendship and of the Kelpy s Cave I shall never forget that I owe my life to you Thank you She took the book and placed a little thread of crimson seaweed that had been caught in the sand between the pages of Elaine Then she rose I must go back now Aunt will need me Thank you again for the book mister Reeves and for all your kindness to me Reeves was relieved when the interview was over Her calmness had reassured him She did not care very much after all it was only a passing fancy and when he was gone she would soon forget him He went away a few days later and Helen bade him an impassive good bye When the afternoon was far spent she stole away from the house to the shore with her Tennyson in her hand and took her way to the Kelpy s Cave The tide was just beginning to come in She sat down on the big boulder where Reeves had fallen asleep Beyond stretched the gleaming blue waters mellowing into a hundred fairy shades horizonward The shadows of the rocks were around her In front was the white line of the incoming tide it had almost reached the headlands A few minutes more and escape would be cut off yet she did not move When the dark green water reached her and the lapping wavelets swished up over the hem of her dress she lifted her head and a sudden strange smile flashed over her face Perhaps the kelpy understood it 
5044-30602-0000	train-other-500	The Way of the Winning of Anne Jerome Irving had been courting Anne Stockard for fifteen years He had begun when she was twenty and he was twenty five and now that Jerome was forty and Anne in a village where everybody knew everybody else s age had to own to being thirty five
5044-30602-0001	train-other-500	the courtship did not seem any nearer a climax than it had at the beginning But that was not Jerome s fault poor fellow At the end of the first year he had asked Anne to marry him and Anne had refused Jerome was disappointed
5044-30602-0002	train-other-500	but he kept his head and went on courting Anne just the same that is he went over to Esek Stockard s house every Saturday night and spent the evening he walked home with Anne from prayer meeting and singing school and parties when she would let him
5044-30602-0003	train-other-500	and asked her to go to all the concerts and socials and quilting frolics that came off Anne never would go of course but Jerome faithfully gave her the chance Old Esek rather favoured Jerome s suit for Anne was the plainest of his many daughters
none	none	 and no other fellow seemed at all anxious to run Jerome off the track 
5044-30602-0004	train-other-500	but she took her own way with true Stockard firmness and matters were allowed to drift on at the will of time or chance Three years later Jerome tried his luck again with precisely the same result and after that he had asked Anne regularly once a year to marry him
5044-30602-0005	train-other-500	and just as regularly Anne said no a little more brusquely and a little more decidedly every year Now in the mellowness of a fifteen year old courtship Jerome did not mind it at all He knew that everything comes to the man who has patience to wait
5044-30602-0006	train-other-500	Time of course had not stood still with Anne and Jerome or with the history of Deep Meadows At the Stockard homestead the changes had been many and marked
5044-30602-0007	train-other-500	Every year or two there had been a wedding in the big brick farmhouse and one of old Esek s girls had been the bride each time Julia and Grace and Celia and Betty and Theodosia and Clementina Stockard were all married and gone But Anne had never had another lover
5044-30602-0008	train-other-500	There had to be an old maid in every big family she said and she was not going to marry Jerome Irving just for the sake of having missus on her tombstone Old Esek and his wife had been put away in the Deep Meadows burying ground The broad fertile Stockard acres passed into Anne s possession
5044-30602-0009	train-other-500	She was a good business woman and the farm continued to be the best in the district She kept two hired men and a servant girl and the sixteen year old of her oldest sister lived with her
none	none	 There were few visitors at the Stockard place now 
5044-30602-0010	train-other-500	but Jerome dropped in every Saturday night with clockwork regularity and talked to Anne about her stock and advised her regarding the rotation of her crops and the setting out of her orchards And at ten o clock he would take his hat and cane and tell Anne to be good to herself and go home
none	none	 Anne had long since given up trying to discourage him she even accepted attentions from him now that she had used to refuse 
5044-30602-0011	train-other-500	He always walked home with her from evening meetings and was her partner in the games at quilting parties It was great fun for the young folks Old Jerome and Anne were a standing joke in Deep Meadows
none	none	 But the older people had ceased to expect anything to come of it 
5044-30602-0012	train-other-500	Anne laughed at Jerome as she had always done and would not have owned for the world that she could have missed him Jerome was useful she admitted and a comfortable friend
none	none	 and she would have liked him well enough 
5044-30602-0013	train-other-500	if he would only omit that ridiculous yearly ceremony of proposal It was Jerome s fortieth birthday when Anne refused him again He realized this as he went down the road in the moonlight and doubt and dismay began to creep into his heart Anne and he were both getting old
5044-30602-0014	train-other-500	there was no disputing that fact It was high time that he brought her to terms if he was ever going to Jerome was an easy going mortal and always took things placidly but he did not mean to have all those fifteen years of patient courting go for nothing
5044-30602-0015	train-other-500	He had thought Anne would get tired of saying no sooner or later and say yes if for no other reason than to have a change but getting tired did not seem to run in the Stockard blood She had said no that night just as coolly and decidedly and unsentimentally as she said it fifteen years before
none	none	 Jerome had the sensation of going around in a circle and never getting any further on 
5044-30602-0016	train-other-500	He made up his mind that something must be done and just as he got to the brook that divides Deep Meadows West from Deep Meadows Central an idea struck him it was a good idea and amused him He laughed aloud and slapped his thigh
none	none	 much to the amusement of two boys who were sitting unnoticed on the railing of the bridge 
5044-30602-0017	train-other-500	There s old Jerome going home from seeing Anne Stockard said one Wonder what on earth he s laughing at Seems to me if I couldn t get a wife without hoeing a fifteen year row I d give up trying
5044-30602-0018	train-other-500	But then the speaker was a Hamilton and the Hamiltons never had any perseverance Jerome although a well to do man owning a good farm had so to speak no home of his own The old Irving homestead belonged to his older brother
5044-30602-0019	train-other-500	who had a wife and family Jerome lived with them and was so used to it he didn t mind At forty a lover must not waste time Jerome thought out the details that night and next day he opened the campaign
5044-30602-0020	train-other-500	But it was not until the evening after that that Anne Stockard heard the news It was her niece Octavia who told her
none	none	 The latter had been having a chat up the lane with Sam Mitchell and came in with a broad smile on her round rosy face and a twinkle in her eyes 
5044-30602-0021	train-other-500	I guess you ve lost your beau this time Aunt Anne
none	none	 It looks as if he meant to take you at your word at last 
5044-30602-0022	train-other-500	What on earth do you mean asked Anne a little sharply She was in the pantry counting eggs and Octavia s interruption made her lose her count
none	none	 Now I can t remember whether it was six or seven dozen I said last 
5044-30602-0023	train-other-500	I shall have to count them all over again I wish Octavia that you could think of something besides beaus all the time Well but listen persisted Octavia wickedly Jerome Irving was at the social
5044-30602-0024	train-other-500	at the Cherry Valley parsonage last night and he had Harriet Warren there took her there and drove her home again I don t believe it cried Anne before she thought She dropped an egg into the basket so abruptly that the shell broke Oh it s true enough
5044-30602-0025	train-other-500	Sam Mitchell told me he was there and saw him Sam says he looked quite beaming and was dressed to kill and followed Harriet around like her shadow I guess you won t have any more bother with him Aunt Anne In the process of picking the broken egg out of the whole ones Anne had recovered
5044-30602-0026	train-other-500	her equanimity She gave a careful little laugh Well it s to be hoped so Goodness knows it s time he tried somebody else Go and change your dress for milking Octavia and don t spend quite so much time gossiping up the lane with Sam Mitchell He always was a fetch and carry
5044-30602-0027	train-other-500	Young girls oughtn t to be so pert When the subdued Octavia had gone Anne tossed the broken eggshell out of the pantry window viciously enough There s no fool like an old fool Jerome Irving always was an idiot
none	none	 The idea of his going after Harriet Warren 
5044-30602-0028	train-other-500	He s old enough to be her father And a Warren too I ve seen the time an Irving wouldn t be seen on the same side of the road with a Warren Well anyhow I don t care and he needn t suppose I will
none	none	 It will be a relief not to have him hanging around any longer 
5044-30602-0029	train-other-500	It might have been a relief
none	none	 but Anne felt strangely lonely as she walked home alone from prayer meeting the next night 
5044-30602-0030	train-other-500	Jerome had not been there The Warrens were Methodists and Anne rightly guessed that he had gone to the Methodist prayer meeting at Cherry Valley Dancing attendance on Harriet she said to herself scornfully When she got home she looked at her face in the glass more critically than she had done for years
5044-30602-0031	train-other-500	Anne Stockard at her best had never been pretty When young she had been called gawky She was very tall and her figure was lank and angular She had a long pale face and dusky hair Her eyes had been good a glimmering hazel large and long lashed
5044-30602-0032	train-other-500	They were pretty yet but the crow s feet about them were plainly visible There were brackets around her mouth too and her cheeks were hollow Anne suddenly realized as she had never realized before that she had grown old that her youth was left far behind
5044-30602-0033	train-other-500	She was an old maid and Harriet Warren was young and pretty Anne s long thin lips suddenly quivered I declare I m a worse fool than Jerome she said angrily When Saturday night came Jerome did not
5044-30602-0034	train-other-500	The corner of the big old fashioned porch where he usually sat looked bare and lonely Anne was short with Octavia and boxed the cat s ears and raged at herself What did she care if Jerome Irving never came again
none	none	 She could have married him years ago if she had wanted to 
5044-30602-0035	train-other-500	everybody knew that At sunset she saw a buggy drive past her gate Even at that distance she recognized Harriet Warren s handsome high coloured profile It was Jerome s new buggy and Jerome was driving
5044-30602-0036	train-other-500	The wheel spokes flashed in the sunlight as they crept up the hill Perhaps they dazzled Anne s eyes a little at least for that or some other reason she dabbed her hand viciously over them as she turned sharply about and went upstairs
5044-30602-0037	train-other-500	Octavia was practising her music lesson in the parlour below and singing in a sweet shrill voice The hired men were laughing and talking in the yard Anne slammed down her window and banged her door and then lay down on her bed
5044-30602-0038	train-other-500	she said her head ached The Deep Meadows people were amused and made joking remarks to Anne which she had to take amiably because she had no excuse for resenting them In reality they stung her pride unendurably
5044-30602-0039	train-other-500	When Jerome had gone she realized that she had no other intimate friend and that she was a very lonely woman whom nobody cared about One night it was three weeks afterward she met Jerome and Harriet squarely
5044-30602-0040	train-other-500	She was walking to church with Octavia and they were driving in the opposite direction Jerome had his new buggy and crimson lap robe His horse s coat shone like satin and had rosettes of crimson on his bridle Jerome was dressed extremely well
5044-30602-0041	train-other-500	and looked quite young with his round ruddy clean shaven face and clear blue eyes Harriet was sitting primly and consciously by his side she was a very handsome girl with bold eyes and was somewhat overdressed She wore a big flowery hat
5044-30602-0042	train-other-500	and a white lace veil and looked at Anne with a supercilious smile Anne felt dowdy and old she was very pale Jerome lifted his hat and bowed pleasantly as they drove past Suddenly Harriet laughed out
5044-30602-0043	train-other-500	Anne did not look back but her face crimsoned darkly Was that girl laughing at her She trembled with anger and a sharp hurt feeling When she got home that night she sat a long while by her window Jerome was gone
5044-30602-0044	train-other-500	and he let Harriet Warren laugh at her and he would never come back to her Well it did not matter but she had been a fool Only it had never occurred to her that Jerome could act so
none	none	 If I d thought he would I mightn t have been so sharp with him was as far as she would let herself go even in thought 
5044-30602-0045	train-other-500	When four weeks had elapsed Jerome came over one Saturday night He was fluttered and anxious but hid it in a masterly manner Anne was taken by surprise
none	none	 She had not thought he would ever come again and was off her guard He had come around the porch corner abruptly as she stood there in the dusk 
5044-30602-0046	train-other-500	and she started very perceptibly Good evening Anne he said easily and unblushingly Anne choked up She was very angry or thought she was Jerome appeared not to notice her lack of welcome He sat coolly down in his old place
5044-30602-0047	train-other-500	His heart was beating like a hammer but Anne did not know that I suppose she said cuttingly that you re on your way down to the bridge It s almost a pity for you to waste time stopping here at all any more than you have of late No doubt Harriet ll be expecting you
5044-30602-0048	train-other-500	A gleam of satisfaction flashed over Jerome s face He looked shrewdly at Anne who was not looking at him but was staring uncompromisingly out over the poppy beds A jealous woman always gives herself away If Anne had been indifferent
5044-30602-0049	train-other-500	she would not have given him that slap in the face I dunno s she will he replied coolly I didn t say for sure whether I d be down tonight or not It s so long since I had a chat with you I thought I d drop in for a spell But of course if I m not wanted I can go where I will be
5044-30602-0050	train-other-500	Anne could not get back her self control
none	none	 Her nerves were all strung up as she would have said 
5044-30602-0051	train-other-500	She had a feeling that she was right on the brink of a scene but she could not help herself I guess it doesn t matter much what I want she said stonily At any rate it hasn t seemed that way lately You don t care of course Oh no Harriet Warren is all you care about Well I wish you joy of her
5044-30602-0052	train-other-500	Jerome looked puzzled or pretended to In reality he was hugging himself with delight I don t just understand you Anne he said hesitatingly You appear to be vexed about something I Oh no I m not mister Irving
5044-30602-0053	train-other-500	Of course old friends don t count now Well I ve no doubt new ones will wear just as well If it s about my going to see Harriet said Jerome easily I don t see as how it can matter much to you Goodness knows you took enough pains to show me you didn t want me
5044-30602-0054	train-other-500	I don t blame you A woman has a right to please herself and a man ought to have sense to take his answer and go I hadn t and that s where I made my mistake I don t mean to pester you any more but we can be real good friends can t we
none	none	 I m sure I m as much your friend as ever I was 
5044-30602-0055	train-other-500	Now I hold that this speech of Jerome s delivered in a cool matter of fact tone as of a man stating a case with dispassionate fairness was a masterpiece It was the last cleverly executed movement of the campaign
5044-30602-0056	train-other-500	If it failed to effect a capitulation he was a defeated man But it did not fail Anne had got to that point where an excited woman must go mad or cry Anne cried She sat flatly down on a chair and burst into tears
5044-30602-0057	train-other-500	Jerome s hat went one way and his cane another
none	none	 Jerome himself sprang across the intervening space and dropped into the chair beside Anne 
5044-30602-0058	train-other-500	He caught her hand in his and threw his arm boldly around her waist Goodness gracious Anne Do you care after all Tell me that
none	none	 I don t suppose it matters to you if I do sobbed Anne It hasn t seemed to matter anyhow 
5044-30602-0059	train-other-500	Anne look here Didn t I come after you for fifteen years
none	none	 It s you I always have wanted and want yet if I can get you 
5044-30602-0060	train-other-500	I don t care a rap for Harriet Warren or anyone but you Now that s the truth right out Anne No doubt it was and Anne was convinced of it
none	none	 But she had to have her cry out 
5044-30602-0061	train-other-500	on Jerome s shoulder and it soothed her nerves wonderfully Later on Octavia slipping noiselessly up the steps in the dusk saw a sight that transfixed her with astonishment When she recovered herself she turned and fled wildly around the house
5044-30602-0062	train-other-500	running bump into Sam Mitchell who was coming across the yard from a twilight conference with the hired men Goodness Tavy what s the matter
none	none	 Y look sif y d seen a ghost 
5044-30602-0063	train-other-500	Octavia leaned up against the wall in spasms of mirth Oh Sam she gasped old Jerome Irving and Aunt Anne are sitting round there in the dark on the front porch and he had his arms around her kissing her And they never saw nor heard me no more n if they were deaf and blind
5044-30602-0064	train-other-500	Sam gave a tremendous whistle and then went off into a shout of laughter whose echoes reached even to the gloom of the front porch and the ears of the lovers But they did not know he was laughing at them and would not have cared if they had They were too happy for that There was a wedding that fall
5044-30602-0065	train-other-500	and Anne Stockard was the bride When she was safely his Jerome confessed all and was graciously forgiven But it was kind of mean to Harriet said Anne rebukingly to go with her and get her talked about and then drop her as you did Don t you think so yourself Jerome
5044-30602-0066	train-other-500	Her husband s eyes twinkled Well hardly that You see Harriet s engaged to that Johnson fellow out west Tain t generally known but I knew it and that s why I picked on her I thought it probable that she d be willing enough to flirt with me for a little diversion
5044-30602-0067	train-other-500	even if I was old Harriet s that sort of a girl And I made up my mind that if that didn t fetch it nothing would and I d give up for good and all But it did didn t it Anne I should say so It was horrid of you Jerome
none	none	 but I daresay it s just as well you did or I d likely never have found out that I couldn t get along without you I did feel dreadful Poor Octavia could tell you I was as cross as X 
5044-30602-0068	train-other-500	How did you come to think of it Jerome A fellow had to do something said Jerome oracularly
none	none	 and I d have done most anything to get you Anne that s a fact And there it was courting fifteen years and nothing to show for it I dunno though how I did come to think of it Guess it was a sort of inspiration Anyhow I ve got you and that s what I set out to do in the beginning Young Si mister Bentley had just driven into the yard with the new summer boarder missus Bentley and Agnes were peeping at her from behind the parlour curtains with the keen interest that they shut in by their restricted farm life always felt in any visitor from the outside world lying beyond their boundary of purple misted hills missus Bentley was a plump rosy cheeked woman with a motherly smile Agnes was a fair slim schoolgirl as tall as her mother with a sweet face and a promise of peach blossom prettiness in the years to come The arrival of a summer boarder was a great event in her quiet life Ain t she pretty whispered missus Bentley admiringly as the girl came slowly up the green slope before the house I do hope she s nice You can generally calculate on men boarders but girls are doubtful Preserve me from a cranky boarder I ve had enough of them I kinder like her looks though Ethel Lennox had paused at the front door as missus Bentley and Agnes came into the hall Agnes gazed at the stranger with shy unenvious admiration the latter stood on the stone step just where the big chestnut by the door cast flickering gleams and shadows over her dress and shining hair She was tall and gowned in some simple white material that fell about her in graceful folds She wore a cluster of pale pink roses at her belt and a big picturesque white hat shaded her face and the glossy clinging masses of her red hair hair that was neither auburn nor chestnut but simply red Nor would anyone have wished it otherwise having once seen that glorious mass with all its wonderful possibilities of rippling luxuriance Her complexion was of that perfect waxen whiteness that goes with burnished red hair and the darkest of dilated violet eyes Her delicately chiselled features wore what might have been a somewhat too decided impress of spirit and independence had it not been for the sweet mouth red and dimpled and curving that parted in a slow charming smile as missus Bentley came forward with her kindly welcome You must be real tired Miss Lennox It s a long drive from the train down here Agnes show Miss Lennox up to her room and tea will be ready when you come down Agnes came forward with the shy grace that always won friends for her and the two girls went slowly up the broad old fashioned staircase while missus Bentley bustled away to bring in the tea and put a goblet of damask roses on the table She looks like a picture doesn t she John she said to her husband I never saw such a face and that hair too Would you have believed red hair could be so handsome She seems real friendly none of your stuck up fine ladies I ve had all I want of them I can tell you Sh sh sh said mister Bentley warningly as Ethel Lennox came in with her arm about Agnes She looked even more lovely without her hat with the soft red tendrils of hair lying on her forehead missus Bentley sent a telegraphic message of admiration across the table to her husband who was helping the cold tongue and feeling his way to a conversation You ll find it pretty quiet here Miss Lennox We re plain folks and there ain t much going and coming Maybe you don t mind that though I like it When one has been teaching school all the year in a noisy city quiet seems the one thing to be desired Besides I like to fancy myself something of an artist I paint and sketch a little when I have time and Miss Courtland who was here last summer said I could not find a more suitable spot So I came because I knew that mackerel fishing was carried on along the shore and I would have a chance to study character among the fishermen Well the shore ain t far away and it s pretty though maybe us folks here don t appreciate it rightly being as we re so used to it Strangers are always going crazy over its picturesqueness as they call it As for character I reckon you ll find all you want of that among the Pointers anyway I never seed such critters as they be When you get tired of painting maybe you can amuse yourself trying to get to the bottom of our mystery Oh have you a mystery How interesting Yes a mystery a mystery repeated mister Bentley solemnly that nobody hain t been able to solve so far I ve give it up so has everyone else Maybe you ll have better luck But what is it The mystery said mister Bentley dramatically is Young Si He s the mystery Last spring just when the herring struck in a young chap suddenly appeared at the Point He appeared from what corner of the globe nobody hain t ever been able to make out He bought a boat and a shanty down at my shore and went into a sort of mackerel partnership with Snuffy Curtis Snuffy supplying the experience and this young fellow the cash I reckon Snuffy s as poor as Job s turkey it was a windfall for him And there he s fished all summer But his name Young Si Well of course that isn t it He did give himself out as Brown but nobody believes that s his handle sounds unnatteral here He bought his establishment from old Si who used to fish down there and was a mysterious old critter in a way too So when this young fellow stepped in from goodness knows where some of the Pointers christened him Young Si for a joke and he never gets anything else Doesn t seem to mind it He s a moody keep to himself sort of chap Yet he ain t unpopular along shore I believe Snuffy was telling me they like him real well considering his unsociableness Anyways he s as handsome a chap as I ever seed and well eddicated too He ain t none of your ordinary fishermen Some of us kind of think he s a runaway got into some scrape or another maybe and is skulking around here to keep out of jail But wife here won t give in to that No I never will said missus Bentley firmly Young Si comes here often for milk and butter and he s a perfect gentleman Nobody ll ever convince me that he has done anything to be ashamed of whatever s his reason for wasting his life down there at that shore He ain t wasting his life chuckled mister Bentley He s making money Young Si is though he don t seem to care about that a mite This has been a big year for mackerel and he s smart If he didn t know much when he begun he s ahead of Snuffy now And as for work I never saw his beat He seems possessed Up afore sunrise every blessed morning and never in bed till midnight and just slaving away all between time I said to him t other day says I Young Si you ll have to let up on this sort of thing and take a rest You can t stand it You re not a Pointer Pointers can stand anything but it ll kill you He give one of them bitter laughs of his Says he It s no difference if it does Nobody ll care and off he walks sulky like There s something about Young Si I can t understand concluded mister Bentley Ethel Lennox was interested A melancholy mysterious hero in a setting of silver rimmed sand hills and wide blue sweeps of ocean was something that ought to lend piquancy to her vacation I should like to see this prince in disguise she said It all sounds very romantic I ll take you to the shore after tea if you d like said Agnes eagerly Si s just splendid she continued in a confidential aside as they rose from the table Pa doesn t half like him because he thinks there s something queer about him But I do He s a gentleman as Ma says I don t believe he s done anything wrong Ethel Lennox sauntered out into the orchard to wait for Agnes She sat down under an apple tree and began to read but soon the book slipped from her hands and the beautiful head leaned back against the grey lichened trunk of the old tree The sweet mouth drooped wistfully There was a sad far away look in the violet eyes The face was not that of a happy girl so thought Agnes as she came down the apple tree avenue But how pretty she is she thought Won t the folks around here stare at her They always do at our boarders but we ve never had one like her Ethel sprang up I had no idea you would be here so soon she said brightly Just wait till I get my hat When she came out they started off and presently found themselves walking down a grassy deep rutted lane that ran through mown hay fields green with their rich aftergrowth and sheets of pale ripening oats and golden green wheat until it lost itself in the rolling sand hills at the foot of the slope Beyond the sand hills stretched the shining expanse of the ocean of the faint bleached blue of hot August seas and reaching out into a horizon laced with long trails of pinkish cloud Numberless fishing boats dotted the shimmering reaches That furthest off boat is Young Si s said Agnes He always goes to that particular spot Is he really all your father says asked Miss Lennox curiously Indeed he is He isn t any more like the rest of the shore men than you are He s queer of course I don t believe he s happy It seems to me he s worrying over something but I m sure it is nothing wrong Here we are she added as they passed the sand hills and came out on the long level beach To their left the shore curved around in a semi circle of dazzling whiteness at their right stood a small grey fish house That s Young Si s place said Agnes He lives there night and day Wouldn t it make anyone melancholy No wonder he s mysterious I m going to get his spyglass He told me I might always use it She pushed open the door and entered followed by Ethel The interior was rough but clean It was a small room lighted by one tiny window looking out on the water In one corner a rough ladder led up to the loft above The bare lathed walls were hung with fishing jackets nets mackerel lines and other shore appurtenances A little stove bore a kettle and a frying pan A low board table was strewn with dishes and the cold remnants of a hasty repast benches were placed along the walls A fat bewhiskered kitten looking as if it were cut out of black velvet was dozing on the window sill This is Young Si s cat explained Agnes patting the creature which purred joyously and opened its sleepy green eyes It s the only thing he cares for I believe Witch Witch How are you Witch Well here s the spyglass Let s go out and have a look Si s catching mackerel announced Agnes a few minutes later after she had scrutinized each boat in turn and he won t be in for an hour yet If you like we have time for a walk up the shore The sun slipped lower and lower in the creamy sky leaving a trail of sparkles that ran across the water and lost itself in the west Sea gulls soared and dipped and tiny sand peeps flitted along the beach Just as the red rim of the sun dipped in the purpling sea the boats began to come in Most of them will go around to the Point explained Agnes with a contemptuous sweep of her hand towards a long headland running out before them They belong there and they re a rough crowd You don t catch Young Si associating with the Pointers There he s getting up sail We ll just have time to get back before he comes in They hurried back across the dampening sand as the sun disappeared leaving a fiery spot behind him The shore was no longer quiet and deserted The little spot where the fishing house stood had suddenly started into life Roughly clad boys were running hither and thither carrying fish or water The boats were hauled up on the skids A couple of shaggy old tars who had strolled over from the Point to hear about Young Si s catch were smoking their pipes at the corner of his shanty A mellow afterlight was shining over sea and shore The whole scene delighted Ethel s artist eyes Agnes nudged her companion There If you want to see Young Si she whispered pointing to the skids where a busy figure was discernible in a large boat that s him with his back to us in the cream coloured boat He s counting out mackerel If you go over to that platform behind him you ll get a good look when he turns around I m going to coax a mackerel out of that stingy old Snuffy if I can She tripped off and Ethel walked slowly over to the boats The men stared at her in open mouthed admiration as she passed them and walked out on the platform behind Young Si There was no one near the two The others were all assembled around Snuffy s boat Young Si was throwing out the mackerel with marvellous rapidity but at the sound of a footstep behind him he turned and straightened up his tall form They stood face to face Miles Ethel Young Si staggered back against the mast letting two silvery bloaters slip through his hands overboard His handsome sunburned face was very white Ethel Lennox turned abruptly and silently and walked swiftly across the sand Agnes felt her arm touched and turned to see Ethel standing pale and erect beside her Let us go home said the latter unsteadily It is very damp here I feel chilled Oh dear exclaimed Agnes penitently I ought to have told you to bring a shawl It is always damp on the shore after sunset Here Snuffy give me my mackerel Thank you I m ready now Miss Lennox They reached the lane before Agnes remembered to ask the question Ethel dreaded Oh did you see Young Si And what do you think of him Ethel turned her face away and answered with studied carelessness He seems to be quite a superior fisherman so far as I could see in the dim light It was very dusky there you know Let us walk a little faster My shoes are quite wet When they reached home Miss Lennox excused herself on the plea of weariness and went straight to her room Back at the shore Young Si had recovered himself and stooped again to his work His face was set and expressionless A dull red burned in each bronzed cheek He threw out the mackerel mechanically but his hands trembled Snuffy strolled over to the boat See that handsome girl Si he asked lazily One of the Bentleys boarders I hear Looks as if she might have stepped out of a picture frame don t she We ve no time to waste Curtis said Young Si harshly with all these fish to clean before bedtime Stop talking and get to work Snuffy shrugged his shoulders and obeyed in silence Young Si was not a person to be trifled with The catch was large and it was late before they finished Snuffy surveyed the full barrels complacently Good day s work he muttered but hard I m dead beat out Low I ll go to bed In the name o goodness Si whar be you a goin to Young Si had got into a dory and untied it He made no answer but rowed out from the shore Snuffy stared at the dory blankly until it was lost in the gloom Ef that don t beat all he ejaculated I wonder if Si is in his right senses He s been actin quar right along and now to start off Lord knows whar at this hour o night I really don t believe it s safe to stay here alone with him Snuffy shook his unkempt head dubiously Young Si rowed steadily out over the dark waves An eastern breeze was bringing in a damp sea fog that blurred darkly over the outlines of horizon and shore The young fisherman found himself alone in a world of water and grey mist He stopped rowing and leaned forward on his oars To see her here of all places he muttered Not a word scarcely a look after all this long heartbreak Well perhaps it is better so And yet to know she is so near How beautiful she is And I love her more than ever That is where the sting lies I thought that in this rough life amid all these rude associations where nothing could remind me of her I might forget And now He clenched his hands The mist was all around and about him creeping impalpable phantom like The dory rocked gently on the swell From afar came the low persistent murmur of the ocean The next day Ethel Lennox declined to visit Si s shore Instead she went to the Point and sketched all day She went again the next day and the next The Point was the most picturesque part of the shore she averred and the types among its inhabitants most interesting Agnes Bentley ceased to suggest another visit to Si s shore She had a vague perception that her companion did not care to discuss the subject At the end of a week missus Bentley remarked What in the world can have happened to Young Si It s a whole week since he was here for milk or butter He ain t sick is he mister Bentley chuckled amusedly I low I can tell you the reason of that Si s getting his stuff at Walden s now I saw him going there twice this week Liza Walden s got ahead of you at last Mary Well I never did said missus Bentley Well Young Si is the first that ever preferred Liza Walden s butter to mine Everyone knows what hers is like She never works her salt half in Well Young Si s welcome to it I m sure I wish him joy of his exchange missus Bentley rattled her dishes ominously It was plain her faith in Young Si had received a severe shock Upstairs in her room Ethel Lennox with a few undried tears glistening on her cheeks was writing a letter Her lips were compressed and her hand trembled I have discovered that it is no use to run away from fate she wrote No matter how hard we try to elude it and how sure we are that we have succeeded it will rise and meet us where we least expect it I came down here tired and worn out looking for peace and rest and lo the most disquieting element of my life is here to confront me I m going to confess Helen Open confession is good for the soul you know and I shall treat myself to a good dose while the mood is on You know of course that I was once engaged to Miles Lesley You also know that that engagement was broken last autumn for unexplained reasons Well I will tell you all about it and then mail this letter speedily before I change my mind It is over a year now since Miles and I first became engaged As you are aware his family is wealthy and noted for its exclusiveness I was a poor school teacher and you may imagine with what horror his relatives received the news of Miles s attentions to one whom they considered his inferior Now that I have thought the whole matter over calmly I scarcely blame them It must be hard for aristocratic parents who have lavished every care upon a son and cherished for him the highest hopes when he turns from the women of his own order to one considered beneath him in station But I did not view the subject in this light then and instead of declining his attentions as I perhaps should have done I encouraged them I loved him so dearly Nell and in spite of family opposition Miles soon openly declared his attachment When his parents found they could not change his purpose their affection for him forced them into outward acquiescence but their reluctant condescension was gall and wormwood to me I saw things only from my own point of view and was keenly sensitive to their politely concealed disapprobation and my offended vanity found its victim in Miles I belonged to the class who admit and resent slights instead of ignoring them as do the higher bred and I thought he would not see those offered to me I grew cold and formal to him He was very patient but his ways were not mine and my manner puzzled and annoyed him Our relations soon became strained and the trifle necessary for an open quarrel was easily supplied One evening I went to a large At Home given by his mother I knew but few and as Miles was necessarily busy with his social duties to her guests I was after the first hurried greeting left unattended for a time Not being accustomed to such functions I resented this as a covert insult and in a fit of jealous pique I blush to own that I took the revenge of a peasant maid and entered into a marked flirtation with Fred Currie who had paid me some attention before my engagement When Miles was at liberty to seek me he found me to all appearances quite absorbed in my companion and oblivious of his approach He turned on his heel and went away nor did he come near me the rest of the evening I went home angry enough but so miserable and repentant that if Miles had been his usual patient self when he called the following evening I would have begged his forgiveness But I had gone too far his mother was shocked by my gaucherie and he was humiliated and justly exasperated We had a short bitter quarrel I said a great many foolish unpardonable things and finally I threw his ring at him He gave me a startled look then in which there was something of contempt and went away without another word After my anger had passed I was wretchedly unhappy I realized how unworthily I had acted how deeply I loved Miles and how lonely and empty my life would be without him But he did not come back and soon after I learned he had gone away whither no one knew but it was supposed abroad Well I buried my hopes and tears in secret and went on with my life as people have to do a life in which I have learned to think and which I hope has made me nobler and better This summer I came here I heard much about a certain mysterious stranger known as Young Si who was fishing mackerel at this shore I was very curious The story sounded romantic and one evening I went down to see him I met him face to face and Helen it was Miles Lesley For one minute earth sky and sea reeled around me The next I remembered all and turned and walked away He did not follow You may be sure that I now religiously avoid that part of the shore We have never met since and he has made no effort to see me He clearly shows that he despises me Well I despise myself I am very unhappy Nell and not only on my own account for I feel that if Miles had never met me his mother would not now be breaking her heart for her absent boy My sorrow has taught me to understand hers and I no longer resent her pride You need hardly be told after this that I leave here in another week I cannot fabricate a decent excuse to go sooner or I would In the cool twilight Ethel went with Agnes Bentley to mail her letter As they stopped at the door of the little country store a young man came around the corner It was Young Si He was in his rough fishing suit with a big herring net trailing over his shoulder but no disguise could effectually conceal his splendid figure Agnes sprang forward eagerly Si where have you been Why have you never I been up to see us for so long Young Si made no verbal reply He merely lifted his cap with formal politeness and turned on his heel Well I never exclaimed Agnes as soon as she recovered her powers of speech If that is how Young Si is going to treat his friends He must have got offended at something I wonder what it is she added her curiosity getting the better of her indignation When they came out they saw the solitary figure of Young Si far adown crossing the dim lonely shore fields In the dusk Agnes failed to notice the pallor of her companion s face and the unshed tears in her eyes I ve just been down to the Point said Agnes coming in one sultry afternoon about a week later and Little Ev said as there was no fishing today he d take us out for that sail tonight if you wanted to go Ethel Lennox put her drawing away listlessly She looked pale and tired She was going away the next day and this was to be her last visit to the shore About an hour before sunset a boat glided out from the shadow of the Point In it were Ethel Lennox and Agnes together with Little Ev the sandy haired undersized Pointer who owned the boat The evening was fine and an off shore breeze was freshening up rapidly They did not notice the long dark bank of livid cloud low in the northwest Isn t this glorious exclaimed Ethel Her hat was straining back from her head and the red rings of her hair were blowing about her face Agnes looked about her more anxiously Wiser in matters of sea and shore than her companion there were some indications she did not like Young Si who was standing with Snuffy their skids lowered his spyglass with a start It is Agnes Bentley and and that boarder of theirs he said anxiously and they ve gone out with Little Ev in that wretched leaky tub of his Where are their eyes that they can t see a squall coming up An Little Ev don t know as much about managing a boat as a cat exclaimed Snuffy excitedly Sign em to come back Si shook his head They re too far out I don t know that the squall will amount to very much In a good boat with someone who knew how to manage it they d be all right But with Little Ev He began walking restlessly up and down the narrow platform The boat was now some distance out The breeze had stiffened to a slow strong wind and the dull grey level of the sea was whipped into white caps Agnes bent towards Ethel It s getting too rough I think we d better go back I m afraid we re in for a thunder squall Look at the clouds A long sullen muttering verified her words Little Ev she shouted we want to go in Little Ev thus recalled to things about him looked around in alarm The girls questioned each other with glances of dismay The sky had grown very black and the peals of thunder came louder and more continuously A jagged bolt of lightning hurtled over the horizon Over land and sea was the green malignant light of coming storm Little Ev brought the boat s head abruptly round as a few heavy drops of rain fell Ev the boat is leaking shrieked Agnes above the wind The water s coming in Bail her out then shouted Ev struggling with the sail There s two cans under the seat I ve got to lower this sail Bail her out I ll help you said Ethel She was very pale but her manner was calm Both girls bailed energetically Young Si watching through the glass saw them He dropped it and ran to his boat white and resolute They ve sprung a leak Here Curtis launch the boat We ve got to go out or Ev will drown them They shot out from the shore just as the downpour came blotting out sea and land in one driving sheet of white rain Young Si is coming off for us said Agnes We ll be all right if he gets here in time This boat is going to sink sure Little Ev was completely demoralized by fear The girls bailed unceasingly but the water gained every minute Young Si was none too soon Jump Ev he shouted as his boat shot alongside Jump for your life He dragged Ethel Lennox in as he spoke Agnes sprang from one boat to the other like a cat and Little Ev jumped just as a thunderous crash seemed to burst above them and air and sky were filled with blue flame The danger was past for the squall had few difficulties for Si and Snuffy When they reached the shore Agnes who had quite recovered from her fright tucked her dripping skirts about her and announced her determination to go straight home with Snuffy I can t get any wetter than I am she said cheerfully I ll send Pa down in the buggy for Miss Lennox Light the fire in your shanty Si and let her get dry I ll be as quick as I can Si picked Ethel up in his strong arms and carried her into the fish house He placed her on one of the low benches and hurriedly began to kindle a fire Ethel sat up dazedly and pushed back the dripping masses of her bright hair Young Si turned and looked down at her with a passionate light in his eyes She put out her cold wet hands wistfully Oh Miles she whispered Outside the wind shook the frail building and tore the shuddering sea to pieces The rain poured down It was already settling in for a night of storm But inside Young Si s fire was casting cheery flames over the rude room and Young Si himself was kneeling by Ethel Lennox with his arm about her and her head on his broad shoulder There were happy tears in her eyes and her voice quivered as she said Miles can you forgive me If you knew how bitterly I have repented Never speak of the past again my sweet In my lonely days and nights down here by the sea I have forgotten all but my love Miles how did you come here I thought you were in Europe I did travel at first I came down here by chance and resolved to cut myself utterly adrift from my old life and see if I could not forget you I was not very successful He smiled down into her eyes And you were going away tomorrow How perilously near we have been to not meeting But how are we going to explain all this to our friends along shore I think we had better not explain it at all I will go away tomorrow as I intended and you can quietly follow soon Let Young Si remain the mystery he has always been That will be best decidedly so They would never understand if we did tell them And I daresay they would be very much disappointed to find I was not a murderer or a forger or something of that sort They have always credited me with an evil past And you and I will go back to our own world Ethel You will be welcome there now sweet my family too have learned a lesson and will do anything to promote my happiness Agnes drove Ethel Lennox to the station next day The fierce wind that had swept over land and sea seemed to have blown away all the hazy vapours and oppressive heats in the air and the morning dawned as clear and fresh as if the sad old earth with all her passionate tears had cleansed herself from sin and stain and come forth radiantly pure and sweet Ethel bubbled over with joyousness Agnes wondered at the change in her Good bye Miss Lennox she said wistfully You ll come back to see us some time again won t you Perhaps smiled Ethel and if not Agnes you must come and see me Some day I may tell you a secret About a week later Young Si suddenly vanished and his disappearance was a nine day s talk along shore His departure was as mysterious as his advent It leaked out that he had quietly disposed of his boat and shanty to Snuffy Curtis sent his mackerel off and that done slipped from the Pointers lives never more to re enter them Little Ev was the last of the Pointers to see him tramping along the road to the station in the dusk of the autumn twilight And the next morning Agnes Bentley going out of doors before the others found on the doorstep a basket containing a small vociferous black kitten with a card attached to its neck On it was written Will Agnes please befriend Witch in memory of Young Si End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Lucy Maud
