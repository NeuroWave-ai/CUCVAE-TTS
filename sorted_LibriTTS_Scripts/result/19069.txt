ten THE SILENT HOUSE CHAPTER I THE TENANT OF THE SILENT HOUSE Lucian Denzil was a briefless barrister who so far departed from the traditions of his brethren of the long robe as not to dwell within the purlieus of the Temple For certain private reasons not unconnected with economy he occupied rooms in Geneva Square Pimlico and for the purposes of his profession repaired daily from ten to four to Serjeant s Inn where he shared an office with a friend equally briefless and poor This state of things sounds hardly enviable but Lucian being young and independent to the extent of Lthree hundred a year was not dissatisfied with his position As his age was only twenty five there was ample time he thought to succeed in his profession and pending that desirable consummation he cultivated the muses on a little oatmeal after the fashion of his kind There have been lives less happily circumstanced Geneva Square was a kind of backwater of the great river of town life which swept past its entrance with speed and clamour without disturbing the peace within One long narrow street led from a roaring thoroughfare into a silent quadrangle of tall grey houses occupied by lodging house keepers city clerks and two or three artists who represented the Bohemian element of the place In the centre there was an oasis of green lawn surrounded by rusty iron railings the height of a man dotted with elms of considerable age and streaked with narrow paths of yellow gravel The surrounding houses represented an eminently respectable appearance with their immaculately clean steps white curtained windows and neat boxes of flowers The windows glittered like diamonds the door knobs and plates shone with a yellow lustre and there were no sticks or straws or waste paper lying about to mar the tidy look of the square With one exception Geneva Square was a pattern of all that was desirable in the way of cleanliness and order One might hope to find such a haven in some somnolent cathedral town but scarcely in the grimy smoky restless metropolis of London The exception to the notable spotlessness of the neighborhood was No thirteen a house in the centre of the side opposite to the entrance Its windows were dusty and without blinds or curtains there were no flower boxes on the ledges the steps lacked whitewash and the iron railings looked rusty for want of paint Stray straws and scraps of paper found their way down the area where the cracked pavement was damp with green slime Such beggars as occasionally wandered into the square to the scandal of its inhabitants camped on the doorstep and the very door itself presented a battered dissolute appearance Yet for all its ill looks and disreputable suggestions those who dwelt in Geneva Square would not have seen it furbished up and occupied for any money They spoke about it in whispers with ostentatious tremblings and daunted looks for No thirteen was supposed to be haunted and had been empty for over twenty years By reason of its legend its loneliness and grim appearance it was known as the Silent House and formed quite a feature of the place Murder had been done long ago in one of its empty dusty rooms and it was since then that the victim walked Lights said the ghost seers had been seen flitting from window to window groans were sometimes heard and the apparition of a little old woman in brocaded silk and high heeled shoes appeared on occasions Hence the Silent House bore an uncanny reputation How much truth there was in these stories it is impossible to say but sure enough in spite of a low rental no tenant would take No thirteen and face its ghostly terrors House and apparition and legend had become quite a tradition when the whole fantasy was ended in the summer of ninety five by the unexpected occupation of the mansion mister Mark Berwin a gentleman of mature age who came from nobody knew where rented No thirteen and established himself therein to lead a strange and lonely life At first the gossips strong in ghostly tradition declared that the new tenant would not remain a week in the house but as the week extended into six months and mister Berwin showed no signs of leaving they left off speaking of the ghost and took to discussing the man himself In a short space of time quite a collection of stories were told about the newcomer and his strange ways Lucian heard many of these tales from his landlady How mister Berwin lived all alone in the Silent House without servant or companion how he spoke to none and admitted no one into the mansion how he appeared to have plenty of money and was frequently seen coming home more or less intoxicated and how missus Kebby the deaf charwoman who cleaned out mister Berwin s rooms declined to sleep in the house because she considered that there was something wrong about her employer To such gossip Denzil paid little attention until his skein of life became unexpectedly entangled with that of the strange gentleman The manner of their meeting was unforeseen and peculiar One foggy November night Lucian returning from the theatre shortly after eleven o clock dismissed his hansom at the entrance to the square and walked thereinto through the thick mist trusting to find his way home by reason of two years familiarity with the precincts As it was impossible to see even the glare of the near gas lamp in the murky air Lucian felt his way cautiously along the railings The square was filled with fog dense to the eye and cold to the feel so that Lucian shivered with the chill in spite of the fur coat over his evening clothes As he edged gingerly along and thought longingly of the fire and supper awaiting him in his comfortable rooms he was startled by hearing a deep rich voice boom out almost at his feet To make the phenomenon still more remarkable the voice shaped itself into certain well known words of Shakespeare Oh boomed this vox et praeterea nihil in rather husky tones Oh that a man should put an enemy in his mouth to steal away his brains And then through the mist and darkness came the unmistakable sound of sobs God bless me cried Lucian leaping back with shaken nerves Who is this Who are you A lost soul wailed the deep voice which God will not bless And then came the sobbing again It made Denzil s blood run cold to hear this unseen creature weeping in the gloom Moving cautiously in the direction of the sound he stumbled against a man with his folded arms resting on the railings and his face bent down on his arms He made no attempt to turn when Lucian touched him but with downcast head continued to weep and moan in a very frenzy of self pity Here said the young barrister shaking the stranger by the shoulder what is the matter with you Drink stuttered the man suddenly turning with a dramatic gesture I am an object lesson to teetotalers a warning to topers a modern helot made shameful to disgust youth with vice You had better go home sir said Lucian sharply I can t find home It is somewhere hereabout but where I don t know You are in Geneva Square said Denzil trying to sharpen the dulled wits of the man I wish I was in No thirteen of it sighed the stranger Where the deuce is No thirteen Not in this Cloudcuckooland anyhow Oh cried Lucian taking the man s arm Come with me I ll lead you home mister Berwin Scarcely had the name passed his lips than the stranger drew back suddenly with a hasty exclamation Some suspicion seemed to engender a mixture of terror and defiance which placed him on his guard against undue intimacy even when some undefined fear was knocking at his heart Who are you he demanded in a steadier tone How do you know my name My name is Denzil mister Berwin and I live in one of the houses of this square As you mention No thirteen I know you can be none other than mister Mark Berwin the tenant of the Silent House The dweller in the haunted house sneered Berwin evidently relieved who stays there with ghosts and worse than ghosts Worse than ghosts The phantoms of my own sins young man I have sowed folly and now I am reaping the crop I am Here his further speech was interrupted by a fit of coughing which shook his lean figure severely At its conclusion he was so exhausted that he was forced to support himself against the railings A portion of the crop he murmured Lucian was sorry for the man who seemed scarcely capable of looking after himself and he thought it unwise to leave him in such a plight At the same time he was impatient of lingering in the heart of the clammy fog at such a late hour so as his companion seemed indisposed to move he caught him again by the arm without ceremony The abrupt action seemed to waken again the fears of Berwin Where would you take me he asked resisting the gentle force used by Lucian To your own house You will be ill if you stay here You are not one of them asked the man suddenly One of whom One of those who wish to harm me Denzil began to think he had to do with a madman and to gain his ends he spoke to him in a soothing manner as he would to a child I wish to do you good mister Berwin said he gently Come to your home Home home Ah God I have no home Nevertheless he gathered himself together and with his arm in that of his guide stumbled along in the thick chill mist Lucian knew the position of No thirteen well as it almost faced the lodgings occupied by himself and by skirting the railings with due caution he managed to half lead half drag his companion to the house When they stood before the door and Berwin had assured himself that he was actually home by the use of his latch key Denzil wished him a curt good night And I should advise you to go to bed at once he concluded turning to descend the steps Don t go Don t go cried Berwin seizing the young man by the arm I am afraid to go in by myself all is so dark and cold Wait until I get a light As the creature s nerves seemed to be unhinged by over indulgence in alcohol and he stood gasping and shivering on the threshold like some beaten animal Lucian took compassion on him I ll see you indoors said he and striking a match stepped into the darkness after the man The hall of No thirteen seemed to be almost as cold as the world without and the trifling glimmer of the lucifer served rather to reveal than dispel the surrounding darkness The light as it were hollowed a gulf out of the tremendous gloom and made the house tenfold more ghostly than before The footsteps of Denzil and Berwin sounding on the bare boards for the hall was uncarpeted waked hollow echoes and when they paused the silence which ensued seemed almost menacing The grim reputation of the mansion its gloom and silence appealed powerfully to the latent superstition of Lucian How much more nearly then would it touch the shaken and excited nerves of the tragic drunkard who dwelt continually amid its terrors Berwin opened a door on the right hand side of the hall and turned up the light of a handsome oil lamp which had been screwed down pending his arrival This lamp was placed on a small square table covered with a white cloth and a dainty cold supper The young barrister noted that the napery cutlery and crystal were all of the finest that the viands were choice that champagne and claret were the beverages Evidently Berwin was a luxurious gentleman and indulgent to his appetites Lucian tried to gain a long look at him in the mellow light but Berwin kept his face turned away and seemed as anxious now for his visitor to go as he had been for him to enter Denzil quick in comprehension took the hint at once I ll go now as you have the light burning said he Good night Good night replied Berwin shortly and added to his discourtesy by letting Lucian find his way out alone And so ended the barrister s first meeting with the strange tenant of the Silent House

none	none	 SHADOWS ON THE BLIND The landlady of Denzil was a rather uncommon specimen of the class She inclined to plumpness was lively in the extreme wore very fashionable garments of the brightest colours and although somewhat elderly still cherished a hope that some young man would elevate her to the rank of a matron 
6519_231834_000004_000000	train-clean-360	At present Miss Julia Greeb was an unwedded damsel of forty summers who with the aid of art was making desperate but ineffectual efforts to detain the youth which was slipping from her 
6519_231834_000004_000001	train-clean-360	She pinched her waist dyed her hair powdered her face and affected juvenile dress of the white frock and blue sash kind 
6519_231834_000004_000002	train-clean-360	In the distance she looked a girlish twenty close at hand various artifices aided her to pass for thirty and it was only in the solitude of her own room that her real age was apparent 
none	none	Never did woman wage a more resolute fight with Time than did Miss Greeb 
6519_231834_000005_000000	train-clean-360	But this was the worst and most frivolous side of her character for she was really a good hearted cheery little woman with a brisk manner and a flow of talk unequalled in Geneva Square 
none	none	She had been born in the house she occupied after the death of her father and had grown up to assist her mother in ministering to the exactions of a continuous procession of lodgers These came and went married and died but not one of the desirable young men had borne Miss Greeb to the altar so that when her mother died the fair Julia almost despaired of attaining to the dignity of wifehood 
6519_231834_000005_000003	train-clean-360	Nevertheless she continued to keep boarders and to make attempts to captivate the hearts of such bachelors as she judged weak in character 
none	none	Hitherto all her efforts had been more or less of a mercantile character with an eye to money but when Lucian Denzil appeared on the scene the poor little woman really fell in love with his handsome face But in strange contrast to her other efforts Miss Greeb never for a moment deemed that Lucian would marry her 
6519_231834_000006_000001	train-clean-360	He was her god her ideal of manhood and to him she offered worship and burnt incense after the manner of her kind 
none	none	Denzil occupied a bedroom and sitting room both pleasant airy apartments looking out on to the square 
6519_231834_000007_000001	train-clean-360	Miss Greeb attended to his needs herself and brought up his breakfast with her own fair hands happy for the day if her admired lodger conversed with her for a few moments before reading the morning paper 
none	none	Then Miss Greeb would retire to her own sitting room and indulge in day dreams which she well knew would never be realised The romances she wove herself were even more marvellous than those she read in her favourite penny novelettes but unlike the printed tales her romance never culminated in marriage 
6519_231834_000007_000004	train-clean-360	Poor brainless silly pitiful Miss Greeb she would have made a good wife and a fond mother but by some irony of fate she was destined to be neither and the comedy of her husband hunting youth was now changing into the lonely tragedy of disappointed spinsterhood 
6519_231834_000007_000005	train-clean-360	She was one of the world s unknown martyrs and her fate merits tears rather than laughter 
6519_231834_000008_000000	train-clean-360	On the morning after his meeting with Berwin the young barrister sat at breakfast with Miss Greeb in anxious attendance 
none	none	Having poured out his tea and handed him his paper and ascertained that his breakfast was to his liking Miss Greeb lingered about the room putting this straight and that crooked in the hope that Lucian would converse with her In this she was gratified as Denzil wished to learn details about the strange man he had assisted on the previous night and he knew that no one could afford him more precise information than his brisk landlady to whom was known all the gossip of the neighbourhood 
6519_231834_000008_000003	train-clean-360	His first word made Miss Greeb flutter back to the table like a dove to its nest 
none	none	Do you know anything about No thirteen asked Lucian stirring his tea Do I know anything about No thirteen repeated Miss Greeb in shrill amazement
6519_231834_000010_000001	train-clean-360	 Of course I do mister Denzil 
6519_231834_000010_000002	train-clean-360	There ain t a thing I don t know about that house 
6519_231834_000010_000003	train-clean-360	Ghosts and vampires and crawling spectres live in it that they do 
none	none	Do you call mister Berwin a ghost
6519_231834_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 No nor nothing half so respectable 
none	none	He is a mystery sir that s what mister Berwin is and I don t care if he hears me commit myself so far
6519_231834_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 In what way is he a mystery demanded Denzil approaching the matter with more particularity 
none	none	Why said Miss Greeb evidently puzzled how to answer this leading question no one can find out anything about him 
6519_231834_000014_000001	train-clean-360	He s full of secrets and underhand goings on 
none	none	It ain t respectable not to be fair and above board that it ain t I see no reason why a quiet living old gentleman should tell his private affairs to the whole square remarked Lucian drily Those who have nothing bad to conceal needn t be afraid of speaking out retorted Miss Greeb tartly And the way in which mister Berwin lives is enough to make one think him a coiner or a thief or even a murderer that it is But what grounds have you to believe him any one of the three 
6519_231834_000018_000000	train-clean-360	This question also puzzled the landlady as she had no reasonable grounds for her wild statements 
none	none	Nevertheless she made a determined attempt to substantiate them by hearsay evidence mister Berwin said she in significant tones lives all alone in that haunted house
6519_231834_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Why not 
none	none	Every man has the right to be a misanthrope if he chooses
6519_231834_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 He has no right to behave so in a respectable square replied Miss Greeb shaking her head 
6519_231834_000020_000001	train-clean-360	 There s only two rooms of that large house furnished and all the rest is given up to dust and ghosts 
none	none	mister Berwin won t have a servant to live under his roof and missus Kebby who does his charing says he drinks awful 
6519_231834_000020_000003	train-clean-360	Then he has his meals sent in from the Nelson Hotel round the corner and eats them all alone 
none	none	He don t receive no letters he don t read no newspapers and stays in all day only coming out at night like an owl If he ain t a criminal mister Denzil why does he carry on so He may dislike his fellow men and desire to live a secluded life 
6519_231834_000022_000000	train-clean-360	Miss Greeb still shook her head 
none	none	He may dislike his fellow men she said with emphasis but that don t keep him from seeing them ah that it don t Is there anything wrong in that said Lucian contemptuous of these cobweb objections
6519_231834_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Perhaps not mister Denzil but where do those he sees come from 
none	none	How do you mean Miss Greeb They don t go in by the front door that s certain continued the little woman darkly There s only one entrance to this square sir and Blinders the policeman is frequently on duty there Two or three nights he s met mister Berwin coming in after dark and exchanged friendly greetings with him and each time mister Berwin has been alone
6519_231834_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 Well well 
6505_231836_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Well well 
6505_231836_000045_000001	train-clean-360	What of that 
6519_231834_000027_000001	train-clean-360	What of that said Denzil impatiently 
6519_231834_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 This much mister Denzil that Blinders has gone round the square after seeing mister Berwin and has seen shadows two or three of them on the sitting room blind 
none	none	Now sir cried Miss Greeb clinching her argument if mister Berwin came into the square alone how did his visitors get in
6519_231834_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 Perhaps by the back conjectured Lucian 
6519_231834_000030_000000	train-clean-360	Again Miss Greeb shook her head 
6519_231834_000030_000001	train-clean-360	 I know the back of No thirteen as well as I know my own face she declared 
6519_231834_000030_000002	train-clean-360	 There s a yard and a fence but no entrance 
none	none	To get in there you have to go in by the front door or down the aiery steps and you can t do neither without coming past Blinders at the square s entrance and that finished Miss Greeb triumphantly these visitors don t do They may have come into the square during the day when Blinders was not on duty No sir said Miss Greeb ready for this objection
6519_231834_000032_000001	train-clean-360	 I thought of that myself and as my duty to the square I have inquired that I have 
6519_231834_000032_000002	train-clean-360	On two occasions I ve asked the day policeman and he says no one passed 
none	none	Then said Lucian rather puzzled mister Berwin cannot live alone in the house Begging your pardon I m sure cried the pertinacious woman but he does missus Kebby has been all over the house and there isn t another soul in it No mister Denzil take it what way you will there s something that ain t right about mister Berwin if that s his real name which I don t believe it is Why Miss Greeb
6519_231834_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 Just because I don t replied the landlady with feminine logic 
none	none	And if you think of having anything to do with this mystery mister Denzil I beg of you not to else you may come to something as is too terrible to consider that you may
6519_231834_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 Such as 
6519_231834_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh I don t know cried Miss Greeb tossing her head and gliding towards the door 
6519_231834_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 It ain t for me to say what I think 
6519_231834_000038_000002	train-clean-360	I am the last person in the world to meddle with what don t concern me that I am And thus ending the conversation Miss Greeb vanished with significant look and pursed up lips 
none	none	The reason of this last speech and rapid retreat lay in the fact that Miss Greeb could bring no tangible charge against her opposite neighbour and therefore hinted at his complicity in all kinds of horrors which she was quite unable to define save in terms more or less vague Lucian dismissed such hints of criminality from his mind as the outcome of Miss Greeb s very lively imagination yet even though he reduced her communications to bare facts he could not but acknowledge that there was something queer about mister Berwin and his mode of life The man s self pity and self condemnation his hints that certain people wished to do him harm the curious episode of the shadows on the blind these things engaged the curiosity of Denzil in no ordinary degree and he could not but admit to himself that it would greatly ease his mind to arrive at some reasonable explanation of Berwin s eccentricities 
6519_231834_000041_000000	train-clean-360	Nevertheless he held that he had no right to pry into the secrets of the stranger and honourably strove to dismiss the tenant of No thirteen and his tantalising environments from his mind 
6519_231834_000041_000001	train-clean-360	But such dismissal of unworthy curiosity was more difficult to effect than he expected 
6519_231834_000042_000000	train-clean-360	For the next week Lucian resolutely banished the subject from his thoughts and declined to discuss the matter further with Miss Greeb That little woman all on fire with curiosity made various inquiries of her gossips regarding the doings of mister Berwin and in default of reporting the same to her lodger occupied herself in discussing them with her neighbours 
none	none	The consequence of this incessant gossip was that the eyes of the whole square fixed themselves on No thirteen in expectation of some catastrophe although no one knew exactly what was going to happen This undefinable feeling of impending disaster communicating itself to Lucian stimulated his curiosity to such a pitch that with some feeling of shame for his weakness he walked round the square on two several evenings in the hope of meeting Berwin 
6519_231834_000043_000001	train-clean-360	But on both occasions he was unsuccessful 
6519_231834_000044_000000	train-clean-360	On the third evening he was more fortunate for having worked at his law books until late at night he went out for a brisk walk before retiring to rest 
none	none	The night was cold and there had been a slight fall of snow so Lucian wrapped himself up well lighted his pipe and proceeded to take the air by tramping twice or thrice round the square Overhead the sky was clear and frosty with chill glittering stars and a wintry moon A thin covering of snow lay on the pavement and there was a white rime on the bare branches of the central trees 
6519_231834_000045_000000	train-clean-360	On coming to the house of Berwin the barrister saw that the sitting room was lighted up and the curtains undrawn so that the window presented a square of illuminated blind 
6519_231834_000045_000001	train-clean-360	Even as he looked two shadows darkened the white surface the shadows of a man and a woman 
none	none	Evidently they had come between the lamp and the window and so quite unknowingly revealed their actions to the watcher 
6519_231834_000045_000003	train-clean-360	Curious to see the end of this shadow pantomime Lucian stood still and looked intently at the window 
6519_231834_000046_000000	train-clean-360	The two figures seemed to be arguing for their heads nodded violently and their arms waved constantly 
6519_231834_000046_000001	train-clean-360	They retreated out of the sphere of light and again came into it still continuing their furious gestures Unexpectedly the male shadow seized the female by the throat and swung her like a feather to and fro 
6519_231834_000046_000002	train-clean-360	The struggling figures reeled out of the radiance and Lucian heard a faint cry 
6519_231834_000047_000000	train-clean-360	Thinking that something was wrong he rushed up the steps and rang the bell violently 
6519_231834_000047_000001	train-clean-360	Almost before the sound died away the light in the room was extinguished and he could see nothing more 
6519_231834_000047_000002	train-clean-360	Again and again he rang but without attracting attention so Lucian finally left the house and went in search of Blinders the policeman to narrate his experience 
none	none	At the entrance of Geneva Square he ran against a man whom he recognised in the clear moonlight To his surprise he beheld Mark Berwin CHAPTER III AN UNSATISFACTORY EXPLANATION mister Berwin cried Lucian recognising the man Is it you Who else should it be replied Berwin bending forward to see who had jostled him Who else should it be mister Denzil But I thought I thought said the barrister unable to conceal his surprise that is I fancied you were indoors Your fancy was wrong you see I am not indoors Then who is in your house Berwin shrugged his shoulders No one so far as I know You are mistaken sir There was a light in your room and I saw the shadows of a man and a woman struggling together thrown on the blind People in my house said Berwin laying a shaking hand on the arm of Lucian Impossible I tell you it is so Come then and we will look for them said Berwin in a tremulous voice But they have gone by this time Gone
6505_231837_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes 
6544_231862_000058_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes 
none	none	said Denzil rapidly I rang the bell as I fancied there was some fatal quarrel going on within At once the light was put out and as I could attract no one to the door I suppose the man and woman must have fled For a moment or so Berwin said nothing but his grip on Lucian s arm relaxed and he moved forward a few steps You must be mistaken mister Denzil said he in altered tones there can be no person in my house I locked the door before I went out and I have been absent at least two hours Then I must be mad or dreaming retorted Lucian with heat We can soon prove if you are either of the two sir Come with me and examine the house for yourself Pardon me said Denzil drawing back it is none of my business But I warn you mister Berwin that others are more curious than I am Several times people have been known to be in your house while you were absent and your mode of life secretive and strange does not commend itself to the householders in this neighbourhood If you persist in giving rise to gossip and scandal some busybody may bring the police on the scene The police echoed the old man now greatly alarmed as would appear from his shaking voice 
6544_231862_000016_000002	train-clean-360	No no 
none	none	That will never do My house is my castle The police dare not break into it I am a peaceful and very unfortunate gentleman who wishes to live quietly All this talk of people being in my house is nonsense Yet you seemed afraid when I told you of the shadows said Lucian pointedly Afraid I am afraid of nothing Not even of those who are after you hinted Denzil recalling the conversation of the previous occasion Berwin gave a kind of eldritch shriek and stepped back a pace as though to place himself on his guard What what do you know about such such things he panted Only so much as you hinted at when I last saw you Yes yes I was not myself on that night The wine was in and the wit was out The truth also it would seem said Lucian drily judging by your agitation then and now I am an unfortunate gentleman whimpered Berwin tremulously If you will excuse me sir I shall leave you said Lucian ceremoniously It seems to be my fate to hold midnight conversations with you in the cold but I think this one had better be cut short One moment mister Berwin exclaimed You have been good enough to place me on my guard as to the talk my quiet course of life is causing Pray add to your kindness by coming with me to my house and exploring it from attic to basement You will then see that there are no grounds for scandal and that the shadows you fancy you saw on the blind are not those of real people They can t be those of ghosts at all events replied Lucian as I never heard to my knowledge that spirits could cast shadows Well come and see for yourself that the house is empty Warmly as this invitation was given Lucian had some scruples about accepting it To explore an almost unfurnished mansion with a complete stranger and one with an ill reputation at the midnight hour is not an enterprise to be coveted by any man however bold he may be Still Lucian had ample courage and more curiosity for the adventure as the chance of it stirred up that desire for romance which belongs peculiarly to youth Also he was anxious to satisfy himself concerning the blind shadows and curious to learn why Berwin inhabited so dismal and mysterious a mansion Add to these reasons a keen pleasure in profiting by the occurrence of the unexpected and you will guess that Denzil ended by accepting the strange invitation of Berwin Being now fully committed to the adventure he went forward with cool courage and an observant eye to spy out if possible the secret upon which hinged these mysteries As on the former occasion Berwin inducted his guest into the sitting room and here as previously a dainty supper was spread Berwin turned up the lamp light and waved his hand round the luxuriously furnished room pointing particularly to the space between table and window The figures whose shadows you saw said he must have struggled together in this space so as to be between the lamp and the blind for the performance of their pantomime But I would have you observe mister Denzil that there is no disturbance of the furniture to show that such a struggle as you describe took place also that the curtains are drawn across the window and no light could have been thrown on the blind The curtains were no doubt drawn after I rang the bell said Lucian glancing towards the heavy folds of crimson velvet which veiled the window The curtains retorted Berwin stripping off his coat were drawn by me before I went out Lucian said nothing but shook his head doubtfully Evidently Berwin was trying for his own ends to talk him into a belief that his eyes had deceived him but Denzil was too clear headed a young man to be so gulled Berwin s explanations and excuses only confirmed the idea that there was something in the man s life which cut him off from humanity and which would not bear the light of day Hitherto Lucian had heard rather than seen Berwin but now in the clear light of the lamp he had an excellent opportunity of observing both the man and his quarters Berwin was of medium height and lean with a clean shaven face hollow cheeks and black sunken eyes His hair was grey and thin his looks wild and wandering and the hectic colouring of his face and narrow chest showed that he was far gone in consumption Even as Lucian looked at him he was shaken by a hollow cough and when he withdrew his handkerchief from his lips the white linen was spotted with blood He was in evening dress and looked eminently refined although worn and haggard in appearance Denzil noted two peculiar marks about him the first a serpentine cicatrice extending on the right cheek from lip almost to ear the second the loss of the little finger of the left hand which was cut off at the first joint As he examined the man a second and more violent fit of coughing shook him You seem to be very ill said Lucian pitying the feebleness of the poor creature Dying of consumption one lung gone gasped Berwin It will soon be over the sooner the better With your health mister Berwin it is sheer madness to dwell in this rigorous English climate No doubt replied the man pouring himself out a tumbler of claret but I can t leave England I can t leave this house even but on the whole he added with a satisfied glance around I am not badly lodged Lucian agreed with this speech The room was furnished in the most luxurious manner The prevailing hue was a deep warm red carpet walls hangings and furniture were all of this cheerful tint The chairs were deep and softly cushioned on the walls were several oil paintings by celebrated modern artists there were dwarf bookcases filled with well chosen books and on a small bamboo table near the fire lay magazines and papers The mantelpiece reaching nearly to the ceiling was of oak framing mirrors of bevelled glass and on the numerous shelves cups saucers and vases of old and valuable china were placed There was also a gilt clock a handsome sideboard and a neat smoking table on which stood a cut glass spirit stand and a box of cigars The whole apartment was furnished with taste and refinement and Lucian saw that the man who owned such luxurious quarters must be possessed of money as well as the capability of using it in the most civilised way You have certainly all that the heart of man can desire in the way of material comforts said he looking at the supper table which with its silver and crystal and spotless covering glittered like a jewel under the brilliant lamplight My only wonder is that you should furnish one room so finely and leave the others bare My bedroom and bathroom are yonder replied Berwin pointing towards large folding doors draped with velvet curtains and placed opposite to the window They are as well furnished as this But how do you know the rest of this house is bare I can hardly help knowing it mister Berwin Your contrast of poverty and riches is an open secret in this neighbourhood No one has been in my house save yourself mister Denzil Oh I have said nothing You turned me out so quickly the other night that I had no time for observation Besides I am not in the habit of remarking on matters which do not concern me
6505_231838_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 I beg your pardon 
none	none	said Berwin weakly I had no intention of offending you I suppose missus Kebby has been talking I should think it probable The skirling Jezebel cried Berwin I ll pack her off right away Are you a Scotchman asked Denzil suddenly Why do you ask demanded Berwin without replying You used an essentially Scotch word skirling And I used an essentially American phrase right away retorted the man I may be a Scot I may be a Yankee but I would remind you that my nationality is my own secret I have no wish to pry into your secrets said Denzil rising from the chair in which he had seated himself and in my turn I would remind you that I am here at your invitation Don t take offense at a hasty word said Berwin nervously I am glad of your company although I seem rather brusque You must go over the house with me I see no necessity to do so It will set your mind at rest regarding the shadows on the blind I can trust my eyes said Lucian drily and I am certain that before I met you a man and a woman were in this room Well said Berwin lighting a small lamp come with me and I ll prove that you are mistaken 
6505_231836_000002_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER IV
none	none	 missus KEBBY S DISCOVERY The pertinacity which Berwin displayed in insisting that Lucian should explore the Silent House was truly remarkable He appeared to be bent upon banishing the idea which Denzil entertained that strangers were hiding in the mansion From attic to basement from front to back premises he led the way and made Lucian examine every corner of the empty rooms He showed him even the unused kitchen and bade him remark that the door leading into the yard was locked and bolted and from the rusty condition of the ironwork could not have been opened for years 
6505_231836_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Also he made him look out of the window into the yard itself with its tall black fence dividing it from the other properties 
6505_231836_000006_000000	train-clean-360	This exploration finished and Lucian being convinced that himself and his host were the only two living beings in the house Berwin conducted his half frozen guest back to the warm sitting room and poured out a glass of wine 
6505_231836_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Here mister Denzil said he in good natured tones drink this and draw near the fire you must be chilled to the bone after our Arctic expedition 
none	none	Lucian willingly accepted both these attentions and sipped his wine it was particularly fine claret before the fire while Berwin coughed and shivered and muttered to himself about the cold of the season 
6505_231836_000008_000001	train-clean-360	When Lucian stood up to take his departure he addressed him directly 
none	none	Well sir said he with a sardonic smile are you convinced that the struggling shadows on yonder blind were children of your heated fancy No said Denzil stoutly I am not Yet you have seen that there is no one in the house mister Berwin said Lucian after a moment s thought you propose a riddle which I cannot answer and which I do not wish to answer 
6505_231836_000012_000001	train-clean-360	I cannot explain what I saw to night but as surely as you were out of this house some people were in it 
none	none	How this affects you or what reason you have for denying it I do not ask 
6505_231836_000012_000003	train-clean-360	Keep your own secrets and go your own way 
6505_231836_000012_000004	train-clean-360	I wish you good night sir and Lucian moved towards the door 
6505_231836_000013_000000	train-clean-360	Berwin who was holding a full tumbler of rich strong port drank the whole of it in one gulp 
none	none	The strong liquor reddened his pallid face and brightened his sunken eyes it even strengthened his already sonorous voice At least you can inform my good neighbours that I am a peaceful man desirous of being left to lead my own life he said urgently No sir 
6505_231836_000015_000001	train-clean-360	I will have nothing to do with your business 
none	none	You are a stranger to me and our acquaintance is too slight to warrant my discussing your affairs 
6505_231836_000015_000003	train-clean-360	Besides added Lucian with a shrug they do not interest me 
6505_231836_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Yet they may interest the three kingdoms one day said Berwin softly 
6505_231836_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Oh if they deal with danger to society said Denzil thinking his strange neighbour spoke of anarchistic schemes I would 
6505_231836_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 They deal with danger to myself interrupted Berwin 
none	none	I am a hunted man and I hide here from those who wish me ill I am dying as you see he cried striking his hollow chest but I may not die quickly enough for those who desire my death Who are they cried Lucian rather startled by this outburst
6505_231836_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 People with whom you have no concern replied the man sullenly 
6505_231836_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 That is true enough mister Berwin so I ll say good night 
none	none	Berwin Berwin Ha ha 
6505_231836_000022_000003	train-clean-360	A very good name Berwin but not for me 
6505_231836_000022_000004	train-clean-360	Oh was there ever so unhappy a creature as I False name false friend in disgrace in hiding 
6505_231836_000022_000005	train-clean-360	Curse everybody 
6505_231836_000022_000006	train-clean-360	Go go 
6505_231836_000022_000007	train-clean-360	mister Denzil and leave me to die here like a rat in its hole 
6505_231836_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 You are ill said Lucian amazed by the man s fury 
none	none	Shall I send a doctor to see you Send no one cried Berwin commanding himself by a visible effort Only go away and leave me to myself Thou can saint not minister to a mind diseased Go go
6505_231836_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Good night then said Denzil seeing that nothing could be done 
6505_231836_000025_000001	train-clean-360	 I hope you will be better in the morning 
6505_231836_000026_000000	train-clean-360	Berwin shook his head and with a silent tongue which contrasted strangely with his late outcry ushered Denzil out of the house 
none	none	As the heavy door closed behind him Lucian descended the steps and looked thoughtfully at the grim mansion which was tenanted by so mysterious a person 
6505_231836_000027_000001	train-clean-360	He could make nothing of Berwin as he chose to call himself he could see no meaning in his wild words and mad behaviour but as he walked briskly back to his lodgings he came to the conclusion that the man was nothing worse than a tragic drunkard haunted by terrors engendered by over indulgence in stimulants 
none	none	The episode of the shadows on the blind he did not attempt to explain for the simple reason that he was unable to find any plausible explanation to account therefor And why should I trouble my head to do so mused Lucian as he went to bed The man and his mysteries are nothing to me Bah I have been infected by the vulgar curiosity of the Square 
6505_231836_000028_000004	train-clean-360	Henceforth I ll neither see nor think of this drunken lunatic and with such resolve he dismissed all thoughts of his strange acquaintance from his mind which under the circumstances was perhaps the wisest thing he could do 
6505_231836_000029_000000	train-clean-360	But later on certain events took place which forced him to alter his determination 
6505_231836_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Fate with her own ends to bring about is not to be denied by her puppets and of these Lucian was one designed for an important part in the drama which was to be played 
6505_231836_000030_000000	train-clean-360	missus Margery Kebby who attended to the domestic economy of Berwin s house was a deaf old crone with a constant thirst only to be assuaged by strong drink and a filching hand which was usually in every pocket save her own 
6505_231836_000030_000001	train-clean-360	She had neither kith nor kin nor friends nor even acquaintances but being something of a miser scraped and screwed to amass money she had no need for and dwelt in a wretched little apartment in a back slum whence she daily issued to work little and pilfer much 
6505_231836_000031_000000	train-clean-360	Usually at nine o clock she brought in her employer s breakfast from the Nelson Hotel which was outside the Square and while he was enjoying it in bed after his fashion she cleaned out and made tidy the sitting room 
6505_231836_000031_000001	train-clean-360	Berwin then dressed and went out for a walk despite Miss Greeb s contention that he took the air only at night like an owl and during his absence missus Kebby attended to the bedroom 
6505_231836_000031_000002	train-clean-360	She then went about her own business which was connected with the cleaning of various other apartments and only returned at midday and at night to lay the table for Berwin s luncheon and dinner or rather dinner and supper which were also sent in from the hotel 
6505_231836_000032_000000	train-clean-360	For these services Berwin paid her well and only enjoined her to keep a quiet tongue about his private affairs which missus Kebby usually did until excited by too copious drams of gin when she talked freely and unwisely to all the servants in the Square 
none	none	It was to her observation and invention that Berwin owed his bad reputation Well known in every kitchen missus Kebby hobbled from one to the other gossiping about the various affairs of her various employers and when absolute knowledge failed she took to inventing details which did no small credit to her imagination 
6505_231836_000033_000001	train-clean-360	Also she could tell fortunes by reading tea leaves and shuffling cards and was not above aiding the maid servants in their small love affairs 
6505_231836_000034_000000	train-clean-360	In short missus Kebby was a dangerous old witch who a century back would have been burnt at the stake and the worst possible person for Berwin to have in his house 
none	none	Had he known of her lying and prating she would not have remained an hour under his roof but missus Kebby was cunning enough to steer clear of such a danger in the most dexterous manner 
6505_231836_000034_000002	train-clean-360	She had a firm idea that Berwin had in her own emphatic phrase done something for which he was wanted by the police and was always on the look out to learn the secret of his isolated life in order to betray him or blackmail him or get him in some way under her thumb 
6505_231836_000034_000003	train-clean-360	As yet she had been unsuccessful 
6505_231836_000035_000000	train-clean-360	Deeming her a weak quiet old creature Berwin in spite of his suspicious nature entrusted missus Kebby with the key of the front door so that she could enter for her morning s work without disturbing him The sitting room door itself was not always locked but Berwin usually bolted the portal of his bedroom and had invariably to rise and admit missus Kebby with his breakfast 
6505_231836_000036_000000	train-clean-360	The same routine was observed each morning and everything went smoothly 
none	none	missus Kebby had heard of the blind shadows from several people and had poked and pryed about all over the house in the hope of arriving at some knowledge of the substantial flesh and blood figures which cast them But in this quest which was intended to put money into her own pocket she failed entirely and during the whole six months of Berwin s tenancy she never saw a living soul in No thirteen save her employer nor could she ever find any evidence to show that Berwin had received visitors during her absence 
6505_231836_000036_000003	train-clean-360	The man was as great a mystery to missus Kebby as he was to the square in spite of her superior opportunities of learning the truth 
none	none	On Christmas Eve the old woman brought in a cold supper for Berwin as usual making several journeys to and fro between hotel and house for that purpose 
6505_231836_000037_000001	train-clean-360	She laid the table made up the fire and before taking her leave asked mister Berwin if he wanted anything else 
6505_231836_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 No I think not replied the man who looked wretchedly ill 
6505_231836_000038_000001	train-clean-360	 You can bring my breakfast to morrow 
6505_231836_000039_000000	train-clean-360	 At nine sir 
6505_231836_000040_000000	train-clean-360	 At the usual time answered Berwin impatiently 
none	none	Go away missus Kebby gave a final glance round to see that all was in order and shuffled out of the room as fast as her rheumatism would let her 
6505_231836_000041_000001	train-clean-360	As she left the house eight o clock chimed from the steeple of a near church and missus Kebby clinking her newly received wages in her pocket hurried out of the square to do her Christmas marketing 
6505_231836_000041_000002	train-clean-360	As she went down the street which led to it Blinders a burly ruddy faced policeman who knew her well stopped to make an observation 
6505_231836_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 Is that good gentleman of yours home missus Kebby he asked in the loud tones used to deaf people 
none	none	Oh he s home grumbled missus Kebby ungraciously sittin afore the fire like Solomon in all his glory What d ye want to know for
6505_231836_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 I saw him an hour ago explained Blinders and I thought he looked ill 
6505_231836_000045_000000	train-clean-360	 So he do like a corpse 
none	none	What of that 
6505_231836_000045_000002	train-clean-360	We ve all got to come to it some day 
none	none	Ow d ye know but what he won t be dead afore morning 
6505_231836_000045_000004	train-clean-360	Well I don t care 
6505_231836_000045_000005	train-clean-360	He s paid me up till to night 
none	none	I m going to enj y myself I am
6505_231836_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Don t you get drunk missus Kebby or I ll lock you up 
6505_231836_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Garn grunted the old beldame 
none	none	Wot s Christmas Eve for if it ain t for folk to enj y theirselves Y are on duty early
6505_231836_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 I m taking the place of a sick comrade and I ll be on duty all night That s my Christmas 
none	none	Well well Let every one enj y hisself as he likes muttered missus Kebby and shuffled off to the nearest public house 
6505_231836_000050_000000	train-clean-360	Here she began to celebrate the season and afterwards went shopping then she celebrated the season again and later carried home her purchases to the miserable garret she occupied 
none	none	In this den missus Kebby with the aid of gin and water celebrated the season until she drank herself to sleep 
6505_231836_000051_000000	train-clean-360	Next morning she woke in anything but an amiable mood and had to fortify herself with an early drink before she was fit to go about her business 
6505_231836_000052_000000	train-clean-360	It was almost nine when she reached the Nelson Hotel and found the covered tray with mister Berwin s breakfast waiting for her so she hurried with it to Geneva Square as speedily as possible fearful of a scolding Having admitted herself into the house missus Kebby took up the tray with both hands and pushed open the sitting room door with her foot 
6505_231836_000052_000001	train-clean-360	Here at the sight which met her eyes she dropped the tray with a crash and let off a shrill yell 
none	none	The room was in disorder the table was overturned and amid the wreckage of glass and china lay Mark Berwin with outspread hands stone dead stabbed to the heart 
6505_231837_000001_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER V
none	none	 THE TALK OF THE TOWN Nowadays events political social and criminal crowd so closely on one another s heels that what was formerly a nine days wonder is scarcely marvelled at the same number of minutes Yet in certain cases episodes of a mysterious or unexpected nature engage the attention of a careless world for a somewhat longer period and provoke an immense amount of discussion and surmise In this category may be placed the crime committed in Geneva Square for when the extraordinary circumstances of the case became known much curiosity was manifested regarding the possible criminal and his motive for committing so apparently useless a crime 
6505_231837_000004_000000	train-clean-360	To add to the wonderment of the public it came out in the evidence of Lucian Denzil at the inquest that Berwin was not the real name of the victim so here the authorities were confronted with a three fold problem 
none	none	They had first to discover the name of the dead man second to learn who it was had so foully murdered him and third to find out the reason why the unknown assassin should have slain an apparently harmless man But these hidden things were not easily brought to light and the meagre evidence collected by the police failed to do away with any one of the three obstacles at all events until after the inquest When the jury brought in a verdict that the deceased had been violently done to death by some person or persons unknown the twelve good men and true stated the full extent of knowledge gained by Justice in her futile scramble after clues 
6505_231837_000005_000002	train-clean-360	Berwin so called was dead his assassin had melted into thin air and the Silent House had added a second legend to its already uncanny reputation 
6505_231837_000005_000003	train-clean-360	Formerly it had been simply haunted now it was also blood stained and its last condition was worse than its first 
none	none	The dead man had been found stabbed to the heart by some long thin sharp pointed instrument which the murderer had taken away with him or perhaps her as the sex of the assassin for obvious reasons could not be decided missus Kebby swore that she had left the deceased sitting over the fire at eight o clock on Christmas Eve and that he had then been fairly well though far from enjoying the best of health 
6505_231837_000006_000002	train-clean-360	When she returned shortly after nine on Christmas morning the man was dead and cold 
none	none	Medical aid was called in at the same time as the police were summoned and the evidence of the doctor who examined the body went to prove that Berwin had been dead at least ten hours therefore he must have been assassinated between the hours of eleven and twelve of the previous night 
6505_231837_000007_000000	train-clean-360	Search was immediately made for the murderer but no trace could be found of him nor could it be ascertained how he had entered the house The doors were all locked the windows were all barred and neither at the back nor in the front was there any outlet left open whereby the man if it was a man who had done the deed could have escaped 
none	none	Blinders the policeman on duty at the entrance of the square gave evidence that he had been on duty there all night and that although many servants and owners of houses belonging to the square had passed in from their Christmas marketings yet no stranger had entered 
6505_231837_000008_000001	train-clean-360	The policeman knew every one even to the errand boys of the neighbourhood who brought parcels of Christmas goods and in many cases had exchanged greetings with the passers by but he was prepared to swear and in fact did swear at the inquest that no stranger either came into or went out of Geneva Square 
none	none	Also he deposed that when the traffic died away after midnight he had walked round the square and had looked at every window including that of No thirteen and had tried every door also including that of No thirteen only to find that all was safe Blinders declared on oath that he had not on Christmas Eve the slightest suspicion of the horrid tragedy which had taken place in the Silent House during the time he was on duty When the police took possession of the body and mansion search was made in bedroom and sitting room for papers likely to throw light on the identity of the victim but in vain No letters or telegrams or even writing of any kind could be discovered there was no name in the dead man s books no mark on his clothes no initials on his linen The landlord of the house declared that the deceased had hired the mansion six months before but had given no references and as the landlord was glad to let the haunted No thirteen on any terms he had not insisted upon having them The deceased said the landlord had paid a month s rent in advance in ready money and at the end of every month he had discharged his liability in the same way 
6505_231837_000011_000002	train-clean-360	He gave neither cheque nor notes but paid always in gold and beyond the fact that he called himself Mark Berwin the landlord knew nothing about him 
6505_231837_000012_000000	train-clean-360	The firm who had furnished the rooms made almost the same report quite as meagre and unsatisfactory 
none	none	mister Berwin so the deceased had given his name had ordered the furniture and had paid for it in gold Altogether in spite of every effort the police were obliged to declare themselves beaten They could not find out the name of the victim and therefore were unable to learn his past life or trace thereby if he had an enemy likely to harm him Beyond the report given by Lucian of his conversation with the man which showed that Berwin certainly had some enemy whom he dreaded there was nothing discovered to show reason for the committal of the crime 
6505_231837_000014_000000	train-clean-360	Berwin so called was dead he was buried under his assumed name and there so far as the obtainable evidence went was an end to the strange tenant of the Silent House 
6505_231837_000014_000001	train-clean-360	Gordon Link the detective charged with the conduct of the case confessed as much to Denzil 
6505_231837_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 I do not see the slightest chance of tracing Berwin s past said he to the barrister 
none	none	We are as ignorant about him as we are of the name of the assassin
6505_231837_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Are you sure there is no clue mister Link 
6544_231862_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Absolutely 
6505_231837_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Absolutely none even the weapon with which the crime was committed cannot be found 
6505_231837_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 You have searched the house 
6505_231837_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Every inch of it and with the result that I have found nothing 
none	none	The surroundings of the case are most mysterious If we do not identify the dead we cannot hope to trace the murderer How the wretch got into the house is more than I can discover It is strange admitted Lucian thoughtfully yet in some secret way people were in the habit of entering the house and Berwin knew as much not only that but he protected them from curiosity by denying that they even existed I don t quite follow you mister Denzil I allude to the shadows on the blind which I saw myself a week before the murder took place They were those of a man and a woman and must have been cast by bodies of flesh and blood Therefore two people must have been in Berwin s sitting room on that night yet when I met Berwin who was absent at the time he denied that anyone could have entered his house without his knowledge More he actually insisted that I should satisfy myself as to the truth of this by examining the house
6505_231837_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Which you did 
6505_231837_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes but found nothing yet said Lucian with an air of conviction however the man and woman entered they were in the house 
none	none	Then the assassin must have come in by the same way but where that way can be or how it can be found is more than I can say Does the landlord know of any secret passages
6505_231837_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 No I asked him replied the detective but he stated that houses nowadays were not built with secret passages 
none	none	When Berwin denied that anyone was in the house was he afraid mister Denzil Yes he seemed to be nervous And he told you he had enemies He hinted that there were people who wished to see him dead From the way he spoke and the language he used I am satisfied that he was hiding from the vengeance of some one
6505_231837_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Vengeance repeated Link raising his eyebrows 
6505_231837_000031_000001	train-clean-360	 Is not that word a trifle melodramatic 
none	none	Perhaps but to my mind there is more melodrama in actual life than people fancy 
6505_231837_000032_000001	train-clean-360	However mister Link added Lucian I have come to certain conclusions 
none	none	Firstly that Berwin was in hiding secondly that he saw people secretly who entered in some way we cannot discover and thirdly that to solve the problem it will be necessary to look into the past life of the dead man
6505_231837_000033_000000	train-clean-360	 Your third conclusion brings us round to the point whence we started retorted Link 
6505_231837_000033_000001	train-clean-360	 How am I to discover the man s past 
none	none	By learning who he is and what is his real name An easy task said the detective sarcastically considering the meagre material upon which we have to work 
6505_231837_000035_000001	train-clean-360	And how is the business to be accomplished 
6505_231837_000036_000000	train-clean-360	 By advertisement 
6505_231837_000037_000000	train-clean-360	 advertisement 
none	none	Advertisement Yes I wonder the idea did not strike you before seeing how often it is used in similar cases Advertise a full description of the man who called himself Berwin note his physical peculiarities and looks and circulate such description by means of handbills and newspapers Link looked angry and laughed rather contemptuously as his professional pride was touched by the fact of being advised by an individual not of his calling I am not so ignorant of my business as you think he said sharply What you suggest has already been done There are handbills describing the appearance of Berwin in every police office in the kingdom
6505_231837_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 In the newspapers also asked Lucian nettled by the detective s tone 
6505_231837_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 No it is not necessary 
6505_231837_000043_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t agree with you 
none	none	Many people in private life are not likely to see your handbills I don t pretend to advise mister Link he added in soothing tones but would it not be wise to use the medium of the daily papers
6505_231837_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll think of it said Link too jealous of his dignity to give way at once 
none	none	Oh I quite rely on your discretion said Denzil hastily
6505_231837_000045_000001	train-clean-360	 You know your own business best 
6505_231837_000045_000002	train-clean-360	But if you succeed in identifying Berwin will you let me know 
6505_231837_000046_000000	train-clean-360	Link looked keenly at the young man 
6505_231837_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Why do you wish to know about the matter he asked 
6505_231837_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 Out of simple curiosity 
none	none	The case is so mysterious that I should like to watch you unravel it
6505_231837_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 Well said Link rather gratified by this tribute to his power I shall indulge your fancy 
none	none	The result of this conversation was that Lucian observed in the newspapers next day an advertisement describing the looks and name and physical peculiarities of the deceased with special mention of the loss of the left hand s little finger and the strange cicatrice on the right cheek Satisfied that the only way to learn the truth had been adopted by the authorities Lucian impatiently waited for the development of the scheme 
6505_231837_000051_000000	train-clean-360	Within the week he received a visit from the detective 
none	none	You were right and I was wrong mister Denzil admitted Link generously The newspapers were of more use than the handbills Yesterday I received a letter from a lady who is coming to see me to morrow at my office So if you care to be present at the interview you have only to say so I should like it above all things said Lucian eagerly
6505_231837_000053_000001	train-clean-360	 Who is the lady 
6505_231837_000054_000000	train-clean-360	 A missus Vrain who writes from Bath 
6505_231837_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 Can she identify the dead man 
6505_231837_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 She thinks she can but of course she cannot be certain until she sees the body 
none	none	Going by the description however added Link she is inclined to believe that Berwin was her husband 
6505_231838_000003_000000	train-clean-360	CHAPTER VI
none	none	 missus VRAIN S STORY Denzil was much pleased with the courtesy of the detective Link in permitting him to gain at first hand further details of this mysterious case With a natural curiosity engendered by his short acquaintance with the unfortunate Berwin he was most anxious to learn why the man had secluded himself from the world in Geneva Square who were the enemies he hinted at as desirous of his death and in what manner and for what reason he had met with so barbarous a fate at their hands 
6505_231838_000005_000002	train-clean-360	It seemed likely that missus Vrain who asserted herself to be the wife of the deceased would be able to answer these questions in full therefore he was punctual in keeping the appointment at the office of Link 
6505_231838_000006_000000	train-clean-360	He was rather astonished to find that missus Vrain had arrived and was deep in conversation with the detective while a third person who had evidently accompanied her sat near at hand silent but attentive to what was being discussed 
6505_231838_000006_000001	train-clean-360	As the dead man had been close on sixty years of age and missus Vrain claimed to be his wife Denzil had quite expected to meet with an elderly woman 
none	none	Instead of doing so however he beheld a pretty young lady of not more than twenty five whose raiment of widow s weeds set off her beauty to the greatest advantage She was a charming blonde with golden hair and blue eyes and a complexion of rose leaf hue 
6505_231838_000006_000003	train-clean-360	In spite of her grief her demeanour was lively and engaging and her smile particularly attractive lighting up her whole face in the most fascinating manner 
6505_231838_000006_000004	train-clean-360	Her hands and feet were small her stature was that of a fairy and her figure was perfect in every way 
none	none	Altogether missus Vrain looked like a sylph or a dainty shepherdess of Dresden china and should have been arrayed in gossamer robes rather than in the deep mourning she affected Indeed Lucian considered that such weeds were rather premature as missus Vrain could not yet be certain that the murdered man was her husband but she looked so charming and childlike a creature that he forgave her being too eager to consider herself a widow Perhaps with such an elderly husband her eagerness was natural From this charming vision Lucian s eyes wandered to the attentive third person a rosy cheeked plump little man of between fifty and sixty From his resemblance to missus Vrain for he had the same blue eyes and pink and white complexion Lucian guessed that he was her father and such indeed proved to be the case Link on Lucian s entrance introduced him to the sylph in black who in her turn presented him to the silvery haired benevolent old man whom she called mister Jabez Clyne At the first sound of their voices Lucian detected so pronounced a twang and so curious a way of collocating words as to conclude that missus Vrain and her amiable parent hailed from the States The little lady seemed to pride herself on this and indicated her republican origin in her speech more than was necessary at least Denzil thought so 
6505_231838_000009_000002	train-clean-360	But then on occasions he was disposed to be hyper critical 
6505_231838_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Say now said missus Vrain casting an approving glance on Lucian s face I m right down glad to see you 
none	none	mister Link here was just saying you knew my husband mister Vrain
6505_231838_000011_000000	train-clean-360	 I knew him as mister Berwin Mark Berwin replied Denzil taking a seat 
none	none	Just think of that now cried missus Vrain with a liveliness rather subdued in compliment to her apparel and his real name was Mark Vrain Well I guess he won t need no name now poor man and the widow touched her bright eyes carefully with a doll s pocket handkerchief which Lucian noted somewhat cynically was perfectly dry Maybe he s an angel by this time Lyddy said mister Clyne in a cheerful chirping voice so it ain t no use wishing him back as I can see We ve all got to negotiate kingdom come some time or another Not in the same way I hope said Lucian dryly But I beg your pardon Link I interrupt your conversation By no means replied the detective readily We had just begun when you entered mister Denzil And it wasn t much of a talk anyhow said missus Vrain I was only replying to some stupid questions Stupid if you will but necessary observed Link with gravity
6505_231838_000017_000001	train-clean-360	 Let us continue 
none	none	Are you certain that this dead man is or rather was your husband I m as sure as sure can be sir Berwin Manor is the name of our place near Bath and it looks as though my husband called himself after it when he changed his colours 
6505_231838_000018_000002	train-clean-360	And isn t his first name Mark pursued the pretty widow 
6505_231838_000018_000003	train-clean-360	 Well my husband was called Mark too so there you are Mark Berwin 
6505_231838_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 Is this all your proof asked Link calmly 
6505_231838_000057_000000	train-clean-360	 I guess not 
none	none	though it s enough I should say My husband had a mark on his right cheek got it fighting a duel with a German student when he was having a high time as one of the boys at Heidelberg 
6505_231838_000020_000002	train-clean-360	Then he lost part of his little finger left hand finger in an accident out West What other proof do you want mister Link 
6505_231838_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 The proofs you have given seem sufficient missus Vrain but may I ask when your husband left his home 
none	none	About a year ago eh poppa You are overdoing it Lyddy corrected the father Size it up as ten months and you ll do Ten months said Lucian suddenly and mister Berwin
6505_231838_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Vrain struck in Lydia the widow Mark Vrain 
none	none	I beg your pardon 
6505_231838_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Well Mark Vrain took the house in Geneva Square six months back 
6505_231838_000026_000002	train-clean-360	Where was he during the other four 
none	none	Ask me something easier mister Denzil I know no more than you do Did you not know where he went on leaving Berwin Manor Sakes 
6505_231838_000057_000001	train-clean-360	how should I 
none	none	Mark and I didn t pull together nohow so he kicked over the traces and made tracks for the back of beyond And you might square it Lyddy by saying as twasn t you who upset the apple cart Well I should smile to think so said missus Vrain vigorously I was as good as pie to that old man
6505_231838_000032_000000	train-clean-360	 You did not get on well together said Link sharply 
none	none	Got on as well as a cat hitched along with a dog My stars there was no living with him 
6505_231838_000033_000003	train-clean-360	If he hadn t left me I d have left him that s an almighty truth 
none	none	So the gist of all this is that mister Vrain left you ten months ago and did not leave his address That s so said the widow calmly I ve not seen nor heard of him for most a year till pop there tumbled across your paragraph in the papers Then I surmised from the name and the missing finger and the scarred cheek that I d dropped right on to Mark I wouldn t take all this trouble for any one else no sir not me My Lyddy does not care about being a grass widow gentlemen I don t mind being a grass widow or a real one so long as I know how to ticket myself said the candid Lydia but seems to me there s no question that Mark s sent in his checks I certainly think that this man who called himself Berwin was your husband said Denzil for missus Vrain s eyes rested on him and she seemed to expect an answer Well then that means I m mister Vrain s widow I should say so And entitled to all his pile That depends on the will said Lucian dryly for the light tone of the pretty woman jarred upon his ear Oh that s all right replied missus Vrain putting a gold topped smelling bottle to her nose I saw the will made and know exactly how I come out The old man s daughter by his first wife gets the manor and the rents and I take the assurance money
6505_231838_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 Was mister Berwin I beg pardon Vrain was he married twice 
none	none	I should think so said Lydia
6505_231838_000045_000001	train-clean-360	 He was a widower with a grown up daughter when I took him to church 
6505_231838_000045_000002	train-clean-360	Well can I get this assurance money 
6505_231838_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 I suppose so said Link provided you can prove your husband s death 
none	none	Sakes alive cried missus Vrain briskly
6505_231838_000047_000001	train-clean-360	 Wasn t he murdered 
6505_231838_000048_000000	train-clean-360	 The man called Berwin was murdered 
none	none	Well sir said the rosy cheeked Clyne with more sharpness than might have been expected from his peaceful aspect and ain t Berwin Vrain It would seem so replied Link coolly
6505_231838_000050_000001	train-clean-360	 All your evidence goes to prove it yet the assurance company may not be satisfied with the proof I expect the grave will have to be opened and the remains identified 
none	none	Ugh said missus Vrain with a shrug how disgusting I mean she added colouring as she saw that Lucian was rather shocked by her flippancy that sorry as I am for the old man he wasn t a good husband to me and corpses a week old ain t pleasant things to look on Lyddy interposed Clyne hastening to obliterate if possible the impression made on the two men by this foolish speech how you do go on 
6505_231838_000052_000001	train-clean-360	But you know your heart is better than your tongue 
6505_231838_000053_000000	train-clean-360	 It was to put up so long with mister Vrain said Lydia resentfully but I m honest if I m nothing else 
6505_231838_000053_000001	train-clean-360	I guess I m sorry that Vrain got stuck like a pig but it wasn t my fault and I ve done my best to show respect by wearing black 
6505_231838_000053_000002	train-clean-360	But it is no good going on in this way poppa for I ve no call to excuse myself to strangers 
none	none	What I want to know is how I m going to get the dollars You ll have to see the assurance company about that said Link coldly my business with you missus Vrain is about this murder
6505_231838_000055_000000	train-clean-360	 I know nothing about it retorted the widow 
none	none	I haven t set eyes on Mark for most a year
6505_231838_000056_000000	train-clean-360	 Have you any idea who killed him 
none	none	I guess not How should I You might know if he had enemies
6505_231838_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 He said missus Vrain with supreme contempt why he hadn t backbone enough for folks to get riz at him 
6505_231838_000059_000001	train-clean-360	He was half baked 
6505_231838_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Crazy that is remarked Clyne always thought the world was against him and folks wanted to get quit of him 
none	none	He said he had enemies hinted Lucian You bet He no doubt made out that all Europe was against him said Clyne That was my son in law all over Lyddy and he had a tiff just like other married couples and he clears out to lie low in an out of the way shanty in Pimlico I tell you gentlemen that Vrain had a chip out of his head He fancied things he did but no one wanted to harm him that I know of Yet he died a violent death said Denzil gravely
6505_231838_000064_000000	train-clean-360	 That s a frozen fact sir cried Clyne and both Lyddy and I want to lynch the reptile as did it but we neither of us know who laid him out 
none	none	I m sure I don t said missus Vrain in a weeping voice Every one that I knew was civil to him he had no one who wanted to kill him when he left Berwin Manor Why he went away or how he died I can t say
6505_231838_000066_000000	train-clean-360	 If you want to know how he died explained Link I can tell you 
6505_231838_000066_000001	train-clean-360	He was stabbed 
6505_231838_000067_000000	train-clean-360	 So the journals said with a bowie 
6505_231838_000068_000000	train-clean-360	 No not with a bowie corrected Lucian but with some long sharp instrument 
6505_231838_000069_000000	train-clean-360	 A dagger suggested Clyne 
none	none	I should be even more precise said Denzil slowly
6505_231838_000070_000001	train-clean-360	 I should say a stiletto an Italian stiletto 
none	none	A stiletto gasped missus Vrain whose delicate pink colour had faded to a chalky white Oh oh I I and she fainted forthwith CHAPTER VII THE ASSURANCE MONEY missus Vrain s fainting fit was of no great duration and she shortly recovered her senses but not her sprightliness Her excuse was that the long discussion of her husband s murder and the too precise details related to her by Link before Denzil s arrival had so wrought on her nerves as to occasion her temporary indisposition This reason which was a trifle weak since she seemed to bear her husband s loss with great stoicism awakened suspicions in Lucian s mind as to her truthfulness However these were too vague and confused to be put into words so the young man remained silent until missus Vrain and her father departed This they did almost immediately after the widow had given her London and country addresses to the detective in case he should require her in the conduct of the case This matter being attended to she left the room with a parting smile and especial bow to Lucian Link smiled in his turn as he observed this Parthian shaft the shooting of which was certainly out of keeping with missus Vrain s character of a mourning widow You seem to have made an impression on the lady mister Denzil he said with a slight cough to conceal his amusement Nonsense replied Lucian his fair face crimsoning with vexation She seems to me one of those shallow women who would sooner flirt with a tinker than pass unnoticed by the male sex I don t like her he concluded with some abruptness On what grounds Well she spoke very hardly about her husband and seemed rather more concerned about this assurance money than his death She is a flippant doll with a good deal of the adventuress about her I don t think said the barrister significantly that she is altogether so ignorant of this matter as she pretends to be The detective raised his eyebrows You don t propose to accuse her of the murder he asked sceptically Oh no answered Denzil hastily I don t say she is as guilty as all that but she knows something or suspects something How do you make that out She fainted at the mention of stiletto and I am convinced that Vrain as I suppose we must call him now was killed with one And again Link this woman admitted that she had married her elderly husband in Florence Now Florence as you know is an Italian town a stiletto is an Italian weapon Putting these two things together what do you make of missus Vrain s fainting I make nothing of it mister Denzil You are too suspicious The woman had no reason to rid herself of her husband as you hint What about the assurance money There is a motive there certainly a motive of gain Still I think you are making a mountain out of a molehill for I am satisfied that she knows no more who committed the crime than does the Pope himself It is as well to look in every direction said Lucian obstinately Meaning that I should follow this clue you suggest which has no existence save in your own fancy Well I ll keep my eye on missus Vrain you may be sure of that It won t be difficult as she will certainly stay in town until she identifies the body of her dead husband and gets the money If she is guilty I ll track her down but I am certain she has nothing to do with the crime If she had it is not likely that she would enter the lion s den by coming to see me No no mister Denzil you have found a mare s nest Lucian shrugged his shoulders and took up his hat to go You may be right said he reluctantly but I have my doubts of missus Vrain and shall continue to have them until she supplies a more feasible explanation of her fainting In the meantime I ll leave you to follow out the case in the manner you judge best We shall see who is right in the long run and Denzil still holding to his opinion took his departure leaving Link confident that the young man did not know what he was talking about As the detective sat thinking over the late conversation and wondering if he could shape any definite course out of it Denzil put his head in at the door I say Link he called out you d better find out if missus Vrain is really the wife of this dead man before you are guided by her story After which speech he hurriedly withdrew leaving Link to digest it at his leisure At first Link was indignant that Denzil should deem him so easily hoodwinked as the speech implied Afterwards he began to laugh Wife said he to himself Of course she is the man s wife She knows too much about him to be otherwise but even granting that Denzil is right which I don t for a moment admit there is no need for me to prove the truth of his assumption If this pretty woman is not the true wife of Berwin or Vrain or whatever this dead man s name actually may be the assurance company will get at the rights of the matter before paying over the money Subsequent events reflected credit on this philosophical speech and determination of mister Link Had missus Vrain been an imposter her house of cards would have been knocked down as soon as reared by the searching inquiry instituted by the Sirius Assurance Company It appeared that the life of the late Mark Vrain was on the books of the company for no less a sum than twenty thousand pounds and under the will this was to be paid over to Lydia Vrain nee Clyne The widow aided by her father who was a shrewd business man in spite of his innocent looks and the family lawyer of the Vrains went systematically to work to establish her own identity the death of her husband and her consequent right to the money The first thing to be done was to prove that the dead man was really Vrain There was some little difficulty in obtaining an order from the authorities for the opening of the grave and the exhumation of the body but finally the consent of those in power was obtained and there was little difficulty in the identification of the remains The lawyer mister Clyne missus Vrain herself and several people brought up from Bath by the assurance company swore that the corpse buried under the false name of Berwin was that of Mark Vrain for decomposition had not proceeded so far but what the features could be recognised There was even no need to unwrap the body from its cerements as the face itself and the scar thereon were quite sufficient for the friends of the deceased to swear to the corpse Thereupon the assurance company on the fullest of evidence was compelled to admit that their client was dead and expressed themselves ready to pay over the money to missus Vrain as soon as the will should be proved Pending the legal process necessary to do this the widow made a great parade of her grief and affection for the dead man She had the body re enclosed in a new and sumptuous coffin and removed the same to Berwin Manor near Bath where after a short lapse of time it was duly placed in the family vault of the Vrains The widow having thus disposed of her husband bethought herself of her stepdaughter who at that time was on a visit to some friends in Australia A long letter giving full details was despatched by missus Vrain and the daughter was requested both by the widow and the lawyer to come back to England at once and take up her abode in Berwin Manor which with its surrounding acres had been left to her under the will Matters connected with the death and its consequences having been disposed of thus far missus Vrain sat down and folding her hands waited till such time as she would receive the assurance money and begin a new life as a wealthy and fascinating widow Every one said that the little woman had behaved very well and that Vrain weak headed as he was supposed to be had shown excellent judgment in dividing his property real and personal so equally between the two claimants Miss Vrain as became the child of the first wife received the home and acres of her ancestors while the second wife obtained the assurance money which every one candidly admitted she quite deserved for having sacrificed her youth and beauty to an old man like Vrain In those days when all these details were being settled the widow was the most popular personage in Bath Matters went smoothly with missus Vrain in every respect The will was duly proved the twenty thousand pounds was duly paid over so finding herself rich the widow came with her father to take up her abode in London When settled there one of her first acts was to send a note to Lucian telling him that she was in town The good looks of the young man had made a considerable impression on missus Vrain and she appeared anxious to renew the acquaintance although it had been so inauspiciously begun in the purlieus of the police courts On his part Lucian lost no time in paying his respects for after the searching inquiry conducted by the Sirius Assurance Company out of which ordeal missus Vrain had emerged unscathed he began to think that he had been too hasty in condemning the little widow So he called upon her almost immediately after receiving the invitation and found her after the lapse of three months as pretty as ever and clothed in less heavy mourning It s real sweet of you to call mister Denzil said she vivaciously I haven t seen anything of you since we met in mister Link s office And sakes have I not had a heap of trouble since then Your trouble has done you no harm missus Vrain So far as your looks go three minutes rather than three months might have passed Oh that s all right I guess it s not good enough to cry one s self sick for what can t be helped But I want to ask you mister Denzil how that policeman is progressing with the case He has found out nothing replied Lucian shaking his head and so far as I can see there s not much chance of learning the truth I never thought there was said missus Vrain with a shrug Seems to me you don t get round much in this old country Well it don t seem as I can do much more I ve told all I know and I ve offered a reward of Lfive hundred to discover the man who stuck Mark If he ain t found for dollars he won t be found at all Probably not missus Vrain It is now over three months since the crime was committed and every day makes the chance of discovery less But for all that Diana Vrain s going on the trail mister Denzil Diana Vrain Who is she My stepdaughter Mark s only child She was in Australia out in the wild west of that country and only lately got the news of her father s death I got a letter from her last week and it seems as she s coming back here to find out who laid her poppa out I am afraid she ll not succeed said Denzil dubiously She ll do her best to replied missus Vrain with a shrug She s as obstinate as a battery mule but it s no use talking she will have her own way and dismissing the subject of Miss Vrain the pretty widow with an air of relief talked on more frivolous subjects until Lucian took his departure CHAPTER VIII DIANA VRAIN Although over three months had elapsed since the murder of Mark Vrain and the crime had been relegated to oblivion both by press and people curiosity concerning it was still active in Geneva Square The gossips in that talkative quarter had exhausted their tongues and imaginations in surmising who had committed the deed and how it had been accomplished It was now known that the deceased had been of a good county family who had left his pretty young wife in a fit of groundless suspicion that he had no enemies and had withdrawn to the Silent House to save himself from the machinations of purely imaginary beings The general opinion was that Vrain had been insane but even this did not explain the reason of his tragic and unforeseen death Since the murder the Silent House had acquired a tenfold interest in the eyes of all The crime added to its reputation for being haunted invested it with horror and its commonplace looks assumed to fanciful onlookers a grim and menacing aspect in keeping with its blood stained floor and ghostly rooms Disheartened by the late catastrophe which had so greatly enhanced the already evil reputation of the house the landlord did not attempt to relet it as he knew very well that no tenant would be bold enough to take it even at a nominal rent missus Vrain had sold off the furniture of the two apartments which her unfortunate husband had inhabited and now these were as bare and lonely as the rest of the rooms The landlord made no effort to furbish up or renovate the mansion deeming that such expense would be useless so No thirteen deserted by man and cursed by God remained vacant and avoided People came from far and near to look at it but no one entered its doors lest some evil fate should befall them Yet in strange contradiction to the horror it created in every breast the houses on either side continued to be occupied Miss Greeb frequently took a peep across the way at the empty house with its curtainless dusty windows and smokeless chimneys She had theorised often on the murder of Vrain and being unable to come to any reasonable conclusion finally decided that a ghost the ghost which haunted the mansion had committed the crime In support of this fantastic opinion she related to Lucian at least a score of stories in which people foolishly sleeping in haunted rooms had been found dead in the morning With black finger marks on their throats said Miss Greeb dramatically and looks of horror in their eyes and everything locked up just like it was in No thirteen to show that nothing but a ghost could have killed them You forget Miss Greeb said Lucian flippantly poor Vrain was stabbed with a stiletto Ghosts don t use material weapons How do you know the dagger was a real one replied Miss Greeb sinking her voice to a horrified whisper Was it ever seen No Was it ever found No The ghost took it away Depend upon it mister Denzil it wasn t flesh and blood as made a spirit of that crazy Berwin In that case the ghostly criminal can t be hanged said Denzil with a laugh But it s all nonsense Miss Greeb I am astonished that a woman of your sense should believe in such rubbish Wiser people than I have faith in ghosts retorted the landlady obstinately Haven t you heard of the haunted house in a West End square where a man and a dog were found dead in the morning with a valet as gibbered awful ever afterwards Pooh Pooh That s a story of Bulwer Lytton s It is not mister Denzil it s a fact You can see the very house in the square for yourself and No thirteen is just such another Nonsense Why I d sleep in No thirteen to morrow night just to prove that your ghostly fears are all moonshine Miss Greeb uttered a screech of alarm mister Denzil she cried with great energy sooner than you should do that I d I d well I don t know what I d do Accuse me of stealing your silver spoons and have me locked up said Lucian laughing Make yourself easy Miss Greeb I have no intention of tempting Providence All the same I don t believe for one minute that No thirteen is haunted Lights were seen flitting from room to room No doubt Poor Vrain showed me over the house before he died His candle explains the lights They have been seen since his death said Miss Greeb solemnly Then as a ghost Vrain must be walking about with the old woman phantom who wears brocade and high heeled shoes Miss Greeb seeing that she had a sceptic to deal with retreated with great dignity from the argument but nevertheless to other people maintained her opinion with many facts drawn from her imagination and from books on the supernatural compiled from the imagination or as the various writers called it the experience of others Some agreed with her others laughed at her but one and all acknowledged that however it came about whether by ghostly or mortal means the murder of Vrain was a riddle never likely to be solved and with other events of a like nature and mystery it was relegated to the list of undiscovered crimes After several interviews with Link the barrister was also inclined to take this view of the matter He found the detective quite discouraged in his efforts to find the assassin I have been to Bath said Link dismally I have examined so far as I was able into the past life of Vrain but I can find nothing likely to throw light on the subject He did not get on well with his wife and left Bath ten months before the murder I tried to trace where he went to but could not He vanished from Bath quite unexpectedly and four months later turned up in Geneva Square as we know but who killed him or why he was killed I can t say I m afraid I ll have to give it up as a bad job mister Denzil What and lose a reward of five hundred pounds said Lucian If it was five thousand I must lose it returned the dejected Link This case beats me I don t believe the murderer will ever be run down Upon my word I am inclined to agree with you said Denzil and barrister and detective departed each convinced that the Vrain case was ended and that in the face of the insuperable obstacles presented by it there was not the slightest chance of avenging the murder of the unfortunate man The reading of the mystery was beyond mortal powers to accomplish About the middle of April nearly four months after the tragedy Lucian received a letter containing an invitation which caused him no little astonishment The note was signed Diana Vrain and having intimated that the writer had returned only that week from Australia requested that mister Denzil would be kind enough to call the next day at the Royal John Hotel in Kensington Miss Vrain ended by stating that she had a particular desire to converse with mister Denzil and hoped that he would not fail to keep the appointment Wondering greatly how the lady who was no doubt the stepdaughter referred to by missus Vrain had obtained his address and why she desired to see him so particularly Lucian out of sheer curiosity obeyed the summons Next day at four o clock the appointed hour he presented himself as requested and on giving his name was shown immediately into the presence of his correspondent who occupied a small private sitting room When Miss Vrain rose to greet him Lucian was amazed to see how beautiful and stately she was With dark hair and eyes oval face and firm mouth majestic figure and imperial gait she moved towards him an apparent queen A greater contrast to missus Vrain than her stepdaughter can scarcely be imagined the one was a frivolous volatile fairy the other a dignified and reserved woman She also was arrayed in black garments but these were made in the plainest manner and showed none of the coquetry of woe such as had characterised missus Vrain s elaborate costume The look of sorrow on the face of Diana was in keeping with her mourning apparel and she welcomed Lucian with a subdued courtesy which prepossessed him greatly in her favour Quick in his likes and dislikes the young man was as drawn towards this beautiful sad woman as formerly he had been repulsed by the feigned grief and ensnaring glances of silly missus Vrain I am much obliged to you for calling mister Denzil said Miss Vrain in a deep voice rather melancholy in its tone No doubt you wondered how I obtained your address It did strike me as peculiar I confess said Lucian taking a chair to which she pointed but on considering the matter I fancied that missus Vrain had missus Vrain echoed Diana in a tone of contempt No I have not seen missus Vrain since I returned a week ago to London I got your address from the detective who examined into the death of my most unhappy father You have seen Link Yes and I know all that Link could tell me He mentioned your name frequently in his narrative and gave me to understand that on two occasions you had spoken with my father therefore I asked him to give me your address so that I might speak with you personally on the matter I am quite at your service Miss Vrain I suppose you wish to learn all that I know of the tragedy I wish for more than that mister Denzil said Diana quietly I wish you to help me in hunting down the assassin of my father What Do you intend to reopen the case Certainly but I did not know that the case as you call it had been closed I have come home from Australia especially to devote myself to this matter I should have been in London long ago but that out in Australia I was with some friends in a part of the country where it is difficult to get letters As soon as missus Vrain s letter about the terrible end of my father came to hand I arranged my affairs and left at once for England Since my arrival I have seen mister Saker our family lawyer and mister Link the detective They have told me all they know and now I wish to hear what you have to say I am afraid I cannot help you Miss Vrain said Lucian dubiously Ah You refuse to help me Oh no no I shall only be too glad to do what I can protested Lucian shocked that she should think him so hard hearted but I know of nothing likely to solve the mystery Both myself and Link have done our best to discover the truth but without success Well mister Denzil said Diana after a pause they often say that a woman s wit can do more than a man s logic so you and I must put our heads together and discover the guilty person Have you no suspicion No I have no suspicion replied Lucian frankly Have you I have I suspect a lady missus Vrain Yes How do you know I meant her Because at one time I suspected her myself You suspected rightly replied Diana I believe that missus Vrain killed her husband CHAPTER IX A MARRIAGE THAT WAS A FAILURE Denzil did not reply at once to the accusation levelled by Diana at missus Vrain as he was too astonished at her vehemence to find his voice readily When he did speak it was to argue on the side of the pretty widow I think you must be mistaken he said at length But mister Denzil you declared that you suspected her yourself At one time but not now replied Lucian decisively because at the time of the murder missus Vrain was keeping Christmas in Berwin Manor Like Nero fiddling when Rome was burning retorted Diana sharply but you mistake my meaning I do not say that missus Vrain committed the crime personally but she inspired and guided the assassin And who is the assassin in your opinion Count Hercule Ferruci An Italian As you may guess from the name Now that is strange cried Lucian with some excitement for from the nature of the wound I believe that your father was stabbed by an Italian stiletto Aha said Diana with satisfaction That strengthens the accusation I bring against Ferruci And again continued Denzil hardly listening to what she was saying when I mentioned my suspicion about the stiletto in the hearing of missus Vrain she fainted Which showed that her guilty conscience pricked her Oh I am sure of it mister Denzil My stepmother and the count are the criminals Our evidence as yet is only circumstantial said Lucian cautiously We must not jump to conclusions At present I am completely in the dark regarding this foreigner I can enlighten you but it is a long story The longer the better said Denzil thinking he could hear Diana speak and watch her face for hours without weariness I wish for all details then I shall be in a better position to judge What you say is only reasonable mister Denzil I shall tell you my father s history from the time he went to Italy some three years ago It was in Italy to be precise in Florence that he met with Lydia Clyne and her father One moment said Denzil Before you begin will you tell me what you think of the couple Think cried Diana disdainfully I think they are a couple of adventurers but she is the worst of the two The old man Jabez Clyne I think moderately well of he is a weak fool under the thumb of his daughter If you only knew what I have suffered at the hands of that golden haired doll I should think you could hold your own Miss Vrain Not against treachery and lies retorted Diana fiercely It is not my habit to employ such weapons but my stepmother used no others It was she who drove me out of the house and made me exile myself to the Antipodes to escape her falseness And it was she added Miss Vrain solemnly who treated my father so ill as to drive him out of his own home Lydia Vrain is not the doll you think her to be she is a false cruel clever adventuress and I hate her I hate her with all my heart and soul This feminine outburst of anger rather bewildered Denzil who saw very plainly that Diana was by no means the lofty angel he had taken her to be in the first appreciation of her beauty But her passion of the moment suited so well with her stately looks that she seemed rather a Margaret of Anjou defying York and his faction than an injured woman concerned with so slight a thing as the rebuke of one of her own sex for whom she had little love Diana saw the surprise expressed on Lucian s face and her own flushed a little with annoyance that she should have betrayed her feelings so openly With a vexed laugh she recovered her temper and composed demeanour You see I am no saint mister Denzil she said resuming her seat for in her anger she had risen to her feet But even if I were one I could not have restrained myself from speaking as I did When you know my stepmother as well as I do but I must talk calmly about her or you will not understand my reasons for thinking her concerned in the terrible fate of my poor father I am all attention Miss Vrain I ll tell you all I know as concisely as possible she replied and you can judge for yourself if I am right or wrong Three years ago my father s health was very bad Since the death of my mother now some ten years he had devoted himself to hard study and had lived more or less the life of a recluse in Berwin Manor He was writing a history of the Elizabethan dramatists and became so engrossed with the work that he neglected his health and consequently there was danger that he might suffer from brain fever The doctors ordered him to leave his books and to travel in order that his attention might be distracted by new scenes and new people I was to go with him to see that he did not resume his studies so in an evil hour for us both we went to Italy Your father was not mad said Lucian thinking of the extraordinary behaviour of Vrain in the square Oh no cried Diana indignantly He was a trifle weak in the head from overwork but quite capable of looking after himself Did he indulge in strong drink Miss Vrain looked scandalised My father was singularly abstemious in eating and drinking she said stiffly Why do you ask such a question I beg your pardon replied Lucian with all humility but it was reported in Geneva Square that Berwin the name by which your father was known drank too much and when I met him he was certainly not not quite himself finished the barrister delicately No doubt his troubles drove him to take more than was good for him said Diana in a low voice Yet I wonder at it for his health was none of the best Sometimes I admit he took sleeping draughts and and drugs He was consumptive said Lucian noticing Diana s hesitation to speak plainly His chest was weak and consumption may have developed itself but when I left England almost two years back he was certainly not suffering from that disease But I see how it is said Diana wringing her hands During my short absence and under the tyranny of his wife his physical health and moral principles gave way Drink and consumption Ah God were not these ills enough but what the woman must add murder to cap them both We do not know yet if she is guilty said Lucian quietly Will you go on with your story Miss Vrain Later on we can discuss these matters when I am in possession of the facts You say it was an evil hour when you went to Italy It was indeed said Diana sorrowfully for in Florence at the Pension Donizetti on the Lung Arno we met with Lydia Clyne and her father They had only lately arrived in Italy from New York I suppose but already she was said to be engaged to a needy Italian nobleman named Hercule Ferruci Then I suppose the Clynes were rich said Lucian for I know those Italian nobles too well to suspect that this Count Ferruci would pay attention to any one but an heiress She was supposed to be rich mister Denzil All Americans for some reason are supposed to be millionaires but after she married my father I learned that mister Clyne had a very moderate fortune indeed and his daughter nothing It was for that reason that Lydia threw over the count to whom she was almost engaged and began to pay attention to my father She heard talk of his estates in the gossip of the Pension and believing him to be rich she decided to marry him instead of throwing herself away in a romantic fit on Ferruci Did she love this Italian Yes I am sure she did and what is more she loves him still What Is Count Ferruci still acquainted with missus Vrain He is as you shall hear Miss Clyne as I said determined to make a rich marriage by becoming the second missus Vrain I never liked her knowing that she was false and frivolous but though I did my best to stop the marriage my father would not be controlled You know that this woman is pretty and fascinating She is certainly the first but not the last interposed Lucian At all events resumed Diana disconsolately she was sufficiently fascinating to snare my poor foolish old father We remained four months in Florence and before we left it Lydia Clyne became missus Vrain I could do nothing with my father as he was possessed of the headstrong passion of an old man and moreover Lydia had learned to know his weak points so well that she could twist him round her finger But angered as I was at my father s folly I loved him too well to leave him at the time therefore I returned to Berwin Manor with the pair There mister Denzil continued Miss Vrain her face growing dark Lydia made my life so wretched and insulted me so openly that I was forced out of self respect to leave the house I had some relatives in Australia to whom I went out on a visit Alas I wish I had not done so yet remain with my colonial cousins I did until recalled to England by the terrible intelligence of my father s untimely end So the marriage was a failure Yes even before I left Lydia openly neglected my father I am bound to say that mister Clyne who is much the better of the two tried to make her conduct herself in a more becoming manner But she defied him and every one else After my departure I received letters from a friend of mine who told me that Lydia had invited Count Ferruci over on a visit My father finding that he could do nothing and seeing what a mistake he had made returned to his books and soon became ill again Instead of looking after him Lydia as I heard encouraged him to study hard hoping no doubt that he would die and that she would be free to marry Count Ferruci Then my father left the house Why That is a very necessary detail Diana thought for a moment then shook her head despondingly That I cannot explain she said with a sigh as I was in Australia at the time But I expect that his brain grew weaker with study and perhaps with the strong drink and drugs which this woman drove him to take No doubt the poor man grew jealous of Ferruci and unable to assert himself seeing how ill he was left the house and retired to Geneva Square to meet his death as we know But all this is supposition remonstrated Lucian We really do not know why mister Vrain left the house What does Lydia say She gives no feasible explanation Nor will she Oh cried Diana is there no way of getting at the truth of this matter I feel certain that Lydia and the Count are guilty You have no proofs said Denzil shaking his head No proofs Why you said yourself that a stiletto That is a supposition on my part interrupted Lucian quickly I cannot say for certain that the deed was committed with such a weapon Besides if it was how can you connect the Italian with the deed Can we not find a proof I fear not But if we search the house There is little use in doing that rejoined Lucian However if it will give you any satisfaction Miss Vrain I will take you over the house to morrow morning Do cried Diana and we may find proof of Lydia s guilt in a way she little dreams of Good bye mister Denzil till to morrow CHAPTER X THE PARTI COLOURED RIBBON The beauty and high spirit of Diana made so deep an impression on Lucian that he determined to aid her by every means in his power in searching for the assassin of her father As yet Denzil had reached the age of twenty five without having been attracted in any marked degree towards woman kind or to put it more precisely he had not yet been in love But now it seemed that the hour which comes to all of Adam s sons had come to him for on leaving Diana he thought of nothing else but her lovely face and charming smile and until he met her again her image was never absent from his mind He took but a languid interest in his daily business or social pursuits and wrapped up in inwardly contemplating the beauties of Diana he appeared to move amongst his fellow men like one in a dream And dreamer he was for there was no substantial basis for his passion Many people particularly those without imagination scoff at the idea that love can be born in a moment but such is often the case for all their ill advised jibes A man may be brought into contact with the loveliest and most brilliant of women yet remain heart whole yet unexpectedly a face not always the most beautiful will fire him with sudden fervour even against his better judgment Love is not an affair of reason to be clipped and measured by logic and calculation but a devouring destroying passion impatient of restraint and utterly regardless of common sense It is born of a look of a smile of a sigh of a word it springs up and fructifies more speedily than did Jonah s gourd and none can say how it begins or how it will end It is the ever old ever new riddle of creation and the more narrowly its mystery is looked into the more impossible does it become of solution The lover of to day with centuries of examples at his back is no wiser in knowledge than was his father Adam Although Lucian was thus stricken mad after the irrational methods of Cupid he had sufficient sense not to examine too minutely into the reasons for this sudden passion He was in love and admitting as much to himself there was an end of all argument The long lane of his youthful and loveless life had turned in another direction at the signpost of a woman s face and down the new vista the lover saw flowering meadows silver streams bowers of roses and all the landscape of Arcadia He was a piping swain and Diana a complaisant shepherdess but they had not yet entered into the promised Arcadia and might never do so unless Diana was as kindly as he wished her to be Lucian was in love with Diana but as yet he could not flatter himself that she was in love with him so he resolved to win her affection if it was free to be bestowed by doing her will and her will was to revenge the death of her father This was hardly a pleasant task to Lucian in his then peace with all the world frame of mind but seeing no other way to gain a closer intimacy with the lady of his love he took the bitter with the sweet and set his shoulder to the wheel The next morning therefore Lucian called on the landlord of No thirteen and requested the keys of the house But it appeared that these were not in the landlord s keeping at the moment I gave them to missus Kebby the charwoman said mister Peacock a retired grocer who owned the greater part of the square The house is in such a state that I thought I d have it cleaned up a bit With a view to a possible tenant I suppose I don t know replied Peacock with a rueful shake of his bald head although I m hoping against hope But what with the murder and the ghost there don t seem much chance of letting it What might you be wanting in No thirteen mister Denzil I wish to examine every room to find if possible a clue to this crime explained Lucian suppressing the fact that he was to have a companion You ll find nothing sir I ve looked into every room myself However you ll find missus Kebby cleaning up and she ll let you in if you ring the bell You aren t thinking of taking the house yourself I suppose added Peacock wishfully No thank you My nerves are in good order just now I don t want to upset them by inhabiting a house with so evil a reputation Ah that s what every one says sighed the grocer I wish that Berwin or Vrain or whatever he called himself had chosen some other place to be killed in I m afraid people who meet with unexpected deaths can t arrange these little matters beforehand said Lucian drily and walked away leaving the unfortunate landlord still lamenting over his unlucky possession of a haunted and blood stained mansion Before going to No thirteen Lucian walked down the street leading into Geneva Square in order to meet Diana who was due at eleven o clock Punctual as the barrister was he found that Miss Vrain in her impatience was before him for he arrived to see her dismiss her cab at the end of the street and met her half way down His heart gave a bound as he saw her graceful figure and he felt the hot blood rise to his cheeks as he advanced to meet her Diana quite unconscious of having like her namesake the moon caused this springtide of the heart could not forbear a glance of surprise but greeted her coadjutor without embarrassment and with all friendliness Her thoughts were too taken up with her immediate task of exploring the scene of the crime to waste time in conjecturing the reason of the young man s blushes Yet the instinct of her sex might have told her the truth and probably it would have but that it was blunted or rather not exercised by reason of her preoccupation Have you the key mister Denzil said she eagerly No but I have seen the landlord and he has given us permission to go over the house A charwoman who is cleaning up the place will let us in A charwoman repeated Miss Vrain stopping short and cleaning up the house Is it then about to receive a new tenant Oh no but the landlord wishes it to be aired and swept to keep it in some degree of order I presume What is the name of this woman missus Kebby The same mentioned in the newspaper reports as having waited on my unhappy father The same replied Lucian with some hesitation but I would advise you Miss Vrain not to question her too closely about your father Why not Ah I see you think her answers about his drinking habits will give me pain No matter I am prepared for all that I don t blame him so much as those who drove him to intemperance Is this the house she said looking earnestly at the neglected building before which they were standing Yes replied Lucian ringing the bell it was in this house that your father came to his untimely end And here is missus Kebby That amiable crone had opened the door while the young man was speaking and now stood eyeing her visitors with a blear eyed look of dark suspicion What is t ye want she demanded with a raven like croak mister Peacock has given this lady and myself permission to go over the house responded Lucian trying to pass And how do I know if he did grumbled missus Kebby blocking the way Because I tell you so And because I am the daughter of mister Vrain said Diana stepping forward Lord love ye miss are ye croaked missus Kebby stepping aside And ye ve come to look at your pa s blood I ll be bound Diana turned pale and shuddered but controlling herself by an effort of will she swept past the old woman and entered the sitting room Is this the place she asked Lucian who was holding the door open That it is miss cried the charwoman who had hobbled after them and yonder is the poor gentleman s blood it soaked right through the carpet added missus Kebby with ghoulish relish Lor ow it must ave poured out Hold your tongue woman said Lucian roughly seeing that Diana looked as though about to faint Get on with your work I m going it s upstairs I m sweeping growled the crone retreating You ll bring me to you if ye give a holler I ll show ye round for a shilling You shall have double if you leave us alone said Lucian pointing to the door missus Kebby s blear eyes lighted up and she leered amiably at the couple I dessay it s worth two shillings she said chuckling hoarsely Oh I m not so old but what I don t know two turtle doves He he To kiss over yer father s blood Lawks what a match twill be He he Still laughing hoarsely missus Kebby in the midst of her unholy joy was pushed out of the door by Lucian who immediately afterwards turned to see if Diana had overheard her ill chosen and ominous words But Miss Vrain with a hard white face was leaning against the wall and gave no sign of such knowledge Her eyes were fixed on a dull looking red stain of a dark hue irregular in shape and her hands the while were pressed closely against her bosom as though she felt a cruel pain in her heart With bloodless cheek and trembling lip the daughter looked upon the evidence of her father s death Lucian was alarmed by her unnatural pallor Miss Vrain he exclaimed starting forward you are ill Let me lead you out of this house No said Diana waving him back Not till we examine every inch of it don t speak to me please I wish to use my eyes rather than my tongue Denzil both as a lover and a friend respected this emotion of the poor young lady so natural under the circumstances and in silence conducted her from room to room All were empty and still dusty for missus Kebby s broom swept sufficiently light and the footfalls of the pair echoed hollowly in the vast spaces Diana looked into every corner examined every fireplace attempted every window but in no place could she find any extraneous object likely to afford a clue to the crime They went down into the basement and explored the kitchen the servant s parlour the scullery and the pantry but with the same unsatisfactory result The kitchen door which led out into the back yard showed signs of having been lately opened but when Diana drew Lucian s attention to this fact as the murderer having possibly entered thereby he assured her that it had only lately been opened by the detective Link when he was searching for clues I saw this door added Lucian striking it with his cane a week before your father was killed He showed it to me himself to prove that no one could have entered the house during his absence and I was satisfied then from the rusty condition of the bolts and the absence of the key in the lock that the door had not been opened at all events during his tenancy Then how could those who killed him have entered That is what I wish to learn Miss Vrain But why do you speak in the plural Because I believe that Lydia and Ferruci killed my father But I have proved to you that missus Vrain remained at Bath I know it replied Diana quickly but she sent Ferruci up to kill my father and I speak in the plural because I think in a moral sense she is as guilty as the Italian That may be Miss Vrain but as yet we have not proved their guilt Diana made no answer but followed by Lucian ascended to the upper part of the house where they found missus Kebby sweeping so vigorously that she had raised a kind of dust storm As soon as she saw the couple she hobbled towards them to cajole them if possible into giving her money For a few moments Diana looked at her haughtily not relishing the familiarity of the old dame but unexpectedly she stepped forward with a look of excitement Where did you get that ribbon she asked missus Kebby pointing to a scrap of personal adornment on the neck of the rusty old creature This croaked missus Kebby I picked it up in the kitchen downstairs It s a pretty red and yaller thing but of no value miss so I don t s pose you ll take it orf me Paying no attention to this whimpering Diana twitched the ribbon out of the old woman s hands and examined it It was a broad yellow ribbon of rich silk spotted with red very noticeably and evidently of foreign manufacture It is the same cried Diana greatly excited mister Denzil I bought this ribbon myself in Florence Well said Lucian wondering at her excitement and what does that prove This that a stiletto which my father bought in Florence at the same time has been used to kill him I tied this ribbon myself round the handle of the stiletto CHAPTER XI FURTHER DISCOVERIES The silence which followed Diana s announcement regarding the ribbon and stiletto for Lucian kept silence out of sheer astonishment was broken by the hoarse voice of missus Kebby If ye want the ribbon miss I ll not say no to a shilling With what your good gentleman promised that will be three as I m ready to take and missus Kebby held out a dirty claw for the silver You ll sell it will you cried out Diana indignantly pouncing down on the harridan How dare you keep what isn t yours If you had shown the detective this shaking the ribbon in missus Kebby s face he might have caught the criminal Pardon me interposed Lucian finding his voice I hardly think so Miss Vrain for no one but yourself could have told that the ribbon adorned the stiletto Where did you see the weapon last In the library at Berwin Manor I hung it up on the wall myself by this ribbon Are you sure it is the same ribbon I am certain replied Diana emphatically I cannot be mistaken the colour and pattern are both peculiar Where did you find it she added turning to missus Kebby In the kitchen I tell ye growled the old woman sullenly I only found it this blessed morning Twas in a dark corner near the door as leads down to the woodshed How was I to know twas any good Did you find anything else asked Lucian mildly No I didn t sir Not a stiletto demanded Diana putting the ribbon in her pocket I don t know what s a stiletter miss but I didn t find nothing and I ain t a thief though some people as sets themselves above others by taking ribbons as doesn t belong to em mayn t be much good The ribbon is not yours said Diana haughtily Yes it are Findings is keepings with me answered missus Kebby Don t anger her whispered Denzil touching Miss Vrain s arm We may find her useful Diana looked from him to the old woman and opened her purse at the sight of which missus Kebby s sour face relaxed When Miss Vrain gave her half a sovereign she quite beamed with joy The blessing of heaven on you my dear she said with a curtsey Gold good gold Ah this is a brave day s work for me thirteen blessed shillings Ten you mean missus Kebby Oh no sir cried missus Kebby obsequiously the lady gave me ten bless her heart but you ve quite forgot your three I said two Ah so you did sir I m a poor schollard at rithmetic You re clever enough to get money out of people said Diana who was disgusted at the avarice of the hag However for the present you must be content with what I have given you If in cleaning this house you find any other article whatever it may be you shall have another ten shillings on consideration that you take it at once to mister Denzil missus Kebby who was tying up the piece of gold in the corner of her handkerchief nodded her old head with much complacency I ll do it miss that is if the gentleman will pay on delivery I like cash You shall have cash said Lucian laughing and then as Diana intimated her intention of leaving the house he descended the stairs in her company Miss Vrain kept silence until they were outside in the sunshine when she cast an upward glance at the warm blue sky dappled with light clouds I am glad to be out of that house she said with a shudder There is something in its dark and freezing atmosphere which chills my spirits It is said to be haunted you know said Lucian carelessly then after a pause he spoke on the subject which was uppermost in his mind Now that you have this piece of evidence Miss Vrain what do you intend to do Make sure that I have made no mistake mister Denzil I shall go down to Berwin Manor this afternoon If the stiletto is still hanging on the library wall by its ribbon I shall admit my mistake if it is absent why then I shall return to town and consult with you as to what is best to be done You know I rely on you I shall do whatever you wish Miss Vrain said Lucian fervently It is very good of you replied the lady gratefully For I have no right to take up your time in this manner You have every right that is I mean I mean stammered Denzil thinking from the surprised look of Miss Vrain that he had gone too far at so early a stage of their acquaintance I mean that as a briefless barrister I have ample time at my command and I shall only be too happy to place it and myself at your service And moreover he added in a lighter tone I have some selfish interest in the matter also for it is not every one who finds so difficult a riddle as this to solve I shall never rest easy in my mind until I unravel the whole of this tangled skein How good you are cried Diana impulsively extending her hand It is as impossible for me to thank you sufficiently now for your kindness as it will be to reward you hereafter should we succeed As to my reward said Lucian retaining her hand longer than was necessary we can decide what I merit when your father s death is avenged Diana coloured and turned away her eyes withdrawing her hand in the meantime from the too warm clasp of the young man A sense of his meaning was suddenly borne in upon her by look and clasp and she felt a maidenly confusion at the momentary boldness of this undeclared lover However with feminine tact she laughed off the hint and shortly afterwards took her leave promising to communicate as speedily as possible with Lucian regarding the circumstances of her visit to Bath The barrister wished to escort her back to the Royal John Hotel in Kensington but Miss Vrain guessing his feelings would not permit this so Lucian hat in hand was left standing in Geneva Square while his divinity drove off in a prosaic hansom With her went the glory of the sunlight the sweetness of the spring and Denzil more in love than ever sighed hugely as he walked slowly back to his lodgings For doleful moods hard work and other interests are the sole cure therefore that same afternoon Lucian returned to explore the Silent House on his own account It had struck him as suggestive that the parti coloured ribbon to which Diana attached such importance should have been found in so out of the way a corner as the threshold of the door which conducted to what missus Kebby with characteristic misrepresentation called the woodshed In reality the place in question was a cellar which extended under the soil of the back yard and was lighted from the top by a skylight placed on a level with the ground On being admitted again by missus Kebby and sending that ancient female to her Augean task of cleansing the house Lucian descended to the basement in order to examine kitchen and cellar more particularly If as Diana stated the ribbon had been knotted loosely about the hilt of the stiletto it must have fallen off unnoticed by the assassin when weapon in hand he was retreating from the scene of crime He must have come down here from the sitting room mused Denzil as he stood in the cool damp kitchen And as the ribbon was found by missus Kebby near yonder door it is most probable that he left the kitchen by that passage for the cellar Now it remains for me to find out how he made his exit from the cellar and also I must look for the stiletto which he possibly dropped in his flight as he did the ribbon While thus soliloquising Denzil lighted a candle which he had taken the precaution to bring with him for the purpose of making his underground explorations Having thus provided himself with means to dispel the darkness he stepped into the door and descended the stone stairs which led to the cellars At the foot of the steps he found himself in a passage running from the front to the back of the house and forthwith turned to the right in order to reach the particular cellar which was dug out in the manner of a cave under the back yard This as Lucian ascertained by walking round was faced with stone and had bins on all four sides for the storage of wine Overhead there was a glass skylight of which the glass was so dusty and dirty that only a few rays of light could struggle into the murky depths below But what particularly attracted the attention of Denzil was a short wooden ladder lying on the stone pavement and which probably was used to reach the wine in the upper bins And I should not be surprised if it had been used for another purpose murmured Lucian glancing upward at the square aperture of the skylight It struck him as possible that a stranger could enter thereby and descend by the ladder To test the truth of this he reared the ladder in the middle of the cellar so that its top rung rested against the lower edge of the square overhead Ascending carefully for the ladder was by no means stout he pushed the glass frame upward and found that it yielded easily to a moderate amount of strength Climbing up step after step Lucian arose through the aperture like a genie out of the earth and soon found that he could jump easily out of the cellar into the yard Good he exclaimed much gratified by this discovery I now see how the assassin entered No wonder the kitchen door was bolted and barred and that no one was seen to visit Vrain by the front door Any one who knew the position of that skylight could obtain admission easily at any hour by descending the ladder and passing through cellar and kitchen to the upper part of the house So much is clear but I must next discover how those who entered got into this yard And indeed there seemed no outlet for the yard was enclosed on three sides by a fence of palings the height of a man and rendered impervious to damp by a coating of tar on the fourth side by the house itself Only over the fence which was no insuperable obstacle could a stranger have gained access to the yard and towards the fence opposite to the house Lucian walked In it there was no gate or opening of any kind so it would appear that to come into the yard a stranger would need to climb over a feat easily achieved by a moderately active man As Denzil examined this frail barrier his eye was caught by a fluttering object on the left that is the side in a line with the skylight This he found was the scrap of a woman s veil of thin black gauze spotted with velvet At once his thoughts reverted to the shadow of the woman on the blind and the suspicions of Diana Vrain Great heavens he thought can that doll of a Lydia be guilty after all CHAPTER XII THE VEIL AND ITS OWNER As may be surmised Lucian was considerably startled by the discovery of this important evidence so confirmative of Diana s suspicions Yet the knowledge which Link had gained relative to missus Vrain s remaining at Berwin Manor to keep Christmas 
5765-231844-0000	train-other-500	seemed to contradict the fact and he could by no means reconcile her absence with the presence on the fence of the fragment of gauze still less with the supposition that she must have climbed over a tolerably difficult obstacle to enter the yard let alone the necessity by no means easy to a woman
5765-231844-0001	train-other-500	of descending into the disused cellar by means of a shaky and fragile ladder After all thought Lucian when he was seated that same evening at his dinner
5765-231844-0002	train-other-500	I am no more certain that the veil is the property of missus Vrain than I am that she was the woman whose shadow I saw on the blind Whosoever it was that gained entrance by passing over fence and through cellar must have come across the yard belonging to the house facing the other road
5765-231844-0003	train-other-500	Therefore the person must be known to the owner of that house and I must discover who the owner is Miss Greeb will know Lucian made this last remark with the greatest confidence as he was satisfied from a long acquaintance with his landlady
5765-231844-0004	train-other-500	that there was very little concerning her own neighbourhood of which she was ignorant The result verified his belief for when Miss Greeb came in to clear the table a duty she invariably undertook so as to have a chance of conversing with her admired lodger
5765-231844-0005	train-other-500	she was able to afford him the fullest information on the subject The position of the house in question the name of its owner the character of its tenants she was thoroughly well posted up in every item and willingly imparted her knowledge with much detail and comment
5765-231844-0006	train-other-500	No nine Jersey Street said she unhesitatingly that is the number of the house at the back of the haunted mansion mister Denzil I know it as well as I know my ten fingers To whom does it belong asked Lucian mister Peacock
none	none	 he owns most of the property round about here 
5765-231844-0007	train-other-500	having bought up the land when the place was first built on He s seventy years of age you know mister Denzil continued Miss Greeb conversationally and rich
none	none	 Lord I don t know how rich he is 
5765-231844-0008	train-other-500	Building houses cheap and letting them dear he has made more out of that than in sanding his sugar and chicorying his coffee He What is the name of the tenant interrupted Lucian cutting short this rapid sketch of Peacock s life missus Bensusan
5765-231844-0009	train-other-500	one of the largest women hereabouts I don t quite understand Fat mister Denzil
none	none	 She turns the scale at eighteen stone and has pretty well broke every weighing machine in the place 
5765-231844-0010	train-other-500	What reputation has she Miss Greeb Oh pretty good said the little woman shrugging her shoulders though they do say she overcharges and underfeeds her lodgers She keeps a boarding house then Well she lets rooms
none	none	 explained Miss Greeb in a very definite manner 
5765-231844-0011	train-other-500	and those who live in them supply their own food and pay for service and kitchen fire Who is with her now No one replied the landlady promptly
none	none	 She s had her bill up these three months 
5765-231844-0012	train-other-500	Her last lodger left about Christmas What is his name or her name Oh it was a he said Miss Greeb smiling missus Bensusan prefers gentlemen who are out of doors all day to ladies muddling and meddling all day about the house I must say I do too mister Denzil
5765-231844-0013	train-other-500	ended the lady with a fascinating glance What is his name Miss Greeb repeated Lucian quite impervious to the hint Let me see said Miss Greeb discomfited at the result of her failure
5765-231844-0014	train-other-500	A queer name that had to do with payments Bill as the short for William
none	none	 No it wasn t that although it does suggest an account 
5765-231844-0015	train-other-500	Quarterday No But it had something to do with quarter days Rent finished Miss Greeb triumphantly Rent with a W before it W r e n t spelled Lucian Yes Wrent mister Wrent
5765-231844-0016	train-other-500	A strange name mister Denzil a kind of charade as I may say He was with missus Bensusan six months
none	none	 came to her house about the time mister Berwin hired No thirteen 
5765-231844-0017	train-other-500	Very strange assented Lucian to stop further comment What kind of a man was this mister Wrent I don t know I never heard much about him replied Miss Greeb regretfully
none	none	 May I ask why you want to know all this mister Denzil 
5765-231844-0018	train-other-500	Lucian hesitated as he rather dreaded the chattering tongue of his landlady and did not wish his connection with the Vrain case to become public property in Geneva Square Still Miss Greeb was a valuable ally if only for her wide acquaintance with the neighbourhood
5765-231844-0019	train-other-500	its inhabitants and their doings Therefore after a moment s reflection he resolved to secure Miss Greeb as a coadjutor and risk her excessive garrulity Can you keep a secret Miss Greeb he asked with impressive solemnity
none	none	 Struck by his serious air and at once on fire with curiosity to learn its reason Miss Greeb loudly protested that she should sooner die than breathe a word of what her lodger was about to divulge She hinted 
5765-231844-0020	train-other-500	with many a mysterious look and nod that secrets endangering the domestic happiness of every family in the square were known to her and appealed to the fact that such families still lived in harmony as a proof that she was to be trusted Wild horses wouldn t drag out of me what I know
5765-231844-0021	train-other-500	cried Miss Greeb earnestly You can confide in me as you would in a she was about to say mother but recollecting her juvenile looks substituted the word sister Very good said Lucian
5765-231844-0022	train-other-500	explaining just as much as would serve his purpose Then I may tell you Miss Greeb that I suspect the assassin of mister Vrain entered through missus Bensusan s house
none	none	 and so got into the yard of No thirteen Lord 
5765-231844-0023	train-other-500	cried Miss Greeb taken by surprise
none	none	 You don t say sir that mister Wrent is a murdering villain steeped in gore 
5765-231844-0024	train-other-500	No No replied Lucian smiling at this highly coloured description Do not jump to conclusions Miss Greeb So far as I am aware this mister Wrent you speak of is innocent Do you know missus Bensusan and her house well
5765-231844-0025	train-other-500	I ve visited both several times mister Denzil Well then tell me continued the barrister is the house built with a full frontage like those in this square I mean to gain missus Bensusan s back yard is it necessary to go through missus Bensusan s house
5765-231844-0026	train-other-500	No replied Miss Greeb shutting her eyes to conjure up the image of her friend s premises You can go round the back through the side passage which leads in from Jersey Road
none	none	 H m 
5765-231844-0027	train-other-500	said Lucian in a dissatisfied tone That complicates matters How so sir demanded the curious landlady Never mind just now Miss Greeb
none	none	 Do you think you could draw me a plan of this passage of missus Bensusan s house 
5765-231844-0028	train-other-500	and of No thirteen with the yards between I never could sketch said Miss Greeb regretfully and I am no artist mister Denzil but I think I can do what you want Here is a sheet of paper and a pencil Will you sketch me the houses as clearly as you can
5765-231844-0029	train-other-500	With much reflection and nibbling of the pencil and casting of her eyes up to the ceiling to aid her memory Miss Greeb in ten minutes produced the required sketch There you are mister Denzil said Miss Greeb
5765-231844-0030	train-other-500	placing this work of art before the barrister that s as good as I can draw It is excellent Miss Greeb replied Lucian examining the plan I see that anyone can get into missus Bensusan s yard through the side passage Oh yes
5765-231844-0031	train-other-500	but I don t think a person could without being seen by missus Bensusan or Rhoda Who is Rhoda The servant She s as sharp as a needle but an idle slut for all that mister Denzil They say she s a gypsy of some kind Is the gate of this passage locked at night
5765-231844-0032	train-other-500	Not that I know of Then what is to prevent any one coming in under cover of darkness and climbing the fence He would escape then being seen by the landlady and her servant I daresay
none	none	 but he d be seen climbing over the fence from the back windows of the houses on each side of No thirteen 
5765-231844-0033	train-other-500	Not if he chose a dark night for the climbing
none	none	 Well even if he did how could he get into No thirteen argued Miss Greeb 
5765-231844-0034	train-other-500	You know I ve read the report of the case mister Denzil
none	none	 and it couldn t be found out as the kitchen door was locked and no stranger entered the square 
5765-231844-0035	train-other-500	how the murdering assassin got in I may discover even that replied Lucian not choosing to tell Miss Greeb that he had already discovered the entrance With time and inquiry and observation we can do much Thank you Miss Greeb he continued
5765-231844-0036	train-other-500	slipping the drawing of the plan into his breast coat pocket
none	none	 I am much obliged for your information 
5765-231844-0037	train-other-500	Of course you ll repeat our conversation to no one I swear to breathe no word said Miss Greeb dramatically and left the room greatly pleased with this secret understanding
5765-231844-0038	train-other-500	which had quite the air of an innocent intrigue such as was detailed in journals designed for the use of the family circle For the next day or two Lucian mused over the information he had obtained and made a fresh drawing of the plan for his own satisfaction
5765-231844-0039	train-other-500	but he took no steps on this new evidence as he was anxious to submit his discoveries to Miss Vrain before doing so At the present time Diana was at Bath taking possession of her ancestral acres and consulting the family lawyer on various matters connected with the property
5765-231844-0040	train-other-500	Once she wrote to Lucian advising him that she had heard several pieces of news likely to be useful in clearing up the mystery but these she refused to communicate save at a personal interview Denzil was thus kept in suspense
5765-231844-0041	train-other-500	and unable to rest until he knew precisely the value of Miss Vrain s newly acquired information therefore it was with a feeling of relief that he received a note from her asking him to call at three o clock on Sunday at the Royal John Hotel Since her going and coming
5765-231844-0042	train-other-500	a week had elapsed Now that his divinity had returned and he was about to see her again the sun shone once more in the heavens for Lucian and he arrayed himself for his visit with the utmost care
none	none	 His heart beat violently and his colour rose as he was ushered into the little sitting room 
5765-231844-0043	train-other-500	and he thought less of the case at the moment than of the joy in seeing Miss Vrain once more in hearing her speak and watching her lovely face On her part Diana recollecting their last meeting or more particularly their parting blushed in her turn
5765-231844-0044	train-other-500	and gave her hand to the barrister with a new born timidity She also was inclined to like Lucian more than was reasonable for the peace of her heart so these two people each drawn to the other should have come together as lovers even at this second meeting But alas
5765-231844-0045	train-other-500	for the prosaicness of this workaday world they had to assume the attitudes of lawyer and client and discourse of crime instead of love The situation was a trifle ironical and must have provoked the laughter of the gods Well asked Miss Vrain
5765-231844-0046	train-other-500	getting to business as soon as Lucian was seated and what have you found out A great deal likely to be of service to us And you I replied Miss Vrain in a satisfied tone I have discovered that the stiletto with the ribbon is gone from the library Who took it away
5765-231844-0047	train-other-500	No one knows I can t find out although I asked all the servants but it has been missing from its place for some months
none	none	 Do you think missus Vrain took it 
5765-231844-0048	train-other-500	I can t say replied Diana but I have made one discovery about missus Vrain which implicates her still more in the crime She was not in Berwin Manor on Christmas Eve but in town Really said Lucian much amazed
5765-231844-0049	train-other-500	But Link was told that she spent Christmas in the Manor at Bath So she did Link asked generally and was answered generally missus Vrain went up to town on Christmas Eve and returned on Christmas Day but said Diana with emphasis she spent the night in town
5765-231844-0050	train-other-500	and on that night the murder was committed Lucian produced his pocketbook and took therefrom the fragment of gauze which he handed to Diana
none	none	 I found this on the fence at the back of No thirteen he said 
5765-231844-0051	train-other-500	It is a veil a portion of a velvet spotted veil A velvet spotted veil cried Diana looking at it Then it belongs to Lydia Vrain She usually wears velvet spotted veils
none	none	 mister Denzil the evidence is complete that woman is guilty CHAPTER XIII GOSSIP Going by circumstantial evidence Diana certainly had good grounds to accuse missus Vrain of committing the crime 
5765-231845-0000	train-other-500	for there were four points at least which could be proved past all doubt as incriminating her strongly in the matter In the first place the female shadow on the blind seen by Lucian showed that a woman had been in the habit of entering the house by the secret way of the cellar
5765-231845-0001	train-other-500	and during the absence of Vrain Secondly the finding of the parti coloured ribbon in the Silent House which had been knotted round the handle of the stiletto by Diana and the absence of the stiletto itself from its usual place on the wall of the Berwin Manor library
5765-231845-0002	train-other-500	proved that the weapon had been removed therefrom to London and presumably used to commit the deed seeing that otherwise there was no necessity for its presence in the Geneva Square mansion Thirdly Diana had discovered that Lydia had spent the night of the murder in town
5765-231845-0003	train-other-500	and lastly she also declared that the fragment of gauze found by Lucian on the dividing fence was the property of missus Vrain This quartette of charges was recapitulated by Diana in support of her accusation of her stepmother
5765-231845-0004	train-other-500	I always suspected Lydia as indirectly guilty she declared in concluding her speech for the prosecution
none	none	 but I was not certain until now that she had actually struck the blow herself 
5765-231845-0005	train-other-500	But did she said Denzil by no means convinced
none	none	 I do not know what further evidence you require to prove it 
5765-231845-0006	train-other-500	retorted Diana indignantly She was in town on Christmas Eve she took the stiletto from the library and You can t prove that interrupted Lucian decidedly Then seeing the look of anger on Diana s face he hastened to apologise
5765-231845-0007	train-other-500	Excuse me Miss Vrain he said nervously I am not the less your friend because I combat your arguments but in this case it is necessary to look on both sides of the question Is it possible to prove that missus Vrain removed this dagger Nobody actually saw it in her possession
none	none	 replied Diana who was more amenable to reason than the majority of her sex but I can prove that the stiletto with its ribbon remained in the library after the departure of my father If Lydia did not take it who else had occasion to bring it up to London 
5765-231845-0008	train-other-500	Let us say Count Ferruci suggested Denzil Diana pointed to the fragment of the veil lying on the table On the evidence of that piece of gauze she said it was Lydia who entered the house Again you saw her shadow on the window blind
5765-231845-0009	train-other-500	I saw two shadows corrected Lucian hastily those of a man and a woman In plain English mister Denzil those of missus Vrain and Count Ferruci We cannot be certain of that But circumstantial evidence Is not always conclusive Miss Vrain
none	none	 Upon my word sir you seem inclined to defend this woman Miss Vrain said Lucian seriously if we don t give her the benefit of every doubt the jury will should she be tried on this charge I admit that the evidence against this woman is strong but it is not certain and I argue the case looking at it from her point of view the only view which is likely to be taken by her counsel 
5765-231845-0010	train-other-500	If missus Vrain killed her husband she must have had a strong motive to do so Well said Diana impatiently there is the assurance money I don t know if that motive is quite strong enough to justify this woman in risking her neck responded the barrister
5765-231845-0011	train-other-500	As missus Vrain of Berwin Manor she had an ample income for your father seems to have left all the rents to her and spent but little on himself
none	none	 also she had an assured position and on the whole a happy life Why should she risk losing these advantages to gain more money She wanted to marry Ferruci said Diana driven to another point of defence She was almost engaged to him before she married my foolish father she invited him to Berwin Manor against the wish of her husband and showed plainly that she loved him sufficiently to commit a crime for his sake With my father dead and she in possession of Ltwenty thousand she could hope to marry this Italian Can you prove that she was so reckless Yes I can replied Miss Vrain defiantly The same person who told me that Lydia was not at Berwin Manor on Christmas Eve can tell you that her behaviour with Count Ferruci was the talk of Bath Who is this person asked Lucian looking up A friend of mine Miss Tyler I brought her up with me so that you should get her information at first hand 
5765-231845-0012	train-other-500	You can see her at once and Diana rose to ring the bell One moment interposed Lucian before she could touch the button Tell me if Miss Tyler knows your reason for bringing her up I have not told her directly said Diana with some bluntness
5765-231845-0013	train-other-500	but as she is no fool I fancy she suspects
none	none	 Why do you ask Because I have something to tell you which I do not wish your friend to hear 
5765-231845-0014	train-other-500	unless added Lucian significantly you desire to take her into our confidence No said Diana promptly I do not think it is wise to take her into our confidence She is rather well to put it plainly mister Denzil rather a gossip
none	none	 H m 
5765-231845-0015	train-other-500	As such do you consider her evidence reliable We can pick the grains of wheat out of the chaff No doubt she exaggerates and garbles after the fashion of a scandal loving woman but her evidence is valuable especially as showing that Lydia was not at Bath on Christmas Eve
5765-231845-0016	train-other-500	We will tell her nothing so she can suspect as much as she likes if we do speak freely she will spread the gossip and if we don t she will invent worse facts so in either case it doesn t matter
none	none	 What is it you have to tell me Lucian could scarcely forbear smiling at Diana s candidly expressed estimate of her ally s character 
5765-231845-0017	train-other-500	but fearful of giving offence to his companion he speedily composed his features With much explanation and an exhibition of Miss Greeb s plan he gave an account of his discoveries beginning with his visit to the cellar and ending with the important conversation with his landlady
5765-231845-0018	train-other-500	Diana listened attentively and when he concluded gave it as her opinion that Lydia had entered the first yard by the side passage and had climbed over the fence into the second as is clearly proved by the veil she concluded decisively
none	none	 But why should she take all that trouble and run the risk of being seen when it is plain that your father expected her 
5765-231845-0019	train-other-500	Expected her cried Diana thunderstruck Impossible I don t know so much about that replied Lucian drily
none	none	 although I admit that on the face of it my assertion appears improbable 
5765-231845-0020	train-other-500	But when I met your father the second time he was so anxious to prove by letting me examine the house
none	none	 that no one had entered it during his absence 
5765-231845-0021	train-other-500	that I am certain he was well aware the shadows I saw were those of people he knew were in the room Now if the woman was missus Vrain she must have been in the habit of visiting your father by the back way And Ferruci also
none	none	 I am not sure if the male shadow was Ferruci 
5765-231845-0022	train-other-500	no more than I am certain the other was missus Vrain But the veil Lucian shrugged his shoulders in despair That seems to prove it was she he said dubiously but I can t explain your father s conduct in receiving her in so secretive a way
5765-231845-0023	train-other-500	The whole thing is beyond me Well what is to be done said Diana after a pause during which they looked blankly at one another I must think My head is too confused just now with this conflicting evidence to plan any line of action
5765-231845-0024	train-other-500	As a relief let us examine your friend and hear what she has to say Diana assented and touched the bell Shortly Miss Tyler appeared ushered in by a nervous waiter to whom it would seem she had addressed a sharp admonition on his want of deference
5765-231845-0025	train-other-500	Immediately on entering she pounced down on Miss Vrain like a hawk on a dove pecked her on both cheeks addressed her as my dearest Di and finally permitted herself with downcast eyes and a modest demeanour to be introduced to Lucian
5765-231845-0026	train-other-500	It might be inferred from the foregoing description that Miss Tyler was a young and ardent damsel in her teens whereas she was considerably nearer forty than thirty and possessed an uncomely aspect unpleasing to male eyes Her own were of a cold grey
5765-231845-0027	train-other-500	her lips were thin her waist pinched in and as the natural consequence of tight lacing her nose was red Her scanty hair was drawn off her high forehead very tightly
none	none	 and screwed into a cast iron knob at the nape of her long neck 
5765-231845-0028	train-other-500	and she smiled occasionally in an acid manner with many teeth She wore a plainly made green dress with a toby frill and a large silver cross dangled on her flat bosom
5765-231845-0029	train-other-500	Altogether she was about as venomous a specimen of an unappropriated blessing as can well be imagined Bella said Miss Vrain to this unattractive female for certain reasons which I may tell you hereafter
5765-231845-0030	train-other-500	mister Denzil wishes to know if missus Vrain was at Berwin Manor on Christmas Eve Of course she was not dearest Di said Bella drooping her elderly head on one scraggy shoulder with an acid smile Didn t I tell you so I was asked by Lydia
none	none	 alas I wish I could say my dearest Lydia 
5765-231845-0031	train-other-500	to spend Christmas at Berwin Manor She invited me for my singing and playing you know and as we all have to make ourselves agreeable I came to see her On the day before Christmas she received a letter by the early post which seemed to upset her a great deal
5765-231845-0032	train-other-500	and told me she would have to run up to town on business She did and stayed all night and came down next morning to keep Christmas
none	none	 I thought it very strange What was her business in town Miss Tyler 
5765-231845-0033	train-other-500	asked Lucian Oh she didn t tell me said Bella tossing her head at least not directly but I gathered from what she said that something was wrong with poor dear mister Clyne her father you know dearest Di Was the letter from him
5765-231845-0034	train-other-500	Oh I couldn t say that mister Denzil
none	none	 as I don t know and I never speak by hearsay 
5765-231845-0035	train-other-500	So much mischief is done in the world by people repeating idle tales of which they are not sure Was Count Ferruci at Berwin Manor at the time Oh dear me no Di I told you that he was up in London the whole of Christmas week I only hope
5765-231845-0036	train-other-500	added Miss Tyler with a venomous smile that Lydia did not go up to meet him Why should she demanded Lucian bluntly Oh I m not blind cried Bella shrilly laughing No indeed
5765-231845-0037	train-other-500	The Count a most amiable man was very attentive to me at one time and Lydia a married woman I regret to say did not like him being so
none	none	 I am indeed sorry to repeat scandal mister Denzil but the way in which missus Vrain behaved towards me and carried on with the Count was not creditable I am a gentlewoman mister Denzil and a churchwoman and as such cannot countenance such conduct as his You infer then that missus Vrain was in love with the Italian I shouldn t be at all surprised to hear it cried Bella again But he did not care for her Oh dear no It is my belief mister Denzil 
5765-231845-0038	train-other-500	that missus Vrain knows more about the death of her husband than she chooses to admit Oh I ve read all the papers I know all about the death Miss Tyler said Lucian alarmed Bella cried Miss Vrain I
5765-231845-0039	train-other-500	Oh I m not blind dearest interrupted Bella speaking very fast I know you ask me these questions to find out if Lydia killed her husband Well she did
none	none	 How do you know Miss Tyler Because I m sure of it mister Denzil Wasn t mister Vrain stabbed with a dagger Very well then There was a dagger hanging in the library of the Manor and I saw it there four days before Christmas When I looked for it on Christmas Day it was gone Gone Who took it missus Vrain Are you sure Yes I am snapped Miss Tyler I didn t see her take it but it was there before she went and it wasn t there on Christmas Day If Lydia did not take it who did Count Ferruci perhaps 
5765-231845-0040	train-other-500	He wasn t there No cried Bella raising her head I m sure missus Vrain stole it and killed her husband and I don t care who hears me say so
none	none	 Diana and Lucian looked at one another in silence CHAPTER XIV THE HOUSE IN JERSEY STREET As her listeners made no comment on Miss Tyler s accusation of missus Vrain she paused only for a moment to recover her breath and was off again in full cry 
4017-231846-0001	train-other-500	with a budget of ancient gossip drawn from a very retentive memory Of the way in which Lydia treated her poor dear husband I know little cried the fair Bella Only this that she drove him out of the house by her scandalous conduct Yes indeed
4017-231846-0002	train-other-500	although you may not believe me Di You were away in Australia at the time but I kept a watch on Lydia in your interest dear and our housemaid heard from your housemaid the most dreadful things Why mister Vrain remonstrated with Lydia
4017-231846-0003	train-other-500	and ordered Count Ferruci out of the house but Lydia would not let him go and mister Vrain left the house himself Where did he go to Miss Tyler I don t know nobody knows But it is my opinion said the spinster with a significant look
none	none	 that he went to London to see about a divorce 
4017-231846-0004	train-other-500	But he was weak in the head poor man and I suppose let things go on When next I heard of him he was a corpse in Geneva Square But did my father tell his wife that he was in Geneva Square Dearest Di I can t say but I don t believe he had anything to do with her
4017-231846-0005	train-other-500	after he left the house Then if she did not know his whereabouts how could she kill him asked Denzil pertinently Brought to a point which she could not evade Bella declined to answer this question
4017-231846-0006	train-other-500	but tossed her head and bit her lip with a fine colour All her accusations of missus Vrain had been made generally and as Lucian noted were unsupported by fact From a legal point of view this spiteful gossip of a jealous woman was worth nothing
4017-231846-0007	train-other-500	but in a broad sense it was certainly useful in showing the discord which had existed between Vrain and his wife Lucian saw that little good was to be gained from this prejudiced witness so thanking Miss Tyler
none	none	 courteously for her information he arose to go Wait for a moment mister Denzil 
4017-231846-0008	train-other-500	said Diana hurriedly I want to ask you something Bella would you mind Leaving the room Oh dear no burst out Miss Tyler annoyed at being excluded I ve said all I have to say and anything I can do dearest Di to assist you and mister
4017-231846-0009	train-other-500	Denzil in hanging that woman I Miss Tyler interrupted Lucian sternly you must not speak so wildly for as yet there is nothing to prove that missus Vrain is guilty She is guilty enough for me mister Denzil
none	none	 but like all men I suppose you take her side because she is supposed to be pretty 
4017-231846-0010	train-other-500	Pretty reflected Bella scornfully I never could see it myself a painted up minx dragged up from the gutter I wonder at your taste mister Denzil indeed I do Pretty the idea What fools men are I m glad I never married one
none	none	 Indeed no He he And with a shrill laugh to point this 
4017-231846-0011	train-other-500	sour grape sentiment and mark her disdain for Lucian the fair Bella took herself and her lean form
none	none	 out of the room 
4017-231846-0012	train-other-500	Diana and the barrister were too deeply interested in their business to take much notice of Bella s hysterical outburst but looked at one another gravely as she departed Well mister Denzil said the former repeating her earlier question
4017-231846-0013	train-other-500	what is to be done now Shall we see missus Vrain Not yet replied Lucian quickly We must secure proofs of missus Vrain s being in that yard before we can get any confession out of her If you will leave it in my hands Miss Vrain I shall call on missus Bensusan
none	none	 Who is missus Bensusan She is the tenant of the house in Jersey Street 
4017-231846-0014	train-other-500	It is possible that she or her servant may know something
none	none	 about the illegal use made of the right of way 
4017-231846-0015	train-other-500	Yes I think that is the next step to take But what am I to do in the meantime Nothing If I were you I would not even see missus Vrain I will not seek her voluntarily replied Diana
none	none	 but as I have been to Berwin Manor she is certain to hear 
4017-231846-0016	train-other-500	that I am in England and may perhaps find out my address and call But if she does you may be sure that I will be most judicious in my remarks I leave all that to your discretion said Denzil rising
4017-231846-0017	train-other-500	Good bye Miss Vrain As soon as I am in possession of any new evidence I shall call again Good bye mister Denzil
none	none	 and thank you for all your kindness 
4017-231846-0018	train-other-500	Diana made this remark with so kindly a look so becoming a blush and so warm a pressure of the hand that Lucian felt quite overcome and not trusting himself to speak
none	none	 walked swiftly out of the room 
4017-231846-0019	train-other-500	In spite of the gravity of the task in which he was concerned at that moment he thought more of Diana s looks and speech
none	none	 than of the detective business which he had taken up for love s sake But on reaching his rooms in Geneva Square he made a mighty effort to waken 
4017-231846-0020	train-other-500	from these day dreams and with a stern determination addressed himself resolutely to the work in hand In this case the bitter came before the sweet But by accomplishing the desire of Diana and solving the mystery of her father s death
4017-231846-0021	train-other-500	Lucian hoped to win not only her smiles but the more substantial reward of her heart and hand Before calling on missus Bensusan the barrister debated within himself as to whether it would not be judicious to call in again
4017-231846-0022	train-other-500	the assistance of Link and by telling him of the new evidence which had been found place him thereby in possession of new material to prosecute the case But Link lately had taken so pessimistic a view of the matter
4017-231846-0023	train-other-500	that Lucian fancied he would scoff at his late discoveries and discourage him in prosecuting what seemed to be a fruitless quest Denzil was anxious as Diana s knight
none	none	 to do as much of the work as possible in order to gain the reward of her smiles 
4017-231846-0024	train-other-500	It is true that he had no legal authority to make these inquiries and it was possible that missus Bensusan might refuse to answer questions concerning her own business unsanctioned by law
none	none	 but on recalling the description of Miss Greeb 
4017-231846-0025	train-other-500	Lucian fancied that missus Bensusan as a fat woman might only be good natured and timid He therefore dismissed all ideas of asking Link to intervene and resolved to risk a personal interview with the tenant of the Jersey Street house
4017-231846-0026	train-other-500	It would be time enough to invite Link s assistance he thought when missus Bensusan as yet an unknown quantity in the case proved obstinate in replying to his questions missus Bensusan proved to be quite as stout as Miss Greeb had reported
4017-231846-0027	train-other-500	A gigantically fat woman she made up in breadth what she lacked in length Yet she seemed to have some activity about her too for she opened the door personally to Lucian who was quite amazed when he beheld her monstrous bulk blocking up the doorway
4017-231846-0028	train-other-500	Her face was white and round like a pale moon
none	none	 she had staring eyes of a china blue resembling the vacant optics of a wax doll 
4017-231846-0029	train-other-500	and on the whole appeared to be a timid lymphatic woman likely to answer any questions put to her in a sufficiently peremptory tone Lucian foresaw that he was not likely to have much trouble with this mountain of flesh What might you be pleased to want sir
4017-231846-0030	train-other-500	she asked Lucian in the meekest of voices Is it about the lodgings Yes answered the barrister boldly for he guessed that missus Bensusan would scuttle back into the house like a rabbit to its burrow did he speak too plainly at the outset that is
4017-231846-0031	train-other-500	I wish to inquire about a friend of mine
none	none	 Did he lodge here sir 
4017-231846-0032	train-other-500	Yes A mister Wrent
none	none	 Deary me said the fat woman 
4017-231846-0033	train-other-500	with mild surprise mister Wrent left me shortly after Christmas A kind gentleman but timid he Excuse me interrupted Lucian who wanted to get into the house but don t you think you could tell me about my friend in a more convenient situation
4017-231846-0034	train-other-500	Oh yes sir certainly sir wheezed missus Bensusan rolling back up the narrow passage I beg your pardon sir for my forgetfulness but my head ain t what it ought to be I m a lone widow sir and not over strong
none	none	 Denzil could have laughed at this description 
4017-231846-0035	train-other-500	as the lady s bulk gave the lie to her assertion However on diplomatic grounds he suppressed his mirth and followed his ponderous guide
none	none	 into a sitting room so small 
4017-231846-0036	train-other-500	that she almost filled it herself As he left the passage he saw a brilliant red head pop down the staircase leading to the basement but whether it was that of a man
none	none	 or a woman he could not say 
4017-231846-0037	train-other-500	Still on recalling Miss Greeb s description of the Bensusan household he concluded that the red head was the property of Rhoda the sharp servant and argued from her appearance in the background and rapid disappearance that she was in the habit of listening to conversations
4017-231846-0038	train-other-500	she was not meant to hear missus Bensusan sat down on the sofa as being most accommodating to her bulk and cast a watery look around the small apartment which was furnished in that extraordinary fashion which seems to be the peculiar
4017-231846-0039	train-other-500	characteristic of boarding houses The walls and carpet were patterned with glowing bunches of red roses the furniture was covered with stamped red velvet the ornaments consisted of shells
none	none	 wax fruit under glass shades 
4017-231846-0040	train-other-500	mats of Berlin wool vases with dangling pendants of glass and such like elegant survivals of the early Victorian epoch Hideous as the apartment was it seemed to afford missus Bensusan also a survival great pleasure
4017-231846-0041	train-other-500	and she cast a complacent look around as Lucian seated himself on an uncomfortable chair covered with an antimacassar
none	none	 of crochet work 
4017-231846-0042	train-other-500	My rooms are most comfortable an much liked said missus Bensusan sighing but I have not had many lodgers lately Rhoda thinks it must be on account of that horrible murder
none	none	 The murder of Vrain in No thirteen 
4017-231846-0043	train-other-500	Ah groaned the fat woman looking tearfully over her double chin
none	none	 I see you have heard of it 
4017-231846-0044	train-other-500	Everybody has heard of it replied Lucian and I was one of the first to hear since I live in
none	none	 Miss Greeb s house opposite No thirteen 
4017-231846-0045	train-other-500	Indeed sir grunted missus Bensusan stiffening a little at the sound of a rival lodging house keeper s name Then you are mister Denzil the gentleman who occupies Miss Greeb s first floor front Yes
none	none	 And I have come to ask you a few questions 
4017-231846-0046	train-other-500	About what sir said missus Bensusan visibly alarmed Concerning mister Wrent You are a friend of his I said so missus Bensusan but as a matter of fact I never set eyes on the gentleman in my life
4017-231846-0047	train-other-500	missus Bensusan gasped like a fish out of water and patted her fat breast with her fat hand as though to give herself courage It is not like a gentleman to say that another gentleman s his friend when he ain t she said with an attempt at dignity
4017-231846-0048	train-other-500	Very true answered Lucian with great composure but you know the saying All is fair in love and war I will be plain with you missus Bensusan he added I am here to seek possible evidence in connection with the murder
none	none	 of mister Vrain in No thirteen on Christmas Eve missus Bensusan 
4017-231846-0049	train-other-500	gave a kind of hoarse screech and stared at Lucian in a horrified manner Murder she repeated Lord what mur that murder mister Vrain mister Vrain that murder she repeated over and over again
none	none	 Yes the murder of mister Vrain in No thirteen Geneva Square on Christmas Eve Now do you understand 
4017-231846-0050	train-other-500	With another gasp missus Bensusan threw up her fat hands and raised her eyes to the ceiling As I am a Christian woman sir she cried I am as innocent as a babe unborn
none	none	 Of what 
4017-231846-0051	train-other-500	asked Lucian sharply Of the murder wept missus Bensusan now dissolved in tears Rhoda said I don t want to hear what Rhoda said interrupted Lucian impatiently and I am not accusing you of the murder But
none	none	 your house is at the back of No thirteen Yes replied missus Bensusan weeping like a Niobe And a fence divides your yard from that of No thirteen 
4017-231846-0052	train-other-500	I won t contradict you sir it do And there is a passage leading from Jersey Street into your yard There is mister Denzil it s useful for the trades people And I daresay useful to others said Lucian drily
4017-231846-0053	train-other-500	Now missus Bensusan do you know if any lady was in the habit of passing through that passage at night Before missus Bensusan could answer the door was dashed open and Rhoda the red headed darted into the room
none	none	 Don t answer missus she cried shortly As you love me mum don t CHAPTER XV RHODA AND THE CLOAK The one servant of missus Bensusan was a girl of seventeen who had a local fame in the neighbourhood on account of her sharp tongue and many precocious qualities No one knew who her parents were or where the fat landlady had picked her up but she had been in the Jersey Street house some ten years and had been educated and in a manner adopted by its mistress although missus Bensusan always gave her cronies to understand that Rhoda was simply and solely the domestic of the establishment Nevertheless for one of her humble position she had a wonderful power over her stout employer the power of a strong mind over a weak one and in spite of her youth it was well known that Rhoda managed the domestic economy of the house missus Bensusan was the sovereign Rhoda the prime minister This position she had earned by dint of her own sharpness in dealing with the world And the local tradesmen were afraid of Rhoda missus Bensusan s devil they called her and never dared to give short weight or charge extra prices or pass off damaged goods as new when Rhoda was the purchaser On the contrary No nine Jersey Street was supplied with everything of the best promptly and civilly at ordinary market rates for neither butcher nor baker nor candlestick maker was daring enough to risk Rhoda s tongue raging like a prairie fire over their shortcomings Several landladies knowing Rhoda s value had tried to entice her from missus Bensusan by offers of higher wages and better quarters but the girl refused to leave her stout mistress and so continued quite a fixture of the lodgings Even in the city Rhoda had been spoken of by clerks who had lived in Jersey Street and so had more than a local reputation for originality This celebrated handmaid was as lean as her mistress was stout Her hair was magnificent in quality and quantity but alas was of the unpopular tint called red not auburn or copper hued or the famous Titian color but a blazing fiery red which made it look like a comic wig Her face was pale and freckled her eyes black in strange contrast to her hair and her mouth large but garnished with an excellent set of white teeth Rhoda was not neat in her attire perhaps not having arrived at the age of coquetry for she wore a dingy grey dress much too short for her a pair of carpet slippers which had been left by a departed lodger and usually went about with her sleeves tucked up and a resolute look on her sharp face Such was the appearance of missus Bensusan s devil who entered to forbid her mistress confiding in Lucian Oh Rhoda groaned missus Bensusan You bad gal I believe as you ve ad your ear to the keyhole I ave retorted Rhoda defiantly It s been there for five minutes and good it is for you mum as I ain t above listening What do you mean sir she cried turning on Lucian like a fierce sparrow by coming ere to frighten two lone females and her as innocent as a spring chicken Oh said Lucian looking at her composedly so you are the celebrated Rhoda I ve heard of you Not much good then sir if Miss Greeb was talking rejoined the red haired girl with a sniff Oh I know her Rhoda Rhoda bleated her mistress do old your tongue I tell you this gentleman s a police He ain t said the undaunted Rhoda He s in the law Oh I knows him Ain t the law the police you foolish gal Of course it began Rhoda when Lucian who thought that she had displayed quite sufficient eccentricity cut her short with a quick gesture See here my girl he said sharply you must not behave in this fashion I have reason to believe that the assassin of mister Vrain entered the house through the premises of your mistress Lawks what a orrible idear shrieked missus Bensusan Good eavens Rhoda did you see the murdering villain Me No I never sawr nothing mum replied Rhoda doggedly Lucian watching the girl s face and the uneasy expression in her eyes felt convinced she was not telling the truth It was no use forcing her to speak as he saw very plainly that Rhoda was one of those obstinate people whom severity only hardened Much more could be done with her by kindness and Denzil adopted this to him more congenial course If Rhoda is bound by any promise missus Bensusan I do not wish her to speak he said indifferently but in the interests of justice I am sure you will not refuse to answer my questions Lord sir I know nothing whimpered the terrified landlady Will you answer a few questions asked Denzil persuasively missus Bensusan glanced in a scared manner at Rhoda who meanwhile had been standing in a sullen and hesitating attitude When she thought herself unobserved she stole swift glances at the visitor trying evidently to read his character by observation of his face and manner It would seem that her scrutiny was favourable for before missus Bensusan could answer Lucian s question she asked him one herself What do you want to know sir I want to know all about mister Wrent Why Because I fancy he has something to do with this crime Lord groaned missus Bensusan Ave I waited on a murderer I don t say he is a murderer missus Bensusan but he knows something likely to put us on the track of the criminal What makes ye take up the case demanded Rhoda sharply Because I know that mister Wrent came to board in this house shortly after mister Vrain occupied No thirteen replied Denzil Who says he did Miss Greeb my landlady and she also told me that he left here two days after the murder That s as true as true cried missus Bensusan ain t it Rhoda We lost him cause he said he couldn t abide living near a house where a crime had been committed Well then continued Lucian seeing that Rhoda without speaking continued to watch him the coincidence of mister Wrent s stay with that of mister Vrain s strikes me as peculiar You are a sharp one you are said Rhoda with an approving nod Look here mister Denzil would you break a promise That depends upon what the promise was It was one I made to hold my tongue About what Several things said the girl shortly Have they to do with this crime asked Lucian eagerly I don t know I can t say said Rhoda then suddenly her face grew black I tell you what sir I hate mister Wrent she declared Oh Rhoda cried missus Bensusan After the lovely cloak he gave you The red haired girl looked contemptuously at her mistress then without a word darted out of the room Before Lucian could conjecture the reason of her strange conduct or missus Bensusan could get her breath again a very difficult operation for her Rhoda was back with a blue cloth cloak lined with rabbit skins hanging over her arm This she threw down at the feet of Lucian and stamped on it savagely with the carpet slippers There s his present she cried angrily but I wish I could dance on him the same way I wish I wish I could hang him Can you demanded Lucian swiftly taking her in the moment of wrath when she seemed disposed to speak No said Rhoda shortly I can t Do you think he killed mister Vrain No I don t Do you know who did Blest if I do Does mister Wrent asked Denzil meaningly The girl wet her finger and went through a childish game That s wet she said then wiping the finger on her dingy skirt that s dry Cut my throat if I tell a lie Ask me something easier mister Denzil I don t understand you said Lucian quite puzzled Rhoda Rhoda Ave you gone crazy wailed missus Bensusan Look here said the girl taking no notice of her mistress do you want to know about mister Wrent Yes I do And about that side passage as you talked of to the missis Yes Then I ll answer yer questions sir You ll know all I know Very good said Lucian with an approving smile now you are talking like a sensible girl Rhoda You ain t going to talk bad of mister Wrent It ain t bad and it ain t good replied Rhoda It s betwixt and between Well I must ear all I don t want the character of the ouse took away said missus Bensusan with an attempt at firmness That s all right rejoined Rhoda reassuringly you can jine in yerself when y like Fire away mister Denzil Who is mister Wrent asked Lucian going straight to the point I don t know replied Rhoda and henceforth the examination proceeded as though the girl were in the witness box and Lucian counsel for the prosecution Q When did he come to Jersey Street A At the end of July last year Q When did he go away A The morning after Boxing Day Q Can you describe his appearance A He was of the middle height with a fresh complexion white hair and a white beard growing all over his face He was untidy about his clothes and kept a good deal to his own room among a lot of books I don t think he was quite right in his head Q Did he pay his rent regularly A Yes except when he was away He would go away for a week at a time Q Was he in this house on Christmas Eve A Yes sir He came back two days before Christmas Q Where had he been A I don t know he did not say Q Did he have any visitors A He did A tall dark man and a lady Q What was the lady like A A little woman I never saw her face as she always kept her veil down Q What kind of a veil did she wear A A black gauze veil with velvet spots Q Did she come often to see mister Wrent A Yes Four or five times Q When did she call last A On Christmas Eve Q At what hour A She came at seven and went away at eight I know that because she had supper with mister Wrent Q Did she leave the house A Yes I let her out myself Q Did you ever hear any conversation between them A No mister Wrent took care of that I never got any chance of listening at keyholes with him He was a sharp one for all his craziness Q What was the male visitor like A He was tall and dark with a black moustache Q Do you think he was a foreigner A I don t know I never heard him speak mister Wrent let him out as usual Q When did he visit mister Wrent last A On Christmas Eve He came with the lady Q Did he stay to supper also A No He went away at half past seven mister Wrent let him out as usual Q Did he go away altogether A I I I am not sure here the witness hesitated Q Why did mister Wrent give you the cloak A To make me hold my tongue about the dark man Q Why A Because I saw him in the back yard Q On what night A On the night of Christmas Eve about half past eight CHAPTER XVI missus VRAIN AT BAY You saw the dark man in the back yard on Christmas Eve repeated Lucian much surprised by this discovery Yes I did replied Rhoda decisively at half past eight o clock I went out into the yard to put some empty bottles into the shed and I saw the man standing near the fence looking at the back of No thirteen When he heard me coming out he rushed past me and out by the side passage The moon was shining and I saw him as plain as plain Did he seem afraid Yes he did and didn t want to be seen neither I told mister Wrent and he promised me a cloak if I held my tongue He said the dark man was waiting in the yard until the lady had gone when he was coming in again But the lady you say went at eight and you saw the man half an hour later That s it sir He told me a lie for he never came in again to see mister Wrent But already the dark man had seen the lady Yes He came in with her at seven and went away at half past Lucian mechanically stooped down and picked up the fur cloak He was puzzled by the information given by Rhoda and did not exactly see what use to make of it Going by the complexion of the man who had lurked in the back yard it would appear that he was Count Ferruci while the small stature of the woman and the fact that she wore a velvet spotted veil indicated that she was Lydia Vrain also the pair had been in the vicinity of the haunted house on the night of the murder and although it was true both were out of the place by half past eight yet they might not have gone far but had probably returned later when Rhoda and missus Bensusan were asleep to murder Vrain between the hours of eleven and twelve on the same night This was all plain enough but Lucian was puzzled by the account of mister Wrent Who he asked himself repeatedly who was this grey haired white bearded man who had so often received Lydia who had on Christmas Eve silenced Rhoda regarding Ferruci s presence in the yard by means of the cloak and who it would seem possessed the key to the whole mystery Rhoda could tell no more but that he had stayed six months with missus Bensusan and had departed two days after the murder whereby it would seem that his task having been completed he had no reason to remain longer in so dangerous a neighbourhood Yet four months had elapsed since his departure and Denzil after some reflection asked missus Bensusan a question or two regarding this interval Has mister Wrent returned here since his departure he demanded Lawks no sir wheezed missus Bensusan shaking her head I ve never set eyes on him since he went Ave you Rhoda Whereat the girl shook her head also and watched Lucian with an intensity of gaze which somewhat discomposed him Did he owe you any money when he went missus Bensusan No sir He paid up like a gentleman I always thought well of mister Wrent Rhoda doesn t seem to share your sentiments said Denzil drily No I don t cried the servant frowning I hated mister Wrent Why did you hate him Never you mind sir retorted Rhoda grimly I hated him Yet he bought you this cloak No he didn t contradicted the girl He got it from the lady What cried Lucian sharply Are you sure of that I can t exactly swear to it replied Rhoda hesitating but it was this way The lady wore a cloak like that and I admired it awful She had it on when she came Christmas Eve and she didn t wear it when I let her out and the next day mister Wrent gave it to me So I suppose it is the same cloak And did the lady go out into the cold winter weather without the cloak Yes but she had a long cloth jacket on sir so I don t s pose she missed it Was the lady agitated when she went out I don t know She held her tongue and kept her veil down Can you tell me anything more asked Lucian anxious to make the examination as exhaustive as possible No mister Denzil answered Rhoda after some thought I can t except that mister Wrent long before Christmas promised me a present and gave me the cloak then Will you let me take this cloak away with me If you like replied Rhoda carelessly I don t want it Oh Rhoda wailed missus Bensusan Your lovely lovely rabbit skin I ll bring it back again said Lucian hastily I only want to use it as evidence Ye want to know who the lady is said Rhoda sharply Yes I do Can you tell me No but you ll find out from that cloak I guess why you re taking it You are very sharp Rhoda said Lucian rising with a good humoured smile and well deserve your local reputation If I find mister Wrent I may require you to identify him and missus Bensusan also I ll be able to do that but missus hasn t her eyes much Hasn t her eyes repeated Denzil with a glance at missus Bensusan s staring orbs Lawks sir I m shortsighted though I never lets on Rhoda ow can you ave let on to the gentleman as I m deficient As to knowing mister Wrent I d do so well enough said missus Bensusan tossing her head with his long white beard and white ead let alone his black velvet skull cap Oh he wore a skull cap Only indoors said Rhoda sharply but here I m olding the door wide sir so if you ve done we re done I m done as you call it for the present replied Denzil putting on his hat but I may come again In the meantime hold your tongues Silence on this occasion will be gold speech won t even be silver missus Bensusan laughed at this speech in a fat and comfortable sort of way while Rhoda grinned and escorted Lucian to the front door She looked so uncanny with her red hair and black eyes that the barrister could not forbear a question Are you English my girl No I ain t retorted Rhoda emphatically I m of the gentle Romany A gipsy So you Gorgios call us replied the girl and shut the door with what seemed to be unnecessary violence Lucian went off with the cloak over his arm somewhat discomposed by this last piece of information A gipsy he repeated Humph Can good come out of Nazareth I don t trust that girl much If I knew why she hates Wrent I d be much more satisfied with her information And who the deuce is Wrent Lucian had occasion to ask himself this question many times before he found its answer and that was not until afterwards At the present moment he dismissed it from his mind as unprofitable He was too busy reflecting on the evidence obtained in Jersey Street to waste time in conjecturing further events On returning to his lodgings he sat down to consider what was best to be done After much reflection and internal argument he decided to call upon missus Vrain and by producing the cloak force her into confessing her share of the crime Whether she had been the principal in the deed or an accessory before the fact Lucian could not determine but he was confident that in one way or another she was cognizant of the truth although this she would probably conceal as its revelation would likely be detrimental to her own safety At first Denzil intended to see Diana before visiting missus Vrain in order to relate all he had learned and find out from her if the cloak really belonged to the widow But on second thoughts he decided not to do so I can tell her nothing absolutely certain about the matter he said to himself as I cannot be sure of anything until I force missus Vrain to confess Diana so he called her in his discourse to himself Diana will probably know nothing about the ownership of the cloak as it seems new and was probably purchased by Lydia during the absence of Diana in Australia No I have the address of missus Vrain which Diana gave me It will be best to call on her and by displaying the cloak make her acknowledge her guilt With such evidence she cannot deny that she visited Wrent and was in the vicinity of the house wherein her husband was murdered on the very night the crime was committed Also she must state Ferruci s reason for hiding in the back yard and tell me plainly who Wrent is and why he helped the pair of them in their devilish plans I am doubtful if she will speak but altogether the evidence I have collected inculpates her so strongly that it will be quite sufficient grounds upon which to obtain a warrant for her arrest And sooner than risk that I expect she will tell as much as she can to exculpate herself that is if she is really innocent If she is guilty Lucian shrugged his shoulders then I cannot guess what course she will take missus Vrain with her father to protect her had established herself in a small but luxurious house in Mayfair and was preparing to enjoy herself during the coming season Although her husband had met with a terrible death scarcely six months before she had already cast off her heavy mourning and wore only such millinery indications of sorrow as suited with her widowed existence Ferruci was a constant visitor at the house but although Lydia was now free and wealthy she by no means seemed ready to marry the Italian Perhaps she thought with her looks and riches she might gain an English title as more valuable than a Continental one and in this view she was supported by her father Clyne had no other desire than to see his beloved Lydia happy and would willingly have sacrificed everything in his power to gain such an end but as he did not like Ferruci himself and saw that Lydia s affections towards him had cooled greatly he did not encourage the idea of a match between them However these matters were yet in abeyance as Lydia was too diplomatic to break off with so subtle a man as the Count who might prove a dangerous enemy were his love turned to hate and mister Clyne was quite willing to remain on friendly terms with the man so long as Lydia chose that such friendship should exist In short Lydia ruled her simple father with a rod of iron and coaxed Ferruci a more difficult man to deal with into good humour so she managed both of them skilfully in every way and contrived to keep things smooth pending her plunge into London society For all her childish looks Lydia was uncommonly clever When Lucian s card was brought in missus Vrain proved to be at home and as his good looks had made a deep impression on her she received him at once He was shown into a luxuriously furnished drawing room without delay and welcomed by pretty missus Vrain herself who came forward with a bright smile and outstretched hands looking more charming than ever Well I do call this real sweet of you said she gaily I guess it is about time you showed up But you don t look well that s a fact What s wrong I m worried a little replied Lucian confounded by her coolness That s no use mister Denzil You should never be worried I guess I don t let anything put me out Not even your husband s death That s rude said Lydia sharply the colour leaving her cheek What do you mean Have you come to be nasty I came to return you this said Denzil throwing the cloak which he had carried on his arm before the widow This echoed missus Vrain looking at it Well what s this old thing got to do with me It s yours you left it in Jersey Street Did I And where s Jersey Street You know well enough said Lucian sternly It is near the place where your husband was murdered missus Vrain turned white Do you dare to say she began when Denzil cut her short with a hint at her former discomposure The stiletto missus Vrain Don t forget the stiletto Oh God cried Lydia trembling violently What do you know of the stiletto CHAPTER XVII A DENIAL What do you know of the stiletto repeated missus Vrain anxiously She had risen to her feet and with an effort to be calm was holding on to the near chair Her bright colour had faded to a dull white hue and her eyes had a look of horror in their depths which transformed her from her childish beauty into a much older and more haggard woman than she really was It seemed as though Lucian by some necromantic spell had robbed her of youth vitality and careless happiness To him this extraordinary agitation was a proof of her guilt and hardening his heart so as not to spare her one iota of her penalty a mercy she did not deserve he addressed her sternly I know that a stiletto purchased in Florence by your late husband hung on the library wall of Berwin Manor I know that it is gone Yes yes said Lydia moistening her white dry lips it is gone but I do not know who took it The person who killed your husband I feared as much she muttered sitting down again Do you know the name of the person As well as you do yourself The name is Lydia Vrain I She threw herself back on the chair with a look of profound astonishment on her colourless face mister Denzil she stammered is is this is this a jest You will not find it so missus Vrain The little woman clutched the arms of her chair and leaned forward with her face no longer pale but red with rage and indignation If you are a gentleman mister Denzil I guess you won t keep me hanging on like this Let us get level Do you say I killed Mark Yes I do said Lucian defiantly I am sure of it On what grounds asked missus Vrain holding her temper back with a visible effort that made her eyes glitter and her breath short On the grounds that he was killed with that stiletto and Go slow How do you know he was killed with that stiletto Because the ribbon which attached it to the wall was found in the Geneva Square house where your husband was killed Miss Vrain recognised it Miss Vrain Diana Is she in England Not only in England but in London Then why hasn t she been to see me Denzil did not like to answer this question the more so as Lydia s sudden divergence from the point of discourse rather disconcerted him It is impossible to maintain dignity in making a serious accusation when the person against whom it is made thinks so little of it as to turn aside to discuss a point of etiquette in connection with another woman Seeing that her accuser was silent and confused Lydia recovered her tongue and colour and the equability of her temper It was therefore with some raillery that she continued her speech I see how it is she said contemptuously Diana has called you into her councils in order to fix this absurd charge on to me Afraid to come herself she sends you as the braver person of the partnership I congratulate you on your errand mister Denzil You can laugh as much as you like missus Vrain but the matter is more serious than you suppose Oh I am sure that my loving stepdaughter will make it as serious as possible She always hated me Pardon me missus Vrain said Lucian colouring with annoyance but I did not come here to hear you speak ill of Miss Vrain I know that She sent you here to speak ill of me and do ill to me Well so you and she accuse me of killing Mark I shall be glad to hear the evidence you can bring forward If you can make your charge good I should smile Oh I guess so Denzil noticed that when missus Vrain became excited she usually spoke plain English without the U S A accent but on growing calmer and as it were recollecting herself she adopted the Yankee twang and their curious style of expression and ejaculation This led him to suspect that the fair Lydia was not a born daughter of the Great Republic perhaps not even a naturalised citizeness but had assumed such nationality as one attractive to society in Europe and Great Britain He wondered what her past really was and if she and her father were the doubtful adventurers Diana believed them to be If so it might happen that Lydia would extricate herself out of her present unpleasant position by the use of past experience To give her no chance of such dodging Lucian rapidly detailed the evidence against her so that she would be hard put to baffle it But in this estimate he quite underrated Lydia s nerve and capability of fence let alone the dexterity with which she produced a satisfactory reply to each of his questions We will begin at the beginning missus Vrain he said soberly say from the time you drove your unfortunate husband out of his own house Now I guess that wasn t my fault explained Lydia I wasn t in love with old man Mark but I liked him well enough for he was a real gentleman and when that make mischief Diana who cocked her nose at me set out for Australia we got on surprisingly well Count Ferruci came over to stay as much at Mark s invitation as mine and I didn t pay too much attention to him anyhow Miss Tyler says you did Sakes cried missus Vrain raising her eyebrows have you been talking to that old stump Well just you look here mister Denzil It was Bella Tyler who made all the mischief She thought Ercole was sweet on her and when she found out he wasn t she got real mad and went to tell Mark that I was making things hum the wrong way with the Count Of course Mark had a row with him and of course I got riz not having done anything to lie low for We had a row royal I guess and the end of it was that Mark cleared out I thought he would turn up again or apply for a divorce though he hadn t any reason to But he did neither and remained away for a whole year While he was away I got quit of Ercole pretty smart I can tell you as I wanted to shut up that old maid s mouth I never knew where Mark was or guessed what became of him until I saw that advertisement and putting two and two together to make four I called to see mister Link where I found you running the circus Why did you faint on the mention of the stiletto I told you the reason and Link also Yes but your reason was too weak to Oh well you re right enough there interrupted Lydia smiling All that talk of nerves and grief wasn t true I didn t give my real reason but I will now When I heard that the old man had been stabbed by a stiletto I remembered that the one on the library wall had vanished some time before the Christmas Eve on which Mark was killed So you may guess I was afraid For yourself I guess not it wasn t any of my funeral I didn t take the stiletto nor did I know who had but I was afraid you might think Ferruci took it The stiletto was Italian and the Count is Italian so it struck me you might put two and two together and suspect Ercole I never thought you d fix on me concluded Lydia with a scornful toss of her head As a matter of fact I fixed on you both said Lucian composedly And for what reason Why should I and the Count murder poor Mark if you please He was a fool and a bore but I wished him no harm I was sorry as any one when I heard of his death and I offered a good reward for the catching of the mean skunk that killed him If I had done so myself I wouldn t have been such a fool as to sharpen the scent of the hounds on my own trail You were in town on Christmas Eve said Denzil not choosing to explain the motives he believed the pair had for committing the crime I was What of that You were in Jersey Street Pimlico on that night I was never in Pimlico in my life declared Lydia wrathfully and as I said before I don t know where Jersey Street is Do you know a man called Wrent I never heard of him Yet you visited him in Jersey Street on Christmas Eve between seven and eight o clock Did I really cried missus Vrain ironically and how can you prove I did By that cloak said Lucian pointing to where it lay on a chair You wore that cloak and a velvet spotted veil I haven t worn a veil of that kind for over a year said Lydia decisively though I admit I used to wear veils of that sort You can ask my maid if I have any velvet spotted veils in my wardrobe just now As to the cloak I never wear rabbit skins You might as a disguise Sakes alive man what should I want with a disguise I tell you the cloak isn t mine You can soon prove that Find out who made it and go and ask in the shop if I bought it How can I find out who made it asked Denzil who was beginning to feel that Lydia was one too many for him Here I ll show you said Lydia and picking up the cloak she turned over the tab at the neck by which it was hung up At the back of this there was a small piece of tape with printed black letters Baxter company General Drapers Bayswater she read out throwing down the cloak contemptuously I don t go to a London suburb for my frocks I get them in Paris Then you are sure this cloak isn t yours asked Lucian much perplexed No I tell you it isn t Go and ask Baxter company if I bought it I ll go with you if you like or better still cried missus Vrain jumping up briskly I can take you to see some friends with whom I stayed on Christmas Eve The whole lot will tell you that I was with them at Camden Hill all the night What Can you prove an alibi I don t know what you call it retorted Lydia coolly but I can prove pretty slick that I wasn t in Pimlico But missus Vrain your friend Ferruci was there Was he Well I don t know I never saw him that time he was in town But if you think he killed Mark you are wrong I do not believe Ercole would kill a fly for all he s an Italian Do you think he took that stiletto No I don t Then who did I don t know I don t even know when it was taken I missed it after Christmas because that old schoolma am told me it was gone Old schoolma am Well Bella Tyler if you like that better retorted missus Vrain Come now mister Denzil I m not going to let you go away without proving my what do you call it alibi Come with me right along to Camden Hill I ll come just to satisfy myself said Lucian picking up the cloak but I am beginning to feel that it is unnecessary You think I am innocent Well drawled Lydia as Lucian nodded I think that s real sweet of you I mayn t be a saint but I m not quite the sinner that Diana of yours makes me out Diana of mine missus Vrain said Lucian colouring The little woman laughed at his blush Oh I m not a fool young man I see how the wind blows And with a nod she vanished CHAPTER XVIII WHO BOUGHT THE CLOAK missus Vrain sacrificed the vanity of a lengthy toilette to a natural anxiety to set herself right with Lucian and appeared shortly in a ravishing costume fresh from Paris Perhaps by arraying herself so smartly she wished to assure Denzil more particularly that she was a lady of too much taste to buy rabbit skin cloaks in Bayswater or perhaps which was more probable she was not averse to ensnaring so handsome a young man into an innocent flirtation The suspicion she entertained of Lucian s love for Diana only made Lydia the more eager to fascinate him on her own account A conceit of herself a hatred of her stepdaughter and a desire to wring admiration out of a man who did not wish to bestow it These were the reasons which led missus Vrain to be particularly agreeable to the barrister When the pair were ensconced in a swift hansom and rolling rapidly towards Camden Hill she began at once to prosecute her amiable designs I guess you ll not mind being my best boy for the day she said with a coquettish glance You can escort me first of all to the Pegalls and afterwards we can drive to Baxter company s in Bayswater so that you can assure yourself I didn t buy that cloak I am much obliged for the trouble you are taking missus Vrain replied the young man avoiding with some reserve the insinuating glances of his pretty companion We shall do as you suggest Who are the Pegalls may I ask My friends with whom I stopped on Christmas Eve rejoined missus Vrain A real good old dull English family as heavy as their own plum puddings missus Pegall s a widow like myself and I daresay she buys her frocks in the Bayswater stores She has two daughters who look like barmaids and ought to be only they ain t smart enough We had a real Sunday at home on Christmas Eve mister Denzil Whist and weak tea at eight negus and prayers and bed at ten Poppa wanted to teach them poker and they kicked like mad at the very idea but that was when he visited them before I guess Not the kind of family likely to suit you I should think said Lucian regarding the little free lance with a puzzled air I guess not Lead s a feather to them for weight But it s a good thing to have respectable friends especially in this slow coach of an old country where you size everybody up by the company they keep Ah said Lucian pointedly and it must be confessed rather rudely so you have found the necessity of having respectable friends however dull That s a fact acknowledged missus Vrain candidly I ve had a queer sort of life with poppa ups and downs and flyings over the moon I guess You are not American said Denzil suddenly Sakes How do you figure that out Because you are too pronouncedly Amurrican to be American That s an epigram with some truth in it replied Lydia coolly Oh I m as much a U S A article as anything else We hung out our shingle in Wyoming Wis for a considerable time and a girl who tickets herself Yankee this side flies high But I guess I m not going to give you my history concluded missus Vrain drily I m not a Popey nor you a confessor H m You ve been in the South Seas I see There s no telling How do you know The natives there use the word Popey to designate a Roman Catholic You are as smart as they make em mister Denzil There s no flies about you but I m not going to give myself away Ask poppa if you want information He s that simple he ll tell you all Well missus Vrain keep your own secret it is not the one I wish to discover By the way you say your father was at Camden Hill on Christmas Eve I didn t say so but he was answered Lydia quietly He was not very well pop can t stand these English winters and wrote me to come up But he was so sick that he left the Pegalls about six o clock That was the letter which upset you It was I see old Bella Tyler kept her eyes peeled I got the letter and came up at once I ve only got one parent left and he s too good to be shoved away in a box underground while fools live But here we are at the Pegalls I hope you ll like the kind of circus they run Campmeetings are nothing to it The dwelling of the respectable family alluded to was a tolerably sized house of red brick placed in a painfully neat garden and shut in from the high road by a tall and jealous fence of green painted wood The stout widow and two stout spinster daughters who made up the inmates quite deserved missus Vrain s epithet of heavy They were aggressively healthy with red cheeks black hair and staring black eyes devoid of expression a trio of Dutch dolls would have looked more intellectual They were plainly and comfortably dressed the drawing room was plainly and comfortably furnished and both house and inmates looked thoroughly respectable and eminently dull What such a hawk as missus Vrain was doing in this Philistine dove cote Lucian could not conjecture but he admired her tact in making friends with a family whose heavy gentility assisted to ballast her somewhat light reputation while the three of their brains in unison could not comprehend her tricks or the reasons for which they were played At all events these three women are too honest to speak anything but the truth thought Lucian while undergoing the ordeal of being presented So I ll learn for certain if missus Vrain was really here on Christmas Eve The Misses Pegall and their lace capped mamma welcomed Lucian with heavy good nature and much simpering for they also had an eye to a comely young man but the cunning Lydia they kissed and embraced and called dear with much zeal missus Vrain on her part darted from one to the other like a bird pecking the red apples of their cheeks and cast an arch glance at Lucian to see if he admired her talent for manoeuvering Then cake and wine port and sherry were produced in the style of early Victorian hospitality from which epoch missus Pegall dated and all went merry as a marriage bell while Lydia laid her plans to have herself exculpated in Lucian s eyes without being inculpated in those of the family We have just come up from our place in Somerset explained missus Pegall in a comfortable voice The girls wanted to see the sights so I just said we ll go dears and perhaps we ll get a glimpse of the dear Queen I m sure she has no more loyal subjects than we three Are you going out much this year dear missus Vrain asked Beatrice Pegall the elder and plainer of the sisters No dear replied Lydia with a sigh putting a dainty handkerchief to her eyes You know what I have lost The two groaned and Miss Cecilia Pegall who was by way of being very religious in a Low Church way remarked that all flesh was grass to which observation her excellent mamma rejoined Very true dear very true And then the trio sighed again and shook their black heads like so many mandarins I should never support my grief continued Lydia still tearful if it was not that I have at least three dear friends Ah I shall never forget that happy Christmas Eve Last Christmas Eve dear missus Vrain said Cecilia When you were all so kind and good sobbed Lydia with a glance at Lucian to see that he noticed the confirmation We played whist didn t we Four rubbers groaned missus Pegall and retired to bed at ten o clock after prayers and a short hymn Quite a carol that hymn was eh dears And your poor pa was so bad with his cough said Beatrice I hope it is better He went away before dinner too Do say your pa is better Yes dear much better said Lydia and considering it was four months since Christmas Eve Lucian thought it was time mister Clyne recovered He enjoyed his tea though said Cecilia mister Clyne always says there is no tea like ours And no evenings cried Lydia who was very glad there were not Poppa and I are coming soon to have a long evening to play whist again But dear missus Vrain you are not going I must dears with a kiss all round I have such a lot to do and mister Denzil is coming with me as poppa wants to consult him about some law business He s a barrister you know I hope mister Denzil will come and see us again said missus Pegall shaking hands with Lucian A fat puffy hand she had and damp Oh delighted delighted said Denzil hurriedly Cards and tea and sensible conversation said Beatrice seriously no more You forget prayers at ten dear rejoined Cecilia in low tones We are a plain family mister Denzil You must take us as we are Thank you missus Pegall I will Good bye dears cried Lydia again and with a final peck all round she skipped out and into the hansom followed by her escort Damn said missus Vrain when the cab drove away in the direction of Bayswater Oh don t look so shocked mister Denzil I assure you I am not in the habit of swearing but the extreme respectability of the Pegalls always makes me wish to relieve my feelings by going to the other extreme What do you think of them They seem very good people and genuine And very genteel and dull retorted Lydia Like Washington they can t tell a lie for a red cent so you can believe I was there with poppa on Christmas Eve only he went away and I stayed all night Yes I believe it missus Vrain Then I couldn t have been in Jersey Street or Geneva Square sticking Mark with the stiletto No I believe you to be innocent said Lucian gravely In fact I really don t think it is necessary to find out about this cloak at Baxter company s I am assured you did not buy it I guess I didn t mister Denzil but you want to know who did and so do I Well you need not open your eyes I d like to know who killed Mark also and you say that cloak will show it I didn t say that but the cloak may identify the woman I wrongfully took for you She may have to do with the matter Lydia shook her pretty head Not she Mark was as respectable as the Pegall gang there s no woman mixed up in this matter But I saw the shadow of a woman on the blind of No thirteen You don t say In Mark s sitting room Well I should smile to know he was human after all He was always so precious stiff Something in missus Vrain s light talk of her dead husband jarred on the feelings of Lucian and in some displeasure he held his peace In no wise abashed Lydia feigned to take no notice of this tacit reproof but chatted on about all and everything in the most frivolous manner Not until they had entered the shop of Baxter company did she resume attention to business Here she said to the smiling shopwalker I want to know by whom this cloak was sold and to what person The man examined the cloak and noted a private mark on it which evidently afforded him some information not obtainable by the general public for he guided Lucian and his companion to a counter behind which stood a brisk woman with sharp eyes In her turn she also examined the cloak and departed to refresh her memory by looking at some account book When she returned it was to intimate that the cloak had been bought by a man A man repeated Lucian much astonished What was he like A dark man replied the brisk shopwoman dark hair dark eyes and a dark moustache I remember him well because he was a foreigner A foreigner repeated Lydia in her turn A Frenchman No madam an Italian He told me as much Sakes alive cried missus Vrain You are right mister Denzil It s Ferruci sure enough CHAPTER XIX THE DEFENCE OF COUNT FERRUCI It is quite impossible cried missus Vrain distractedly I can t believe it nohow The little woman was back again in her own drawing room talking to Lucian about the discovery which had lately been made regarding Ferruci s purchase of the cloak missus Vrain having proved her own innocence by the evidence of the Pegall family was now trying to persuade both herself and Denzil that the Count could not be possibly implicated in the matter He had no motive to kill Vrain she said a statement with which Lucian at once disagreed I beg your pardon missus Vrain he had two motives said the barrister quickly In the first place he was in love and wished to marry you in the second he was poor and wanted money By the death of your husband he hoped to gain both He has gained neither as yet replied Lydia sharply I like Ercole well enough and at one time I was almost engaged to him But he has a nasty temper of his own mister Denzil so I shunted him pretty smart to marry Mark Vrain I wouldn t marry him now if he dumped down a million dollars at my feet to morrow Besides poppa don t like him at all I ve got my money and I ve got my freedom and I don t fool away either the one or the other on that Italian dude Is the Count acquainted with these sentiments asked Lucian drily I guess so mister Denzil He asked me to marry him two months after Mark s death and I just up and told him pretty plain how the cat jumped In plain English you refused him You bet I did cried Lydia vigorously So you see mister Denzil he could not have killed Mark Why not He did not know your true mind until two months after the murder That s a fact anyhow commented missus Vrain But what the mischief made him buy that rabbit skin cloak I expect he bought it for the woman I mistook for you And who may she be That is just what I wish to find out This woman who came to Jersey Street so often wore this cloak therefore she must have obtained it from the Count I ll make him tell me who she is and what she has to do with this crime Do you think she has anything to do with it said missus Vrain doubtfully I am certain It must have been her shadow I saw on the blind And the man s shadow was the Count s questioned Lydia I think so He bought the cloak for the woman visited the man Wrent at Jersey Street and was seen by the servant in the back yard He did not act thus without some object missus Vrain you may be sure of that Sakes said Lydia with a weary sigh I ain t sure of anything save that my head is buzzing like a sawmill Who is Wrent anyhow I don t know An old man with white beard and a skull cap of black velvet Ugh said missus Vrain with a shiver Mark used to wear a black skull cap and the thought of it makes me freeze up Sounds like a judge of your courts ordering a man to be lynched Well mister Denzil it seems to me as you d best hustle Ercole If he knows who the woman is and he wouldn t buy cloaks for her if he didn t he ll know who this Wrent is I guess he can supply all information Where does he live Number forty Marquis Street saint James s You go and look him up while I tell poppa what a mean white he is I guess poppa won t let him come near me again Pop s an honest man though he ain t no Washington Suppose I find out that he killed your husband asked Lucian rising Then you d best lynch him right away replied Lydia without hesitation I draw the line at murder some The barrister was somewhat disgusted to hear missus Vrain so coolly devote her whilom admirer to a shameful death However he knew that her heart was hard and her nature selfish so there was little use in showing any outward displeasure at her want of charity She had cleared herself from suspicion and evidently cared not who suffered so long as she was safe and well spoken of Moreover Lucian had learned all he wished about her movements on the night of the crime and taking a hasty leave he went off to Marquis Street for the purpose of bringing Ferruci to book for his share in the terrible business However the Count proved to be from home and would not be back so the servant said until late that night Denzil therefore left a message that he would call at noon the next day and drove from saint James s to Kensington where he visited Diana Here he detailed what he had learned and done from the time he had visited missus Bensusan up to the interview with Lydia Also he displayed the cloak and narrated how missus Vrain had cleared herself of its purchase To all this Diana listened with the greatest interest and when Lucian ended she looked at him for some moments in silence In fact Diana with all her wit and common sense did not know how to regard the present position of affairs Well Miss Vrain said Lucian seeing that she did not speak what do you think of it all missus Vrain appears to be innocent said Diana in a low voice Assuredly she is The evidence of the Pegall family given in all innocence proves that she could not have been in Geneva Square or in Jersey Street on Christmas Eve Then we come back to my original belief mister Denzil Lydia did not commit the crime herself but employed Ferruci to do so No replied Denzil decidedly Whether the Italian is guilty or not missus Vrain knows nothing about it If she were cognisant of his guilt she would not have risked going with me to Baxter company and letting me discover that Ferruci had bought the cloak Nor would she so lightly surrender a possible accomplice as she has done Ferruci Whatever can be said of missus Vrain s conduct and I admit that it is far from perfect yet I must say that she appears by the strongest evidence to be totally innocent and ignorant She knows no more about the matter than her father does Well said Diana unwilling to grant her stepmother too much grace we must give her the benefit of the doubt What about Ferruci So far as I can see Ferruci is guilty replied Lucian To clear himself he will have to give the same proof as missus Vrain Firstly he will have to show that he was not in Jersey Street on Christmas Eve secondly he will have to prove that he did not buy the cloak But in the face of the servant s evidence and the statement of the shopwoman he will find it difficult to clear himself Yet added Lucian remembering his failure with Lydia it is always possible that he may do so It seems to me mister Denzil that your only chance of getting at the truth is to see the Italian I think so myself I will see him to morrow Will you take mister Link with you No Miss Vrain As I have found out so much without Link I may as well proceed in the matter until his professional services are required to arrest Count Ferruci By the way I have never seen that gentleman Can you describe his appearance to me Oh as far as looks go there is no fault to be found with him answered Diana He is a typical Italian tall slender and olive complexioned He speaks English very well indeed and appears to be possessed of considerable education Certainly to look at him and to speak with him you would not think he was a villain likely to murder a defenceless old man But if he did not kill my poor father I know not who did I ll call on him to morrow at noon said Lucian and later on I shall come here to tell you what has passed between us This remark brought the business between them to a close but Lucian would fain have lingered to engage Diana in lighter conversation Miss Vrain however was too much disturbed by the news he had brought her to indulge in frivolous talk Her mind busied with recollections of her deceased father and anxiously seeking some means whereby to avenge his death was ill attuned to encourage at the moment the aspirations which she knew Lucian entertained The barrister therefore sighed and hinted in vain His Dulcinea would have none of him or his courting and he was compelled to retire as disconsolate a lover as could be seen To slightly alter the saying of Shakespeare the course of true love never does run smooth but there were surely an unusual number of obstacles in the current of Denzil s desires But as he consoled himself with reflecting that the greater the prize the harder it is to win so it behooved him to do his devoir like a true knight The next day at noon Lucian armed for the encounter with the evidence of Rhoda and of the cloak presented himself at the rooms which Count Ferruci temporarily inhabited in Marquis Street He not only found the Italian ready to receive him but in full possession of the adventure of the cloak which as he admitted he had learned from Lydia the previous evening Also Count Ferruci was extremely indignant and informed Lucian that he was easily able to clear himself of the suspicion While he raged on in his fiery Italian way Denzil who saw no chance of staying the torrent of words examined him at his leisure Ercole Ferruci was as Diana had said a singularly handsome man of thirty five He was dark slender and tall with dark flashing eyes a heavy black moustache and an alert military look about him which showed that he had served in the army The above description savours a trifle of the impossible hero of a young lady s dream and as a matter of fact Ferruci was not unlike that ideal personage He had all the looks and graces which women admire and seemed honest and fiery enough in a manly way the last person as Lucian thought to gain his aims by underhand ways or to kill a helpless old man But Lucian legally experienced in human frailty was not to be put off with voluble conversation and outward graces He wished for proofs of innocence and these he tried to obtain as soon as Ferruci drew breath in his fiery harangue If you are innocent Count said Lucian in reply to the fluent incorrect English of the Italian appearances are against you However you can prove yourself innocent if you will Sir cried Ferruci is not my word good Not good enough for an English court replied Lucian coldly You say you were not in Jersey Street on Christmas Eve Who can prove that My friend my dear friend doctor Jorce of Hampstead sir I was with him oh yes sir he will tell you so Very good I hope his evidence will clear you replied the more phlegmatic Englishman And this cloak I never bought the cloak I saw it not before Then come with me to the shop in Bayswater and hear what the girl who sold it says I will come at once cried Ferruci hastily catching up his cane and hat Come then my friend Come What does the woman say That she sold the cloak to a tall man to a dark man with a moustache and one who told her he was Italian Bah retorted the Count as they hailed a hansom Is all that she can say Why all we Italians are supposed to be tall and dark and wear moustaches Your common people in England never fancy one of us can be fair You are not fair replied Lucian drily and your looks correspond to the description True Oh yes sir But that description might describe a dozen of my countrymen And mister Denzil added the Count laughing I do not go round about saying to common people that I am an Italian It is not my custom to explain Lucian shrugged his shoulders and said no more until they entered the shop in Bayswater As he knew from the previous visit where the saleswoman was located he led the Count rapidly to the place The girl was there as brisk and businesslike as ever She looked up as they approached and came forward to serve them with a swift glance at both I am sorry to trouble you again said Lucian ceremoniously but you told me yesterday that you sold a blue cloak lined with rabbit skin to an Italian gentleman and And am I the gentleman interrupted Ferruci Did I buy a cloak No replied the shopwoman after a sharp glance This is not the gentleman who bought the cloak CHAPTER XX A NEW DEVELOPMENT You see mister Denzil said Ferruci turning triumphantly to Lucian I did not buy this cloak I am not the Italian this lady speaks of Lucian was extremely astonished at this unexpected testimony in favour of the Count and questioned the shopwoman sharply Are you certain of what you say he asked looking at her intently Yes I am sir replied the girl stiffly as though she did not like her word doubted The gentleman who bought the cloak was not so tall as this one nor did he speak English well I had great difficulty in learning what he wanted But you said that he was dark with a moustache and I said all that sir but this is not the gentleman Could you swear to it said Lucian more chagrined than he liked to show to the victorious Ferruci If it is necessary I could sir said the shopwoman with the greatest confidence And after so direct a reply and such certain evidence Denzil had nothing to do but retire from an awkward position as gracefully as he could And now sir said Ferruci who had followed him out of the shop you come with me please Where to asked Lucian gloomily To my friend to my rooms I have shown I did not buy the cloak you speak of Now we must find my friend doctor Jorce to tell you I was not at Jersey Street when you say Is doctor Jorce at your rooms I asked him to call about this time said Ferruci glancing at his watch When missus Vrain speak to me of what you say I wish to defend myself so I write last night to my friend to talk with you this day I get his telegram saying he would come at two hours Lucian glanced in his turn at his watch Half past one he said beckoning to a cab Very good Count we will just have time to get back to your place And what you think now said Ferruci with a malicious twinkle in his eyes I do not know what to think replied Lucian dismally save that it is a strange coincidence that another Italian should have bought the cloak The Count shrugged his shoulders as they got into the hansom but he did not speak until they were well on their way back to Marquis Street He then looked thoughtfully at his companion I do not believe coincidence he said abruptly but in design What do you mean Count I do not quite follow you Some one who knows I love missus Vrain wish to injure me said the Italian rapidly and so make theirself like me to buy that cloak Ah you see But he could not make himself as tall as me Oh yes sir I am sure it is so Do you know any one who would disguise himself so as to implicate you in the murder No Ferruci shook his head I cannot think of one man not one Do you know a man called Wrent asked Lucian abruptly I do not mister Denzil said Ferruci at once Why do you ask Well I thought he might be the man to disguise himself But no added Lucian remembering Rhoda s account of Wrent s white hair and beard it cannot be him He would not sacrifice his beard to carry out the plan in fact he could not without attracting Rhoda s attention Rhoda Wrent What strange names you talk of cried Ferruci vivaciously No stranger than that of your friend Jorce Ferruci laughed Oh he is altogether most strange You see It was as the Italian said doctor Jorce who was waiting for them in the Count s room proved to be a small dried up atom of a man who looked as though all the colour had been bleached out of him At first sight he was more like a monkey than a man owing to his slight queer figure and agile movements but a closer examination revealed that he had a clever face and a pair of most remarkable eyes These were of a steel grey hue with an extraordinary intensity of gaze and when he fixed them on Lucian at the moment of introduction the young barrister felt as though he were being mesmerised For the rest Jorce was dressed sombrely in black cloth was extremely voluble and vivacious and impressed Lucian with the idea that he was less a fellow mortal than a changeling from fairyland Quite an exceptional man was doctor Jorce and as the Italian said most strange My good friend said Ferruci laying his stern hand on the shoulder of this oddity this gentleman wishes you to decide a what do you say bet A bet cried the little doctor in a deep bass voice but with some indignation Do I understand Count that you have brought me all the way from my place in Hampstead to decide a bet Ah but sir it is a bet most important said Ferruci with a smile This mister Denzil declares that he saw me in Pim Pim what In Pimlico said Lucian seeing that Ferruci could not pronounce the word I say that the Count was in Pimlico on Christmas Eve You are wrong sir said Jorce with a wave of his skinny hand My friend Count Ferruci was in my house at Hampstead on that evening Was he remarked Lucian astonished at this confident assertion And at what time did he leave He did not leave till next morning My friend the Count remained under my roof all night and left at twelve o clock on Christmas morning So you see said Ferruci airily to Lucian that I could not have done what you think as that was done by what you said between eleven and twelve on that night Was the Count with you at ten o clock on that evening asked Denzil Certainly he was so you have lost your bet mister Denzil Sorry to bring you such bad fortune but truth is truth you know Would you repeat this statement if I wished Why not Call on me at any time The Haven Hampstead that will always find me Ah but I do not think it will be necessary for mister Denzil to call on you sir interposed the Count rapidly You can always come to me Well mister Denzil are you satisfied I am replied Lucian I have lost my bet Count and I apologise Good day doctor Jorce and thank you Count Ferruci I wish you good bye Not even au revoir said Ferruci mockingly That depends upon the future replied Lucian coolly and forthwith went away in low spirits at the downfall of his hopes Far from revealing the mystery of Vrain s death his late attempts to solve it had resulted in utter failure Lydia had cleared herself Ferruci had proved himself innocent and Lucian could not make up his mind what was now to be done In this dilemma he sought out Diana as knowing from experience that where a man s logic ends a woman s instinct begins he thought she might suggest some way out of the difficulty On arriving at the Royal John Hotel he found that Diana was waiting for him with great impatience and hardly giving herself time to greet him she asked how he had fared in his interview with Count Ferruci Has that man been arrested mister Denzil No Miss Vrain I regret to say that he has not been arrested To speak plainly he has so far as I can see proved himself innocent Innocent And the evidence against him Is utterly useless I brought him face to face with the woman who sold the cloak and she denies that Ferruci bought it But she said the buyer was an Italian She did and dark with a moustache All the same she did not recognise the Count She says the buyer was not so tall and spoke worse English Ferruci could make his English bad if he liked Probably but he could not make his stature shorter No Miss Vrain I am afraid that our Italian friend in spite of the evidence against him did not buy the cloak That he resembles the purchaser in looks and nationality is either a coincidence or Or what seeing that Lucian hesitated Or design finished the barrister And indeed the Count himself is of this opinion He believes that some one who wished to get him into trouble personated him Has he any suspicions as to whom the person may be He says not and I believe him for if he did suspect any particular individual he certainly would gain nothing by concealment of the fact H m said Diana thoughtfully so that denial of the saleswoman disposes of the cloak s evidence What about the Count s presence in Jersey Street on Christmas Eve He was not there But Rhoda the servant saw him both in the house and in the back yard She saw a dark man with a moustache but she could not say that he was a foreigner She does not know Ferruci remember The man she saw must have been the same as the purchaser of the cloak Where does Ferruci say he was At Hampstead visiting a friend Oh And what does the friend say He declares that the Count was with him on Christmas Eve and stayed all night That is very convenient evidence for the Count mister Denzil Who is this accommodating friend A doctor called Jorce Can his word be trusted So far as I can judge from his looks and a short acquaintance I should say so It was half past eight when the servant saw the dark man run out of the yard Yes And at half past eight Ferruci was at Hampstead in the house of doctor Jorce Not that I know of said Lucian remembering that he had asked Jorce the question rather generally than particularly but the doctor declared that Ferruci was with him at ten o clock on that evening and did not leave him until next morning so as your father was killed between eleven and twelve Ferruci must be innocent It would seem so if this doctor is to be believed muttered Diana reflectively but judging by what you have told me there is nothing to show that Ferruci was not in Pimlico at eight thirty and was not the man whom the servant saw Well certainly he could get from Pimlico to Hampstead in an hour and a half However the main point about all this evidence is that neither Ferruci nor Lydia Vrain killed your father No no that seems clear Still still they know about it Oh I am sure of it It must have been Ferruci who was in Pimlico on that night If so he knows who Wrent is and why he stayed in Jersey Street Perhaps although he denies ever hearing the name of Wrent But I would not be surprised if the man who could solve the mystery is Who who Doctor Jorce himself I feel sure of it CHAPTER XXI TWO MONTHS PASS Unwilling to give up prosecuting the Vrain case while the slightest hope remained of solving its mystery Lucian sought out Link the detective and detailed all the evidence he had collected since the constituted authorities had abandoned the matter Although missus Vrain and Ferruci had exculpated themselves entirely Denzil thought that Link with his professional distrust and trained sense of ferreting out secrets might discern better than himself whether such exculpations were warranted by circumstances Link heard all that Denzil had to tell him with outward indifference and inward surprise for while unwilling through jealousy of an amateur to flatter the barrister by a visible compliment yet he silently admitted that Denzil had made his discoveries and profited by them with much acuteness What annoyed him however was that the young man had pushed his inquiries to the uttermost limit and that there was no chance of any glory accruing to himself by prosecuting them further Still on the possibility that something might come of it he went over the ground already traversed by the amateur detective You should have told me of your intentions when Miss Vrain spoke to you in the first instance he said to Lucian by way of rebuke As it is you have confused the clues so much that I do not know which one to take It seems to me that I have pursued each clue until fate or circumstance clipped it short retorted Lucian nettled by this injustice missus Vrain has defended herself successfully much in the same way as Count Ferruci has done Your only chance of getting at the truth lies in discovering Wrent and unless Rhoda helps you there I do not see how you can trace the man I am of a different opinion said Link lying freely to conceal his doubts of success in the matter As you have failed through lack of experience I shall attempt to unravel this skein You attempted to do so before and gave it up because of the tangle said Lucian with quiet irony And unless you discover more than I have done you will dismiss the matter again as impossible So far as I can see the mystery of Vrain s death is more of a mystery than ever and will never be solved I ll make one last attempt to unriddle it however answered Link with a confidence he was far from feeling but of course not being one of your impossible detectives of fiction I may fail You are certain to fail said Lucian decisively and with this disheartening prophecy he left Link to his task of apparently spinning ropes of sand Whether it was that Link was so doubtful of the result as to extend little energy in the search or whether he really found the task impossible of accomplishment it is difficult to say but assuredly he failed as completely as Lucian predicted With outward zeal he set to work interviewed Lydia and the Italian to make certain that their defence was genuine examined the Pegall family who were dreadfully alarmed by their respectability being intruded upon by a common detective and obtained a fresh denial from Baxter company s saleswoman that Ferruci was the purchaser of the cloak Also he cross questioned missus Bensusan and her sharp handmaid in the most exhaustive manner and did his best to trace out the mysterious Wrent who had so much to do with the matter He even called on doctor Jorce at Hampstead to satisfy himself as to the actual time of Ferruci s arrival in that neighbourhood on Christmas Eve But here he received a check for Jorce had gone abroad on his annual holiday and was not expected back for a month In fact Link did all that a man could do to arrive at the truth only to find himself at the end of his labours in the same position as Lucian had been Disgusted at this result he threw up his brief and called upon Diana and Denzil with whom he had previously made an appointment to notify them of his inability to bring the matter to a satisfactory conclusion There is not the slightest chance of finding the assassin of mister Vrain said Link after he had set forth at length his late failures The more I go into the matter the more I see it Yet you were so confident of doing more than I said Lucian quietly Link turned sulkily after the fashion of a bad loser I did my best he retorted gloomily No man can do more Some crimes are beyond the power of the law to punish for sheer lack of proof This is one of them and so far as I can see this unknown assassin will be punished on Judgment Day not before Then you don t think that Signor Ferruci is guilty said Diana No He has had nothing to do with the matter nor has missus Vrain brought about the death in any way You cannot say who killed my father Not for certain but I suspect Wrent Then why not find Wrent asked Diana bluntly He has hidden his trail too well began Link and and And if you did find him finished Denzil coolly he might prove himself guiltless after the fashion of missus Vrain and Ferruci He might sir there is no knowing But since you think I have done so little mister Denzil let me ask you who it is you suspect doctor Jorce of Hampstead Pooh pooh cried Link with contempt He didn t kill the man how could he seeing he was at Hampstead on that Christmas Eve midnight as I found out from his servants I don t suspect him of actually striking the blow replied Lucian but I believe he knows who did Not he doctor Jorce has too responsible a position to mix himself up in a crime from which he gains no benefit Why what position does he hold He is the owner of a private lunatic asylum Is it likely that a man like him would commit a murder Again I deny that he did commit the crime but I am certain from the very fact of his friendship with Ferruci that he knows more than he chooses to tell Why should the Italian be intimate with the owner of a private asylum with a man so much beneath him in rank I don t know sir But if you suspect doctor Jorce you had better see him when he comes back from his holidays in a month Where is he now In Italy and the Count has gone with him Diana and Lucian looked at one another and the former spoke That is strange she said I agree with mister Denzil it is peculiar to say the least of it that an Italian noble should make a bosom friend of a man so far inferior to him in position Don t you think so yourself mister Link Madam said Link gravely I think nothing about it save that you will never find out the truth I have tried my best and failed and I am confident enough in my own power to say that where I have failed no one else will succeed Miss Vrain mister Denzil I wish you good day And with this bragging speech which revealed the hurt vanity of the man mister Link took his departure Lucian held his peace for in the face of this desertion of a powerful ally he did not know what to say Diana walked to the sitting room window and watched Link disappear into the crowd of passers by At that she heaved a sigh for with him she thought went every chance of learning the truth since if he an experienced person in such matters turned back from the quest there could assuredly be no help in any one not professional and with less trained abilities Then she turned to Lucian There is nothing more to be done I suppose said she sighing again I am afraid not replied Lucian dismally for he was quite of her opinion regarding the desertion of the detective Then I must leave this unknown assassin to the punishment of God said Diana quietly And I can only thank you for all you have done for me mister Denzil and say she hesitated and blushed then added with some emphasis say au revoir Ah ejaculated Denzil with an indrawn breath of relief I am glad you did not say good bye I don t wish to say it mister Denzil I have not so many friends in the world that I can afford to lose so good a one as yourself I am content said Lucian softly that you should think of me as your friend for the present His meaning was so unmistakable that Diana still blushing and somewhat confused hastened to prevent his saying more at so awkward a moment Then as my friend I hope you will come and see me at Berwin Manor I shall be delighted When do you go down Within a fortnight I must remain that time in town to see my lawyer about the estate left by my poor father And see missus Vrain No replied Diana coldly Now that my father is dead missus Vrain is nothing to me Indirectly I look upon her as the cause of his death for if she had not driven both of us out of our own home my father might have been alive still I shall not call on missus Vrain and I do not think she will dare to call on me I m not so sure of that rejoined Lucian who was well acquainted with the lengths to which missus Vrain s audacity would carry her but let us dismiss her with all your other troubles May I call on you again before you leave town Occasionally replied Diana smiling and blushing and you will come down to Berwin Manor when I send you an invitation I should think so said Denzil in high glee as he rose to depart and now I will say Good bye said Miss Vrain holding out her hand No I will use your own form of farewell au revoir Then Lucian went out from the presence of his beloved exulting that she had proved so kind as not to dismiss him when she no longer required his services In another woman he would not have minded such ingratitude but had Diana banished him thus he would have been miserable beyond words Also as Lucian joyfully reflected her invitation to Berwin Manor showed that far from wishing to lose sight of him she desired to draw him into yet closer intimacy There could be nothing but good resulting from her invitation and his acceptance and already Denzil looked forward to some bright summer s day in the green and leafy country when he should ask this goddess among women to be his wife If encouragement and looks and blushes went for anything he hardly doubted the happy result In the meantime while Lucian dreamed his dreams Diana also dreaming in her own way remained in town and attended to business She saw her lawyers and had her affairs looked into so that when she went to Bath she was legally installed as the mistress of Berwin Manor and its surrounding acres As Lucian hinted Lydia did indeed try to see her stepdaughter She called twice and was refused admission into Diana s presence She wrote three times and received no reply to her letters so the consequence was that finding Diana declined to have anything to do with her in any way whatsoever she became very bitter This feeling she expressed to Lucian whom she one day met in Piccadilly As if I had done anything finished Lydia after a recital of all her grievances I call it real mean Don t you think so mister Denzil If you ask me missus Vrain said Lucian stiffly I think you and Miss Vrain are better apart Of course you defend her But I guess I can t blame you as I know what you are driving at What about Signor Ferruci asked Denzil parrying Oh we are good friends still but nothing more As he proved that he did not kill Mark I ve no reason to give him his walking ticket But added missus Vrain drily I guess you ll be married to Diana before I hitch up longside Ercole How do you know I shall marry Miss Vrain asked Lucian flushing If you saw your face in a glass you wouldn t ask I guess Tomatoes ain t in it for redness I won t dance at your wedding and I won t break my heart either and with a gay nod missus Lydia Vrain tripped away evidently quite forgetful of the late tragedy in her life CHAPTER XXII AT BERWIN MANOR The heritage of Diana lay some miles from Bath in a pleasant wooded valley through which meandered a placid and slow flowing stream On either side of this water stretched broad meadow lands flat and fertile as well they might be seeing they were of rich black loam and well drained withal To the right these meadows were bounded by forest lands the trees of which grew thickly up and over the ridge and on the space where wood met fields was placed the manor a quaint square building of Georgian architecture and some two centuries old Against the green of the trees its warm walls of red brick and sloping roof of bluish slate made a pleasant spot of colour There stretched a terrace before it beneath the terrace a flower garden and orchard and below these the meadow lands white with snow in winter black in spring with ridgy furrows and golden with grain in the hot days of summer Altogether a lovely and peaceful spot where a man could pass pleasant days in rural quiet a hermitage of rest for the life worn and heart weary Here towards the end of summer came Lucian to rest his brain after the turmoil of London and to court his mistress under the most favourable circumstances Diana had established herself in her ancestral home with a superannuated governess as a chaperon for without such a guardianship she could hardly have invited the barrister to visit her Miss Priscilla Barbar was a placid silver haired old dame who having taught Diana for many years had returned now that the American missus Vrain had departed to spend the rest of her days under the roof of her dear pupil She took a great fancy to Lucian which was just as well seeing what was the object of his visit and complacently watched the growing attachment between the handsome young couple who seemed so suited to one another But her duties as chaperon were nominal for when not pottering about the garden she was knitting in a snug corner and when knitting failed to interest her she slumbered quietly in defiance of the etiquette which should have compelled her to make a third in the conversation of her young friends As for Lucian and his charming hostess they found that they had so many tastes in common and enjoyed each other s society so much that they were hardly ever apart Diana saw with the keen eyes of a woman that Lucian was in love with her and let it be seen in a marvellously short space of time and without much difficulty that she was in love with him But even after Lucian had been at the manor a fortnight and daily in the society of Diana he spoke no word of love Seeing how beautiful she was and how dowered with lands and rents and horses he began to ask himself whether it was not rather a presumption on his part to ask her to share his life He had only three hundred a year six pounds a week and a profession in which as yet he had not succeeded so he could offer her very little in exchange for her beauty wealth and position The poor lover became quite pale with fruitless longing and his spirits fell so low that good Miss Priscilla one day drew him aside to ask about his health For said she if you are ill in body mister Denzil I know of some remedies old woman s medicines you will call them no doubt which with the blessing of God may do you good Thank you Miss Barbar but I am not ill in body worse luck and Lucian sighed Why worse luck mister Denzil said the old lady severely That is an ungrateful speech to Providence I would rather be ill in body than ill in mind explained Denzil blushing for in some ways he was younger than his years And are you ill in mind asked Miss Priscilla with a twinkle in her eyes Alas yes Can you cure me No For that cure I shall hand you over to Diana Miss Priscilla And Lucian coloured again this time with vexation Oh mister Denzil laughed the governess because I am old you must not imagine that I am blind I see that you love Diana Better than my life cried the devoted lover with much fervour Of course That is the usual romantic answer to make Well why do you not tell Diana so with any pretty additions your fancy suggests She might not listen to me said this doubting lover dolefully Very true replied his consoler On the other hand she might Besides mister Denzil however much the world may have altered since my youth I have yet to learn that it is the lady s part to propose to the gentleman But Miss Barbar I am poor What of that Diana is rich Don t I know it For that very reason I hesitate to ask her Because you are afraid of being called a fortune hunter I suppose said the old lady drily That shows a lack of moral courage which is not worthy of you mister Denzil Take an old woman s advice young man and put your fortunes to the test Remember Montrose s advice in the song You approve of my marrying Diana I mean Miss Vrain From what I have seen of you and from what Diana has told me about you I could wish her no better husband Poor girl After the tragical death of her father and her wretched life with that American woman she deserves a happy future And do you think do you really think that she that she would be happy with with me stammered Lucian hardly daring to believe Miss Priscilla whose acquaintance with him seemed too recent to warrant such trust The wise old woman laughed and nodded Ask her yourself my dear she said patting his hand She will be able to answer that question better than I Besides girls like to say yea or nay themselves This seemed to be good advice and certainly none could have been more grateful to the timid lover That very night he made up his mind to risk his fortunes by speaking to Diana It was no easy matter for the young man to bring himself to do so for cool bold and fluent as he was on ordinary occasions the fever of love rendered him shy and nervous The looks of Diana acted on his spirits as the weather does on a barometer A smile made him jocund and hilarious a frown abashed him almost to gloom And in the April weather of her presence he was as variable as a weather cock It is therefore little to be wondered at that one ordinarily daring should tremble to ask a question which might be answered in the negative True Miss Barbar s partisanship heartened him a trifle but he still feared for the result Cupid as well as conscience makes cowards of us all and Lucian was a doubting lover Towards the end of his stay Miss Priscilla as usual fell asleep one evening after dinner and Diana feeling the house too warm stepped out into the garden followed by Lucian The sun had just set behind the undulating hills and the clear sky to the zenith was of a pale rose colour striped towards the western horizon with lines of golden cloud In the east a cold blue prevailed and here and there a star sparkled in the arch of the sky The garden was filled with floating shadows which seemed to glide into it from the dark recesses of the near woods and in a copse some distance away a nightingale was singing to his mate and filling the silence with melody The notes fluted sweetly through the still air mingling with the sigh of the rising wind and the musical splashing of the fountain This shot up a pillar of silvery water to a great height and in descending sprinkled the near flower beds with its cold spray All was inexpressibly beautiful to the eye and soothing to the ear a scene and an hour for love It might have been the garden of the Capulets and those who moved in it the immortal lovers as yet uncursed by Fate Only three more days sighed Lucian as he walked slowly down the path beside Diana and then that noisy London again Perhaps it is as well said Diana in her practical way You would rust here But is there any need for you to go back so soon I must for my own peace of mind Diana started and blushed at the meaning of his tone and words Then she recovered her serenity and sat down on an old stone seat near which stood a weather beaten statue of Venus Seeing that she kept silent in spite of his broad hint Lucian to bring matters to a crisis resolved to approach the subject in a mythological way through the image of the goddess I am sorry I am not a Greek Miss Vrain he said abruptly Why asked Diana secretly astonished by the irrelevancy of the remark Lucian plucked a red rose from the bush which grew near the statue and placed it on the pedestal Because I would lay my offering at the feet of the goddess and touch her knees to demand a boon What boon would you ask said Diana in a low voice I would beseech that in return for my rose of flowers she would give me the rose of womanhood A modest request Do you think it would be granted Do you asked Lucian picking up the rose again How can I reply to your parables or read your dark sayings said Diana half in earnest half in mirth I can speak plainer if you permit it If if you like The young man laid the rose on Diana s lap Then in return for my rose give me yourself mister Denzil cried Diana starting up whereby the flower fell to the ground You you surprise me Indeed I surprise myself said Lucian sadly That I should dare to raise my eyes to you is no doubt surprising I don t see that at all exclaimed Diana coldly I like to be woo d like a woman not honoured like a goddess You are both woman and goddess But you are not angry Why should I be angry Because I I love you I cannot be angry with with shall we say a compliment Oh Diana Wait wait cried Miss Vrain waving back this too eager lover You cannot love me You have known me only a month or two Love can be born in an hour cried Lucian eagerly I loved you on the first day I saw you I love you now I shall love you ever Will you truly love me ever Lucian Oh my darling Can you doubt it And you He looked at her hopefully And I she repeated in a pretty mocking tone and I With a laugh she bent and picked up the flower I take the rose and I give you Yourself cried the enraptured lover and the next moment he was clasping her to his breast Oh Diana dearest Will you really be my wife Yes she said softly and kissed him For a few moments the emotions of both overcame them too much to permit further speech then Diana sat down and made Lucian sit beside her Lucian she said in a firm voice I love you and I shall be your wife when you find out who killed my poor father It is impossible he cried in dismay No We must prosecute the search I have no right to be happy while the wretch who killed him is still at large We have failed hitherto but we may succeed yet and when we succeed I shall marry you My darling cried Lucian in ecstasy and then in a more subdued tone I ll do all I can to find out the truth But after all from what point can I begin afresh From the point of missus Vrain said Diana unexpectedly missus Vrain cried the startled Lucian Do you still suspect her Yes I do But she has cleared herself on the most undeniable evidence Not in my eyes said Diana obstinately If missus Vrain is innocent how did she find out that the unknown man murdered in Geneva Square was my father By his assumption of the name of Berwin which was mentioned in the advertisement also from the description of the body and particularly by the mention of the cicatrice on the right cheek and of the loss of the little finger of the left hand Diana started I never heard that about the little finger she said hurriedly Are you sure Yes I saw myself when I knew your father as Berwin that he had lost that little finger Then Lucian you did not see my father What cried Denzil hardly able to credit her words My father never lost a finger cried Diana starting to her feet Ah Lucian I now begin to see light That man who called himself Berwin who was murdered was not my father No I believe on my soul I believe that my father Mark Vrain is alive CHAPTER XXIII A STARTLING THEORY When Diana declared that her father yet lived Lucian drew back from her in amazement for of all impossible things said of this impossible case this saying of hers was the strangest and most incredible Hitherto not a suspicion had entered his mind but that the man so mysteriously slain in Geneva Square was Mark Vrain and for the moment he thought that Diana was distraught to deny so positive a fact It is impossible said he shaking his head quite impossible missus Vrain identified the corpse and so did other people who knew your father well As to missus Vrain said Diana contemptuously I quite believe she would lie to gain her own ends And it may be that the man who was murdered was like my father in the face but He had the mark on his cheek interrupted Lucian impatient of this obstinate belief in the criminality of Lydia I know that mark well replied Miss Vrain My father received it in a duel he fought in his youth when he was a student in a German university but the missing finger She shook her head He might have lost the finger while you were in Australia suggested the barrister He might rejoined Diana doubtfully but it is unlikely As to other people identifying the body they no doubt did so by looking at the face and its scar Still I do not believe the murdered man was my father If not why should missus Vrain identify the body as that of her husband Why Because she wanted to get the assurance money She may have been misled by the resemblance of the dead man to your father And who provided that resemblance My dear Lucian I would not be at all surprised to learn that there was conspiracy as well as murder in this matter My father left his home and Lydia could not find him I quite believe that As she cannot prove his death she finds it impossible to obtain the assurance money so what does she do I cannot guess said Lucian anxious to hear Diana s theory Why she finds a man who resembles my father and sets him to play the part of the recluse in Geneva Square She selects a man in ill health and given to drink that he may die the sooner and by being buried as Mark Vrain give her the money she wants When you told me of this man Berwin s coughing and drinking I thought it strange as my father had no consumptive disease when I left him and never during his life was he given to over indulgence in drink Now I see the truth This dead man was Lydia s puppet Even granting that this is so which I doubt Diana why should the man be murdered Why cried Diana fiercely Because he was not dying quickly enough for that woman s purpose She did not kill him herself if her alibi is to be credited but she employed Ferruci to murder him You forget Signor Ferruci also proved an alibi A very doubtful one said Miss Vrain scornfully You did not ask that doctor Jorce the questions you should have done Go up to London now Lucian see him at Hampstead and find out if Ferruci was at his house at eight o clock on Christmas Eve Then I shall believe him guiltless till then I hold him but the creature and tool of Lydia Jorce declares that Ferruci was with him at the house when the murder was committed Can you believe that Ferruci may have made it worth the while of this doctor to lie And even granting that much the presence of Ferruci at the Jersey Street house shows that he knew what was going to take place on that night and perhaps arranged with another man to do the deed Either way you look at it he and Lydia are implicated I tell you it is impossible Diana said Lucian finding it vain to combat this persistent belief All this plotting of crime is such as is found in novels not in real life In real life cried Diana taking the words out of his mouth more incredible things take place than can be conceived by the most fantastic imagination of an author Look at this talk of ours it began with words of love and marriage speeches and it ends with a discussion of murder But this I say Lucian that if you love me and would have me marry you you must find out the truth of these matters Learn if this dead man is my father for from what you have told me of the lost finger I do not believe that he is Hunt down the assassin and discover if he is whom I believe him to be Ferruci himself and learn if you can what Lydia has to do with all these evil matters Do this and I am yours Refuse and I shall not marry you You set me a hard task said Lucian with a sigh and I hardly know how to set about it Be guided by me replied Diana Go up to London and put an advertisement in the papers offering a reward for the discovery of my father He is of medium height with grey hair and has a clean shaven face with a scar on it You describe the dead man Diana But he has not lost a finger continued Diana as though she had not heard him If my father for fear of Lydia is in hiding he will come to you or me in answer to that advertisement But he must have seen the report of his death by violence in the papers if indeed he is alive urged Lucian at his wit s end My father is weak in the head and perhaps was afraid to come out in the midst of such trouble But if you put in the advertisement that I his daughter am in England he will come to me for with me he knows he is safe Also call on doctor Jorce and find out the truth about Signor Ferruci And then Then when you have done these two things we shall see what will come of them Promise me to do what I ask you I promise said Lucian taking her hand but you send me on a wild goose chase That may be Lucian but my heart my presentiment my instinct whatever you like to call it tells me otherwise Now let us go inside Shall we tell Miss Barbar of our engagement asked Denzil timidly No you will tell no one of that until we learn the truth of this conspiracy When we do Lucian you will find that my father is not dead but is alive and will be at our wedding I doubt it I doubt it I am sure of it answered Diana and slipping her hand within the arm of her lover she walked with him up to the house It was the strangest of wooings Miss Barbar with a true woman s interest in love affairs was inclined to congratulate them both when they entered deeming as the chance had been so propitious that Lucian had proposed But Diana looked so stern and Lucian so gloomy that she held her peace Later on when her curiosity got the better of her desire not to offend her pupil she asked if Denzil had spoken Yes replied Diana he has spoken And you have refused him cried the old lady in dismay for she did not relish the idea that Lucian should have lost by her counsel No I have not refused him Then you have said yes my dear I have said sufficient replied Diana cautiously Please do not question me any further Miss Barbar Lucian and I understand one another very well She calls him by his Christian name thought the wise old dame that is well She will not speak of her happiness that is ill and in various crafty ways Miss Barbar tried to learn how matters actually stood between the pair But if she was skilful in asking questions Diana was equally skilful in baffling them and Miss Barbar learned nothing more than her pupil chose to tell her and that was little enough To perplex her still further Lucian departed for London the next day with a rather disconsolate look on his handsome face and gave his adviser no very satisfactory explanation at parting So Miss Barbar was forced to remain in ignorance of the success or failure of her counsel and could by no means discover if the marriage she was so anxious to bring about was likely to take place And so ended Denzil s visit to Berwin Manor In the meantime Lucian went back to London with a heavy heart for he did not see how he was to set about the task imposed on him by Diana At first he thought it would be best to advertise as she advised but this he considered would do no good as if Vrain supposing him to be alive and in hiding would not come out at the false report of his murder he certainly would not appear in answer to an advertisement that might be a snare Then Lucian wondered if it would be possible to have the grave opened a second time that Diana might truly see if the corpse was that of her father or of another man But this also was impossible and to speak plainly useless for by this time the body would not be recognisable therefore it would be of little use to exhume the poor dead man whomsoever he might be for the second time Finally Lucian judged it would be wisest of all to call on doctor Jorce and find out why he was friendly with Ferruci and how much he knew of the Italian s doings While the barrister was making up his mind to this course he was surprised to receive a visit from no less a person than mister Jabez Clyne the father of Lydia The little man usually so bright and merry now looked worried and ill at ease Lucian so much as he had seen of him had always liked him better than Lydia and was sorry to see him so downcast Nor when he learned the reason was he better pleased Clyne told it to him in a roundabout way Do you know anything against Signor Ferruci he asked when the first greetings were over Very little and that bad replied Denzil shortly Do you refer to the horrible death of my son in law Yes I do mister Clyne I believe Ferruci had a hand in it and if you bring him here I ll tell him so Can you prove it asked Clyne eagerly No As yet Ferruci has proved that he was not in Geneva Square on the night of the crime or rather added Lucian correcting himself at the hour when the murder was committed Clyne s face fell I wish you could discover if he is guilty or not he said I am anxious to know the truth Why asked Lucian bluntly Because if he is guilty I don t want my daughter to marry a murderer What Is missus Vrain going to marry him Yes said the little man disconsolately and I wish she wasn t So do I for her own sake I thought she did not like him She said as much to me I can t make her out mister Denzil She grew tired of him for a time but now she has taken up with him again and nothing I can say or do will stop the marriage I love Lydia beyond words as she is my only child and I don t want to see her married to a man of doubtful reputation like Ferruci So I thought I d call and see if you could help me I can t replied Lucian As yet I have found out nothing likely to implicate Ferruci in the crime But you may said Clyne hopefully Lucian shrugged his shoulders If I do you shall know at once he said CHAPTER XXIV LUCIAN IS SURPRISED Although Denzil received mister Clyne with all courtesy and promised to aid him if he could in breaking off the marriage with Ferruci by revealing his true character to missus Vrain he by no means made a confidant of the little man or entrusted him with the secret of his plans Clyne as he well knew was dominated in every way by his astute daughter and did he learn Lucian s intentions he was quite capable through sheer weakness of character of revealing the same to Lydia who in her turn since she was bent upon marrying Ferruci might retail them to the Italian and so put him on his guard Denzil therefore rid himself of the American by promising to tell him on some future occasion all that he knew about Ferruci Satisfied with this Clyne departed in a more cheerful mood and apparently hoped for the best After his departure Lucian again began to consider his idea of calling on Jorce regarding the alibi of Ferruci On further reflection he judged that before paying the visit to Hampstead it might be judicious to see Rhoda again and refresh his memory in connection with the events of Christmas Eve With this idea he put on his hat and shortly after the departure of Clyne walked round to Jersey Street On ringing the bell the door was opened by Rhoda in person looking sharper and more cunning than ever She informed him that he could not see missus Bensusan as that good lady was in bed with a cold I don t want to see your mistress my girl said Lucian quickly to stop Rhoda from shutting the door in his face which she seemed disposed to do I desire to speak with you About that there murder asked Rhoda sharply Then in reply to the nod of Lucian she continued I told you all I knew about it when you called before I don t know nothing more Can you tell me the name of the dark man you saw in the yard No I can t I know nothing about him Did you ever hear mister Wrent mention his name No sir He called and he went and I saw him in the back yard at eight point thirty I never spoke to him and he never spoke to me Could you swear to the man if you saw him Yes I could Have you got him with you asked Rhoda eagerly Not at present answered Lucian rather surprised by the vindictive expression on the girl s face But later on I may call upon you to identify him Do you know who he is asked the servant quickly I think so Did he kill that man Possibly said Denzil wondering at these very pointed questions Why do you ask I have my reasons sir Where is my cloak I will return it later on it will probably be used as evidence Rhoda started Where she demanded with a frown At the trial Do you think they ll hang the person who killed mister Vrain If the police catch him and his guilt is proved I am sure they will hang him The girl s eyes flashed with a wicked light and she clasped and unclasped her hands with a quick nervous movement I hope they will she said in a low rapid voice I hope they will What cried Lucian with a step forward Do you know the assassin No cried Rhoda with much vehemence I swear I don t but I think the murderer ought to be hanged I know I know well I know something see me to morrow night and you ll hear Hear what The truth said this strange girl and shut the door before Lucian could say another word The barrister quite dumbfounded remained on the step looking at the closed door So important were Rhoda s words that he was on the point of ringing again to interview her once more and force her to speak But when he reflected that missus Bensusan was in bed and that Rhoda alone could reopen the door which from her late action it was pretty evident she would not do he decided to retire for the present It was little use to call in the police or create trouble by forcing his way into the house as that might induce Rhoda to run away before giving her evidence So Lucian departed with the intention of keeping the next night s appointment and hearing what Rhoda had to say The truth he repeated as he walked along the street Evidently she knows who killed this man If so why did she not speak before and why is she so vindictive Heavens If Diana s belief should be a true one and her father not dead Conspiracy murder this gypsy girl that subtle Italian and the mysterious Wrent My head is in a whirl I cannot understand what it all means To morrow when Rhoda speaks I may But can I trust her I doubt it Still there is nothing else for it I must trust her Talking to himself in this incoherent way Lucian reached his rooms and tried to quiet the excitement of his brain caused by the strange words of Rhoda It was yet early in the afternoon so he took up a book and threw himself on the sofa to read for an hour but he found it quite impossible to fix his attention on the page The case in which he was concerned was far more exciting than any invention of the brain and after a vain attempt to banish it from his mind he jumped up and threw the book aside Although he did not know it Lucian was suffering from a sharp attack of detective fever and the only means of curing such a disease is to learn the secret which haunts the imagination Rhoda as she stated rather ambiguously it must be confessed could reveal this especial secret touching the murder of Vrain but for some hidden reason chose to delay her confession for twenty four hours Lucian all on fire with curiosity found himself unable to bear this suspense so to distract his mind and learn if possible the true relationship existing between Ferruci and Jorce he set out for Hampstead to interview the doctor The Haven as Jorce with some humour termed his private asylum was a red brick house large handsome and commodious built in a wooded and secluded part of Hampstead It was surrounded by a high brick wall over which the trees of its park could be seen and possessed a pair of elaborate iron gates opening on to a quiet country lane Externally it looked merely the estate of a gentleman The grounds were large and well laid out in flower gardens and orchards and as it was doctor Jorce s system to allow his least crazy patients as much liberty as possible they roamed at will round the grounds giving the place a cheerful and populated look The more violent inmates were of course secluded but these were well and kindly treated by the doctor Indeed Jorce was a very humane man and had a theory that more cures of the unhappy beings under his charge could be effected by kindness than by severity His asylum was more like a private hotel with paying guests than an establishment for the retention of the insane and even to an outside observer the eccentricities of the doctor s family as he loved to call them were not more marked than many of the oddities possessed by people at large Indeed Jorce was in the habit of saying that There were more mad people in the world than were kept under lock and key and in this he was doubtless right However the kindly and judicious little man was like a father to those under his charge and very popular with them all Anything more unlike the popular conception of an asylum than the establishment at Hampstead can scarcely be imagined When Lucian arrived at The Haven he found that Jorce had long since returned from his holiday and was that day at home so on sending in his card he was at once admitted into the presence of the local potentate Jorce looking smaller and more like a fairy changeling than ever was evidently pleased to see Lucian but a look on his dry yellow face indicated that he was somewhat puzzled to account for the visit However preliminary greetings having passed Lucian did not leave him long in doubt doctor Jorce he said boldly and without preamble I have called to see you about that alibi of Signor Ferruci s Alibi is a nasty word mister Denzil said Jorce looking sharply at his visitor Perhaps but it is the only word that can be used with propriety But I thought that I was called on to decide a bet Oh that was Count Ferruci s clever way of putting it responded Lucian with a sneer He did not wish you to know too much about his business H m Perhaps I know more than you think mister Denzil What do you mean sir cried Lucian sharply Softly mister Denzil softly rejoined the doctor waving his hand I shall explain everything to your satisfaction Do you know why I went to Italy No no more than I know why you went with Signor Ferruci replied Lucian recalling Link s communication Ah said Jorce placidly you have been making inquiries I see But you are wrong in one particular I did not go to Italy with Ferruci I left him in Paris and I went on myself to Florence to find out the true character of the man Why did you wish to do that doctor Because I had some business with our mutual friend the Count and I was not altogether pleased with the way in which it was conducted Also my last interview with you about that bet made me suspicious of the man Over in Florence I learned sufficient about the Count to assure me that he is a bad man with whom it is as well to have as little to do as possible I intended to return at once with this information and call on you mister Denzil Unfortunately I fell ill of an attack of typhoid fever in Florence and had to stay there these two months I am sorry said Lucian noting that the doctor did look ill but why did you not send on your information to me It was necessary to see you personally mister Denzil I arrived back a few days ago and intended writing to you when I recovered from the fatigue of the journey However your arrival saves me the trouble Now I can tell you all about Ferruci if you like Then tell me Doctor if you spoke truly about that alibi Yes I did Count Ferruci was with me that night and stayed here until the next morning What time did he arrive About ten o clock or to be precise said Jorce about ten thirty Ah cried Lucian exultantly then Ferruci must have been the man in the back yard What do you mean by that asked Jorce in a puzzled tone Why that Count Ferruci has had to do with a crime committed some months ago in Pimlico A man called Mark Vrain was murdered as you may have seen in the papers Doctor and I believe Ferruci murdered him If I remember rightly said Jorce with calmness the man in question was murdered shortly before midnight on Christmas Eve If that is so Ferruci could not have killed him because as I said before he was here at half past ten on that night I don t say he actually killed the man explained Lucian eagerly but he certainly employed some one to strike the blow else what was he doing in the Jersey Street yard on that night You can say what you like doctor Jorce but that man is guilty of Mark Vrain s death No replied Jorce coolly he s not for the simple reason that Vrain is not dead Not dead repeated Lucian recalling Diana s belief No For the last few months Mark Vrain under the name of Michael Clear has been in this asylum CHAPTER XXV A DARK PLOT So Vrain is alive after all was Lucian s comment on the speech of Jorce and he is here under your charge Jove it s wonderful Diana was right after all Diana Who is Diana queried Jorce then held up his hand to stop his visitor from replying Wait I know Vrain mentioned his daughter Diana Yes she is the daughter of Vrain and she believes her father to be alive On what grounds Because the dead man whom until lately she believed to be mister Vrain had one of his little fingers missing That fact came to her knowledge only a week ago When it did she declared that the deceased could not be her father H m said Jorce thoughtfully I am quite in the dark as to why mister Vrain was put under my charge Because Ferruci wished to marry his widow I see Ferruci substituted another man for my patient and had him killed Evidently replied Lucian but I am almost as much in the dark as you are doctor Jorce Tell me how Vrain came to be placed here and exchanging confidence for confidence I ll let you know all I have discovered since the death of the man in Geneva Square who called himself Berwin That is a fair offer replied Jorce clearing his throat and one which I willingly accept I do not wish you to think that I am in league with Signor Ferruci What I did was done honestly I am not afraid of telling my story I am sure of that said Lucian heartily I guessed that Ferruci had not trusted you altogether from the time he feigned that your evidence was needed only to decide a bet Trust me echoed Jorce with scorn He never trusted me at all He is too cunning for that However you shall hear I m all attention Doctor A week before last Christmas Signor Ferruci called to see me and explained that he was interested in a gentleman called Michael Clear whom he had met some years before in Italy Clear he said had been most intimate with him but later on had indulged so much in the morphia habit that their friendship had terminated with high words Afterwards Clear had returned to England and Ferruci lost sight of him for some months Then he visited England and one day found Clear in the street looking ill and wretched The man had become a confirmed morphiamaniac and the habit had weakened his brain The Count pitied the poor creature according to his own story and took him to his home the whereabouts of which Clear was happily able to remember Where is the house asked Lucian taking out his pocketbook Number thirty saint Bertha s Road Bayswater replied Jorce and when the barrister for his private information had made a note of the address he continued It then appeared that Clear was married The wife told Ferruci that she was afraid of her husband who in his fits of drink for he drank likewise often threatened to kill her They had lost their money and the poor woman was at her wit s end what to do Ferruci explained to me that out of friendship he was most anxious to befriend Clear and stated that missus Clear wished to get her husband cured He proposed therefore to put Clear into my asylum and pay on behalf of the wife A very ingenious and plausible plan said Lucian Well Doctor and what did you say I agreed of course provided the man was certified insane in the usual way Ferruci then departed promising to bring missus Clear to see me He brought her late on Christmas Eve at ten Ah interrupted Lucian did she wear a black gauze veil with velvet spots She did mister Denzil Have you met her No but I have heard of her She was the woman who visited Wrent in Jersey Street No doubt Ferruci was waiting for her in the back yard Who is Wrent asked Jorce looking puzzled Don t you know the name Doctor No Did missus Clear never mention it Never Nor Ferruci No I never heard the name before replied Jorce complacently Strange said Denzil reflectively Yet Wrent seems to be at the bottom of the whole plot Well never mind just now Please continue my dear Doctor What did missus Clear say Oh she repeated Ferruci s story amplified in a feminine fashion She was afraid of Michael who when excited with morphia or drink would snatch up a knife to attempt her life Twice she had disarmed him and now she was tired and frightened She was willing for him to go into my asylum since Count Ferruci had so kindly consented to bear the expense but she wished to give him one more chance Then as it was late she stayed here all night So did the Count and on Christmas Day they went away When did they come back About a fortnight later and they brought with them the man they both called Michael Clear What is he like An old man with a white beard Is he mad asked Lucian bluntly He is not mad now only weak in the head replied Jorce professionally but he was certainly mad when he arrived The man s brain is wrecked by morphia Not by drink No although it suited missus Clear and Ferruci to say so But Clear as I may call him was very violent and quite justified missus Clear s desire to sequester him She told me that he often imagined himself to be other people Sometimes he would feign to be Napoleon again the Pope so when he a week after he was in the asylum insisted that he was Mark Vrain I put it down to his delusion But how could you think he had come by the name Doctor My dear sir at that time the papers were full of the case and its mystery and as we have a reading room in this asylum I fancied that Clear had seen the accounts and had as a delusion called himself Vrain Afterwards he fell into a kind of comatose state and for weeks said very little He was most abject and frightened and responded in a timid sort of way to the name of Clear Naturally this confirmed me in my belief that his calling himself Vrain was a delusion Then he grew better and one day told me that his name was Vrain Of course I did not believe him Still he was so persistent about the matter that I thought there might be something in it and spoke to Ferruci What did he say He denied that the man s name was anything but Clear That the wife and two doctors for the poor soul had been duly certified as insane had put him into the asylum and altogether persisted so strongly in his original story that I thought it was absurd to put a crazy man s delusion against a sane man s tale Besides everything regarding the certificate and sequestrating of Clear had been quite legal Two doctors and very rightly too had certified to the insanity of the man and his wife as I then believed missus Clear to be had consented to his detention What made you suspicious that there might be something wrong asked Lucian eagerly My visit to meet you at Ferruci s request to prove the alibi responded Jorce I thought it was strange and afterwards when a detective named mister Link called I thought it was stranger still But you did not see Link No I was in Italy then but I heard of his visit In Florence I heard from a most accomplished gossip the whole story of mister Vrain s marriage and the prior engagement of missus Vrain to Ferruci I guessed that there might be some plot but I could not quite understand how it was carried out save that Vrain as I then began to believe Clear to be had been placed in my asylum under a false name On my return I intended to see you when I was laid up in Florence with the fever Now however that we have met tell me so much of the story as you know Afterwards we shall see mister Vrain Lucian was willing enough to show his confidence in Jorce the more so as he needed his help Forthwith he told him all he knew from the time he had met Michael Clear alias Mark Berwin alias Mark Vrain in Geneva Square down to the moment he had presented himself for information at the gates of The Haven Doctor Jorce listened with the greatest attention his little face puckered up into a grim smile and shook his head when the barrister ended his recital A bad world mister Denzil a bad world he said rising Come with me and I ll take you to see my patient But what do you think of it all said Denzil eager for some comment I ll tell you that rejoined Jorce when you have heard the story of mister Vrain In a few minutes Lucian was led by his guide into a pleasant room with French windows opening on to a wide verandah and a sunny lawn set round with flowers Books were arranged on shelves round the walls newspapers and magazines were on the table and near the window in a comfortable chair sat an old man with a volume in his hand As Jorce entered he stood up and shuffled forward with a senile smile of delight Evidently and with reason poor soul he considered the doctor his very good friend Well well said the cheery Jorce and how are you to day mister Vrain I feel very well replied Vrain in a soft weak voice Who is this Doctor A young friend of mine mister Vrain He wishes to hear your story Alas alas sighed Vrain his eyes filling with tears a sad story sir The father of Diana was of middle height with white hair and a long white beard which swept his chest On his cheek Lucian saw the cicatrice of which Diana had spoken and mainly by which the dead man had been falsely identified as Vrain He was very like Clear in figure and manner but of course the resemblance in the face was not very close as Clear had been clean shaven whereas the real Vrain wore a beard The eyes were dim and weak looking and altogether Lucian saw that Vrain was not fitted to battle with the world in any way and quite weak enough to become the prey of villains as had been his sad fate My name is Mark Vrain young sir said he beginning his story without further preamble I lived in Berwin Manor Bath with my wife Lydia but she treated me badly by letting another man love her and I left her Oh yes sir I left her I went away to Salisbury and was very happy there with my books but alas I took morph Vrain said Jorce holding up his finger no Of course of course said the old man with a watery smile I mean I was very happy there But Signor Ferruci a black hearted villain his face grew dark as he mentioned the name found me out and made me come with him to London He kept me there for months and then he brought me here Kept you where mister Vrain asked Lucian gently The old man looked at him with a vacant eye I don t know he said in a dull voice You came here from Bayswater hinted Jorce Yes yes Bayswater cried Vrain growing excited I was there with a woman they called my wife She was not my wife My wife is fair this woman was dark Her name was Maud Clear my wife s name is Lydia Did missus Clear say you were her husband Michael Yes She called me Michael Clear and brought me to stay with the doctor But I am not Michael Clear CHAPTER XXVI THE OTHER MAN S WIFE As soon as Lucian arrived back in his rooms he sat down at his desk and wrote a long letter to Diana giving a full account of his extraordinary discovery of her father in Jorce s asylum and advising her to come up at once to London When he posted this which he did the same night he sighed to think it was not a love letter He could have covered reams of paper with words of passion and adoration he could have poured out his whole soul at the feet of his divinity telling her of his love his aspirations his hopes and fears No doubt from a common sense view the letter would have been silly enough but it would have relieved his mind and completed his happiness of knowing that he loved and was beloved But in place of writing thus he was compelled by his promise to Diana to pen a description of his late discovery and interesting as the case was now growing he found it irksome to detail the incident of the afternoon He wished to be a lover not a detective So absent minded and distraught was Lucian that Miss Greeb who had long suspected something was wrong with him spoke that very evening about himself She declared that Lucian was working too hard that he needed another rest although he had just returned from the country and recommended a sleeping draught Finally she produced a letter which had just arrived and as it was in a female hand Miss Greeb watched its effect on her admired lodger with the keen eyes of a jealous woman When she saw him flush and seize it eagerly casting meanwhile an impatient look on her to leave the room she knew the truth at once and retired hurriedly to the kitchen where she shed floods of tears I might have guessed it gasped Miss Greeb to a comfortable cat which lay selfishly before the fire He s far too good looking not to be snapped up He ll be leaving me and setting up house with that other woman I only hope she ll do for him as well as I have done I wonder if she s beautiful and rich Oh how dreadful it all is But the cat made no comment on this tearful address not as much as a mew It rolled over into a warmer place and went to sleep again Cats are particularly selfish animals Two days afterwards Miss Greeb opened the door to a tall and beautiful lady who asked for mister Denzil and was shown into his sitting room With keen instinct Miss Greeb decided that this was the woman who had taken possession of Lucian s heart and being a just little creature in spite of her jealousy was obliged to admit that the visitor was as handsome as a picture Then seeing that there was no chance for her beside this splendid lady she consoled herself with a dismal little proverb and looked forward to the time when it would be necessary to put a ticket in the parlour window Meanwhile to have some one on whose bosom she could weep Miss Greeb went round to see missus Bensusan leaving Diana in possession of Lucian and the cat sole occupant of the kitchen In the drawing room on the front floor Diana with her eyes shining like two stars was talking to Lucian She had come up at once on receipt of his letter she had been to Hampstead she had seen her father and now she was telling Lucian about the visit He knew me at once poor dear she said rapidly and asked me if I had been out just as if I d left the house for a visit and come back Ah she shook her head and sighed I am afraid he ll never be quite himself again What does Jorce think He says that father can be discharged as cured and is going to see about it for me Of course he will never be quite sane but he will never be violent so long as morphia and drugs of that sort are kept from him As soon as he is discharged I shall take him back to Bath and put him in charge of Miss Barbar then I shall return to town and we must expose the whole conspiracy Conspiracy What else do you call it Lucian That woman and Ferruci have planned and carried it out between them They put my father into the asylum and made another man pass as him in order to get the assurance money As their tool did not die quickly enough they killed him No Diana Both Lydia and Ferruci have proved beyond all doubt that they were not in Pimlico at the hour of the death I believe they contrived this conspiracy but I don t believe they murdered Clear Well we shall see what defence they make But one thing is certain Lucian Lydia will have to disgorge the assurance money Yes she certainly will and I ve no doubt the Assurance Company will prosecute her for fraud in obtaining it I shall see Ferruci to morrow and force him to confess his putting your father in the asylum No said Diana shaking her head Don t do that until you have more evidence against him I think the evidence of Jorce is strong enough I suppose you mean the evidence of missus Clear Yes although for her own sake I don t suppose she will speak Lucian nodded I thought of that also he said and yesterday I went to saint Bertha Street Bayswater to see her But I found that she had moved and no one knew where she was I expect having received her price for the conspiracy she has left London However I put an advertisement in the papers saying if she called on me here she would hear of something to her advantage It is in the papers this morning I doubt if she will call said Diana seriously What about the promised revelation of Rhoda I believe that girl is deceiving me cried Lucian angrily I went round to Jersey Street as she asked me and only saw missus Bensusan who said that Rhoda was out and would not be back for some time Then I had to wait for you here and tell you all about your father so the thing slipped my memory I have not been near the place since but I ll go round there to night Whatever is Miss Greeb thinking of cried Lucian breaking off quickly That front door bell has been ringing for at least five minutes To Diana s amusement Lucian went and shouted down the stairs to Miss Greeb but as no reply came and the bell was still ringing furiously he was obliged to open the door himself On the step there stood a little woman in a tailor made brown frock a plainly trimmed brown straw hat with a black gauze velvet spotted veil At once Denzil guessed who she was You are missus Clear he said delighted that she had replied so quickly to his advertisement for it had only that morning appeared in the newspapers Yes I am answered the woman in a quick sharp voice Are you the L D who advertised for me Yes Come upstairs I have much to say to you Diana said Lucian on entering the room with his prize let me introduce you to missus Clear missus Clear Are you the wife of the man who was murdered in the house opposite missus Clear uttered a cry of astonishment and turned as if to retreat But Denzil was between her and the door so she saw that there was nothing for it but to outface the situation As though she found it difficult to breathe she threw up her veil and Diana beheld a thin white face with two brilliant black eyes This is a trap said missus Clear hoarsely looking from the one to the other Who are you I said Lucian politely I am the man who met your husband before My husband I have my husband in an asylum You can t have met him You are telling a falsehood said Diana fiercely The gentleman in the asylum of doctor Jorce is not your husband but my father Your father And who are you I am Diana Vrain missus Clear gave a screech and dropped back on to the sofa staring at Diana with wide open and terrified eyes And now missus Clear I see you realise the situation Lucian said coldly You must confess your share in this conspiracy What conspiracy she interrupted furiously The putting of mister Vrain into an asylum and the passing off of your husband Michael Clear as him I don t know anything about it Come now you talk nonsense If you refuse to speak I ll have you arrested at once Arrest me She bounded off the sofa with flashing eyes Yes on a charge of conspiracy It is no use your getting angry missus Clear for it won t improve your position We that is this lady and myself wish to know firstly how your husband came to be masquerading as mister Vrain secondly where we can find the man called Wrent who employed your husband and thirdly missus Clear we wish to know and the law wishes to know who killed your husband I don t know who killed him said the woman looking rather afraid but I believe Wrent did Who is Wrent I don t know You don t know many things said Diana taking part in the conversation but you must tell us what you do know otherwise I shall call in a policeman and have you arrested You can t prove anything against me I think I can said Lucian in the most cheerful manner I can prove that you were in No thirteen of this Square seeing your husband for I found on the fence dividing the back yard of that house from one in Jersey Street a scrap of a veil such as you wear Also the landlady and servant can prove that you called on mister Wrent several times and were with him on the night of the murder Then there is the evidence of your cloak which you left behind and which Wrent gave to the servant Rhoda Also the evidence of Signor Ferruci Ferruci What has he said about me Lucian saw that revenge might make the woman speak so he lied in the calmest manner to get at the truth Ferruci says that he contrived the whole conspiracy So he did said missus Clear with a nod And took you to The Haven at Hampstead on Christmas Eve That s true He took me from Wrent s house in Jersey Street You need not go on mister L D I admit the whole business You do cried Lucian and Diana together Yes if only to spite that old villain Wrent who has not paid me the money he promised Before Lucian and Miss Vrain could express their pleasure at missus Clear coming to this sensible conclusion the door opened suddenly and little Miss Greeb in a wonderful state of agitation tripped in Oh mister Denzil I ve just been to missus Bensusan s and Rhoda s run away Run away Yes She hasn t been back all day and left a note for missus Bensusan saying she was going to hide because she was afraid CHAPTER XXVII A CONFESSION Now indeed Lucian had his hands full Rhoda the red headed servant of missus Bensusan had run away on the plea that she was afraid of something what she did not explain in the note she left behind her and it was necessary that she should be discovered and forced into confessing what she knew of the conspiracy and murder missus Clear not having been paid her

none	none	money had betrayed the confidence and misdeeds of Ferruci thereby revealing an extent of villainy for which neither Diana nor Lucian was prepared Now the Count had to be seen and brought to book for his doings Lydia informed that her husband was in the asylum and Vrain himself had to be released in due form from his legal imprisonment How Lucian even with the assistance of Diana could deal with all these matters he did not know Why not see mister Link suggested Diana when missus Clear had departed after making a clean breast of the nefarious transactions in which she had been involved He may take the case in hand again No doubt responded Denzil drily but I am not very keen to hand it over to him seeing that he has abandoned it twice Again if I call in the police it is all over with Lydia and the Count They will be arrested and punished For the murder of Clear Perhaps if it can be proved that they have anything to do with it certainly for the conspiracy to get the assurance money by the feigned death of your father Well said Diana coldly and why should they not receive the reward of their deeds Quite so but the question is do you wish any scandal Diana was silent She had not looked at the matter from this point of view It was true what Lucian said If the police took up the case again Lydia and her accomplice would be arrested and the whole sordid story of their doings would be in the papers Diana was a proud woman and winced at the idea of such publicity It would be as well to avoid proceeding to such extremities If the assurance money was returned by Lydia she would be reduced to her former estate and by timely flight might escape the vengeance of the defrauded company After all she was the wife of Vrain and little as Diana liked her she did not wish to see the woman who was so closely related to the wronged man put in prison not for her own sake but for the sake of the name she so unworthily bore I leave it in your hands said Diana to Lucian who was watching her closely Very good replied Denzil Then I think it will be best for me to see Ferruci first and hear his confession afterwards call on missus Vrain and learn what she has to say Then Well said Diana curiously what then I will be guided by circumstances In the meantime for the sake of your name we had better keep the matter as quiet as possible missus Clear may speak out missus Clear won t speak said Denzil grimly She will keep quiet for her own sake and as Rhoda has left Jersey Street there will be no danger of trouble from that quarter First I ll see Lydia and the Count to get to the bottom of this conspiracy then I ll set the police on Rhoda s track that she may be arrested and made to confess her knowledge of the murder Do you think she knows anything I think she knows everything replied Lucian with emphasis That is why she has run away If we capture her and force her to speak we may be able to arrest Wrent Why Wrent asked Diana Have you forgotten what missus Clear said I agree with her that he is the assassin although we can t prove it as yet But who is Wrent Ah said Lucian significantly that is just what I wish to find out The upshot of this interview was that early the next morning Denzil went to the chambers of Ferruci in Marquis Street and informed the servant that he wanted particularly to see the Count At first the Italian being still in bed for he was a late riser did not incline to grant his visitor an interview but on second thoughts he ordered Lucian to be shown into the sitting room and shortly afterwards joined him there wrapped in a dressing gown He welcomed the barrister with a smiling nod and having some instinct that Lucian came on an unpleasant errand he did not offer him his hand From the first the two men were on their guard against one another Good morning sir said Ferruci in his best English May I ask why you take me from my bed so early To tell you a story About my friend doctor Jorce saying I was with him on that night sneered the Count Partly and partly about a lady you know Ferruci frowned You speak of missus Vrain No replied Lucian coolly I speak of missus Clear At the mention of this name which was the last one he expected to hear his visitor pronounce the Italian in spite of his coolness and cunning could not forbear a start missus Clear he repeated And what do you know of missus Clear As much as doctor Jorce could tell me Count Ferruci s brow cleared Then you know I pay for keeping her miserable husband with my friend he said composedly It is for her sake I am so kind Rather it is for your own you are so cunning Cunning A most strange word for my goodness said the Count coolly The most fit word you mean replied Lucian impatient of this fencing It is no use beating about the bush Count I know that the man you keep in the asylum is not Clear but Mark Vrain La la la You talk great humbug mister Vrain is dead and buried He is not dead answered Lucian resolutely and the man who was buried under his name is Michael Clear the husband of the woman who told me all Ferruci who had been pacing impatiently up and down the room stopped short with a nervous laugh This is most amusing he said with an emotion he could not conceal despite his self control missus Clear told you all eh She told you what my friend That is the story I have come to tell you replied Lucian sharply Very good said Ferruci with a shrug I wait to hear this pretty story and with a frown he threw himself into a chair near Lucian Apparently he saw that he was found out for it took him all his time to keep his voice from trembling and his hands from shaking The man was not a coward but being thus brought face to face with a peril he little expected it was scarcely to be wondered at that he felt shaken and nervous Moreover he knew little about the English law and hardly guessed how his misdeeds would be punished Still he did not surrender on the spot but listened quietly to Lucian s story in the hope of seeing some way of escape from his awkward position The other day I went to doctor Jorce s asylum said Lucian slowly and there I discovered it matters not how that your friend Clear was mister Vrain also I learned that he had been placed in the asylum by you and missus Clear Jorce gave me her address in Bayswater but when I went there I could not find her she had left I then put an advertisement in all the papers stating that if she called on me she would hear of something to her advantage Now Count it appears that missus Clear was in the habit of looking into the papers to see if there was any message from yourself or your friend Wrent so she saw my advertisement at once and came in person to reply to it One moment mister Denzil said Ferruci politely I know no one called Wrent and he is not my friend We ll come to that hereafter answered Lucian with a shrug In the meantime I ll proceed with my story which I see interests you very much Well Count it seems that Michael Clear was an actor who bore a strong resemblance to mister Vrain save that he had not a scar on his face Vrain at Bath was always clean shaven now he wears a long white beard but that is neither here nor there Clear had a moustache but when that was shaved off he looked exactly like Vrain For purposes of your own which you can easily guess you made the acquaintance of this man a profligate and a drunkard and proposed for a certain sum of money to be paid to his wife that he Michael Clear should personate Vrain and live in the Silent House in Geneva Square under the name of Berwin You knew that Clear was slowly dying of consumption and drink so you trusted that he would die as Vrain that missus Vrain who I believe is in the plot would recognise the corpse by the description in the newspapers and that when Clear was buried as Vrain she would get the assurance money and marry you That is clever said the Count with a sneer But is it true You know best answered Lucian coolly However all turned out as you expected for Clear died as Vrain or rather was murdered at your command as he did not die quickly enough his body was recognised by missus Vrain buried as her husband and she got the assurance money The only thing that remains for your conspiracy to be entirely successful is that missus Vrain should marry you and as I was told by mister Clyne that has pretty well been arranged Do you think then that Clyne would let his daughter marry a man who has done all this said Ferruci who was now very pale I don t believe Clyne knows anything about it replied Lucian coldly You and missus Vrain made up this pretty plot between you Vrain himself told me how you decoyed him from Salisbury and took him to missus Clear s in Bayswater where he passed as her husband although as she confesses she kept him as a kind of prisoner But this is wrong cried Ferruci trying to laugh This is most foolish How would a man of his own will pass as the husband of a woman he knew not A sane man would not but none knew better than you Count that Vrain was not sane and that you dosed him with drugs and let missus Clear keep him locked up in her house until you put him in the asylum Vrain was a puppet in your hands and you locked him up in an asylum a fortnight after the man who personated him was murdered You intended to marry missus Vrain and keep her wretched husband in that asylum all his life The best place for a lunatic said Ferruci Ah cried Lucian Then you admit that that Vrain was mad I admit nothing not even that he is alive If what you say is true said the Italian cunningly how came it that the murdered man had the scar on his cheek He might have been like Vrain eh but not so much missus Clear explained that replied Lucian quickly You made that scar Count with vitriol or some such stuff You don t know chemistry for nothing I see I am quite ignorant of chemistry said Ferruci sullenly Jorce heard a different story in Florence In Florence Did Jorce ask about me there said the Count in alarm He did and heard some strange tales Count Come now it is no use your trying to evade this matter further Jorce can prove that you put Vrain into his asylum under the name of Clear Miss Vrain can prove that the so called Clear is her father and missus Clear who has turned Queen s evidence has exposed the whole of your conspiracy The game s up Count Ferruci sprang from his seat and began to walk hastily up and down the room He looked haggard and pale and years older as he recognised his position for he saw very plainly that he was trapped and that nothing remained to him but flight But how to fly He stopped opposite to Lucian What do you intend to do he demanded in a hoarse voice Have you arrested along with missus Vrain replied Lucian making this threat to force Ferruci into defending himself or confessing missus Vrain is innocent she knows nothing about this conspiracy as you call it I planned the whole thing myself You admit then that the so called Vrain was really Michael Clear Yes I got him to personate the man Vrain so that I could get the assurance money when I married Lydia I chose Clear because he was like Vrain I made the scar on the cheek and I thought he would die soon being consumptive And you killed him No No I swear I did not kill him Did you not take that stiletto from Berwin Manor No I never did I am telling the truth I do not know who killed Clear Did you not visit Wrent in Jersey Street Yes I was the man Rhoda saw in the back yard I was waiting for missus Clear to take her to Hampstead and in the meantime I thought I would climb over the fence and see Clear But the girl saw me so I ran away and joined missus Clear up the road I was not aware at the time that the woman who saw me was Rhoda Afterwards I went to Hampstead with missus Clear to see Jorce Did you buy the cloak I did That girl in Baxter company s told a lie for me I was warned by missus Vrain that you had made questions about the cloak so I went to the girl and told her you were a jealous husband and paid her to say it was not I who bought the cloak She did so quite ignorant of the real reason I wished her to deny knowing me Why did you buy the cloak asked Lucian satisfied with this explanation I bought it for Wrent He asked me to buy it but what he wanted it for I do not know He had it some days before Christmas and I believe gave it to missus Clear and afterwards to the girl Rhoda But of this I am not sure Who is Wrent asked Denzil reserving the most important question for the last Wrent said Ferruci smiling in a sneering way Ah you wish to know who Wrent is Well excuse me for a few minutes and I ll bring you something to show who he is With a nod to Lucian he passed into his bedroom leaving the barrister much astonished He thought that Ferruci was Wrent himself and had gone away to resume the disguise of wig and beard While he pondered thus the Count reappeared carrying a small bottle in his hand mister Denzil said he with a ghastly smile I have played a bold game and thanks to a woman s treachery I have lost I hoped to get twenty thousand pounds and a charming wife but I have gained nothing but poverty and a chance of imprisonment but I am of noble birth and I will not survive my dishonour You wish to know who Wrent is you shall never know He raised the bottle to his lips before Lucian motionless with horror could rush forward and the next moment Count Ercole Ferruci was lying dead on the floor CHAPTER XXVIII THE NAME OF THE ASSASSIN That afternoon London was ringing with the news of Ferruci s suicide but no paper could give any reason for the rash act This inability was due to the police who anxious to capture those concerned in the conspiracy to obtain the assurance money of the Sirius Company kept everything they could out of the papers lest Lydia and Wrent should be put on their guard and so escape Lucian had been forced to report the death of Ferruci to the authorities Now the case was out of his hands again and in those of Link who blamed the young barrister severely for not having brought him into the matter before The detective was always more prone to blame than to praise But what could I do cried Lucian angrily You threw up the case twice You said the assassin of Clear or as you thought Vrain would never be discovered I did my best and failed retorted Link who did not like his position You have had better luck and have succeeded My luck has been sheer hard work Link I was not so faint hearted as you to draw back at the first check Well well the whole truth hasn t been discovered yet mister Denzil As you have found out this conspiracy I may learn who the assassin is We know that already The assassin is Wrent You have yet to prove that I said Lucian with disdain I prove nothing I wash my hands of the whole affair You are a detective let me see what you will make of a case which has baffled you twice and Denzil with rage in his heart went off laughing at the discomfiture of Link At that moment the detective hated his successful rival with his whole heart Lucian took a hansom to the Royal John Hotel in Kensington where Diana in a great state of alarm was reading the evening papers which contained short notices of Ferruci s death On seeing her lover she hurried forward anxiously and caught him by the hand Lucian I am so glad you have come she cried leading him to a chair I sent messages both to Geneva Square and Sergeant s Inn but you were neither at your lodgings nor in your office I was better employed my dear said Lucian with a weary sigh for he was quite worn out with fatigue and anxiety I have been with Link telling him about Ferruci s death and being blamed as the cause of it You blamed And why said Diana with just indignation Because I forced Ferruci to confess the truth and when he saw that there was every chance of his being put into jail for his villainy he went to his bedroom and took poison You know missus Clear said the man was something of a chemist so I suppose he prepared the poison himself It was very swift in its action for he dropped dead before I could recover my presence of mind Lucian this is terrible cried Diana wringing her hands You may well say that he replied gloomily Now the whole details of the case will be in the papers and that unfortunate woman will be arrested Lydia And what will her father say It will break his heart Perhaps but he must take the consequences of having brought up his daughter so badly Still added Lucian reflectively I do not believe that Lydia is so guilty as Wrent That scoundrel seems to be at the bottom of the affair Ferruci and he contrived and carried out the whole thing between them and a precious pair of villains they are Will Wrent be arrested If he can be found but I fancy the scoundrel has made himself scarce out of fright Since he left Jersey Street after the murder he has not been heard of Even missus Clear does not know where he is You know she has put advertisements in the papers in the cypher he gave her according to the arrangement between them but Wrent has not turned up And Rhoda Rhoda is still missing The police are getting warrants out for the servant for Wrent for missus Clear and for Lydia Vrain Ferruci luckily for himself and his family has escaped the law by his own act It was the wisest thing the scoundrel could do to kill himself and avoid dishonour I must admit the man had pluck It is terrible terrible What will be the end of it Imprisonment for the lot I expect unless they can prove that Wrent murdered Clear then they will hang him But now that Ferruci is dead I fancy Rhoda is the only witness who can prove Wrent s guilt That is why she ran away I don t wonder she was afraid to stay But I feel quite worn out with all this Diana Please give me a biscuit and a glass of port I have had nothing all day With a sigh Diana touched the bell and when the waiter made his appearance gave the order She felt low spirited and nervous in spite of the discovery that her father was alive and well and indeed the extraordinary events of the last few days were sufficient to upset the strongest mind Lucian was leaning back in his chair with closed eyes for his head was aching with the excitement of the morning Suddenly he opened them and jumped up At the same time Diana threw open the door with an exclamation and both of them heard the thin high voice of a woman who apparently was coming up the stairs Never mind my name said the voice I ll tell it to Miss Vrain myself Take me to her at once Lydia called Lucian and here Great heavens Why does she come here Diana said nothing but compressed her lips as Lydia followed by the waiter with the biscuits and wine came into the room She was plainly and neatly dressed and wore a heavy veil but seemed greatly excited She did not say a word nor did Diana until the waiter left the room and closed the door Then she threw up her veil revealing a haggard face and red eyes swollen with weeping and filled with an expression of terror Sakes alive isn t this awful she wailed making a clutch at Miss Vrain s arm You ve done it this time Diana Ferruci s dead and your father alive and I m not a widow and my father away I don t know where I was told that the police were after me so I m clearing out Clearing out missus Vrain repeated Diana stiffly I should think so sobbed Lydia I don t want to stay and be put in gaol though what I ve done to be put in gaol for I don t know What cried Lucian indignantly You don t know when this abominable conspiracy is I know nothing of the conspiracy interrupted Lydia Did you not get Ferruci to put your husband into an asylum I I did nothing of the sort I thought my husband was dead and buried until Ferruci told me the truth and then I held my tongue until I could think of what to do After Ercole died his servant came round and told me all he overheard the conversation you had with the Count mister Denzil I was never so astonished in my life as to hear about missus Clear and her husband and Mark alive and and oh Lord isn t it dreadful Give me a glass of wine Diana or I ll go right off in a dead faint In silence Miss Vrain poured out a glass of port and handed it to her stepmother who sipped it in a most tearful mood Lucian looked at the wretched little woman without saying a word and wondered if indeed she was as innocent as she made herself out to be He thought that after all she might be ignorant of Ferruci s plots although she had certainly benefited by them but she was such a glib liar that he did not know how much to believe of her story However she had hitherto only given a general idea of her connection with the matter so when she had finished her wine and was somewhat calmer Lucian begged her to be more explicit Did you know did you guess or even suspect that your husband was alive mister Denzil said Lydia with unusual solemnity as I m a married woman and not the widow I thought I was I did not know that Mark was alive I m bad I daresay but I am not bad enough to shut a man up in a lunatic asylum and pretend he is dead just to get money much as I like it What I did about identifying the corpse was done in good faith You really thought it was my father s body questioned Diana doubtfully I swear I did responded missus Vrain emphatically Mark walked out of the house because he thought I was carrying on with Ferruci which I wasn t It was that Tyler cat who made the trouble between us and Mark was so weak and silly half crazy I think with his morphia and over study that he cleared right out and I never knew where he had gone to When I saw that notice about the murdered man in Geneva Square who called himself Berwin and was marked on the cheek I thought he might be my husband When the coffin was opened I really believed I saw poor Mark s dead body The face was just like his and scarred in the same way What about the missing finger missus Vrain If I remember you even gave a cause for its loss Well it was this way replied Lydia somewhat discomposed I knew that Mark hadn t lost a finger when he left but Ferruci said that if I denied it the police might refuse to believe that the body was that of my husband So as I was sure it was Mark s corpse I just said he had lost a finger out West I didn t think there was any harm in saying so as for all I knew he might have got it chopped off after leaving me But the face of the dead man was as I thought Mark s and he called himself Berwin which you know Diana is the name of the Manor and the scar was on the cheek I know now it was all contrived by Ercole but then I was quite ignorant When did you find out the truth After that cloak business Ferruci came to me and I told him what that girl at Baxter s had said and insisted that he should tell me the truth Well he did in order to force me to marry him and then I told him to go and make it right with the girl so that when mister Denzil went again she d deny that Ercole had bought the cloak She denied it sure enough said Lucian grimly Ferruci before he died told me he had bribed her to speak falsely What more did the Count reveal to you missus Vrain the conspiracy Yes He said he d found Mark hiding at Salisbury half mad with morphia and had taken him up to missus Clear s where it seems he went mad altogether so they locked him up as her husband in a lunatic asylum Ferruci also told me that he had seen Michael Clear on the stage and that as he was so like Mark and was likely to die of drink and consumption he got him to play the part of Mark in Geneva Square under the name of Berwin missus Clear visited her husband there by climbing over a back fence and getting down a cellar somehow I know that said Lucian It was missus Clear s shadow I saw on the blind She was fighting with her husband and when I rang the bell they were both so alarmed that they left the house by the back way and got into Jersey Street Then missus Clear went home and the man himself came round into the Square by the front way That was how I met him I wondered how people were in the house during his absence missus Clear told me all Did she say why her husband made you examine the house asked Diana No But I expect he made me do so that I should not have my suspicions about that back entrance But missus Vrain when Ferruci confessed that your husband was alive why did you not tell it to the world Well I d got the assurance money you see said Lydia with shrewd candour and I thought the company would make a fuss and take it back as I suppose they will now Ferruci wanted me to marry him but I wasn t so bad as that I did not want to commit bigamy But I really held my tongue because Ferruci told me who killed Clear He knew then cried Lucian and denied it to me Who killed the man Wrent did the man who lived in Jersey Street And who is at the bottom of the whole plot said Lucian furiously Do you know where he is to be found Yes said Lydia boldly I do but I m not going to tell where he is Why not Because I don t want him punished But I do said Diana angrily He is a wretch who ought to suffer Very well said Lydia loudly and spitefully then make him suffer for this Wrent is your own father It was Mark who killed Michael Clear CHAPTER XXIX LINK SETS A TRAP In the course of their acquaintance Diana had put up with a great deal from the little American adventuress owing to her position of stepmother but when she heard her accusing the man she had ruined of murder the patience of Miss Vrain gave way She rose quickly and walking over to where Lydia was shrinking in her chair towered in righteous indignation above the shameless little woman You lie missus Vrain she said in a low distinct voice with a flushed face and indignation in her eyes You know you lie I I only repeat what Ferruci told me whimpered Lydia rather alarmed by the attitude of her stepdaughter I m sure I hope Mark didn t kill the man but Ercole said that he was in Jersey Street for that purpose It is not true My father was in the asylum at Hampstead Indeed he wasn t not at the time Clear was killed protested Lydia He was not put into the asylum until at least two weeks after Christmas Is that not so mister Denzil It is so assented Lucian gravely but even admitting so much it is impossible to believe that mister Vrain was in Jersey Street For many months before Christmas he was in charge of missus Clear at Bayswater So Ercole said replied Lydia but he used to get away from missus Clear at times and had to be brought back He wandered when he got the chance said Lucian with hesitation I admit as much Well then when he was not at Bayswater he used to live in Jersey Street as Wrent Ferruci found him out there and tried to get him to go back and he took missus Clear several times to the same place in order to persuade him to return to Bayswater That was why missus Clear visited Jersey Street Oh Mark played his part there as mister Wrent I guess there ain t no two questions about that finished Lydia triumphantly He is the assassin you bet I don t believe it cried Diana furiously Why my father is too weak in the head to have the will let alone the courage to masquerade like that He is like a child in leading strings That s his cunning Diana He s cute enough to pretend madness so that he won t be hanged It is impossible that Vrain can be Wrent said Lucian decidedly I agree with Miss Vrain he is too weak and irresponsible to carry out such a deed Besides I don t see how you prove him guilty of the murder you do not even know that he could enter the Silent House by the secret way I don t know anything about it except what Count Ferruci told me said Lydia obstinately And he said that Vrain as Wrent killed Clear But you can easily prove if it s true or not How can we prove it asked Diana coldly By laying a trap for Mark You know at least Ercole told me and I suppose missus Clear told you that she corresponded with Mark Wrent I mean in the agony column of the Daily Telegraph By means of a cypher Yes I know that but she hasn t received any answer yet Of course not replied Lydia with triumph because Wrent that s Mark you know is in the asylum and can t answer her This is all nonsense broke in Lucian impatient of this cobweb spinning I don t believe a word of Ferruci s story If Vrain lived in Jersey Street as Wrent why should missus Clear visit him To get him back to Bayswater Nonsense nonsense And even admitting as much why should missus Clear in the newspapers correspond in cypher with a man whom she not only knows is in an asylum as her husband but who can be seen by her at any time I quite agree with you Lucian cried Diana emphatically Count Ferruci told a pack of falsehoods to missus Vrain The thing is utterly absurd Oh I guess I m not so easily made a fool of as all that cried Lydia firing up If you don t believe me lay the trap I told you of Let Mark go free out of the asylum get missus Clear with her cypher and newspapers to ask him to meet her in the house where Clear was murdered and then you ll see if Mark won t turn up in his character of Wrent He will not cried Diana vehemently He will not Mark when he left me went on the angry Lydia had plenty of hair and was clean shaven Now as Ferruci told me for I haven t seen him he is bald and wears a skull cap of black velvet and a white beard After Ercole told me about Jersey Street I went there to ask that fat woman about Mark she said he had gone away two days after Christmas and described him as an old man with a skull cap and a white beard Oh cried Lucian for he recollected that Rhoda gave the same description Ah you know I speak the truth said Lydia rising but I ve had enough of all this I ve lost my money and I don t suppose I ll go back to Mark I ve been treated badly all round and I don t know what poppa will say But I m going out of London to meet him You said you did not know where your father was cried Diana scornfully I don t tell you everything Diana retorted Lydia looking very wicked but if you must know poppa went over to Paris last week and I m going over there to meet him He ll raise Cain for the way I ve been treated Well said Lucian as she prepared to take her leave I hope you ll get away Do you intend to stop me mister Denzil flashed out missus Vrain furiously Not I but I ll give you a hint the railway stations will be watched by the police For me said Lydia with a scared expression Oh sakes it s awful and I ve done nothing It s not my fault if I got the assurance money I really thought that Mark was dead But I ll try and get away to poppa he ll put things right Good bye mister Denzil and Diana you ve done me a heap of harm but I don t bear malice and missus Vrain rushed out of the room in a great hurry to escape the chance of arrest hinted at by Lucian She had a sharp eye to her own safety Diana waited until the cab which Lydia had kept waiting was driving away and then turned with an anxious expression on her face to look at Lucian My dear she said taking his arm what do you think of Lydia s accusation Against your father said Lucian Why I don t believe it Nor do I but it will be as well to set the trap she suggests for if my father does not fall into it and as he is not Wrent I don t believe he will the real man may keep the appointment with missus Clear Whosoever Wrent is I don t think he ll come again to the Silent House replied the barrister shaking his head It would be thrusting his head into the lion s jaws If he is in London he ll see the death of Ferruci described in the papers and no doubt will guess that the game is up so he ll keep away Nevertheless we ll do as Lydia suggests said Diana obstinately You see mister Link and missus Clear and arrange about the cypher Then my father is to be discharged as cured to morrow and I ll let him go out if he pleases Of course I ll follow him then I ll be able to see if he goes to Pimlico But Diana suppose he does go to the Silent House and proves to be Wrent He won t do that my dear My father is no more Wrent than you are I believe Lydia speaks in the full belief that he is but Ferruci for his own ends lied to her However to trap the real man let us do as Lydia suggests The idea is a good one Well we ll try said Lucian with a sigh But I do hope Diana that this case will end soon Every week there is some fresh development in a new direction and I am getting quite bewildered over it It will end with the capture of Wrent the assassin I hope so and God grant Wrent does not prove to be your father There is no fear of that said Diana gravely My father is insane more or less but he is not a murderer I am quite content to risk the trap suggested by that woman Lucian did not at once adopt the plan to net Wrent whosoever he might be invented by Lydia and approved of by Diana On the whole he could not bring himself to believe that a weak headed foolish old creature like Vrain had masqueraded in Jersey Street as Wrent Still there were certain suspicious incidents which fitted in very neatly with Ferruci s story missus Clear had stated that Vrain when under her charge escaped several times and had remained away for several days until brought back again by the Count Again the appearance of Wrent as described by Rhoda was precisely the same as the looks of Vrain when Lucian saw him in the Hampstead asylum so it seemed that there might be some truth in the story But it s impossible said Lucian to himself Vrain is half mad and incapable of conducting his own life or arranging so cleverly to commit a crime Also he had no money and had he lived in Jersey Street would not have been able to pay missus Bensusan There is something more in the coincidence of this similarity of looks than meets the eye I ll see Link and hear what he has to say on the subject It s time he found out something The next day Lucian paid a visit to Link but was not received very amiably by that gentleman who proved to be in a somewhat bad temper He was not altogether pleased with Lucian finding out more about the case than he had discovered himself and also to further ruffle his temper the clever Lydia had given him the slip He had called at her Mayfair house with a warrant for her arrest only to find out that having received timely warning from Ferruci s servant she had fled In vain the railway stations had been watched Lydia taking the hint given to her by Lucian had baffled that peril by taking the Dover train at a station outside London Lucian heard what Link had to say on the subject but did not reveal the fact that Lydia had paid a visit to Diana or had gone to meet her father at Dover He did not want to give the little woman up to justice as he was beginning to believe her innocent and that in all truth she had known nothing of the Ferruci Wrent conspiracy Therefore giving no information to Link as to the little woman s whereabouts Denzil told as coming from himself his idea that Wrent might fall into a trap set for him in the Pimlico House by means of missus Clear s cypher Link listened to the tale attentively and decided to adopt the idea It is a good one he admitted generously and I m not jealous enough to cut off my nose to spite my face You have had the better of me all through this case mister Denzil and we have had words over it but I ll show you that I can appreciate your cleverness by adopting your plan I am greatly obliged to you for your good opinion said Lucian drily for he saw with some humour that Link was only too anxious to benefit by the very cleverness of which he pretended to be so jealous And you will see missus Clear Yes I ll see her at once and get her to invite Wrent to Pimlico by that cypher with a threat that she will betray the whole plot if he does not come I daresay he knows already that missus Clear is a traitress Impossible replied Link quickly I have kept missus Clear s name out of the papers It is known that Ferruci is dead and that missus Vrain is likely to be arrested in connection with her supposed husband s murder But the fact of missus Clear putting the real Vrain into the asylum is not known nor indeed anything about the woman If Wrent thinks she ll tell tales he ll meet her in their own hunting grounds in Geneva Square to make his terms Hitherto he has not replied to her requests for money but now he ll think she is driven into a corner and will fix her up once and for all Do you think that Wrent is Vrain Good Lord no replied Link staring What put that into your head Lucian immediately told about the supposed connection between Vrain and Wrent but suppressing that it was Lydia s or Ferruci s idea based his supposition on the fact of the resemblance between the two men Link heard the theory with scorn and scouted the idea that the two men could be one and the same I ve seen Vrain said he The old man is as mad as a March hare and as silly as a child He s in his dotage and could not possibly carry out such a plan But we can easily learn the truth From whom asked Lucian Ah mister Denzil you are not so clever as you think yourself scoffed Link Why from missus Clear to be sure She visited at Jersey Street and saw Wrent and as Vrain was then with her in the character of her husband she ll be able to tell us if they are two men or one person You are right Link I never thought of that He he Then I can still teach you something replied Link in high good humour at having for once scored off the too clever barrister and forthwith went off to see missus Clear How this interview with that lady sped or what she told him he refused to reveal to Lucian but its result was that a cypher appeared in the agony column of the Daily Telegraph calling upon Wrent to meet her in the Silent House in Pimlico under the penalty of her telling the police all she knew if he did not come In the same issue of the paper in which this message appeared there was a paragraph stating that missus Vrain had been arrested at Dover CHAPTER XXX WHO FELL INTO THE TRAP 
6544_231862_000001_000000	train-clean-360	However closely one may study the fair sex there is no understanding them in the least 
none	none	No one can say how a woman will act in a given situation for feminine actions are based less on logical foundations than on the emotion of the moment 
6544_231862_000002_000000	train-clean-360	Diana had never liked Lydia when the American girl became her stepmother she hated her and not only said as much but showed in her every action that she believed what she said 
none	none	She declared that she would be glad to see Lydia deprived of her money and put into jail 
6544_231862_000002_000002	train-clean-360	The punishment would be no more than she deserved 
6544_231862_000003_000000	train-clean-360	Yet when these things came to pass when by the discovery that Vrain yet lived Lydia lost her liberty and when as connected with the conspiracy she was arrested on a criminal warrant and put into prison Diana was the only friend she had 
6544_231862_000003_000001	train-clean-360	Miss Vrain declared that her stepmother was innocent visited her in prison and engaged a lawyer to defend her 
6544_231862_000003_000002	train-clean-360	Lucian could not forbear pointing out the discrepancy between Diana s past sentiments and her present actions but Miss Vrain was quite ready with an excuse 
6544_231862_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 I am only doing my duty she said 
6544_231862_000004_000001	train-clean-360	 In herself I like Lydia as little as ever I did but I think we have suspected her wrongly in being connected with this conspiracy so I wish to help her if possible 
6544_231862_000004_000002	train-clean-360	And after all added Diana she is my father s wife as if that fact extenuated all 
6544_231862_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 He has reason to know it replied Lucian bitterly 
6544_231862_000005_000001	train-clean-360	 If it had not been for Lydia your father would not have left his home for a lunatic asylum nor would Clear have been murdered 
none	none	I quite agree with you Lucian but some good has come out of this evil for if things had not been as they are you and I would never have met
6544_231862_000007_000000	train-clean-360	 Egad that is true said Lucian kissing her 
6544_231862_000007_000001	train-clean-360	 It s an ill wind that blows nobody any good 
6544_231862_000008_000000	train-clean-360	So Diana played the part of a Good Samaritan towards her stepmother and helped her to bear the evil of being thrust into prison 
6544_231862_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Lydia wrote to her father in Paris but received no reply and therefore was without a friend in the world save Diana 
6544_231862_000008_000002	train-clean-360	Later on she was admitted to bail and Diana took her to the hotel in Kensington there to wait for the arrival of mister Clyne 
none	none	His absence and silence were both unaccountable
6544_231862_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 I hope nothing is wrong with poppa wept Lydia 
none	none	As a rule he is always smart in replying and if he has seen about Ercole s death and my imprisonment in the papers I m sure he will be over soon 
6544_231862_000010_000000	train-clean-360	While she was thus waiting for her father and Link in every way was seeking evidence against her missus Clear received an answer to her message 
none	none	In the same column of the Daily Telegraph and in the same cypher there appeared a message from Wrent that he would meet missus Clear at No thirteen Geneva Square Link was delighted when missus Clear showed him this and rubbed his hands with much pleasure 
6544_231862_000011_000001	train-clean-360	Affairs were about to be brought to a crisis and as Link was the moving spirit in the matter his vanity was sufficiently gratified as to make him quite amiable 
6544_231862_000012_000000	train-clean-360	 We ve got him this time mister Denzil he said with enthusiasm 
6544_231862_000012_000001	train-clean-360	 You and I and a couple of policemen will go down to that house in Geneva Square by the front sir by the front 
6544_231862_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 missus Clear also questioned Lucian wishing to be enlightened on all points 
none	none	No 
6544_231862_000014_000001	train-clean-360	She ll come in by the back down the cellarway as Wrent expects her to come 
none	none	Then he ll follow in the same path and walk right into the trap
6544_231862_000015_000000	train-clean-360	 But won t the two be seen climbing over that fence in the daytime asked the barrister doubtfully 
6544_231862_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Who said anything about the daytime mister Denzil 
6544_231862_000016_000001	train-clean-360	I did not and Wrent knows too much to risk himself at a time that he can be seen from the windows of the adjacent houses 
none	none	No no The meeting with missus Clear is to take place in the front room at ten o clock when it will be quite dark You I and the policemen will hide in what was the bedroom and listen to what Wrent has to say to missus Clear 
6544_231862_000016_000005	train-clean-360	We ll give him rope enough to hang himself sir and then pounce out and nab him 
6544_231862_000017_000000	train-clean-360	 Well he won t show much fight if he is mister Vrain 
6544_231862_000018_000000	train-clean-360	 I don t believe he is mister Vrain retorted the detective bluntly 
6544_231862_000019_000000	train-clean-360	 I am doubtful of that also admitted Lucian but you know Vrain is now out of the asylum and for the time being has been left to his own devices 
none	none	The reply to the cypher did not appear until he was in that position 
6544_231862_000019_000002	train-clean-360	Supposing after all this mysterious Wrent proves to be this unhappy man 
6544_231862_000020_000000	train-clean-360	 In that case he ll have to pay for his whistle sir 
6544_231862_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 You mean in connection with the conspiracy 
6544_231862_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes and perhaps with the murder of Clear but we don t know if the so called Wrent committed the crime 
6544_231862_000022_000001	train-clean-360	For such reason mister Denzil I wish to overhear what he says to missus Clear 
6544_231862_000022_000002	train-clean-360	It is as well to give him enough rope to hang himself with 
6544_231862_000023_000000	train-clean-360	 Can you trust missus Clear 
none	none	Absolutely 
6544_231862_000024_000001	train-clean-360	She knows on which side her bread is buttered 
none	none	Her only chance of getting free from her share of the matter is to turn Queen s evidence and she intends to do so What did she say about Vrain being Wrent
6544_231862_000026_000000	train-clean-360	 Well sir said Link putting his head on one side and looking at Lucian with an odd expression you had better wait till the man s caught before I answer that question 
6544_231862_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Then maybe you won t require an answer 
6544_231862_000027_000000	train-clean-360	 It is very probable I won t replied Lucian drily 
none	none	What time am I to see you to night
6544_231862_000028_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll call for you at nine o clock sharp and we ll go across to the house at once 
6544_231862_000028_000001	train-clean-360	I have the key in my pocket now 
6544_231862_000028_000002	train-clean-360	Peacock gave it to me this morning 
none	none	The scene will be quite dramatic
6544_231862_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 I hope it won t prove to be Vrain said Lucian restlessly for he thought how grieved Diana would be 
6544_231862_000030_000000	train-clean-360	 I hope not answered Link curtly but there s no knowing 
6544_231862_000030_000001	train-clean-360	However if the old man does get into trouble he can plead insanity 
6544_231862_000030_000002	train-clean-360	His having been in the asylum of Jorce is a strong card for him to play 
6544_231862_000030_000003	train-clean-360	Good day mister Denzil 
none	none	I ll see you to night at nine o clock sharp
6544_231862_000031_000000	train-clean-360	 Good day replied Lucian and the pair parted for the time being 
none	none	Lucian did not go near Diana that day 
6544_231862_000032_000001	train-clean-360	In the first place he did not wish to see Lydia for whom he had no great love and in the second he was afraid to speak to Diana as to the possibility of her father being Wrent 
6544_231862_000033_000000	train-clean-360	Diana as a good daughter should held firmly to the idea that her father could not behave in such a way and as a sensible woman she did not think that a man with so few of his senses about him could have acted the dual part with which he was credited without in some measure betraying himself 
6544_231862_000034_000000	train-clean-360	Lucian was somewhat of this opinion himself yet he had an uneasy feeling that Vrain might prove to be the culprit 
6544_231862_000034_000001	train-clean-360	The fact of Vrain s being often away from missus Clear s house in Bayswater and Wrent absent in the same way from missus Bensusan s house in Jersey Street appeared strange and argued a connection between the two 
6544_231862_000034_000002	train-clean-360	Again the resemblance between them was most extraordinary and unaccountable 
none	none	On the whole Lucian was not satisfied in his mind as to what would be the end of the matter and had he known missus Clear s address he would have gone to question her about it 
6544_231862_000035_000001	train-clean-360	But only Link knew where the woman was to be found and kept that information to himself especially from Denzil 
none	none	Now that he had the reins once more in his hands he did not intend that the barrister should take them again 
6544_231862_000036_000000	train-clean-360	Punctual to the minute Link in a state of subdued excitement came to Lucian s rooms 
6544_231862_000036_000001	train-clean-360	Already he had sent his two policemen over to the house into which he had instructed them to enter in the quietest and most unostentatious manner and now came to escort the barrister across 
6544_231862_000037_000000	train-clean-360	Lucian put on his hat at once and the two walked out into the dark night for dark it was with no moon few stars and a great many clouds 
6544_231862_000037_000001	train-clean-360	A most satisfactory night for their purpose 
6544_231862_000038_000000	train-clean-360	 All the better said Link casting a look round the deserted square all the better for our little game 
6544_231862_000038_000001	train-clean-360	I wish to secure this fellow as quietly as possible 
6544_231862_000038_000002	train-clean-360	Here s the door open in with you mister Denzil 
6544_231862_000039_000000	train-clean-360	According to instructions a policeman had waited behind the closed door and at the one sharp knock of his superior opened it at once so that the two slipped in as speedily as possible 
6544_231862_000039_000001	train-clean-360	Link had a dark lantern which he used carefully so that no light could be seen from the window looking on to the square and with his three companions he went into the back room which had formerly been used by Clear as a sleeping apartment 
6544_231862_000039_000002	train-clean-360	Here the two policemen stationed themselves in one corner and Link with Lucian waited near the door leading into the sitting room so as to be ready for missus Clear 
none	none	All was so dark and lonely and silent that Lucian s nerves became over strained and it was as much as he could do to prevent himself from trembling violently 
6544_231862_000040_000001	train-clean-360	In a whisper he conversed with Link 
6544_231862_000041_000000	train-clean-360	 Have you heard anything of that girl Rhoda he asked 
6544_231862_000042_000000	train-clean-360	 We have traced her to Berkshire whispered Link 
6544_231862_000042_000001	train-clean-360	 She went back to her gypsy kinsfolk you know 
none	none	I dare say we ll manage to lay hands on her sooner or later She is an accomplice of Wrent s I believe
6544_231862_000044_000000	train-clean-360	 So do I and I hope to make him confess as much to night 
none	none	Hush 
6544_231862_000045_000000	train-clean-360	Suddenly Link had laid his clasp on Lucian s wrist to command silence and the next moment they heard the swish swish of a woman s dress coming along the passage 
6544_231862_000045_000001	train-clean-360	She entered the sitting room cautiously moving slowly in the darkness and stole up to the door behind which Lucian and the detective were hiding 
6544_231862_000045_000002	train-clean-360	The position of this she knew well because it was opposite the window 
6544_231862_000046_000000	train-clean-360	 Are you there whispered missus Clear nervously 
6544_231862_000047_000000	train-clean-360	 Yes replied Link in the same tone 
6544_231862_000047_000001	train-clean-360	 Myself mister Denzil and two policemen 
none	none	Keep the man in talk and find out if possible if he committed the murder I hope he won t kill me muttered missus Clear
6544_231862_000048_000001	train-clean-360	 He will if he knows I ve betrayed him 
6544_231862_000049_000000	train-clean-360	 That will be all right said Link in a low impatient voice 
none	none	We will rush out should he prove dangerous Get over by the window so that we can see a little of you and Wrent when you talk No no Don t leave the door open 
6544_231862_000050_000001	train-clean-360	He ll see you 
6544_231862_000051_000000	train-clean-360	 He won t missus Clear 
6544_231862_000051_000001	train-clean-360	We ll keep back in the darkness 
6544_231862_000051_000002	train-clean-360	If he shows a light we ll rush him before he can use a weapon or clear out 
6544_231862_000051_000003	train-clean-360	Get back to the window 
6544_231862_000052_000000	train-clean-360	 I hope I ll get through with this all right said missus Clear nervously 
6544_231862_000052_000001	train-clean-360	 It s an awful situation and she moved stealthily across the floor to the window 
6544_231862_000053_000000	train-clean-360	There was a faint gaslight outside and the watchers could see her figure and profile black against the slight illumination 
6544_231862_000053_000001	train-clean-360	All was still and silent as the grave when they began their dreary watch 
6544_231862_000054_000000	train-clean-360	The minutes passed slowly in the darkness and there was an unbroken silence save for the breathing of the watchers and the restless movements of missus Clear near the window 
6544_231862_000054_000001	train-clean-360	They saw her pass and repass the square of glass when unexpectedly she paused rigid and silent 
none	none	A stealthy step was ascending the distant stair and pacing cat like along the passage Lucian felt a tremor pass through his body as the steps of the murderer sounded nearer and clearer 
6544_231862_000056_000001	train-clean-360	They paused at the door and then moved towards the window where missus Clear was standing 
none	none	Is that you said a low voice which came weirdly out of the darkness Yes I have been waiting for the last half hour mister Wrent replied the woman in nervous tones
6544_231862_000058_000002	train-clean-360	 I am glad you have come 
6544_231862_000059_000000	train-clean-360	 I am glad also said the voice harshly as I wish to know why you propose to betray me 
6544_231862_000060_000000	train-clean-360	 Because you won t pay me the money said missus Clear boldly 
6544_231862_000060_000001	train-clean-360	 And if you don t give it to me this very night I ll go straight and tell the police all about my husband 
6544_231862_000061_000000	train-clean-360	 I ll kill you first cried the man with a snarl and made a dash at the woman 
none	none	With a cry for help she eluded him and sprang towards the bedroom door for protection 
6544_231862_000061_000002	train-clean-360	The next moment the four watchers were in the room wrestling with Wrent 
none	none	When he felt the grip of their hands and knew that he was betrayed he cried out savagely and fought with the strength of two men

none	none	Yes cried Link triumphantly Jabez Clyne conspirator and assassin CHAPTER XXXI A STRANGE CONFESSION I Jabez Clyne write this confession in my prison cell of my own free will and without coercion from any one partly because I know that the evidence concerning my share in the Vrain conspiracy is strong against me and partly because I wish to exonerate my daughter Lydia She is absolutely innocent of all knowledge concerning the feigned death of her husband and his actual existence in a private lunatic asylum and on the strength of this confession of mine which will fix the guilt of the matter on the right persons I demand that she shall be set free It is not fair that she should suffer for I and Ferruci planned and carried out the whole conspiracy Well Ferruci has punished himself and soon the law will punish me so it is only justice that Lydia should be discharged from all blame On this understanding I set out the whole story of the affair how it was thought of how it was contrived and how it was carried out Now that Count Ferruci is dead this confession can harm no one but myself and may be the means of setting Lydia free So here I begin my recital I was always an unlucky man and the end of my life proves to be as unfortunate as the beginning I was born in London some fifty and more years ago in a Whitechapel slum of drunken and profligate parents so it is little to be wondered at that my career has been anything but virtuous or respectable In my early childhood if it may be called so I was beaten and starved set to beg forced to thieve and never had a kind word said to me or a kind deed done to me No wonder I grew up a callous hardened ruffian As the twig is bent so will the tree grow Out of this depth of degradation I was rescued by a philanthropist who had me fed and clothed and educated I had at his hands every chance of leading a respectable life but I did not want to become smug and honest My early training was too strong for that so after a year or two of enforced goodness I ran away to sea The vessel I embarked on as a stowaway was bound for America When I was discovered hiding among the cargo we were in mid ocean and there was nothing for it but to carry me to the States Still to earn my passage I was made cabin boy to a ruffianly captain and once more tasted the early delights of childhood viz kicks curses and starvation When the ship arrived in New York I was turned adrift in the city without a penny or a friend It is not my purpose to describe my sufferings as such description will do no good and interest nobody particularly as the purpose of this confession is to declare the Vrain conspiracy and its failure so I will pass over my early years as speedily as possible To be brief I became a newsboy then a reporter afterwards I went West and tried my luck in San Francisco later on in Texas but in every case I failed and became poorer and more desperate than ever In New Orleans I set up a newspaper and had a brief time of prosperity when I married the daughter of a hotelkeeper and for the time was happy Then the Civil War broke out and I was ruined My wife died leaving me with one child whom I called Lydia after her but that child died also and I was left alone After the war I prospered again for a time and married a woman with money She also died and left a daughter and this child I again called Lydia in memory of my first wife who was the only woman I ever truly loved I placed little Lydia in a convent for education and devoted my second wife s money to that purpose then I started out for the fifth or sixth time to make my fortune Needless to say I did not make it I pass over a long period of distress and prosperity hopes and fears One day I was rich the next poor and Fate or whatever malignant deity looked after my poor affairs knocked me about most cruelly tossed me up threw me down and at the end of a score of years left me comparatively prosperous with an income in English money of Lfive hundred a year With this I returned to Washington to seek Lydia and found her grown up into a beautiful and clever girl Her beauty gave me the idea that I might marry her well in Europe as an American heiress So for Europe we started and after many years of travel about the Continent we settled down in the Pension Donizetti in Florence There Lydia was admired for her beauty and wit and courted for her money But save for my ten pounds a week which we eked out in the most frugal manner we had not a penny between us It was in Florence that we met with Vrain and his daughter who came to stay at the Pension He was a quiet harmless old gentleman a trifle weak in the head which his daughter said came from over study but which I discovered afterwards was due to habitual indulgence in morphia and other drugs His daughter watched him closely and not having a will of his own by reason of his weak brain he submitted passively to her guidance I heard by a side wind that Vrain was rich and had a splendid mansion in the country so I hinted to Lydia that as it seemed difficult to get her a young husband it would be better for her to marry a rich old one At that time Lydia was in love with and almost engaged to Count Ercole Ferruci a penniless Italian nobleman who courted my pretty girl less for her beauty than for her supposed wealth When I suggested that Lydia should marry Vrain she refused at first to entertain the idea but afterwards seeing that the man was old and weak she thought it would be a good thing as his wife to inherit his money and then as his widow to marry Ferruci I think also that the pointed dislike which Diana Vrain manifested for us both although I am bound to say she hated Lydia more than she did me had a great deal to do with my daughter marrying Vrain However the end of it was that Lydia broke off her engagement with Ferruci and very mad he was at losing her and married Mark Vrain in Florence After the marriage the old man who at that time was quite infatuated with Lydia made a will leaving her his assurance money of Ltwenty thousand but the house near Bath and the land he left to Diana I am bound to say that Lydia behaved very well in this matter as she could have had all the money and land but she was content with the assurance money and did not rob Diana Vrain of her birthright Yet Diana hated her and still hates her but I ask any one who reads this confession if my dear Lyddy is not the better woman of the two Who dares to say that such a sweet girl is guilty of the crimes she is charged with Well the marriage took place and we all journeyed home to Berwin Manor but here things went from bad to worse Old Vrain took again to his morphia and nothing would restrain him then Lydia and Diana fought constantly and each wished the other out of the house I tried to keep the peace and blamed Lyddy who is no saint I admit for the way in which she was treating Diana With Miss Vrain I got on very well and tried to make things easy for her but in the end the ill will between her and my Lydia became so strong that Diana left the house and went out to Australia to live with some relatives So Lydia and I and old Vrain were left alone and I thought that everything would be right So it would have been if Lydia had not put matters wrong again by inviting Ferruci over to stay But she would insist upon doing so and although I begged and prayed and commanded her not to have so dangerous a man in the house she held her own and in the face of my remonstrances and those of her husband Count Ferruci came to stay with us From the moment he entered the house there was nothing but trouble Vrain became jealous and mad with drugs he took often treated Lydia with cruelty and violence and she came to me for protection I spoke to Vrain and he insulted me wishing to turn me out of the house but for Lydia s sake I remained Then a Miss Tyler came to stay and falling in love with Count Ferruci grew jealous of Lydia and made trouble with Vrain The end of it was that after a succession of scenes in which the old man behaved like the lunatic he was he left the house and not one of us knew where he went to That was the last Lydia saw of her husband After that trouble I insisted that Count Ferruci should leave the house also Miss Tyler They both did but came back at times to pay Lydia a visit We tried to find Vrain but could not as he had vanished altogether Ferruci I saw was in love with Lydia and she with him but neither the one nor the other hinted at a future marriage should Vrain die I do not say that Lydia was a fond wife to Vrain but he treated her so badly that he could not expect her to be and I dare say I am the one to blame all through as I made Lydia marry Vrain when she loved Ferruci But I did it all for the best so as to get money for my dear girl and if it has turned out for the worst my inordinate affection for my child is to blame All I have done has been for Lydia s sake all Ferruci did was for Lydia s sake as he truly loved her but I swear by all that I hold most holy that Lydia knew not how either of us was working to secure her happiness Well Ferruci is dead and I am in jail so we have paid in full for our wickedness I had no idea of getting rid of Vrain until one day Ferruci took me aside and told me that he had found Vrain at Salisbury He stated that the man was still taking morphia but in spite of his excesses had so strong a constitution that it appeared he would live for many years The Count then said that he loved Lydia dearer than life and wished to marry her if Vrain could be got out of the way I cried out against murder being done as I never entertained such an idea for a moment but Ferruci denied that he wished to harm the man He wanted him put away in a lunatic asylum and when I asked him how even then he could marry Lydia he suggested his scheme of substituting a sickly and dying man for Vrain The scheme which was entirely invented by the Count was as follows Ferruci said that in a minor London theatre he had seen an actor called Clear who was wonderfully like Vrain save that he had no scar on the cheek and had a moustache whereas Vrain was always clean shaved He had made the acquaintance of the actor Michael Clear was his full name and of his wife They proved to be hard up and mercenary so Ferruci had no difficulty in gaining over both for his purpose For a certain sum of money which was to be paid to missus Clear when her husband was dead and the Count married to Lydia was possessed of the assurance money Clear agreed to shave off his moustache and personate Vrain Ferruci who was something of a chemist created by means of some acid a scar on Clear s cheek like that on Vrain s so that he resembled my son in law in every way save that he had lost one little finger Ferruci wanted me to join him in the conspiracy so that I could watch Clear impersonating Vrain while he himself kept his eye on the real Vrain who was to be received into missus Clear s house at Bayswater and passed off as her husband All missus Clear wanted was the money as long since wearied of her drunken husband she did not care if he lived or died Clear on his part knowing that he could not live long was quite willing to play the part of Vrain on condition that he had plenty to eat and drink and could live in idleness and luxury His wishes in this direction cost us a pretty penny as he bought everything of the best To this plot I refused consent until I saw how Vrain was so when Ferruci brought him from Salisbury where he was hiding to London I had an interview with him He proved to be so stupefied with drugs that he hardly knew me so seeing that my Lydia would get no good out of her life by being tied to such a husband I determined that I would assist Ferruci on the understanding of course that Vrain was to be well looked after in every way We agreed that when Clear died and his body was identified as Vrain s that the real man should be put in an asylum which was and I am sure every one will agree with me the best place for him All this being arranged I went out to look for a house in a secluded part of the town in which Clear under the name of Berwin should live until he died as Vrain I did not wish to see about the house in my new character lest I should be recognised if there was any trouble over the assurance money to complicate matters I determined to disguise myself as the real Vrain Of course Clear personated Vrain as Lydia had last seen him that is clean shaven and neat in his dress But the real Vrain neglecting his personal appearance had cultivated a long white beard and wore a black velvet skull cap to conceal a baldness which had come upon him I disguised myself in this fashion therefore and went to Pimlico under the name of Wrent CHAPTER XXXII THE CONFESSION Continued In Geneva Square Pimlico I found the house I wanted It was No thirteen and was said to be haunted as cries had been heard in it at night and lights had been seen flitting from window to window when no one was in the house I looked at it without entering or calling on the landlord and then I went into Jersey Street to see the back The house in the same section with it was kept by a missus Bensusan who took in lodgers Her rooms were vacant and as it suited me very well that I should be a neighbour to Clear I took the rooms They proved as I shall explain better for our purpose than I was aware of When I told Ferruci of my discovery he gave Clear money and made him hire the house and furnish two rooms for himself I supplied the money In this way Clear calling himself Berwin which was the name of Vrain s house in the country came to live in Pimlico We also removed the real Vrain to missus Clear s at Bayswater and he passed as her husband So weak were his brains and so cowed was his spirit that there was no difficulty in keeping him in the house and the neighbours were told merely that Clear was ill For my part I took up my abode in Jersey Street under the name of Wrent and met Clear outside on occasions when it was necessary for me to see him but I never entered the house for obvious reasons I was constantly afraid lest Clear in his drunken fits for he was always more or less drunk should reveal our secret and I took as my bedroom an apartment in missus Bensusan s out of the window of which I could overlook the back of No thirteen One night when I was watching I saw a dark figure glide into missus Bensusan s yard and climb over the fence only to disappear I was terribly alarmed and wondering what was wrong I put on my clothes and hurried downstairs into the yard Also I climbed over the fence into the yard of No thirteen Here I could not see where the figure had disappeared to as the doors and windows at the back of the house were all locked I could not conjecture who the woman was for it was a woman I saw who had entered or why she had done so or in what way she had gained admission While I was thus thinking I saw the woman again She apparently rose out of the earth and after closing what appeared to be a trap door she made for the fence I stopped her before she got there and found to my surprise that she was a red headed servant of missus Bensusan s a kind of gypsy very clever and I think with much evil in her She was alarmed at being discovered and begged me not to tell on her For my own sake I promised not to do so but made her explain how she got into the house and why she entered it Then she told me an extraordinary tale For some years she said she had been with missus Bensusan who had taken her from the gypsies to civilise her and hating the restraint of civilised life she had been in the habit of roaming about at night Knowing that the house at the back was unoccupied this Rhoda for that is her name climbed over the fence and tried to get into it but found the doors and windows bolted and barred Then one night she saw a kind of grated window amid the grass and as this proved not to be bolted she pulled it open Taking a candle with her she went on a voyage of discovery and dropped through this hole some distance into a disused cellar Only a cat could have got in safely for the height was considerable and indeed Rhoda did not risk that mode of entrance again for finding a ladder in the cellar which I presume had been used to get at the higher bins of wine she placed this against the aperture and thus was enabled to ascend and descend without difficulty Frequently by this means she entered the empty house and went from room to room with her candle singing gypsy songs as she wandered So here I had found the ghost of No thirteen although I don t suppose this impish gypsy girl knew as much She haunted the house just to amuse herself when fat missus Bensusan thought she was safe in bed I asked Rhoda why she had entered the house on that particular night when I had caught her She confessed that she had seen some articles of silver in Clear s rooms which she wished to steal but on this occasion he had locked the door a thing which he did not always do in his drunken humours and so Rhoda was returning disappointed After this confession I made her go back to her own house and promised to keep her secret I also told her that if she held her tongue I would give her a present For this purpose I made Ferruci buy me a cloak lined with rabbit skins as Rhoda on her night excursions wanted something to keep her warm When Ferruci gave it to me and it was lying in my room missus Clear came one night to see me and finding it cold she borrowed the cloak to wrap round her She kept it for some time and brought it back on Christmas Eve when I gave it next day to Rhoda It was Ferruci who bought the cloak not I and it was purchased for Rhoda not for missus Clear The next night I entered No thirteen by the cellarway and found it of great advantage as I could visit Clear without exciting suspicion and so keep an eye on him At first he was alarmed by my unexpected appearance but when I showed him the secret way he made use of it also We used it only on dark nights and it was for this reason that we were not noticed by the neighbours It would never have done for any one of us to be seen climbing over the fence missus Clear once visited her husband and had a quarrel with him about his drinking It was her shadow and Clear s which Denzil saw on the blind As soon as they heard his ring they both went out the back way and in climbing hurriedly over the fence missus Clear tore her veil It was a portion of this which Denzil found On that night Clear after leaving his wife entered the square by the front and so met with Denzil much to the latter s surprise I was very angry when Clear showed Denzil over the house but he said that the young man was very suspicious and he only showed him the house to prove that there was no one in it and that he must have been mistaken about the shadows on the blind Notwithstanding this explanation I did not approve of Clear s act nor indeed of his acquaintance with Denzil For some months matters went on in this way Clear remained in the Silent House drinking himself to death missus Clear looked after Vrain in her Bayswater house and I in my old man disguise remained in Jersey Street although at times I left there and went to see my daughter All this time Lydia had no idea of what we were preparing Then I began to grow wearied of the position for Clear proved tougher than we anticipated and showed no signs of dying In despair I thought I would give him the means to kill himself Mind I did not wish to murder him myself but the man when in his drinking fits thought he was attacked by enemies and when in a melancholic frame of mind on recovery would frequently hint at suicide I therefore thought that if a weapon were left within his reach he might kill himself I don t defend my conduct in this case but surely this drunken scoundrel was better dead than alive In choosing a weapon I wished to select one that would implicate Ferruci rather than myself in case there was any trouble over the matter so I chose for my purpose a stiletto which hung by a parti coloured ribbon on the walls of the library at Berwin Manor I fancied that the stiletto having been bought in Florence and Ferruci coming from Florence he if anyone should any of these facts come to light would be credited with giving it to Clear I took this stiletto from Berwin Manor some time before Christmas and bringing it up to town I left it on the day before Christmas on the table in Clear s sitting room That was at nine o clock in the night and that was when I last saw him alive Who killed him I know no more than any one else On Christmas Eve I was ill and wrote to Lydia to come up She met me at the Pegalls but as I felt ill I left there at six o clock and Lydia stayed with the family all night At seven o clock missus Clear came to me with Ferruci and brought back the cloak which I gave afterwards to Rhoda She wanted to see her husband again but I refused to let her risk the visit Ferruci came to tell me that he was arranging to place Vrain who was becoming too violent to be restrained in the private asylum of doctor Jorce at Hampstead missus Clear was to go with him and we conversed about the matter Ferruci went away first as he desired to see Clear and for that purpose waited about until it was darker and went into the back yard shortly after eight o clock There he was seen by Rhoda as he was about to climb the fence and not knowing it was the girl he took fright and ran out of the yard into Jersey Street Here he found missus Clear who had left me and was waiting for him and the pair went off to see doctor Jorce at Hampstead I believe they remained there all night Left alone I climbed over the fence about nine o clock and saw Clear He was celebrating Christmas Eve by drinking heavily and I was unable to bring him to reason I therefore left the stiletto which I had brought with me on the table and returned to my house in Jersey Street I never saw him alive again I went to bed and slept all night so I was aware of nothing in connection with the death until late on Christmas Day Then missus Bensusan was told by Miss Greeb the landlady of Denzil that the tenant of No thirteen had been murdered I fancied that he had killed himself in a fit of melancholia with the stiletto I had left on his table but I did not dare to go near the house to find this out Afterwards I learned that the doctor who examined the body was of the opinion that Clear had been murdered and being afraid about the police taking up the case I paid missus Bensusan a week s rent and left her house two days after Christmas I returned to Berwin Manor and shortly afterwards Ferruci joined me there as he had successfully incarcerated Vrain in the asylum under the name of Michael Clear When the advertisement came out it was I who hinted to Lydia that the dead man seeing that he was called Berwin might be her husband We went up to town Lydia identified the body of Clear as her husband in all innocence for after death the man looked more like Vrain than ever and in due time the assurance money was obtained I do not think there is anything more to tell save that I did not know that missus Clear had betrayed me I could not pay her the money as I could not get it from Lydia I told Lydia I was going to Paris but in reality I was hunting for Rhoda who had run away from Jersey Street I fancied she might betray us and wished to make things safe with her Before I found her however I saw in the papers that Ferruci had committed suicide also that Lydia who had gone to Dover to meet me thinking I was returning from Paris had been arrested Then I saw missus Clear s advertisement saying she would betray me if I did not pay the money I consented to meet her in order to implore her silence and so fell into the clutches of the law I may state that I did not kill Clear as I never saw him after nine o clock and then he was alive In spite of what the doctor said I am still inclined to think he killed himself Now I have made a clean breast of it I am willing to be punished but I hope Lydia will be set free for whosoever is guilty she is innocent I have been an unlucky man and I remain one at this moment when I sign myself for the last time JABEZ CLYNE Needless to say both Link and Denzil were greatly surprised at this confession which revealed all things save the one they wished to know What do you think of this idea of suicide asked Lucian It is quite out of the question replied the detective decidedly The doctor who examined the body said that it was impossible the man could have committed suicide The position of the wound shows that also the power of the stroke No man could drive a stiletto so dexterously and strongly into the heart Also the room was in confusion which points to a struggle and the stiletto is missing It was not suicide but murder and I believe either Clyne or Ferruci killed the man But Ferruci was not He was not there after ten interrupted Link but he was there about eight I dare say when Rhoda saw him he was coming back after having committed the deed and Clyne says the stiletto was not there at the time just to screen him It is of little use to screen the dead said Lucian I think only one person can tell the truth about this murder and that is Rhoda I m looking for her mister Denzil This was easy saying but harder doing for weeks passed away and in spite of all the efforts of the police Rhoda could not be found Then one morning the detective much excited burst into Lucian s rooms waving a paper over his head A confession he cried Another confession Of whom asked Lucian surprised Of Rhoda replied Link excitedly She has confessed It was Rhoda who killed Michael Clear CHAPTER XXXIII WHAT RHODA HAD TO SAY Of all the news concerning the truth of Clear s death this was the last which Lucian expected to hear He stood staring at the excited face of the detective in wide eyed surprise and for the moment could not find his voice It is true I tell you cried Link sitting down and smoothing out the paper which he carried Rhoda and none other killed the man Are you sure Link Of course I am This flourishing the paper is her dying confession Her dying confession repeated the barrister blankly Is she dead also Yes It is a long story mister Denzil Sit down and I ll tell it to you As you have had so much to do with the beginning of the case it is only fair that you should know the end and a strange end it is Without a word Lucian sat down feeling quite confused for in no way could he guess how Clear had come by his death at the hands of Rhoda He had suspected Lydia as guilty of the crime he had credited Ferruci with its commission and he had been certain of the guilt of Clyne alias Wrent but to discover that the red headed servant was the culprit entirely bewildered him She had no motive to kill the man she had given evidence freely in the matter and in all respects had acted as an innocent person So this was why she had left Jersey Street It was a fear of being arrested for the crime which had driven her into the wilds But as Lucian privately thought she need not have fled for so far as he could see beyond the startling announcement of Link there was no evidence to connect her with the matter It was most extraordinary I see you are astonished said Link with a nod so was I Of all folk I least suspected that imp of a girl The truth would never have been known had she not confessed at the last moment for even now I cannot see on the face of it any evidence save her own confession to inculpate her in the matter So you see mister Denzil the mystery of this man s death which we have been so anxious to solve has not been explained by you or discovered by me but has been brought to light by chance which after all is the great detective You may well look astonished repeated the man slowly I am immensely Let me hear the confession Link Wait one moment I ll tell you how it came to be made and then I ll relate the story in my own fashion as the way in which the confession is written is too muddled for you to understand clearly Still it shows plainly enough that Clyne for all our suspicions is innocent And Rhoda the sharp servant girl guilty said Lucian reflectively I never should have thought that she was involved in the matter How the deuce did she come to confess Well said Link clearing his throat as a preliminary to his narrative it seems that mister Bensusan in a fit of philanthropy picked up this wretched girl in the country She belonged to some gypsies but as her parents were dead and the child a burden the tribe were glad to get rid of her Rhoda Stanley that is her full name was taken to London by missus Bensusan who tried to civilise her I don t think she succeeded very well Link Rhoda with her cunning ways and roaming about at night was always a savage at heart In spite of what Clyne says in his confession I believe she took a delight in turning No thirteen into a haunted house with her shrieking and her flitting candles How she must have enjoyed herself when she heard the talk about the ghost I have no doubt she did mister Denzil but even those delights wearied her and she longed to get back to the free gypsy life When she found through you sir that the police wanted to know too much about Clear s death she left missus Bensusan in the lurch and tramped off down to the New Forest where she picked up again with her tribe How did her mistress take her desertion Very much to heart as she had treated the young savage very kindly and ought to have received more gratitude Perhaps when she hears how her adopted child wandered about at night and ended by killing Clear she will be glad she is dead and buried Yet I don t know Women are wonderfully soft hearted and certainly Rhoda is thought no end of by that fat woman Well well said Lucian impatient of this digression So Rhoda went back to her tribe Yes sir and as she was sharp clever and moreover came with some money which she had stolen from missus Bensusan for she added theft to ingratitude she was received with open arms With her gypsy cousins she went about in the true gypsy style but not being hardened to the outdoor life in wet weather she fell ill Civilisation made her delicate I suppose said Denzil grimly Exactly she was not fit for the tent life after having lived for so long under a comfortable roof She fell ill with inflammation of the lungs and in a wonderfully short space of time she died When did she confess her crime I m coming to that sir When she was dying she sent two gypsies to the nearest magistrate who happened to be the vicar of the parish in which the tribe were then encamped and asked him to see her on a matter of life and death The vicar came at once and when he became aware that Rhoda was the girl wanted in the Vrain case for he had read all about her in the papers he became very interested He took down the confession of the wretched girl had it signed by two witnesses and Rhoda herself and sent it up to Scotland Yard And this confession Here it is said Link pointing to the manuscript on the table but it is too long to read so I shall just tell you briefly what Rhoda confessed and how she committed the crime Go on I am most anxious to hear Link Well mister Denzil you know that Rhoda was in the habit of visiting No thirteen by night and amusing herself by wandering about the empty rooms although I don t know what pleasure she found in doing so It seems that when Clear became the tenant of the house Rhoda was very angry as his presence interfered with her midnight capers However on seeing his rooms for Clear found her one night and took her in to show them to her she was filled with admiration and with true gypsy instinct wanted to steal some of the ornaments She tried to pocket a silver paper knife on that very night Clear was so hospitable to her but she was not sharp enough and the man saw the theft In a rage at her dishonesty he turned her out of the room and swore that he would thrash her if she came into his presence again Did the threat keep Rhoda away Not it I am sure you saw enough of that wildcat to know nothing would frighten her She certainly did not thrust herself personally on Clear but whenever his back was turned she took to stealing things out of his room when he was foolish enough to leave the door open Clear was much enraged and complained to Clyne known to Rhoda as Wrent who in his turn read the girl a sharp lecture But having shown Clyne the cellarway into the house Miss Rhoda knew too much and laughed in Clyne s face He did not dare to make her thefts public or complain to missus Bensusan lest Rhoda should tell of the connection between him and the tenant of the Silent House who passed under the name of Berwin Therefore he told Clear to keep his sitting room door locked A wise precaution with that imp about said Lucian I hope Clear was sensible enough to adopt it Yes and no When he was sober he locked the door and when drunk he left it open and Rhoda looted at will And now comes the more important part of the confession You remember that Clyne left the stiletto from Berwin Manor on Clear s table Yes with the amiable intention that the poor devil should kill himself He left it on Christmas Eve too a pleasant time for a man to commit suicide Of course the intention was horrible said mister Link gravely Some people might think such an act incredible but I have seen so much of the worst side of human nature that I am not surprised Clyne was too cowardly to kill the man himself so he thought to make Clear his own executioner by leaving the stiletto in his way Well sir the weapon proved to be useful in the way it was intended by Clyne for Clear was killed with that very weapon And by Rhoda said Lucian nodding I see How did she get hold of it By accident When Wrent I mean Clyne and missus Bensusan went to bed on Christmas Eve Rhoda thought she would have some of her devil dances in the haunted house so she slipped out of bed and into the yard and dropped down into the cellar whence she went up to Clear s rooms Was Clear in bed No but he was in his bedroom and according to Rhoda furiously drunk You know that Clyne said the man had been drinking all day On this night he had left his sitting room door open and the lamp burning On the table was the silver handled stiletto with the ribbon and when Rhoda peered into the room to see what she could pick up she thought she would like this pretty toy She stole forward softly and took the stiletto but before she could get back to the door Clear who had been watching her reeled out and rushed at her Did she run away She couldn t Clear was between her and the door She ran round the room upsetting everything for she thought he would kill her in his drunken rage Don t you remember mister Denzil how disorderly the room was Well Clear got Rhoda into a corner and was going to strike her she had the stiletto still in her hand and held it point outward to save herself from the blow She thought when he saw the weapon he would not dare to come nearer However either he did not see the stiletto or was too drunk to feel fear for he stumbled and fell forward so that the dagger ran right into his heart In a moment he fell dead before he had time as Rhoda says to even utter a cry So it was an accident after all said Lucian Oh yes quite an accident replied Link and I can see very plainly how it took place Of course Rhoda was terrified at what she had done although she really was not to blame and leaving the dead man ran away with the stiletto She dropped the ribbon off it near the cellar door as she was running away and there missus Kebby found it What did she do with the stiletto She had it in her room and when she left missus Bensusan she carried it with her down the country In proof of the truth she gave it to the vicar who wrote down her confession and he sent it up with the papers to Scotland Yard Queer case isn t it Very queer Link I thought everybody was guilty but Rhoda Ah said the detective significantly it is always the least suspected person who is guilty I could have sworn that Clyne was the man Now it seems that he is innocent so instead of hanging he will only be imprisoned for his share in the conspiracy He may escape that way said Lucian drily but morally speaking I regard him as more guilty than Rhoda CHAPTER XXXIV THE END OF IT ALL Two years after the discovery of Rhoda s guilt mister and missus Denzil were seated in the garden of Berwin Manor It was a perfect summer evening at the sunset hour something like that evening when in the same garden almost at the same time Lucian had asked Diana to be his wife But between then and now twenty four months had elapsed and many things had taken place of more or less importance to the young couple The mystery of Clear s death had been solved Lydia had been set free as innocent of crime her father found guilty of conspiracy to obtain the assurance money had been condemned to a long term of imprisonment and what most concerned Lucian and Diana Mark Vrain had really and truly gone the way of all flesh After the conclusion of the Vrain case Lucian had become formally engaged to Diana but it was agreed between them that the marriage should not take place for some time on account of her father s health After his discharge as cured from the asylum of doctor Jorce Miss Vrain had taken her father down to his own place in the country and there tended him with the most affectionate solicitude in the hope that he would recover his health But the hope was vain for by his over indulgence in morphia his worrying and wandering and irregular mode of life Vrain had completely shattered his health He lapsed into a state of second childhood and being deprived of the drugs which formerly had excited him to a state of frenzy sank into a pitiable condition For days he would remain without speaking to any one and even ceased to take a pleasure in his books Finally his limbs became paralysed and so he spent the last few months of his wretched life in a bath chair being wheeled round the garden Still his constitution was so strong that he lived for quite twelve months after his return to his home and died unexpectedly in his sleep Diana was not sorry when he passed so easily away for death was a merciful release of his tortured soul from his worn out body So Mark Vrain died and was buried and after the funeral Diana went abroad with Miss Priscilla Barbar for a companion In the meantime Lucian stayed in grimy smoky London and worked hard at his profession He was beginning to be known and in time actually received a brief or two with which he did his best in court Still he was far from being the successful pleader he hoped to be for law of all professions is one which demands time and industry for the attainment of any degree of excellence It is rarely that a young lawyer can go to sleep and wake to find himself famous he must crawl rather than run With diligence and punctuality and observance of every chance in time the wished for goal is reached although that goal in nine cases out of ten is a very moderate distance off Lucian did not sigh for a judgeship or for a seat on the Woolsack he was content to be a barrister with a good practice and perhaps a Q C ship in prospect However during the year of Diana s mourning he did so well that he felt justified in asking her to marry him when she returned Diana on her side saw no obstacle to this course so she consented If you are not rich my dear I am she said when Lucian alleged his poverty as the only bar to their union and as money gives me no pleasure without you I do not care to stay in Berwin Manor in lonely spinsterhood I shall marry you whenever you choose And Lucian taking advantage of this gracious permission did choose to be married and that speedily so within two years after the final closing of the Vrain case they became man and wife At the time they were seated in the garden at the hour of sunset they had only lately returned from their honeymoon and were now talking over past experiences Miss Priscilla who had been left in charge of the Manor during their absence had welcomed them back with much joy as she looked upon the match as one of her own making Now she had gone inside on the understanding that two are company and three are none and the young couple were left alone Hand in hand after the foolish fashion of lovers they sat under a leafy oak tree and the sunlight glowed redly on their happy faces After a short silence Lucian looked at the face of his wife and laughed What is amusing you dear said missus Denzil with a sympathetic smile My thoughts were rather pleasant than amusing replied Lucian giving the hand that lay in his a squeeze but I was thinking of Hans Andersen s tale of the Elder Mother Tree and of the old couple who sat enjoying their golden wedding under the linden with the red sunlight shining on their silver crowns We are under an oak and wear no crowns replied Diana in her turn but we are quite as happy I think although it is not our golden wedding Perhaps that will come some day Diana Fifty years my dear it s a long way off yet said missus Denzil dubiously I am glad it is for I shall have D V fifty years of happiness with you to look forward to Upon my word Diana I think you deserve happiness after all the trouble you have had With you I am sure to be happy Lucian but other people poor souls are not so well off What other people Jabez Clyne for one My dear said Lucian seriously I hope I am not a hard man but I really cannot find it in my heart to pity Clyne He was and I dare say is a scoundrel I don t deny that he acted badly sighed Diana but it was for his daughter s sake you know There is a limit even to paternal affection Diana And putting aside the wickedness of the whole conspiracy I cannot pardon a man who deliberately put a weapon in the way of a man almost insane with drink in order that he might kill himself The idea was diabolically wicked my dear and I think that Jabez Clyne alias Wrent quite deserves the long imprisonment he received At all events the Sirius Company got back their money Lucian So much as Lydia had not spent they got back Diana but when your father actually died they had to part with it very soon again and some of it has gone into Lydia s pocket after all Diana blushed It was only right dear she said apologetically When my father made his new will leaving it all to me I did not think that Lydia however badly she treated him should be left absolutely penniless And you know Lucian you agreed that I should share the assurance money with her I did replied Denzil Of two evils I chose the least for if Lydia had not got a portion of the money she would have been quite capable of trying to upset the second will on the ground that mister Vrain was insane Papa was not insane reproved Diana He was weak I admit but at the time he made that will he had all his senses Besides after all the scandal of the case I don t think Lydia would have dared to go to law about it Still it was best to give her the money and I hear from Miss Priscilla that Lydia is now in Italy and proposes to marry an Italian prince She has flown higher than a count then Poor Ferruci killed himself for her sake For his own rather exclaimed missus Denzil energetically He knew that if he lived he would be punished by imprisonment so chose to kill himself rather than suffer such dishonour I believe he truly loved Lydia certainly but as he wanted the assurance money I fancy he sinned quite as much for his own sake as for Lydia s No doubt and I dare say Lydia loved him after her own fashion yet she seems to have forgotten him pretty soon and as you say intends to marry a prince I don t envy his highness She has no heart so I dare say she will be happy as such women ever are said Diana contemptuously yet her happiness comes out of much evil If she had not married my father her own would not now be in prison nor would Count Ferruci and Rhoda be dead Ferruci perhaps might still be alive and her husband assented Lucian but I have my doubts about Rhoda She was a wicked precocious little imp that girl and sooner or later would have come to a bad end The death of Clear was due to an accident I admit but Rhoda has still one person who laments over her for although missus Bensusan knows the truth she always thinks of that red haired minx as a kind of martyr who was led into wicked ways by Clyne alias Wrent I am sure missus Clear doesn t think so missus Clear has got quite enough to think about in remembering how narrowly she escaped imprisonment for her share in that shameful conspiracy If she had not turned Queen s evidence she would have been punished as Clyne was as it is she just escaped by an accident Still if it had not been for her we should never have discovered the truth I would never have suspected Clyne who was always so meek and mild Even that visit he paid to me to lament over his daughter s probable marriage to Ferruci was a trick to find out how much I knew Don t you think he hated Ferruci No I am sure he did not He acted a part to find out what I was doing If missus Clear had not betrayed him we should never have discovered the conspiracy And if Rhoda had not spoken the mystery of Clear s death would never have been solved said Diana although she only confessed at the eleventh hour and when she was dying I think Link was pleased that the mystery was solved in so unexpected a way said Lucian laughing He never forgave my finding out so much without his aid He ascribes the ending of the whole matter to chance and I dare say he is right H m said missus Denzil who had no great love for the detective He certainly left everything to chance Twice he gave up the case And twice I gave it up said Denzil If it had not been for you dear I should never have gone on with what seemed to be a hopeless task But when I first met you you induced me to continue the search for the culprit and again when by the evidence of the missing finger you did not believe your father was dead Well you worked I worked Link worked said Diana philosophically and we all three did our best to discover the truth Only to let chance discover it in the long run Diana laughed and nodded but did not contradict her husband Well my dear she said I think we have discussed the subject pretty freely but there is one thing I should like to know What about the Silent House in Pimlico Oh Miss Greeb told me the other day that Peacock is going to pull it down You know just before we were married I took leave of Miss Greeb with whom I lodged for a long time Well she gave me a piece of news She is going to be married also and to whom do you think I don t know said Diana looking interested as women always do in marriage news To Peacock who owns nearly all the property in and about Geneva Square It will be a splendid match for her and missus Peacock will be much richer than you or I Diana But not happier my dear I am glad she is to be married as she seemed a nice woman and made you very comfortable But why is the Silent House to be pulled down Because no one will live in it But it is not haunted now You know it was discovered that Rhoda was the ghost and the ghost as Miss Greeb suggested killed Clear It is haunted now by the ghost of Clear said Lucian gravely At all events he was murdered there and no one cares to live in the house I confess I shouldn t care to live in it myself So Peacock finding the house unprofitable has determined to pull it down So there is an end to the Silent House of Pimlico said Diana rising and taking her husband s arm Come inside Lucian It grows chilly Tho winds be cold and nights be drear Yet love makes warm our hearts my dear quoted Lucian as they went up to the house That is not very good poetry but it is a beautiful truth my love Diana laughed and looked up proudly into the bright face of her husband So they went inside and found that Miss Priscilla had made the tea and all were very happy and very thankful for their happiness In this condition which is sufficiently pleasant I think we may leave them THE END End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Silent House by Fergus Hume END
