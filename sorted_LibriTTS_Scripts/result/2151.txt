be successfully attempted The people will imitate the nobles and the result is a thorough diffusion of the proper feeling But in America the coins current being the sole arms of the aristocracy their display may be said in general to be the sole means of the aristocratic distinction and the populace looking always upward for models are insensibly led to confound the two entirely separate ideas of magnificence and beauty In short the cost of an article of furniture has at length come to be with us nearly the sole test of its merit in a decorative point of view and this test once established has led the way to many analogous errors readily traceable to the one primitive folly There could be nothing more directly offensive to the eye of an artist than the interior of what is termed in the United States that is to say in Appallachia a well furnished apartment Its most usual defect is a want of keeping We speak of the keeping of a room as we would of the keeping of a picture for both the picture and the room are amenable to those undeviating principles which regulate all varieties of art and very nearly the same laws by which we decide on the higher merits of a painting suffice for decision on the adjustment of a chamber A want of keeping is observable sometimes in the character of the several pieces of furniture but generally in their colours or modes of adaptation to use Very often the eye is offended by their inartistic arrangement Straight lines are too prevalent too uninterruptedly continued or clumsily interrupted at right angles If curved lines occur they are repeated into unpleasant uniformity By undue precision the appearance of many a fine apartment is utterly spoiled Curtains are rarely well disposed or well chosen in respect to other decorations With formal furniture curtains are out of place and an extensive volume of drapery of any kind is under any circumstance irreconcilable with good taste the proper quantum as well as the proper adjustment depending upon the character of the general effect Carpets are better understood of late than of ancient days but we still very frequently err in their patterns and colours The soul of the apartment is the carpet From it are deduced not only the hues but the forms of all objects incumbent A judge at common law may be an ordinary man a good judge of a carpet must be a genius Yet we have heard discoursing of carpets with the air d un mouton qui reve fellows who should not and who could not be entrusted with the management of their own moustaches Every one knows that a large floor may have a covering of large figures and that a small one must have a covering of small yet this is not all the knowledge in the world As regards texture the Saxony is alone admissible Brussels is the preterpluperfect tense of fashion and Turkey is taste in its dying agonies Touching pattern a carpet should not be bedizzened out like a Riccaree Indian all red chalk yellow ochre and cock s feathers In brief distinct grounds and vivid circular or cycloid figures of no meaning are here Median laws The abomination of flowers or representations of well known objects of any kind should not be endured within the limits of Christendom Indeed whether on carpets or curtains or tapestry or ottoman coverings all upholstery of this nature should be rigidly Arabesque As for those antique floor cloth still occasionally seen in the dwellings of the rabble cloths of huge sprawling and radiating devises stripe interspersed and glorious with all hues among which no ground is intelligible these are but the wicked invention of a race of time servers and money lovers children of Baal and worshippers of Mammon Benthams who to spare thought and economize fancy first cruelly invented the Kaleidoscope and then established joint stock companies to twirl it by steam Glare is a leading error in the philosophy of American household decoration an error easily recognised as deduced from the perversion of taste just specified We are violently enamoured of gas and of glass The former is totally inadmissible within doors Its harsh and unsteady light offends No one having both brains and eyes will use it A mild or what artists term a cool light with its consequent warm shadows will do wonders for even an ill furnished apartment Never was a more lovely thought than that of the astral lamp We mean of course the astral lamp proper the lamp of Argand with its original plain ground glass shade and its tempered and uniform moonlight rays The cut glass shade is a weak invention of the enemy The eagerness with which we have adopted it partly on account of its flashiness but principally on account of its greater rest is a good commentary on the proposition with which we began It is not too much to say that the deliberate employer of a cut glass shade is either radically deficient in taste or blindly subservient to the caprices of fashion The light proceeding from one of these gaudy abominations is unequal broken and painful It alone is sufficient to mar a world of good effect in the furniture subjected to its influence Female loveliness in especial is more than one half disenchanted beneath its evil eye In the matter of glass generally we proceed upon false principles Its leading feature is glitter and in that one word how much of all that is detestable do we express Flickering unquiet lights are sometimes pleasing to children and idiots always so but in the embellishment of a room they should be scrupulously avoided In truth even strong steady lights are inadmissible The huge and unmeaning glass chandeliers prism cut gas lighted and without shade which dangle in our most fashionable drawing rooms may be cited as the quintessence of all that is false in taste or preposterous in folly The rage for glitter because its idea has become as we before observed confounded with that of magnificence in the abstract has led us also to the exaggerated employment of mirrors We line our dwellings with great British plates and then imagine we have done a fine thing Now the slightest thought will be sufficient to convince any one who has an eye at all of the ill effect of numerous looking glasses and especially of large ones Regarded apart from its reflection the mirror presents a continuous flat colourless unrelieved surface a thing always and obviously unpleasant Considered as a reflector it is potent in producing a monstrous and odious uniformity and the evil is here aggravated not in merely direct proportion with the augmentation of its sources but in a ratio constantly increasing In fact a room with four or five mirrors arranged at random is for all purposes of artistic show a room of no shape at all If we add to this evil the attendant glitter upon glitter we have a perfect farrago of discordant and displeasing effects The veriest bumpkin on entering an apartment so bedizzened would be instantly aware of something wrong although he might be altogether unable to assign a cause for his dissatisfaction But let the same person be led into a room tastefully furnished and he would be startled into an exclamation of pleasure and surprise It is an evil growing out of our republican institutions that here a man of large purse has usually a very little soul which he keeps in it The corruption of taste is a portion or a pendant of the dollar manufacture As we grow rich our ideas grow rusty It is therefore not among our aristocracy that we must look if at all in Appallachia for the spirituality of a British boudoir But we have seen apartments in the tenure of Americans of moderns possibly modest or moderate means which in negative merit at least might vie with any of the or molu d cabinets of our friends across the water Even now there is present to our mind s eye a small and not ostentatious chamber with whose decorations no fault can be found The proprietor lies asleep on a sofa the weather is cool the time is near midnight we will make a sketch of the room during his slumber It is oblong some thirty feet in length and twenty five in breadth a shape affording the best ordinary opportunities for the adjustment of furniture It has but one door by no means a wide one which is at one end of the parallelogram and but two windows which are at the other These latter are large reaching down to the floor have deep recesses and open on an Italian veranda Their panes are of a crimson tinted glass set in rose wood framings more massive than usual They are curtained within the recess by a thick silver tissue adapted to the shape of the window and hanging loosely in small volumes Without the recess are curtains of an exceedingly rich crimson silk fringed with a deep network of gold and lined with silver tissue which is the material of the exterior blind There are no cornices but the folds of the whole fabric which are sharp rather than massive and have an airy appearance issue from beneath a broad entablature of rich giltwork which encircles the room at the junction of the ceiling and walls The drapery is thrown open also or closed by means of a thick rope of gold loosely enveloping it and resolving itself readily into a knot no pins or other such devices are apparent The colours of the curtains and their fringe the tints of crimson and gold appear everywhere in profusion and determine the character of the room The carpet of Saxony material is quite half an inch thick and is of the same crimson ground relieved simply by the appearance of a gold cord like that festooning the curtains slightly relieved above the surface of the ground and thrown upon it in such a manner as to form a succession of short irregular curves one occasionally overlaying the other The walls are prepared with a glossy paper of a silver gray tint spotted with small Arabesque devices of a fainter hue of the prevalent crimson Many paintings relieve the expanse of paper These are chiefly landscapes of an imaginative cast such as the fairy grottoes of Stanfield or the lake of the Dismal Swamp of Chapman There are nevertheless three or four female heads of an ethereal beauty portraits in the manner of Sully The tone of each picture is warm but dark There are no brilliant effects Repose speaks in all Not one is of small size Diminutive paintings give that spotty look to a room which is the blemish of so many a fine work of Art overtouched The frames are broad but not deep and richly carved without being dulled or filagreed They have the whole lustre of burnished gold They lie flat on the walls and do not hang off with cords The designs themselves are often seen to better advantage in this latter position but the general appearance of the chamber is injured But one mirror and this not a very large one is visible In shape it is nearly circular and it is hung so that a reflection of the person can be obtained from it in none of the ordinary sitting places of the room Two large low sofas of rosewood and crimson silk gold flowered form the only seats with the exception of two light conversation chairs also of rose wood There is a pianoforte rose wood also without cover and thrown open An octagonal table formed altogether of the richest gold threaded marble is placed near one of the sofas This is also without cover the drapery of the curtains has been thought sufficient Four large and gorgeous Sevres vases in which bloom a profusion of sweet and vivid flowers occupy the slightly rounded angles of the room A tall candelabrum bearing a small antique lamp with highly perfumed oil is standing near the head of my sleeping friend Some light and graceful hanging shelves with golden edges and crimson silk cords with gold tassels sustain two or three hundred magnificently bound books Beyond these things there is no furniture if we except an Argand lamp with a plain crimson tinted ground glass shade which depends from He lofty vaulted ceiling by a single slender gold chain and throws a tranquil but magical radiance over all A TALE OF JERUSALEM Intensos rigidarn in frontern ascendere canos Passus erat Lucan De Catone a bristly bore LET us hurry to the walls said Abel Phittim to Buzi Ben Levi and Simeon the Pharisee on the tenth day of the month Thammuz in the year of the world three thousand nine hundred and forty one let us hasten to the ramparts adjoining the gate of Benjamin which is in the city of David and overlooking the camp of the uncircumcised for it is the last hour of the fourth watch being sunrise and the idolaters in fulfilment of the promise of Pompey should be awaiting us with the lambs for the sacrifices Simeon Abel Phittim and Duzi Ben Levi were the Gizbarim or sub collectors of the offering in the holy city of Jerusalem Verily replied the Pharisee let us hasten for this generosity in the heathen is unwonted and fickle mindedness has ever been an attribute of the worshippers of Baal That they are fickle minded and treacherous is as true as the Pentateuch said Buzi Ben Levi but that is only toward the people of Adonai When was it ever known that the Ammonites proved wanting to their own interests Methinks it is no great stretch of generosity to allow us lambs for the altar of the Lord receiving in lieu thereof thirty silver shekels per head Thou forgettest however Ben Levi replied Abel Phittim that the Roman Pompey who is now impiously besieging the city of the Most High has no assurity that we apply not the lambs thus purchased for the altar to the sustenance of the body rather than of the spirit Now by the five corners of my beard shouted the Pharisee who belonged to the sect called The Dashers that little knot of saints whose manner of dashing and lacerating the feet against the pavement was long a thorn and a reproach to less zealous devotees a stumbling block to less gifted perambulators by the five corners of that beard which as a priest I am forbidden to shave have we lived to see the day when a blaspheming and idolatrous upstart of Rome shall accuse us of appropriating to the appetites of the flesh the most holy and consecrated elements Have we lived to see the day when Let us not question the motives of the Philistine interrupted Abel Phittim for to day we profit for the first time by his avarice or by his generosity but rather let us hurry to the ramparts lest offerings should be wanting for that altar whose fire the rains of heaven can not extinguish and whose pillars of smoke no tempest can turn aside That part of the city to which our worthy Gizbarim now hastened and which bore the name of its architect King David was esteemed the most strongly fortified district of Jerusalem being situated upon the steep and lofty hill of Zion Here a broad deep circumvallatory trench hewn from the solid rock was defended by a wall of great strength erected upon its inner edge This wall was adorned at regular interspaces by square towers of white marble the lowest sixty and the highest one hundred and twenty cubits in height But in the vicinity of the gate of Benjamin the wall arose by no means from the margin of the fosse On the contrary between the level of the ditch and the basement of the rampart sprang up a perpendicular cliff of two hundred and fifty cubits forming part of the precipitous Mount Moriah So that when Simeon and his associates arrived on the summit of the tower called Adoni Bezek the loftiest of all the turrets around about Jerusalem and the usual place of conference with the besieging army they looked down upon the camp of the enemy from an eminence excelling by many feet that of the Pyramid of Cheops and by several that of the temple of Belus Verily sighed the Pharisee as he peered dizzily over the precipice the uncircumcised are as the sands by the seashore as the locusts in the wilderness The valley of the King hath become the valley of Adommin And yet added Ben Levi thou canst not point me out a Philistine no not one from Aleph to Tau from the wilderness to the battlements who seemeth any bigger than the letter Jod Lower away the basket with the shekels of silver here shouted a Roman soldier in a hoarse rough voice which appeared to issue from the regions of Pluto lower away the basket with the accursed coin which it has broken the jaw of a noble Roman to pronounce Is it thus you evince your gratitude to our master Pompeius who in his condescension has thought fit to listen to your idolatrous importunities The god Phoebus who is a true god has been charioted for an hour and were you not to be on the ramparts by sunrise Aedepol do you think that we the conquerors of the world have nothing better to do than stand waiting by the walls of every kennel to traffic with the dogs of the earth Lower away I say and see that your trumpery be bright in color and just in weight El Elohim ejaculated the Pharisee as the discordant tones of the centurion rattled up the crags of the precipice and fainted away against the temple El Elohim who is the god Phoebus whom doth the blasphemer invoke Thou Buzi Ben Levi who art read in the laws of the Gentiles and hast sojourned among them who dabble with the Teraphim is it Nergal of whom the idolater speaketh or Ashimah or Nibhaz or Tartak or Adramalech or Anamalech or Succoth Benith or Dagon or Belial or Baal Perith or Baal Peor or Baal Zebub Verily it is neither but beware how thou lettest the rope slip too rapidly through thy fingers for should the wicker work chance to hang on the projection of Yonder crag there will be a woful outpouring of the holy things of the sanctuary By the assistance of some rudely constructed machinery the heavily laden basket was now carefully lowered down among the multitude and from the giddy pinnacle the Romans were seen gathering confusedly round it but owing to the vast height and the prevalence of a fog no distinct view of their operations could be obtained Half an hour had already elapsed We shall be too late sighed the Pharisee as at the expiration of this period he looked over into the abyss we shall be too late we shall be turned out of office by the Katholim No more responded Abel Phittim no more shall we feast upon the fat of the land no longer shall our beards be odorous with frankincense our loins girded up with fine linen from the Temple Racal swore Ben Levi Racal do they mean to defraud us of the purchase money or Holy Moses are they weighing the shekels of the tabernacle They have given the signal at last cried the Pharisee they have given the signal at last pull away Abel Phittim and thou Buzi Ben Levi pull away for verily the Philistines have either still hold upon the basket or the Lord hath softened their hearts to place therein a beast of good weight And the Gizbarim pulled away while their burden swung heavily upward through the still increasing mist Booshoh he as at the conclusion of an hour some object at the extremity of the rope became indistinctly visible Booshoh he was the exclamation which burst from the lips of Ben Levi Booshoh he for shame it is a ram from the thickets of Engedi and as rugged as the valley of jehosaphat It is a firstling of the flock said Abel Phittim I know him by the bleating of his lips and the innocent folding of his limbs His eyes are more beautiful than the jewels of the Pectoral and his flesh is like the honey of Hebron It is a fatted calf from the pastures of Bashan said the Pharisee the heathen have dealt wonderfully with us let us raise up our voices in a psalm let us give thanks on the shawm and on the psaltery on the harp and on the huggab on the cythern and on the sackbut It was not until the basket had arrived within a few feet of the Gizbarim that a low grunt betrayed to their perception a hog of no common size Now El Emanu slowly and with upturned eyes ejaculated the trio as letting go their hold the emancipated porker tumbled headlong among the Philistines El Emanu God be with us it is the unutterable flesh THE SPHINX DURING the dread reign of the Cholera in New York I had accepted the invitation of a relative to spend a fortnight with him in the retirement of his cottage ornee on the banks of the Hudson We had here around us all the ordinary means of summer amusement and what with rambling in the woods sketching boating fishing bathing music and books we should have passed the time pleasantly enough but for the fearful intelligence which reached us every morning from the populous city Not a day elapsed which did not bring us news of the decease of some acquaintance Then as the fatality increased we learned to expect daily the loss of some friend At length we trembled at the approach of every messenger The very air from the South seemed to us redolent with death That palsying thought indeed took entire possession of my soul I could neither speak think nor dream of any thing else My host was of a less excitable temperament and although greatly depressed in spirits exerted himself to sustain my own His richly philosophical intellect was not at any time affected by unrealities To the substances of terror he was sufficiently alive but of its shadows he had no apprehension His endeavors to arouse me from the condition of abnormal gloom into which I had fallen were frustrated in great measure by certain volumes which I had found in his library These were of a character to force into germination whatever seeds of hereditary superstition lay latent in my bosom I had been reading these books without his knowledge and thus he was often at a loss to account for the forcible impressions which had been made upon my fancy A favorite topic with me was the popular belief in omens a belief which at this one epoch of my life I was almost seriously disposed to defend On this subject we had long and animated discussions he maintaining the utter groundlessness of faith in such matters I contending that a popular sentiment arising with absolute spontaneity that is to say without apparent traces of suggestion had in itself the unmistakable elements of truth and was entitled to as much respect as that intuition which is the idiosyncrasy of the individual man of genius The fact is that soon after my arrival at the cottage there had occurred to myself an incident so entirely inexplicable and which had in it so much of the portentous character that I might well have been excused for regarding it as an omen It appalled and at the same time so confounded and bewildered me that many days elapsed before I could make up my mind to communicate the circumstances to my friend Near the close of exceedingly warm day I was sitting book in hand at an open window commanding through a long vista of the river banks a view of a distant hill the face of which nearest my position had been denuded by what is termed a land slide of the principal portion of its trees My thoughts had been long wandering from the volume before me to the gloom and desolation of the neighboring city Uplifting my eyes from the page they fell upon the naked face of the bill and upon an object upon some living monster of hideous conformation which very rapidly made its way from the summit to the bottom disappearing finally in the dense forest below As this creature first came in sight I doubted my own sanity or at least the evidence of my own eyes and many minutes passed before I succeeded in convincing myself that I was neither mad nor in a dream Yet when I described the monster which I distinctly saw and calmly surveyed through the whole period of its progress my readers I fear will feel more difficulty in being convinced of these points than even I did myself Estimating the size of the creature by comparison with the diameter of the large trees near which it passed the few giants of the forest which had escaped the fury of the land slide I concluded it to be far larger than any ship of the line in existence I say ship of the line because the shape of the monster suggested the idea the hull of one of our seventy four might convey a very tolerable conception of the general outline The mouth of the animal was situated at the extremity of a proboscis some sixty or seventy feet in length and about as thick as the body of an ordinary elephant Near the root of this trunk was an immense quantity of black shaggy hair more than could have been supplied by the coats of a score of buffaloes and projecting from this hair downwardly and laterally sprang two gleaming tusks not unlike those of the wild boar but of infinitely greater dimensions Extending forward parallel with the proboscis and on each side of it was a gigantic staff thirty or forty feet in length formed seemingly of pure crystal and in shape a perfect prism it reflected in the most gorgeous manner the rays of the declining sun The trunk was fashioned like a wedge with the apex to the earth From it there were outspread two pairs of wings each wing nearly one hundred yards in length one pair being placed above the other and all thickly covered with metal scales each scale apparently some ten or twelve feet in diameter I observed that the upper and lower tiers of wings were connected by a strong chain But the chief peculiarity of this horrible thing was the representation of a Death s Head which covered nearly the whole surface of its breast and which was as accurately traced in glaring white upon the dark ground of the body as if it had been there carefully designed by an artist While I regarded the terrific animal and more especially the appearance on its breast with a feeling or horror and awe with a sentiment of forthcoming evil which I found it impossible to quell by any effort of the reason I perceived the huge jaws at the extremity of the proboscis suddenly expand themselves and from them there proceeded a sound so loud and so expressive of wo that it struck upon my nerves like a knell and as the monster disappeared at the foot of the hill I fell at once fainting to the floor Upon recovering my first impulse of course was to inform my friend of what I had seen and heard and I can scarcely explain what feeling of repugnance it was which in the end operated to prevent me At length one evening some three or four days after the occurrence we were sitting together in the room in which I had seen the apparition I occupying the same seat at the same window and he lounging on a sofa near at hand The association of the place and time impelled me to give him an account of the phenomenon He heard me to the end at first laughed heartily and then lapsed into an excessively grave demeanor as if my insanity was a thing beyond suspicion At this instant I again had a distinct view of the monster to which with a shout of absolute terror I now directed his attention He looked eagerly but maintained that he saw nothing although I designated minutely the course of the creature as it made its way down the naked face of the hill I was now immeasurably alarmed for I considered the vision either as an omen of my death or worse as the fore runner of an attack of mania I threw myself passionately back in my chair and for some moments buried my face in my hands When I uncovered my eyes the apparition was no longer apparent My host however had in some degree resumed the calmness of his demeanor and questioned me very rigorously in respect to the conformation of the visionary creature When I had fully satisfied him on this head he sighed deeply as if relieved of some intolerable burden and went on to talk with what I thought a cruel calmness of various points of speculative philosophy which had heretofore formed subject of discussion between us I remember his insisting very especially among other things upon the idea that the principle source of error in all human investigations lay in the liability of the understanding to under rate or to over value the importance of an object through mere mis admeasurement of its propinquity To estimate properly for example he said the influence to be exercised on mankind at large by the thorough diffusion of Democracy the distance of the epoch at which such diffusion may possibly be accomplished should not fail to form an item in the estimate Yet can you tell me one writer on the subject of government who has ever thought this particular branch of the subject worthy of discussion at all He here paused for a moment stepped to a book case and brought forth one of the ordinary synopses of Natural History Requesting me then to exchange seats with him that he might the better distinguish the fine print of the volume he took my armchair at the window and opening the book resumed his discourse very much in the same tone as before But for your exceeding minuteness he said in describing the monster I might never have had it in my power to demonstrate to you what it was In the first place let me read to you a schoolboy account of the genus Sphinx of the family Crepuscularia of the order Lepidoptera of the class of Insecta or insects The account runs thus Four membranous wings covered with little colored scales of metallic appearance mouth forming a rolled proboscis produced by an elongation of the jaws upon the sides of which are found the rudiments of mandibles and downy palpi the inferior wings retained to the superior by a stiff hair antennae in the form of an elongated club prismatic abdomen pointed The Death s headed Sphinx has occasioned much terror among the vulgar at times by the melancholy kind of cry which it utters and the insignia of death which it wears upon its corslet He here closed the book and leaned forward in the chair placing himself accurately in the position which I had occupied at the moment of beholding the monster Ah here it is he presently exclaimed it is reascending the face of the hill and a very remarkable looking creature I admit it to be Still it is by no means so large or so distant as you imagined it for the fact is that as it wriggles its way up this thread which some spider has wrought along the window sash I find it to be about the sixteenth of an inch in its extreme length and also about the sixteenth of an inch distant from the pupil of my eye HOP FROG I never knew anyone so keenly alive to a joke as the king was He seemed to live only for joking To tell a good story of the joke kind and to tell it well was the surest road to his favor Thus it happened that his seven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers They all took after the king too in being large corpulent oily men as well as inimitable jokers Whether people grow fat by joking or whether there is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke I have never been quite able to determine but certain it is that a lean joker is a rara avis in terris About the refinements or as he called them the ghost of wit the king troubled himself very little He had an especial admiration for breadth in a jest and would often put up with length for the sake of it Over niceties wearied him He would have preferred Rabelais Gargantua to the Zadig of Voltaire and upon the whole practical jokes suited his taste far better than verbal ones At the date of my narrative professing jesters had not altogether gone out of fashion at court Several of the great continental powers still retain their fools who wore motley with caps and bells and who were expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms at a moment s notice in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table Our king as a matter of course retained his fool The fact is he required something in the way of folly if only to counterbalance the heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers not to mention himself His fool or professional jester was not only a fool however His value was trebled in the eyes of the king by the fact of his being also a dwarf and a cripple Dwarfs were as common at court in those days as fools and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through their days days are rather longer at court than elsewhere without both a jester to laugh with and a dwarf to laugh at But as I have already observed your jesters in ninety nine cases out of a hundred are fat round and unwieldy so that it was no small source of self gratulation with our king that in Hop Frog this was the fool s name he possessed a triplicate treasure in one person I believe the name Hop Frog was not that given to the dwarf by his sponsors at baptism but it was conferred upon him by general consent of the several ministers on account of his inability to walk as other men do In fact Hop Frog could only get along by a sort of interjectional gait something between a leap and a wriggle a movement that afforded illimitable amusement and of course consolation to the king for notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional swelling of the head the king by his whole court was accounted a capital figure But although Hop Frog through the distortion of his legs could move only with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor the prodigious muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his arms by way of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs enabled him to perform many feats of wonderful dexterity where trees or ropes were in question or any thing else to climb At such exercises he certainly much more resembled a squirrel or a small monkey than a frog I am not able to say with precision from what country Hop Frog originally came It was from some barbarous region however that no person ever heard of a vast distance from the court of our king Hop Frog and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself although of exquisite proportions and a marvellous dancer had been forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces and sent as presents to the king by one of his ever victorious generals Under these circumstances it is not to be wondered at that a close intimacy arose between the two little captives Indeed they soon became sworn friends Hop Frog who although he made a great deal of sport was by no means popular had it not in his power to render Trippetta many services but she on account of her grace and exquisite beauty although a dwarf was universally admired and petted so she possessed much influence and never failed to use it whenever she could for the benefit of Hop Frog On some grand state occasion I forgot what the king determined to have a masquerade and whenever a masquerade or any thing of that kind occurred at our court then the talents both of Hop Frog and Trippetta were sure to be called into play Hop Frog in especial was so inventive in the way of getting up pageants suggesting novel characters and arranging costumes for masked balls that nothing could be done it seems without his assistance The night appointed for the fete had arrived A gorgeous hall had been fitted up under Trippetta s eye with every kind of device which could possibly give eclat to a masquerade The whole court was in a fever of expectation As for costumes and characters it might well be supposed that everybody had come to a decision on such points Many had made up their minds as to what roles they should assume a week or even a month in advance and in fact there was not a particle of indecision anywhere except in the case of the king and his seven minsters Why they hesitated I never could tell unless they did it by way of a joke More probably they found it difficult on account of being so fat to make up their minds At all events time flew and as a last resort they sent for Trippetta and Hop Frog When the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king they found him sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council but the monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor He knew that Hop Frog was not fond of wine for it excited the poor cripple almost to madness and madness is no comfortable feeling But the king loved his practical jokes and took pleasure in forcing Hop Frog to drink and as the king called it to be merry Come here Hop Frog said he as the jester and his friend entered the room swallow this bumper to the health of your absent friends here Hop Frog sighed and then let us have the benefit of your invention We want characters characters man something novel out of the way We are wearied with this everlasting sameness Come drink the wine will brighten your wits Hop Frog endeavored as usual to get up a jest in reply to these advances from the king but the effort was too much It happened to be the poor dwarf s birthday and the command to drink to his absent friends forced the tears to his eyes Many large bitter drops fell into the goblet as he took it humbly from the hand of the tyrant Ah ha ha roared the latter as the dwarf reluctantly drained the beaker See what a glass of good wine can do Why your eyes are shining already Poor fellow his large eyes gleamed rather than shone for the effect of wine on his excitable brain was not more powerful than instantaneous He placed the goblet nervously on the table and looked round upon the company with a half insane stare They all seemed highly amused at the success of the king s joke And now to business said the prime minister a very fat man Yes said the King Come lend us your assistance Characters my fine fellow we stand in need of characters all of us ha ha ha and as this was seriously meant for a joke his laugh was chorused by the seven Hop Frog also laughed although feebly and somewhat vacantly Come come said the king impatiently have you nothing to suggest I am endeavoring to think of something novel replied the dwarf abstractedly for he was quite bewildered by the wine Endeavoring cried the tyrant fiercely what do you mean by that Ah I perceive You are Sulky and want more wine Here drink this and he poured out another goblet full and offered it to the cripple who merely gazed at it gasping for breath Drink I say shouted the monster or by the fiends The dwarf hesitated The king grew purple with rage The courtiers smirked Trippetta pale as a corpse advanced to the monarch s seat and falling on her knees before him implored him to spare her friend The tyrant regarded her for some moments in evident wonder at her audacity He seemed quite at a loss what to do or say how most becomingly to express his indignation At last without uttering a syllable he pushed her violently from him and threw the contents of the brimming goblet in her face The poor girl got up the best she could and not daring even to sigh resumed her position at the foot of the table There was a dead silence for about half a minute during which the falling of a leaf or of a feather might have been heard It was interrupted by a low but harsh and protracted grating sound which seemed to come at once from every corner of the room What what what are you making that noise for demanded the king turning furiously to the dwarf The latter seemed to have recovered in great measure from his intoxication and looking fixedly but quietly into the tyrant s face merely ejaculated I I How could it have been me The sound appeared to come from without observed one of the courtiers I fancy it was the parrot at the window whetting his bill upon his cage wires True replied the monarch as if much relieved by the suggestion but on the honor of a knight I could have sworn that it was the gritting of this vagabond s teeth Hereupon the dwarf laughed the king was too confirmed a joker to object to any one s laughing and displayed a set of large powerful and very repulsive teeth Moreover he avowed his perfect willingness to swallow as much wine as desired The monarch was pacified and having drained another bumper with no very perceptible ill effect Hop Frog entered at once and with spirit into the plans for the masquerade I cannot tell what was the association of idea observed he very tranquilly and as if he had never tasted wine in his life but just after your majesty had struck the girl and thrown the wine in her face just after your majesty had done this and while the parrot was making that odd noise outside the window there came into my mind a capital diversion one of my own country frolics often enacted among us at our masquerades but here it will be new altogether Unfortunately however it requires a company of eight persons and Here we are cried the king laughing at his acute discovery of the coincidence eight to a fraction I and my seven ministers Come what is the diversion We call it replied the cripple the Eight Chained Ourang Outangs and it really is excellent sport if well enacted We will enact it remarked the king drawing himself up and lowering his eyelids The beauty of the game continued Hop Frog lies in the fright it occasions among the women Capital roared in chorus the monarch and his ministry I will equip you as ourang outangs proceeded the dwarf leave all that to me The resemblance shall be so striking that the company of masqueraders will take you for real beasts and of course they will be as much terrified as astonished Oh this is exquisite exclaimed the king Hop Frog I will make a man of you The chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their jangling You are supposed to have escaped en masse from your keepers Your majesty cannot conceive the effect produced at a masquerade by eight chained ourang outangs imagined to be real ones by most of the company and rushing in with savage cries among the crowd of delicately and gorgeously habited men and women The contrast is inimitable It must be said the king and the council arose hurriedly as it was growing late to put in execution the scheme of Hop Frog His mode of equipping the party as ourang outangs was very simple but effective enough for his purposes The animals in question had at the epoch of my story very rarely been seen in any part of the civilized world and as the imitations made by the dwarf were sufficiently beast like and more than sufficiently hideous their truthfulness to nature was thus thought to be secured The king and his ministers were first encased in tight fitting stockinet shirts and drawers They were then saturated with tar At this stage of the process some one of the party suggested feathers but the suggestion was at once overruled by the dwarf who soon convinced the eight by ocular demonstration that the hair of such a brute as the ourang outang was much more efficiently represented by flu A thick coating of the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar A long chain was now procured First it was passed about the waist of the king and tied then about another of the party and also tied then about all successively in the same manner When this chaining arrangement was complete and the party stood as far apart from each other as possible they formed a circle and to make all things appear natural Hop Frog passed the residue of the chain in two diameters at right angles across the circle after the fashion adopted at the present day by those who capture Chimpanzees or other large apes in Borneo The grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place was a circular room very lofty and receiving the light of the sun only through a single window at top At night the season for which the apartment was especially designed it was illuminated principally by a large chandelier depending by a chain from the centre of the sky light and lowered or elevated by means of a counter balance as usual but in order not to look unsightly this latter passed outside the cupola and over the roof The arrangements of the room had been left to Trippetta s superintendence but in some particulars it seems she had been guided by the calmer judgment of her friend the dwarf At his suggestion it was that on this occasion the chandelier was removed Its waxen drippings which in weather so warm it was quite impossible to prevent would have been seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the guests who on account of the crowded state of the saloon could not all be expected to keep from out its centre that is to say from under the chandelier Additional sconces were set in various parts of the hall out of the war and a flambeau emitting sweet odor was placed in the right hand of each of the Caryaides Caryatides that stood against the wall some fifty or sixty altogether The eight ourang outangs taking Hop Frog s advice waited patiently until midnight when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders before making their appearance No sooner had the clock ceased striking however than they rushed or rather rolled in all together for the impediments of their chains caused most of the party to fall and all to stumble as they entered The excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious and filled the heart of the king with glee As had been anticipated there were not a few of the guests who supposed the ferocious looking creatures to be beasts of some kind in reality if not precisely ourang outangs Many of the women swooned with affright and had not the king taken the precaution to exclude all weapons from the saloon his party might soon have expiated their frolic in their blood As it was a general rush was made for the doors but the king had ordered them to be locked immediately upon his entrance and at the dwarf s suggestion the keys had been deposited with him While the tumult was at its height and each masquerader attentive only to his own safety for in fact there was much real danger from the pressure of the excited crowd the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung and which had been drawn up on its removal might have been seen very gradually to descend until its hooked extremity came within three feet of the floor Soon after this the king and his seven friends having reeled about the hall in all directions found themselves at length in its centre and of course in immediate contact with the chain While they were thus situated the dwarf who had followed noiselessly at their heels inciting them to keep up the commotion took hold of their own chain at the intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle diametrically and at right angles Here with the rapidity of thought he inserted the hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend and in an instant by some unseen agency the chandelier chain was drawn so far upward as to take the hook out of reach and as an inevitable consequence to drag the ourang outangs together in close connection and face to face The masqueraders by this time had recovered in some measure from their alarm and beginning to regard the whole matter as a well contrived pleasantry set up a loud shout of laughter at the predicament of the apes Leave them to me now screamed Hop Frog his shrill voice making itself easily heard through all the din Leave them to me I fancy I know them If I can only get a good look at them I can soon tell who they are Here scrambling over the heads of the crowd he managed to get to the wall when seizing a flambeau from one of the Caryatides he returned as he went to the centre of the room leaping with the agility of a monkey upon the kings head and thence clambered a few feet up the chain holding down the torch to examine the group of ourang outangs and still screaming I shall soon find out who they are And now while the whole assembly the apes included were convulsed with laughter the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle when the chain flew violently up for about thirty feet dragging with it the dismayed and struggling ourang outangs and leaving them suspended in mid air between the sky light and the floor Hop Frog clinging to the chain as it rose still maintained his relative position in respect to the eight maskers and still as if nothing were the matter continued to thrust his torch down toward them as though endeavoring to discover who they were So thoroughly astonished was the whole company at this ascent that a dead silence of about a minute s duration ensued It was broken by just such a low harsh grating sound as had before attracted the attention of the king and his councillors when the former threw the wine in the face of Trippetta But on the present occasion there could be no question as to whence the sound issued It came from the fang like teeth of the dwarf who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at the mouth and glared with an expression of maniacal rage into the upturned countenances of the king and his seven companions Ah ha said at length the infuriated jester Ah ha I begin to see who these people are now Here pretending to scrutinize the king more closely he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which enveloped him and which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame In less than half a minute the whole eight ourang outangs were blazing fiercely amid the shrieks of the multitude who gazed at them from below horror stricken and without the power to render them the slightest assistance At length the flames suddenly increasing in virulence forced the jester to climb higher up the chain to be out of their reach and as he made this movement the crowd again sank for a brief instant into silence The dwarf seized his opportunity and once more spoke I now see distinctly he said what manner of people these maskers are They are a great king and his seven privy councillors a king who does not scruple to strike a defenceless girl and his seven councillors who abet him in the outrage As for myself I am simply Hop Frog the jester and this is my last jest Owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which it adhered the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech before the work of vengeance was complete The eight corpses swung in their chains a fetid blackened hideous and indistinguishable mass The cripple hurled his torch at them clambered leisurely to the ceiling and disappeared through the sky light It is supposed that Trippetta stationed on the roof of the saloon had been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge and that together they effected their escape to their own country for neither was seen again THE MAN OF THE CROWD Ce grand malheur de ne pouvoir etre seul La Bruyere IT was well said of a certain German book that er lasst sich nicht lesen it does not permit itself to be read There are some secrets which do not permit themselves to be told Men die nightly in their beds wringing the hands of ghostly confessors and looking them piteously in the eyes die with despair of heart and convulsion of throat on account of the hideousness of mysteries which will not suffer themselves to be revealed Now and then alas the conscience of man takes up a burthen so heavy in horror that it can be thrown down only into the grave And thus the essence of all crime is undivulged Not long ago about the closing in of an evening in autumn I sat at the large bow window of the D Coffee House in London For some months I had been ill in health but was now convalescent and with returning strength found myself in one of those happy moods which are so precisely the converse of ennui moods of the keenest appetency when the film from the mental vision departs the Greek phrase and the intellect electrified surpasses as greatly its every day condition as does the vivid yet candid reason of Leibnitz the mad and flimsy rhetoric of Gorgias Merely to breathe was enjoyment and I derived positive pleasure even from many of the legitimate sources of pain I felt a calm but inquisitive interest in every thing With a cigar in my mouth and a newspaper in my lap I had been amusing myself for the greater part of the afternoon now in poring over advertisements now in observing the promiscuous company in the room and now in peering through the smoky panes into the street This latter is one of the principal thoroughfares of the city and had been very much crowded during the whole day But as the darkness came on the throng momently increased and by the time the lamps were well lighted two dense and continuous tides of population were rushing past the door At this particular period of the evening I had never before been in a similar situation and the tumultuous sea of human heads filled me therefore with a delicious novelty of emotion I gave up at length all care of things within the hotel and became absorbed in contemplation of the scene without At first my observations took an abstract and generalizing turn I looked at the passengers in masses and thought of them in their aggregate relations Soon however I descended to details and regarded with minute interest the innumerable varieties of figure dress air gait visage and expression of countenance By far the greater number of those who went by had a satisfied business like demeanor and seemed to be thinking only of making their way through the press Their brows were knit and their eyes rolled quickly when pushed against by fellow wayfarers they evinced no symptom of impatience but adjusted their clothes and hurried on Others still a numerous class were restless in their movements had flushed faces and talked and gesticulated to themselves as if feeling in solitude on account of the very denseness of the company around When impeded in their progress these people suddenly ceased muttering but re doubled their gesticulations and awaited with an absent and overdone smile upon the lips the course of the persons impeding them If jostled they bowed profusely to the jostlers and appeared overwhelmed with confusion There was nothing very distinctive about these two large classes beyond what I have noted Their habiliments belonged to that order which is pointedly termed the decent They were undoubtedly noblemen merchants attorneys tradesmen stock jobbers the Eupatrids and the common places of society men of leisure and men actively engaged in affairs of their own conducting business upon their own responsibility They did not greatly excite my attention The tribe of clerks was an obvious one and here I discerned two remarkable divisions There were the junior clerks of flash houses young gentlemen with tight coats bright boots well oiled hair and supercilious lips Setting aside a certain dapperness of carriage which may be termed deskism for want of a better word the manner of these persons seemed to me an exact fac simile of what had been the perfection of bon ton about twelve or eighteen months before They wore the cast off graces of the gentry and this I believe involves the best definition of the class The division of the upper clerks of staunch firms or of the steady old fellows it was not possible to mistake

none	none	There were two other traits moreover by which I could always detect them a guarded lowness of tone in conversation and a more than ordinary extension of the thumb in a direction at right angles with the fingers Very often in company with these sharpers I observed an order of men somewhat different in habits but still birds of a kindred feather They may be defined as the gentlemen who live by their wits

none	none	The wild effects of the light enchained me to an examination of individual faces and although the rapidity with which the world of light flitted before the window prevented me from casting more than a glance upon each visage still it seemed that in my then peculiar mental state I could frequently read even in that brief interval of a glance the history of long years With my brow to the glass I was thus occupied in scrutinizing the mob when suddenly there came into view a countenance that of a decrepid old man some sixty five or seventy years of age a countenance which at once arrested and absorbed my whole attention on account of the absolute idiosyncrasy of its expression Any thing even remotely resembling that expression I had never seen before

8592_285135_000020_000004	train-clean-360	I felt singularly aroused startled fascinated

8592_285135_000020_000006	train-clean-360	Hurriedly putting on an overcoat and seizing my hat and cane I made my way into the street and pushed through the crowd in the direction which I had seen him take for he had already disappeared With some little difficulty I at length came within sight of him approached and followed him closely yet cautiously so as not to attract his attention 
8592_285135_000021_000000	train-clean-360	I had now a good opportunity of examining his person 
8592_285135_000021_000001	train-clean-360	He was short in stature very thin and apparently very feeble 
none	none	His clothes generally were filthy and ragged but as he came now and then within the strong glare of a lamp I perceived that his linen although dirty was of beautiful texture and my vision deceived me or through a rent in a closely buttoned and evidently second handed roquelaire which enveloped him I caught a glimpse both of a diamond and of a dagger These observations heightened my curiosity and I resolved to follow the stranger whithersoever he should go 
8592_285135_000022_000000	train-clean-360	It was now fully night fall and a thick humid fog hung over the city soon ending in a settled and heavy rain

8592_285135_000022_000005	train-clean-360	For half an hour the old man held his way with difficulty along the great thoroughfare and I here walked close at his elbow through fear of losing sight of him

8592_285135_000022_000007	train-clean-360	By and bye he passed into a cross street which although densely filled with people was not quite so much thronged as the main one he had quitted 
8592_285135_000022_000008	train-clean-360	Here a change in his demeanor became evident 
none	none	He walked more slowly and with less object than before more hesitatingly He crossed and re crossed the way repeatedly without apparent aim and the press was still so thick that at every such movement I was obliged to follow him closely The street was a narrow and long one and his course lay within it for nearly an hour during which the passengers had gradually diminished to about that number which is ordinarily seen at noon in Broadway near the Park so vast a difference is there between a London populace and that of the most frequented American city 
8592_285135_000022_000011	train-clean-360	A second turn brought us into a square brilliantly lighted and overflowing with life 
none	none	The old manner of the stranger re appeared His chin fell upon his breast while his eyes rolled wildly from under his knit brows in every direction upon those who hemmed him in

none	none	I was surprised however to find upon his having made the circuit of the square that he turned and retraced his steps Still more was I astonished to see him repeat the same walk several times once nearly detecting me as he came round with a sudden movement In this exercise he spent another hour at the end of which we met with far less interruption from passengers than at first

none	none	With a gesture of impatience the wanderer passed into a bye street comparatively deserted Down this some quarter of a mile long he rushed with an activity I could not have dreamed of seeing in one so aged and which put me to much trouble in pursuit A few minutes brought us to a large and busy bazaar with the localities of which the stranger appeared well acquainted and where his original demeanor again became apparent as he forced his way to and fro without aim among the host of buyers and sellers During the hour and a half or thereabouts which we passed in this place it required much caution on my part to keep him within reach without attracting his observation Luckily I wore a pair of caoutchouc over shoes and could move about in perfect silence 
8592_285135_000024_000002	train-clean-360	At no moment did he see that I watched him 
none	none	He entered shop after shop priced nothing spoke no word and looked at all objects with a wild and vacant stare I was now utterly amazed at his behavior and firmly resolved that we should not part until I had satisfied myself in some measure respecting him A loud toned clock struck eleven and the company were fast deserting the bazaar A shop keeper in putting up a shutter jostled the old man and at the instant I saw a strong shudder come over his frame He hurried into the street looked anxiously around him for an instant and then ran with incredible swiftness through many crooked and people less lanes until we emerged once more upon the great thoroughfare whence we had started the street of the D Hotel It no longer wore however the same aspect It was still brilliant with gas but the rain fell fiercely and there were few persons to be seen The stranger grew pale He walked moodily some paces up the once populous avenue then with a heavy sigh turned in the direction of the river and plunging through a great variety of devious ways came out at length in view of one of the principal theatres It was about being closed and the audience were thronging from the doors I saw the old man gasp as if for breath while he threw himself amid the crowd but I thought that the intense agony of his countenance had in some measure abated His head again fell upon his breast he appeared as I had seen him at first I observed that he now took the course in which had gone the greater number of the audience but upon the whole I was at a loss to comprehend the waywardness of his actions As he proceeded the company grew more scattered and his old uneasiness and vacillation were resumed For some time he followed closely a party of some ten or twelve roisterers but from this number one by one dropped off until three only remained together in a narrow and gloomy lane little frequented The stranger paused and for a moment seemed lost in thought then with every mark of agitation pursued rapidly a route which brought us to the verge of the city amid regions very different from those we had hitherto traversed 
8592_285135_000026_000003	train-clean-360	It was the most noisome quarter of London where every thing wore the worst impress of the most deplorable poverty and of the most desperate crime

8592_285135_000027_000005	train-clean-360	Long and swiftly he fled while I followed him in the wildest amazement resolute not to abandon a scrutiny in which I now felt an interest all absorbing 
none	none	The sun arose while we proceeded and when we had once again reached that most thronged mart of the populous town the street of the D Hotel it presented an appearance of human bustle and activity scarcely inferior to what I had seen on the evening before And here long amid the momently increasing confusion did I persist in my pursuit of the stranger But as usual he walked to and fro and during the day did not pass from out the turmoil of that street And as the shades of the second evening came on I grew wearied unto death and stopping fully in front of the wanderer gazed at him steadfastly in the face He noticed me not but resumed his solemn walk while I ceasing to follow remained absorbed in contemplation This old man I said at length is the type and the genius of deep crime

Hop O My Thumb In short it has been shown that no man can sit down to write without a very profound design Thus to authors in general much trouble is spared A novelist for example need have no care of his moral It is there that is to say it is somewhere and the moral and the critics can take care of themselves When the proper time arrives all that the gentleman intended and all that he did not intend will be brought to light in the Dial or the Down Easter together with all that he ought to have intended and the rest that he clearly meant to intend so that it will all come very straight in the end There is no just ground therefore for the charge brought against me by certain ignoramuses that I have never written a moral tale or in more precise words a tale with a moral They are not the critics predestined to bring me out and develop my morals that is the secret By and by the North American Quarterly Humdrum will make them ashamed of their stupidity In the meantime by way of staying execution by way of mitigating the accusations against me I offer the sad history appended a history about whose obvious moral there can be no question whatever since he who runs may read it in the large capitals which form the title of the tale I should have credit for this arrangement a far wiser one than that of La Fontaine and others who reserve the impression to be conveyed until the last moment and thus sneak it in at the fag end of their fables Defuncti injuria ne afficiantur was a law of the twelve tables and De mortuis nil nisi bonum is an excellent injunction even if the dead in question be nothing but dead small beer It is not my design therefore to vituperate my deceased friend Toby Dammit He was a sad dog it is true and a dog s death it was that he died but he himself was not to blame for his vices They grew out of a personal defect in his mother She did her best in the way of flogging him while an infant for duties to her well regulated mind were always pleasures and babies like tough steaks or the modern Greek olive trees are invariably the better for beating but poor woman she had the misfortune to be left handed and a child flogged left handedly had better be left unflogged The world revolves from right to left It will not do to whip a baby from left to right If each blow in the proper direction drives an evil propensity out it follows that every thump in an opposite one knocks its quota of wickedness in I was often present at Toby s chastisements and even by the way in which he kicked I could perceive that he was getting worse and worse every day At last I saw through the tears in my eyes that there was no hope of the villain at all and one day when he had been cuffed until he grew so black in the face that one might have mistaken him for a little African and no effect had been produced beyond that of making him wriggle himself into a fit I could stand it no longer but went down upon my knees forthwith and uplifting my voice made prophecy of his ruin The fact is that his precocity in vice was awful At five months of age he used to get into such passions that he was unable to articulate At six months I caught him gnawing a pack of cards At seven months he was in the constant habit of catching and kissing the female babies At eight months he peremptorily refused to put his signature to the Temperance pledge Thus he went on increasing in iniquity month after month until at the close of the first year he not only insisted upon wearing moustaches but had contracted a propensity for cursing and swearing and for backing his assertions by bets Through this latter most ungentlemanly practice the ruin which I had predicted to Toby Dammit overtook him at last The fashion had grown with his growth and strengthened with his strength so that when he came to be a man he could scarcely utter a sentence without interlarding it with a proposition to gamble Not that he actually laid wagers no I will do my friend the justice to say that he would as soon have laid eggs With him the thing was a mere formula nothing more His expressions on this head had no meaning attached to them whatever They were simple if not altogether innocent expletives imaginative phrases wherewith to round off a sentence When he said I ll bet you so and so nobody ever thought of taking him up but still I could not help thinking it my duty to put him down The habit was an immoral one and so I told him It was a vulgar one this I begged him to believe It was discountenanced by society here I said nothing but the truth It was forbidden by act of Congress here I had not the slightest intention of telling a lie I remonstrated but to no purpose I demonstrated in vain I entreated he smiled I implored he laughed I preached he sneered I threatened he swore I kicked him he called for the police I pulled his nose he blew it and offered to bet the Devil his head that I would not venture to try that experiment again Poverty was another vice which the peculiar physical deficiency of Dammit s mother had entailed upon her son He was detestably poor and this was the reason no doubt that his expletive expressions about betting seldom took a pecuniary turn I will not be bound to say that I ever heard him make use of such a figure of speech as I ll bet you a dollar It was usually I ll bet you what you please or I ll bet you what you dare or I ll bet you a trifle or else more significantly still I ll bet the Devil my head This latter form seemed to please him best perhaps because it involved the least risk for Dammit had become excessively parsimonious Had any one taken him up his head was small and thus his loss would have been small too But these are my own reflections and I am by no means sure that I am right in attributing them to him At all events the phrase in question grew daily in favor notwithstanding the gross impropriety of a man betting his brains like bank notes but this was a point which my friend s perversity of disposition would not permit him to comprehend In the end he abandoned all other forms of wager and gave himself up to I ll bet the Devil my head with a pertinacity and exclusiveness of devotion that displeased not less than it surprised me I am always displeased by circumstances for which I cannot account Mysteries force a man to think and so injure his health The truth is there was something in the air with which mister Dammit was wont to give utterance to his offensive expression something in his manner of enunciation which at first interested and afterwards made me very uneasy something which for want of a more definite term at present I must be permitted to call queer but which mister Coleridge would have called mystical mister Kant pantheistical mister Carlyle twistical and mister Emerson hyperquizzitistical I began not to like it at all mister Dammits soul was in a perilous state I resolved to bring all my eloquence into play to save it I vowed to serve him as saint Patrick in the Irish chronicle is said to have served the toad that is to say awaken him to a sense of his situation I addressed myself to the task forthwith Once more I betook myself to remonstrance Again I collected my energies for a final attempt at expostulation When I had made an end of my lecture mister Dammit indulged himself in some very equivocal behavior For some moments he remained silent merely looking me inquisitively in the face But presently he threw his head to one side and elevated his eyebrows to a great extent Then he spread out the palms of his hands and shrugged up his shoulders Then he winked with the right eye Then he repeated the operation with the left Then he shut them both up very tight Then he opened them both so very wide that I became seriously alarmed for the consequences Then applying his thumb to his nose he thought proper to make an indescribable movement with the rest of his fingers Finally setting his arms a kimbo he condescended to reply I can call to mind only the beads of his discourse He would be obliged to me if I would hold my tongue He wished none of my advice He despised all my insinuations He was old enough to take care of himself Did I still think him baby Dammit Did I mean to say any thing against his character Did I intend to insult him Was I a fool Was my maternal parent aware in a word of my absence from the domiciliary residence He would put this latter question to me as to a man of veracity and he would bind himself to abide by my reply Once more he would demand explicitly if my mother knew that I was out My confusion he said betrayed me and he would be willing to bet the Devil his head that she did not mister Dammit did not pause for my rejoinder Turning upon his heel he left my presence with undignified precipitation It was well for him that he did so My feelings had been wounded Even my anger had been aroused For once I would have taken him up upon his insulting wager I would have won for the Arch Enemy mister Dammit s little head for the fact is my mamma was very well aware of my merely temporary absence from home But Khoda shefa midehed Heaven gives relief as the Mussulmans say when you tread upon their toes It was in pursuance of my duty that I had been insulted and I bore the insult like a man It now seemed to me however that I had done all that could be required of me in the case of this miserable individual and I resolved to trouble him no longer with my counsel but to leave him to his conscience and himself But although I forebore to intrude with my advice I could not bring myself to give up his society altogether I even went so far as to humor some of his less reprehensible propensities and there were times when I found myself lauding his wicked jokes as epicures do mustard with tears in my eyes so profoundly did it grieve me to hear his evil talk One fine day having strolled out together arm in arm our route led us in the direction of a river There was a bridge and we resolved to cross it It was roofed over by way of protection from the weather and the archway having but few windows was thus very uncomfortably dark As we entered the passage the contrast between the external glare and the interior gloom struck heavily upon my spirits Not so upon those of the unhappy Dammit who offered to bet the Devil his head that I was hipped He seemed to be in an unusual good humor He was excessively lively so much so that I entertained I know not what of uneasy suspicion It is not impossible that he was affected with the transcendentals I am not well enough versed however in the diagnosis of this disease to speak with decision upon the point and unhappily there were none of my friends of the Dial present I suggest the idea nevertheless because of a certain species of austere Merry Andrewism which seemed to beset my poor friend and caused him to make quite a Tom Fool of himself Nothing would serve him but wriggling and skipping about under and over every thing that came in his way now shouting out and now lisping out all manner of odd little and big words yet preserving the gravest face in the world all the time I really could not make up my mind whether to kick or to pity him At length having passed nearly across the bridge we approached the termination of the footway when our progress was impeded by a turnstile of some height Through this I made my way quietly pushing it around as usual But this turn would not serve the turn of mister Dammit He insisted upon leaping the stile and said he could cut a pigeon wing over it in the air Now this conscientiously speaking I did not think he could do The best pigeon winger over all kinds of style was my friend mister Carlyle and as I knew he could not do it I would not believe that it could be done by Toby Dammit I therefore told him in so many words that he was a braggadocio and could not do what he said For this I had reason to be sorry afterward for he straightway offered to bet the Devil his head that he could I was about to reply notwithstanding my previous resolutions with some remonstrance against his impiety when I heard close at my elbow a slight cough which sounded very much like the ejaculation ahem I started and looked about me in surprise My glance at length fell into a nook of the frame work of the bridge and upon the figure of a little lame old gentleman of venerable aspect Nothing could be more reverend than his whole appearance for he not only had on a full suit of black but his shirt was perfectly clean and the collar turned very neatly down over a white cravat while his hair was parted in front like a girl s His hands were clasped pensively together over his stomach and his two eyes were carefully rolled up into the top of his head Upon observing him more closely I perceived that he wore a black silk apron over his small clothes and this was a thing which I thought very odd Before I had time to make any remark however upon so singular a circumstance he interrupted me with a second ahem To this observation I was not immediately prepared to reply The fact is remarks of this laconic nature are nearly unanswerable I have known a Quarterly Review non plussed by the word Fudge I am not ashamed to say therefore that I turned to mister Dammit for assistance Dammit said I what are you about don t you hear the gentleman says ahem I looked sternly at my friend while I thus addressed him for to say the truth I felt particularly puzzled and when a man is particularly puzzled he must knit his brows and look savage or else he is pretty sure to look like a fool Dammit observed I although this sounded very much like an oath than which nothing was further from my thoughts Dammit I suggested the gentleman says ahem I do not attempt to defend my remark on the score of profundity I did not think it profound myself but I have noticed that the effect of our speeches is not always proportionate with their importance in our own eyes and if I had shot mister D through and through with a Paixhan bomb or knocked him in the head with the Poets and Poetry of America he could hardly have been more discomfited than when I addressed him with those simple words Dammit what are you about don t you hear the gentleman says ahem You don t say so gasped he at length after turning more colors than a pirate runs up one after the other when chased by a man of war Are you quite sure he said that Well at all events I am in for it now and may as well put a bold face upon the matter Here goes then ahem At this the little old gentleman seemed pleased God only knows why He left his station at the nook of the bridge limped forward with a gracious air took Dammit by the hand and shook it cordially looking all the while straight up in his face with an air of the most unadulterated benignity which it is possible for the mind of man to imagine I am quite sure you will win it Dammit said he with the frankest of all smiles but we are obliged to have a trial you know for the sake of mere form Ahem replied my friend taking off his coat with a deep sigh tying a pocket handkerchief around his waist and producing an unaccountable alteration in his countenance by twisting up his eyes and bringing down the corners of his mouth ahem And ahem said he again after a pause and not another word more than ahem did I ever know him to say after that Aha thought I without expressing myself aloud this is quite a remarkable silence on the part of Toby Dammit and is no doubt a consequence of his verbosity upon a previous occasion One extreme induces another I wonder if he has forgotten the many unanswerable questions which he propounded to me so fluently on the day when I gave him my last lecture At all events he is cured of the transcendentals Ahem here replied Toby just as if he had been reading my thoughts and looking like a very old sheep in a revery The old gentleman now took him by the arm and led him more into the shade of the bridge a few paces back from the turnstile My good fellow said he I make it a point of conscience to allow you this much run Wait here till I take my place by the stile so that I may see whether you go over it handsomely and transcendentally and don t omit any flourishes of the pigeon wing A mere form you know I will say one two three and away Mind you start at the word away Here he took his position by the stile paused a moment as if in profound reflection then looked up and I thought smiled very slightly then tightened the strings of his apron then took a long look at Dammit and finally gave the word as agreed upon One two three and away Punctually at the word away my poor friend set off in a strong gallop The stile was not very high like mister Lord s nor yet very low like that of mister Lord s reviewers but upon the whole I made sure that he would clear it And then what if he did not ah that was the question what if he did not What right said I had the old gentleman to make any other gentleman jump The little old dot and carry one who is he If he asks me to jump I won t do it that s flat and I don t care who the devil he is The bridge as I say was arched and covered in in a very ridiculous manner and there was a most uncomfortable echo about it at all times an echo which I never before so particularly observed as when I uttered the four last words of my remark But what I said or what I thought or what I heard occupied only an instant In less than five seconds from his starting my poor Toby had taken the leap I saw him run nimbly and spring grandly from the floor of the bridge cutting the most awful flourishes with his legs as he went up I saw him high in the air pigeon winging it to admiration just over the top of the stile and of course I thought it an unusually singular thing that he did not continue to go over But the whole leap was the affair of a moment and before I had a chance to make any profound reflections down came mister Dammit on the flat of his back on the same side of the stile from which he had started At the same instant I saw the old gentleman limping off at the top of his speed having caught and wrapt up in his apron something that fell heavily into it from the darkness of the arch just over the turnstile At all this I was much astonished but I had no leisure to think for Dammit lay particularly still and I concluded that his feelings had been hurt and that he stood in need of my assistance I hurried up to him and found that he had received what might be termed a serious injury The truth is he had been deprived of his head which after a close search I could not find anywhere so I determined to take him home and send for the homoeopathists In the meantime a thought struck me and I threw open an adjacent window of the bridge when the sad truth flashed upon me at once About five feet just above the top of the turnstile and crossing the arch of the foot path so as to constitute a brace there extended a flat iron bar lying with its breadth horizontally and forming one of a series that served to strengthen the structure throughout its extent With the edge of this brace it appeared evident that the neck of my unfortunate friend had come precisely in contact He did not long survive his terrible loss The homoeopathists did not give him little enough physic and what little they did give him he hesitated to take So in the end he grew worse and at length died a lesson to all riotous livers I bedewed his grave with my tears worked a bar sinister on his family escutcheon and for the general expenses of his funeral sent in my very moderate bill to the transcendentalists The scoundrels refused to pay it so I had mister Dammit dug up at once and sold him for dog s meat THOU ART THE MAN I will now play the Oedipus to the Rattleborough enigma I will expound to you as I alone can the secret of the enginery that effected the Rattleborough miracle the one the true the admitted the undisputed the indisputable miracle which put a definite end to infidelity among the Rattleburghers and converted to the orthodoxy of the grandames all the carnal minded who had ventured to be sceptical before This event which I should be sorry to discuss in a tone of unsuitable levity occurred in the summer of eighteen mister Barnabas Shuttleworthy one of the wealthiest and most respectable citizens of the borough had been missing for several days under circumstances which gave rise to suspicion of foul play mister Shuttleworthy had set out from Rattleborough very early one Saturday morning on horseback with the avowed intention of proceeding to the city of about fifteen miles distant and of returning the night of the same day Two hours after his departure however his horse returned without him and without the saddle bags which had been strapped on his back at starting The animal was wounded too and covered with mud These circumstances naturally gave rise to much alarm among the friends of the missing man and when it was found on Sunday morning that he had not yet made his appearance the whole borough arose en masse to go and look for his body The foremost and most energetic in instituting this search was the bosom friend of mister Shuttleworthy a mister Charles Goodfellow or as he was universally called Charley Goodfellow or Old Charley Goodfellow Now whether it is a marvellous coincidence or whether it is that the name itself has an imperceptible effect upon the character I have never yet been able to ascertain but the fact is unquestionable that there never yet was any person named Charles who was not an open manly honest good natured and frank hearted fellow with a rich clear voice that did you good to hear it and an eye that looked you always straight in the face as much as to say I have a clear conscience myself am afraid of no man and am altogether above doing a mean action And thus all the hearty careless walking gentlemen of the stage are very certain to be called Charles Now Old Charley Goodfellow although he had been in Rattleborough not longer than six months or thereabouts and although nobody knew any thing about him before he came to settle in the neighborhood had experienced no difficulty in the world in making the acquaintance of all the respectable people in the borough Not a man of them but would have taken his bare word for a thousand at any moment and as for the women there is no saying what they would not have done to oblige him And all this came of his having been christened Charles and of his possessing in consequence that ingenuous face which is proverbially the very best letter of recommendation I have already said that mister Shuttleworthy was one of the most respectable and undoubtedly he was the most wealthy man in Rattleborough while Old Charley Goodfellow was upon as intimate terms with him as if he had been his own brother The two old gentlemen were next door neighbours and although mister Shuttleworthy seldom if ever visited Old Charley and never was known to take a meal in his house still this did not prevent the two friends from being exceedingly intimate as I have just observed for Old Charley never let a day pass without stepping in three or four times to see how his neighbour came on and very often he would stay to breakfast or tea and almost always to dinner and then the amount of wine that was made way with by the two cronies at a sitting it would really be a difficult thing to ascertain Old Charleys favorite beverage was Chateau Margaux and it appeared to do mister Shuttleworthy s heart good to see the old fellow swallow it as he did quart after quart so that one day when the wine was in and the wit as a natural consequence somewhat out he said to his crony as he slapped him upon the back I tell you what it is Old Charley you are by all odds the heartiest old fellow I ever came across in all my born days and since you love to guzzle the wine at that fashion I ll be darned if I don t have to make thee a present of a big box of the Chateau Margaux Od rot me mister Shuttleworthy had a sad habit of swearing although he seldom went beyond Od rot me or By gosh or By the jolly golly Od rot me says he if I don t send an order to town this very afternoon for a double box of the best that can be got and I ll make ye a present of it I will ye needn t say a word now I will I tell ye and there s an end of it so look out for it it will come to hand some of these fine days precisely when ye are looking for it the least I mention this little bit of liberality on the part of mister Shuttleworthy just by way of showing you how very intimate an understanding existed between the two friends Well on the Sunday morning in question when it came to be fairly understood that mister Shuttleworthy had met with foul play I never saw any one so profoundly affected as Old Charley Goodfellow When he first heard that the horse had come home without his master and without his master s saddle bags and all bloody from a pistol shot that had gone clean through and through the poor animal s chest without quite killing him when he heard all this he turned as pale as if the missing man had been his own dear brother or father and shivered and shook all over as if he had had a fit of the ague At first he was too much overpowered with grief to be able to do any thing at all or to concert upon any plan of action so that for a long time he endeavored to dissuade mister Shuttleworthy s other friends from making a stir about the matter thinking it best to wait awhile say for a week or two or a month or two to see if something wouldn t turn up or if mister Shuttleworthy wouldn t come in the natural way and explain his reasons for sending his horse on before I dare say you have often observed this disposition to temporize or to procrastinate in people who are labouring under any very poignant sorrow Their powers of mind seem to be rendered torpid so that they have a horror of any thing like action and like nothing in the world so well as to lie quietly in bed and nurse their grief as the old ladies express it that is to say ruminate over the trouble The people of Rattleborough had indeed so high an opinion of the wisdom and discretion of Old Charley that the greater part of them felt disposed to agree with him and not make a stir in the business until something should turn up as the honest old gentleman worded it and I believe that after all this would have been the general determination but for the very suspicious interference of mister Shuttleworthy s nephew a young man of very dissipated habits and otherwise of rather bad character This nephew whose name was Pennifeather would listen to nothing like reason in the matter of lying quiet but insisted upon making immediate search for the corpse of the murdered man This was the expression he employed and mister Goodfellow acutely remarked at the time that it was a singular expression to say no more This remark of Old Charley s too had great effect upon the crowd and one of the party was heard to ask very impressively how it happened that young mister Pennifeather was so intimately cognizant of all the circumstances connected with his wealthy uncle s disappearance as to feel authorized to assert distinctly and unequivocally that his uncle was a murdered man Hereupon some little squibbing and bickering occurred among various members of the crowd and especially between Old Charley and mister Pennifeather although this latter occurrence was indeed by no means a novelty for no good will had subsisted between the parties for the last three or four months and matters had even gone so far that mister Pennifeather had actually knocked down his uncles friend for some alleged excess of liberty that the latter had taken in the uncle s house of which the nephew was an inmate Upon this occasion Old Charley is said to have behaved with exemplary moderation and Christian charity He arose from the blow adjusted his clothes and made no attempt at retaliation at all merely muttering a few words about taking summary vengeance at the first convenient opportunity a natural and very justifiable ebullition of anger which meant nothing however and beyond doubt was no sooner given vent to than forgotten However these matters may be which have no reference to the point now at issue it is quite certain that the people of Rattleborough principally through the persuasion of mister Pennifeather came at length to the determination of dispersion over the adjacent country in search of the missing mister Shuttleworthy I say they came to this determination in the first instance After it had been fully resolved that a search should be made it was considered almost a matter of course that the seekers should disperse that is to say distribute themselves in parties for the more thorough examination of the region round about I forget however by what ingenious train of reasoning it was that Old Charley finally convinced the assembly that this was the most injudicious plan that could be pursued Convince them however he did all except mister Pennifeather and in the end it was arranged that a search should be instituted carefully and very thoroughly by the burghers en masse Old Charley himself leading the way As for the matter of that there could have been no better pioneer than Old Charley whom everybody knew to have the eye of a lynx but although he led them into all manner of out of the way holes and corners by routes that nobody had ever suspected of existing in the neighbourhood and although the search was incessantly kept up day and night for nearly a week still no trace of mister Shuttleworthy could be discovered When I say no trace however I must not be understood to speak literally for trace to some extent there certainly was The poor gentleman had been tracked by his horses shoes which were peculiar to a spot about three miles to the east of the borough on the main road leading to the city Here the track made off into a by path through a piece of woodland the path coming out again into the main road and cutting off about half a mile of the regular distance Following the shoe marks down this lane the party came at length to a pool of stagnant water half hidden by the brambles to the right of the lane and opposite this pool all vestige of the track was lost sight of It appeared however that a struggle of some nature had here taken place and it seemed as if some large and heavy body much larger and heavier than a man had been drawn from the by path to the pool This latter was carefully dragged twice but nothing was found and the party was upon the point of going away in despair of coming to any result when Providence suggested to mister Goodfellow the expediency of draining the water off altogether This project was received with cheers and many high compliments to Old Charley upon his sagacity and consideration As many of the burghers had brought spades with them supposing that they might possibly be called upon to disinter a corpse the drain was easily and speedily effected and no sooner was the bottom visible than right in the middle of the mud that remained was discovered a black silk velvet waistcoat which nearly every one present immediately recognized as the property of mister Pennifeather This waistcoat was much torn and stained with blood and there were several persons among the party who had a distinct remembrance of its having been worn by its owner on the very morning of mister Shuttleworthy s departure for the city while there were others again ready to testify upon oath if required that mister P did not wear the garment in question at any period during the remainder of that memorable day nor could any one be found to say that he had seen it upon mister P s person at any period at all subsequent to mister Shuttleworthy s disappearance Matters now wore a very serious aspect for mister Pennifeather and it was observed as an indubitable confirmation of the suspicions which were excited against him that he grew exceedingly pale and when asked what he had to say for himself was utterly incapable of saying a word Hereupon the few friends his riotous mode of living had left him deserted him at once to a man and were even more clamorous than his ancient and avowed enemies for his instantaneous arrest But on the other hand the magnanimity of mister Goodfellow shone forth with only the more brilliant lustre through contrast He made a warm and intensely eloquent defence of mister Pennifeather in which he alluded more than once to his own sincere forgiveness of that wild young gentleman the heir of the worthy mister Shuttleworthy for the insult which he the young gentleman had no doubt in the heat of passion thought proper to put upon him mister Goodfellow He forgave him for it he said from the very bottom of his heart and for himself mister Goodfellow so far from pushing the suspicious circumstances to extremity which he was sorry to say really had arisen against mister Pennifeather he mister Goodfellow would make every exertion in his power would employ all the little eloquence in his possession to to to soften down as much as he could conscientiously do so the worst features of this really exceedingly perplexing piece of business mister Goodfellow went on for some half hour longer in this strain very much to the credit both of his head and of his heart but your warm hearted people are seldom apposite in their observations they run into all sorts of blunders contre temps and mal apropos isms in the hot headedness of their zeal to serve a friend thus often with the kindest intentions in the world doing infinitely more to prejudice his cause than to advance it So in the present instance it turned out with all the eloquence of Old Charley for although he laboured earnestly in behalf of the suspected yet it so happened somehow or other that every syllable he uttered of which the direct but unwitting tendency was not to exalt the speaker in the good opinion of his audience had the effect to deepen the suspicion already attached to the individual whose cause he pleaded and to arouse against him the fury of the mob One of the most unaccountable errors committed by the orator was his allusion to the suspected as the heir of the worthy old gentleman mister Shuttleworthy The people had really never thought of this before They had only remembered certain threats of disinheritance uttered a year or two previously by the uncle who had no living relative except the nephew and they had therefore always looked upon this disinheritance as a matter that was settled so single minded a race of beings were the Rattleburghers but the remark of Old Charley brought them at once to a consideration of this point and thus gave them to see the possibility of the threats having been nothing more than a threat And straightway hereupon arose the natural question of cui bono a question that tended even more than the waistcoat to fasten the terrible crime upon the young man And here lest I may be misunderstood permit me to digress for one moment merely to observe that the exceedingly brief and simple Latin phrase which I have employed is invariably mistranslated and misconceived Cui bono in all the crack novels and elsewhere in those of missus Gore for example the author of Cecil a lady who quotes all tongues from the Chaldaean to Chickasaw and is helped to her learning as needed upon a systematic plan by mister Beckford in all the crack novels I say from those of Bulwer and Dickens to those of Bulwer and Dickens to those of Turnapenny and Ainsworth the two little Latin words cui bono are rendered to what purpose or as if quo bono to what good Their true meaning nevertheless is for whose advantage Cui to whom bono is it for a benefit It is a purely legal phrase and applicable precisely in cases such as we have now under consideration where the probability of the doer of a deed hinges upon the probability of the benefit accruing to this individual or to that from the deed s accomplishment Now in the present instance the question cui bono very pointedly implicated mister Pennifeather His uncle had threatened him after making a will in his favour with disinheritance But the threat had not been actually kept the original will it appeared had not been altered Had it been altered the only supposable motive for murder on the part of the suspected would have been the ordinary one of revenge and even this would have been counteracted by the hope of reinstation into the good graces of the uncle But the will being unaltered while the threat to alter remained suspended over the nephew s head there appears at once the very strongest possible inducement for the atrocity and so concluded very sagaciously the worthy citizens of the borough of Rattle mister Pennifeather was accordingly arrested upon the spot and the crowd after some further search proceeded homeward having him in custody On the route however another circumstance occurred tending to confirm the suspicion entertained mister Goodfellow whose zeal led him to be always a little in advance of the party was seen suddenly to run forward a few paces stoop and then apparently to pick up some small object from the grass Having quickly examined it he was observed too to make a sort of half attempt at concealing it in his coat pocket but this action was noticed as I say and consequently prevented when the object picked up was found to be a Spanish knife which a dozen persons at once recognized as belonging to mister Pennifeather Moreover his initials were engraved upon the handle The blade of this knife was open and bloody No doubt now remained of the guilt of the nephew and immediately upon reaching Rattleborough he was taken before a magistrate for examination Here matters again took a most unfavourable turn The prisoner being questioned as to his whereabouts on the morning of mister Shuttleworthy s disappearance had absolutely the audacity to acknowledge that on that very morning he had been out with his rifle deer stalking in the immediate neighbourhood of the pool where the blood stained waistcoat had been discovered through the sagacity of mister Goodfellow This latter now came forward and with tears in his eyes asked permission to be examined He said that a stern sense of the duty he owed his Maker not less than his fellow men would permit him no longer to remain silent Hitherto the sincerest affection for the young man notwithstanding the latter s ill treatment of himself mister Goodfellow had induced him to make every hypothesis which imagination could suggest by way of endeavoring to account for what appeared suspicious in the circumstances that told so seriously against mister Pennifeather but these circumstances were now altogether too convincing too damning he would hesitate no longer he would tell all he knew although his heart mister Goodfellow s should absolutely burst asunder in the effort He then went on to state that on the afternoon of the day previous to mister Shuttleworthy s departure for the city that worthy old gentleman had mentioned to his nephew in his hearing mister Goodfellow s that his object in going to town on the morrow was to make a deposit of an unusually large sum of money in the Farmers and Mechanics Bank and that then and there the said mister Shuttleworthy had distinctly avowed to the said nephew his irrevocable determination of rescinding the will originally made and of cutting him off with a shilling He the witness now solemnly called upon the accused to state whether what he the witness had just stated was or was not the truth in every substantial particular Much to the astonishment of every one present mister Pennifeather frankly admitted that it was The magistrate now considered it his duty to send a couple of constables to search the chamber of the accused in the house of his uncle From this search they almost immediately returned with the well known steel bound russet leather pocket book which the old gentleman had been in the habit of carrying for years Its valuable contents however had been abstracted and the magistrate in vain endeavored to extort from the prisoner the use which had been made of them or the place of their concealment Indeed he obstinately denied all knowledge of the matter The constables also discovered between the bed and sacking of the unhappy man a shirt and neck handkerchief both marked with the initials of his name and both hideously besmeared with the blood of the victim At this juncture it was announced that the horse of the murdered man had just expired in the stable from the effects of the wound he had received and it was proposed by mister Goodfellow that a post mortem examination of the beast should be immediately made with the view if possible of discovering the ball This was accordingly done and as if to demonstrate beyond a question the guilt of the accused mister Goodfellow after considerable searching in the cavity of the chest was enabled to detect and to pull forth a bullet of very extraordinary size which upon trial was found to be exactly adapted to the bore of mister Pennifeather s rifle while it was far too large for that of any other person in the borough or its vicinity To render the matter even surer yet however this bullet was discovered to have a flaw or seam at right angles to the usual suture and upon examination this seam corresponded precisely with an accidental ridge or elevation in a pair of moulds acknowledged by the accused himself to be his own property Upon finding of this bullet the examining magistrate refused to listen to any farther testimony and immediately committed the prisoner for trial declining resolutely to take any bail in the case although against this severity mister Goodfellow very warmly remonstrated and offered to become surety in whatever amount might be required This generosity on the part of Old Charley was only in accordance with the whole tenour of his amiable and chivalrous conduct during the entire period of his sojourn in the borough of Rattle In the present instance the worthy man was so entirely carried away by the excessive warmth of his sympathy that he seemed to have quite forgotten when he offered to go bail for his young friend that he himself mister Goodfellow did not possess a single dollar s worth of property upon the face of the earth The result of the committal may be readily foreseen mister Pennifeather amid the loud execrations of all Rattleborough was brought to trial at the next criminal sessions when the chain of circumstantial evidence strengthened as it was by some additional damning facts which mister Goodfellow s sensitive conscientiousness forbade him to withhold from the court was considered so unbroken and so thoroughly conclusive that the jury without leaving their seats returned an immediate verdict of Guilty of murder in the first degree Soon afterward the unhappy wretch received sentence of death and was remanded to the county jail to await the inexorable vengeance of the law In the meantime the noble behavior of Old Charley Goodfellow had doubly endeared him to the honest citizens of the borough He became ten times a greater favorite than ever and as a natural result of the hospitality with which he was treated he relaxed as it were perforce the extremely parsimonious habits which his poverty had hitherto impelled him to observe and very frequently had little reunions at his own house when wit and jollity reigned supreme dampened a little of course by the occasional remembrance of the untoward and melancholy fate which impended over the nephew of the late lamented bosom friend of the generous host One fine day this magnanimous old gentleman was agreeably surprised at the receipt of the following letter Charles Goodfellow esquire Rattleborough From H F B company Chat Mar A No one six doz bottles one two Gross Charles Goodfellow Esquire Dear Sir In conformity with an order transmitted to our firm about two months since by our esteemed correspondent mister Barnabus Shuttleworthy we have the honor of forwarding this morning to your address a double box of Chateau Margaux of the antelope brand violet seal Box numbered and marked as per margin We remain sir Your most ob nt ser ts HOGGS FROGS BOGS company City of June twenty one eighteen P S The box will reach you by wagon on the day after your receipt of this letter Our respects to mister Shuttleworthy H F B company The fact is that mister Goodfellow had since the death of mister Shuttleworthy given over all expectation of ever receiving the promised Chateau Margaux and he therefore looked upon it now as a sort of especial dispensation of Providence in his behalf He was highly delighted of course and in the exuberance of his joy invited a large party of friends to a petit souper on the morrow for the purpose of broaching the good old mister Shuttleworthy s present Not that he said any thing about the good old mister Shuttleworthy when he issued the invitations The fact is he thought much and concluded to say nothing at all He did not mention to any one if I remember aright that he had received a present of Chateau Margaux He merely asked his friends to come and help him drink some of a remarkable fine quality and rich flavour that he had ordered up from the city a couple of months ago and of which he would be in the receipt upon the morrow I have often puzzled myself to imagine why it was that Old Charley came to the conclusion to say nothing about having received the wine from his old friend but I could never precisely understand his reason for the silence although he had some excellent and very magnanimous reason no doubt The morrow at length arrived and with it a very large and highly respectable company at mister Goodfellow s house Indeed half the borough was there I myself among the number but much to the vexation of the host the Chateau Margaux did not arrive until a late hour and when the sumptuous supper supplied by Old Charley had been done very ample justice by the guests It came at length however a monstrously big box of it there was too and as the whole party were in excessively good humor it was decided nem con that it should be lifted upon the table and its contents disembowelled forthwith No sooner said than done I lent a helping hand and in a trice we had the box upon the table in the midst of all the bottles and glasses not a few of which were demolished in the scuffle Old Charley who was pretty much intoxicated and excessively red in the face now took a seat with an air of mock dignity at the head of the board and thumped furiously upon it with a decanter calling upon the company to keep order during the ceremony of disinterring the treasure After some vociferation quiet was at length fully restored and as very often happens in similar cases a profound and remarkable silence ensued Being then requested to force open the lid I complied of course with an infinite deal of pleasure I inserted a chisel and giving it a few slight taps with a hammer the top of the box flew suddenly off and at the same instant there sprang up into a sitting position directly facing the host the bruised bloody and nearly putrid corpse of the murdered mister Shuttleworthy himself It gazed for a few seconds fixedly and sorrowfully with its decaying and lack lustre eyes full into the countenance of mister Goodfellow uttered slowly but clearly and impressively the words Thou art the man and then falling over the side of the chest as if thoroughly satisfied stretched out its limbs quiveringly upon the table The scene that ensued is altogether beyond description The rush for the doors and windows was terrific and many of the most robust men in the room fainted outright through sheer horror But after the first wild shrieking burst of affright all eyes were directed to mister Goodfellow If I live a thousand years I can never forget the more than mortal agony which was depicted in that ghastly face of his so lately rubicund with triumph and wine For several minutes he sat rigidly as a statue of marble his eyes seeming in the intense vacancy of their gaze to be turned inward and absorbed in the contemplation of his own miserable murderous soul At length their expression appeared to flash suddenly out into the external world when with a quick leap he sprang from his chair and falling heavily with his head and shoulders upon the table and in contact with the corpse poured out rapidly and vehemently a detailed confession of the hideous crime for which mister Pennifeather was then imprisoned and doomed to die What he recounted was in substance this He followed his victim to the vicinity of the pool there shot his horse with a pistol despatched its rider with the butt end possessed himself of the pocket book and supposing the horse dead dragged it with great labour to the brambles by the pond Upon his own beast he slung the corpse of mister Shuttleworthy and thus bore it to a secure place of concealment a long distance off through the woods The waistcoat the knife the pocket book and bullet had been placed by himself where found with the view of avenging himself upon mister Pennifeather He had also contrived the discovery of the stained handkerchief and shirt Towards the end of the blood churning recital the words of the guilty wretch faltered and grew hollow When the record was finally exhausted he arose staggered backward from the table and fell dead The means by which this happily timed confession was extorted although efficient were simple indeed mister Goodfellow s excess of frankness had disgusted me and excited my suspicions from the first I was present when mister Pennifeather had struck him and the fiendish expression which then arose upon his countenance although momentary assured me that his threat of vengeance would if possible be rigidly fulfilled I was thus prepared to view the manoeuvering of Old Charley in a very different light from that in which it was regarded by the good citizens of Rattleborough I saw at once that all the criminating discoveries arose either directly or indirectly from himself But the fact which clearly opened my eyes to the true state of the case was the affair of the bullet found by mister G in the carcass of the horse I had not forgotten although the Rattleburghers had that there was a hole where the ball had entered the horse and another where it went out 
8459_285137_000033_000007	train-clean-360	If it were found in the animal then after having made its exit I saw clearly that it must have been deposited by the person who found it 
8459_285137_000033_000008	train-clean-360	The bloody shirt and handkerchief confirmed the idea suggested by the bullet for the blood on examination proved to be capital claret and no more When I came to think of these things and also of the late increase of liberality and expenditure on the part of mister Goodfellow I entertained a suspicion which was none the less strong because I kept it altogether to myself 
8459_285137_000034_000000	train-clean-360	In the meantime I instituted a rigorous private search for the corpse of mister Shuttleworthy and for good reasons searched in quarters as divergent as possible from those to which mister Goodfellow conducted his party 
8459_285137_000034_000001	train-clean-360	The result was that after some days I came across an old dry well the mouth of which was nearly hidden by brambles and here at the bottom I discovered what I sought 
none	none	Now it so happened that I had overheard the colloquy between the two cronies when mister Goodfellow had contrived to cajole his host into the promise of a box of Chateaux Margaux 
8459_285137_000035_000001	train-clean-360	Upon this hint I acted 
8459_285137_000035_000002	train-clean-360	I procured a stiff piece of whalebone thrust it down the throat of the corpse and deposited the latter in an old wine box taking care so to double the body up as to double the whalebone with it 
none	none	In this manner I had to press forcibly upon the lid to keep it down while I secured it with nails and I anticipated of course that as soon as these latter were removed the top would fly off and the body up Having thus arranged the box I marked numbered and addressed it as already told and then writing a letter in the name of the wine merchants with whom mister Shuttleworthy dealt I gave instructions to my servant to wheel the box to mister Goodfellow s door in a barrow at a given signal from myself For the words which I intended the corpse to speak I confidently depended upon my ventriloquial abilities for their effect I counted upon the conscience of the murderous wretch I believe there is nothing more to be explained mister Pennifeather was released upon the spot inherited the fortune of his uncle profited by the lessons of experience turned over a new leaf and led happily ever afterward a new life WHY THE LITTLE FRENCHMAN WEARS HIS HAND IN A SLING IT S on my visiting cards sure enough and it s them that s all o pink satin paper that inny gintleman that plases may behould the intheristhin words

none	none	 Idee de Bon Bon as for all the trash of Idees of all the rest of the savants 
8671-285138-0056	train-other-500	Bon Bon had ransacked libraries which no other man had ransacked had more than any other would have entertained a notion of reading had understood more than any other would have conceived the possibility of understanding
8671-285138-0057	train-other-500	and although while he flourished
none	none	 there were not wanting some authors at Rouen to assert 
8671-285138-0058	train-other-500	that his dicta evinced neither the purity of the Academy nor the depth of the Lyceum although mark me his doctrines were by no means very generally comprehended still
8671-285138-0059	train-other-500	it did not follow that they were difficult of comprehension
none	none	 It was I think on account of their self evidency that many persons were led to consider them abstruse 
8671-285138-0060	train-other-500	It is to Bon Bon but let this go no farther it is to Bon Bon that Kant himself is mainly indebted for his metaphysics The former was indeed not a Platonist
8671-285138-0061	train-other-500	nor strictly speaking an Aristotelian nor did he
none	none	 like the modern Leibnitz waste those precious hours which might be employed in the invention 
8671-285138-0062	train-other-500	of a fricasee or
none	none	 facili gradu 
8671-285138-0063	train-other-500	the analysis of a sensation in frivolous attempts at reconciling the obstinate oils and waters of ethical discussion Not at all Bon Bon was Ionic
none	none	 Bon Bon was equally Italic He reasoned a priori 
8671-285138-0064	train-other-500	He reasoned also a posteriori
none	none	 His ideas were innate or otherwise 
8671-285138-0065	train-other-500	He believed in George of Trebizonde He believed in Bossarion
8671-285138-0066	train-other-500	Bessarion Bon Bon was emphatically a Bon Bonist I have spoken of the philosopher in his capacity of restaurateur I would not
none	none	 however have any friend of mine imagine that in fulfilling his hereditary duties in that line our hero wanted a proper estimation of their dignity 
8671-285138-0067	train-other-500	and importance Far from it It was impossible to say in which branch of his profession he took the greater pride In his opinion
8671-285138-0068	train-other-500	the powers of the intellect held intimate connection with the capabilities of the stomach I am not sure indeed that he greatly disagreed with the Chinese who held
none	none	 that the soul lies in the abdomen The Greeks at all events were right he thought who employed the same words for the mind and the diaphragm one 
8671-285138-0069	train-other-500	By this I do not mean to insinuate a charge of gluttony or indeed any other serious charge to the prejudice of the metaphysician If Pierre Bon Bon had his failings and what great man has not a thousand if Pierre
8671-285138-0070	train-other-500	Bon Bon I say had his failings they were failings of very little importance faults indeed which in other tempers have often been looked upon rather in the light of virtues
none	none	 As regards one of these foibles I should not even have mentioned it in this history but for the remarkable prominency the extreme alto relievo in which it jutted out from the plane of his general disposition He could never let slip an opportunity of making a bargain MD Not that he was avaricious no It was by no means necessary to the satisfaction of the philosopher 
8671-285138-0071	train-other-500	that the bargain should be to his own proper advantage Provided a trade could be effected a trade of any kind upon any terms or under any circumstances
8671-285138-0072	train-other-500	a triumphant smile was seen for many days thereafter to enlighten his countenance and a knowing wink of the eye to give evidence of his sagacity
none	none	 At any epoch it would not be very wonderful if a humor so peculiar as the one I have just mentioned 
8671-285138-0073	train-other-500	should elicit attention and remark
none	none	 At the epoch of our narrative 
8671-285138-0074	train-other-500	had this peculiarity not attracted observation
none	none	 there would have been room for wonder indeed 
8671-285138-0075	train-other-500	It was soon reported that upon all occasions of the kind the smile of Bon Bon was wont to differ widely from the downright grin with which he would laugh at his own jokes or welcome an acquaintance
8671-285138-0076	train-other-500	Hints were thrown out of an exciting nature stories were told of perilous bargains made in a hurry and repented of at leisure
none	none	 and instances were adduced of unaccountable capacities vague longings and unnatural inclinations implanted by the author of all evil 
8671-285138-0077	train-other-500	for wise purposes of his own The philosopher had other weaknesses but they are scarcely worthy our serious examination For example there are few men of extraordinary profundity
8671-285138-0078	train-other-500	who are found wanting in an inclination for the bottle Whether this inclination be an exciting cause or rather a valid proof of such profundity it is a nice thing to say
none	none	 Bon Bon as far as I can learn did not think the subject adapted to minute investigation 
8671-285138-0079	train-other-500	nor do I Yet in the indulgence of a propensity so truly classical it is not to be supposed that the restaurateur would lose sight of that intuitive discrimination
8671-285138-0080	train-other-500	which was wont to characterize at one and the same time his essais and his omelettes
none	none	 In his seclusions the Vin de Bourgogne had its allotted hour and 
8671-285138-0081	train-other-500	there were appropriate moments for the Cotes du Rhone
none	none	 With him Sauterne was to Medoc what Catullus was to Homer 
8671-285138-0082	train-other-500	He would sport with a syllogism in sipping saint Peray
none	none	 but unravel an argument over Clos de Vougeot and upset a theory in a torrent of Chambertin 
8671-285138-0083	train-other-500	Well had it been if the same quick sense of propriety had attended him in the peddling propensity to which I have formerly alluded but this was by no means the case
8671-285138-0084	train-other-500	Indeed to say the truth that trait of mind in the philosophic Bon Bon
none	none	 did begin at length to assume a character 
8671-285138-0085	train-other-500	of strange intensity and mysticism
none	none	 and appeared deeply tinctured with the diablerie of his favorite German studies To enter the little Cafe in the cul de sac Le Febvre was at the period of our tale 
8671-285138-0086	train-other-500	to enter the sanctum of a man of genius Bon Bon was a man of genius There was not a sous cusinier in Rouen who could not have told you that Bon Bon was a man
8671-285138-0087	train-other-500	of genius His very cat knew it and forebore to whisk her tail in the presence of the man of genius His large water dog was acquainted with the fact and upon the approach of his master
8671-285138-0088	train-other-500	betrayed his sense of inferiority by a sanctity of deportment
none	none	 a debasement of the ears and a dropping of the lower jaw 
8671-285138-0089	train-other-500	not altogether unworthy of a dog It is however true that much of this habitual respect might have been attributed to the personal appearance of the metaphysician A distinguished exterior will
8671-285138-0090	train-other-500	I am constrained to say have its way even with a beast and I am willing to allow much in the outward man of the restaurateur calculated to impress the imagination of the quadruped
none	none	 There is a peculiar majesty about the atmosphere of the little great 
8671-285138-0091	train-other-500	if I may be permitted so equivocal an expression which mere physical bulk alone will be found at all times inefficient in creating If however Bon Bon was barely three feet in height
8671-285138-0092	train-other-500	and if his head was diminutively small still it was impossible to behold the rotundity of his stomach without a sense of magnificence nearly bordering upon the sublime
8671-285138-0093	train-other-500	In its size both dogs and men must have seen a type of his acquirements in its immensity a fitting habitation for his immortal soul I might here if it so pleased me
8671-285138-0094	train-other-500	dilate upon the matter of habiliment and other mere circumstances of the external metaphysician I might hint that the hair of our hero was worn short combed smoothly over his forehead
8671-285138-0095	train-other-500	and surmounted by a conical shaped white flannel cap and tassels that his pea green jerkin was not after the fashion of those worn by the common class of restaurateurs at that day that the sleeves were something fuller
8671-285138-0096	train-other-500	than the reigning costume permitted that the cuffs were turned up not as usual in that barbarous period with cloth of the same quality and color as the garment but faced in a more fanciful manner with the particolored velvet of Genoa
none	none	 that his slippers were of a bright purple curiously filigreed 
8671-285138-0097	train-other-500	and might have been manufactured in Japan but for the exquisite pointing of the toes and the brilliant tints of the binding and embroidery
none	none	 that his breeches were of the yellow satin like material 
8671-285138-0098	train-other-500	called aimable that his sky blue cloak resembling in form a dressing wrapper and richly bestudded all over with crimson devices floated cavalierly upon his shoulders like a mist of the morning
8671-285138-0099	train-other-500	and that his tout ensemble gave rise to the remarkable words of Benevenuta the Improvisatrice of Florence
none	none	 that it was difficult to say whether Pierre Bon Bon was indeed a bird of Paradise 
8671-285138-0100	train-other-500	or rather a very Paradise of perfection I might I say expatiate upon all these points if I pleased but I forbear merely personal details may be left to historical novelists
none	none	 they are beneath the moral dignity of matter of fact 
8671-285138-0101	train-other-500	I have said
none	none	 that to enter the Cafe in the cul de sac Le Febvre was to enter the sanctum of a man of genius 
8671-285138-0102	train-other-500	but then it was only the man of genius who could duly estimate the merits of the sanctum A sign consisting of a vast folio swung before the entrance
8671-285138-0103	train-other-500	On one side of the volume was painted a bottle on the reverse a pate On the back were visible in large letters
none	none	 Oeuvres de Bon Bon 
8671-285138-0104	train-other-500	Thus was delicately shadowed forth the two fold occupation of the proprietor Upon stepping over the threshold the whole interior of the building presented itself to view
8671-285138-0105	train-other-500	A long low pitched room of antique construction was indeed all the accommodation afforded by the Cafe In a corner of the apartment stood the bed of the metaphysician
none	none	 An army of curtains together with a canopy a la Grecque gave it an air at once classic 
8671-285138-0106	train-other-500	and comfortable In the corner diagonary opposite appeared in direct family communion the properties of the kitchen and the bibliotheque A dish of polemics stood peacefully upon the dresser
8671-285138-0107	train-other-500	Here lay an ovenful of the latest ethics
none	none	 there a kettle of dudecimo melanges Volumes of German morality were hand and glove with the gridiron a toasting fork might be discovered by the side of Eusebius Plato reclined at his ease in the frying pan 
8671-285138-0108	train-other-500	and contemporary manuscripts were filed away upon the spit In other respects the Cafe de Bon Bon might be said to differ little from the usual restaurants of the period A fireplace yawned opposite the door
none	none	 On the right of the fireplace an open cupboard displayed a formidable array of labelled bottles 
8671-285138-0109	train-other-500	It was here about twelve o clock one night during the severe winter the comments of his neighbours upon his singular propensity that Pierre Bon Bon I say having turned them all out of his house locked the door
8671-285138-0110	train-other-500	upon them with an oath and betook himself in no very pacific mood to the comforts of a leather bottomed arm chair and a fire of blazing fagots
none	none	 It was one of those terrific nights which are only met with once or twice during a century It snowed fiercely and the house tottered to its centre with the floods of wind that rushing through the crannies in the wall and pouring impetuously down the chimney shook awfully the curtains of the philosopher s bed and disorganized the economy of his pate pans and papers The huge folio sign that swung without exposed to the fury of the tempest creaked ominously and gave out a moaning sound from its stanchions of solid oak It was in no placid temper I say that the metaphysician drew up his chair to its customary station by the hearth Many circumstances of a perplexing nature had occurred during the day to disturb the serenity of his meditations In attempting des oeufs a la Princesse he had unfortunately perpetrated an omelette a la Reine the discovery of a principle in ethics had been frustrated by the overturning of a stew and last not least he had been thwarted in one of those admirable bargains which he at all times took such especial delight in bringing to a successful termination But in the chafing of his mind at these unaccountable vicissitudes there did not fail to be mingled some degree of that nervous anxiety which the fury of a boisterous night is so well calculated to produce Whistling to his more immediate vicinity the large black water dog we have spoken of before and settling himself uneasily in his chair he could not help casting a wary and unquiet eye toward those distant recesses of the apartment whose inexorable shadows not even the red firelight itself could more than partially succeed in overcoming Having completed a scrutiny whose exact purpose was perhaps unintelligible to himself he drew close to his seat a small table covered with books and papers and soon became absorbed in the task of retouching a voluminous manuscript intended for publication on the morrow He had been thus occupied for some minutes when I am in no hurry Monsieur Bon Bon suddenly whispered a whining voice in the apartment The devil ejaculated our hero starting to his feet overturning the table at his side and staring around him in astonishment Very true calmly replied the voice Very true what is very true how came you here vociferated the metaphysician as his eye fell upon something which lay stretched at full length upon the bed I was saying said the intruder without attending to the interrogatives I was saying that I am not at all pushed for time that the business upon which I took the liberty of calling is of no pressing importance in short that I can very well wait until you have finished your Exposition My Exposition there now how do you know how came you to understand that I was writing an Exposition good God Hush replied the figure in a shrill undertone and arising quickly from the bed he made a single step toward our hero while an iron lamp that depended over head swung convulsively back from his approach The philosopher s amazement did not prevent a narrow scrutiny of the stranger s dress and appearance The outlines of his figure exceedingly lean but much above the common height were rendered minutely distinct by means of a faded suit of black cloth which fitted tight to the skin but was otherwise cut very much in the style of a century ago These garments had evidently been intended for a much shorter person than their present owner His ankles and wrists were left naked for several inches In his shoes however a pair of very brilliant buckles gave the lie to the extreme poverty implied by the other portions of his dress His head was bare and entirely bald with the exception of a hinder part from which depended a queue of considerable length A pair of green spectacles with side glasses protected his eyes from the influence of the light and at the same time prevented our hero from ascertaining either their color or their conformation About the entire person there was no evidence of a shirt but a white cravat of filthy appearance was tied with extreme precision around the throat and the ends hanging down formally side by side gave although I dare say unintentionally the idea of an ecclesiastic Indeed many other points both in his appearance and demeanor might have very well sustained a conception of that nature Over his left ear he carried after the fashion of a modern clerk an instrument resembling the stylus of the ancients In a breast pocket of his coat appeared conspicuously a small black volume fastened with clasps of steel This book whether accidentally or not was so turned outwardly from the person as to discover the words Rituel Catholique in white letters upon the back His entire physiognomy was interestingly saturnine even cadaverously pale The forehead was lofty and deeply furrowed with the ridges of contemplation The corners of the mouth were drawn down into an expression of the most submissive humility There was also a clasping of the hands as he stepped toward our hero a deep sigh and altogether a look of such utter sanctity as could not have failed to be unequivocally preposessing Every shadow of anger faded from the countenance of the metaphysician as having completed a satisfactory survey of his visiter s person he shook him cordially by the hand and conducted him to a seat There would however be a radical error in attributing this instantaneous transition of feeling in the philosopher to any one of those causes which might naturally be supposed to have had an influence Indeed Pierre Bon Bon from what I have been able to understand of his disposition was of all men the least likely to be imposed upon by any speciousness of exterior deportment It was impossible that so accurate an observer of men and things should have failed to discover upon the moment the real character of the personage who had thus intruded upon his hospitality To say no more the conformation of his visiter s feet was sufficiently remarkable he maintained lightly upon his head an inordinately tall hat there was a tremulous swelling about the hinder part of his breeches and the vibration of his coat tail was a palpable fact Judge then with what feelings of satisfaction our hero found himself thrown thus at once into the society of a person for whom he had at all times entertained the most unqualified respect He was however too much of the diplomatist to let escape him any intimation of his suspicions in regard to the true state of affairs It was not his cue to appear at all conscious of the high honor he thus unexpectedly enjoyed but by leading his guest into the conversation to elicit some important ethical ideas which might in obtaining a place in his contemplated publication enlighten the human race and at the same time immortalize himself ideas which I should have added his visitor s great age and well known proficiency in the science of morals might very well have enabled him to afford Actuated by these enlightened views our hero bade the gentleman sit down while he himself took occasion to throw some fagots upon the fire and place upon the now re established table some bottles of Mousseux Having quickly completed these operations he drew his chair vis a vis to his companion s and waited until the latter should open the conversation But plans even the most skilfully matured are often thwarted in the outset of their application and the restaurateur found himself nonplussed by the very first words of his visiter s speech I see you know me Bon Bon said he ha ha ha he he he hi hi hi ho ho ho hu hu hu and the devil dropping at once the sanctity of his demeanor opened to its fullest extent a mouth from ear to ear so as to display a set of jagged and fang like teeth and throwing back his head laughed long loudly wickedly and uproariously while the black dog crouching down upon his haunches joined lustily in the chorus and the tabby cat flying off at a tangent stood up on end and shrieked in the farthest corner of the apartment Not so the philosopher he was too much a man of the world either to laugh like the dog or by shrieks to betray the indecorous trepidation of the cat It must be confessed he felt a little astonishment to see the white letters which formed the words Rituel Catholique on the book in his guest s pocket momently changing both their color and their import and in a few seconds in place of the original title the words Regitre des Condamnes blazed forth in characters of red This startling circumstance when Bon Bon replied to his visiter s remark imparted to his manner an air of embarrassment which probably might not otherwise have been observed Why sir said the philosopher why sir to speak sincerely I I imagine I have some faint some very faint idea of the remarkable honor Oh ah yes very well interrupted his Majesty say no more I see how it is And hereupon taking off his green spectacles he wiped the glasses carefully with the sleeve of his coat and deposited them in his pocket If Bon Bon had been astonished at the incident of the book his amazement was now much increased by the spectacle which here presented itself to view In raising his eyes with a strong feeling of curiosity to ascertain the color of his guest s he found them by no means black as he had anticipated nor gray as might have been imagined nor yet hazel nor blue nor indeed yellow nor red nor purple nor white nor green nor any other color in the heavens above or in the earth beneath or in the waters under the earth In short Pierre Bon Bon not only saw plainly that his Majesty had no eyes whatsoever but could discover no indications of their having existed at any previous period for the space where eyes should naturally have been was I am constrained to say simply a dead level of flesh It was not in the nature of the metaphysician to forbear making some inquiry into the sources of so strange a phenomenon and the reply of his Majesty was at once prompt dignified and satisfactory Eyes my dear Bon Bon eyes did you say oh ah I perceive The ridiculous prints eh which are in circulation have given you a false idea of my personal appearance Eyes true Eyes Pierre Bon Bon are very well in their proper place that you would say is the head right the head of a worm To you likewise these optics are indispensable yet I will convince you that my vision is more penetrating than your own There is a cat I see in the corner a pretty cat look at her observe her well Now Bon Bon do you behold the thoughts the thoughts I say the ideas the reflections which are being engendered in her pericranium There it is now you do not She is thinking we admire the length of her tail and the profundity of her mind She has just concluded that I am the most distinguished of ecclesiastics and that you are the most superficial of metaphysicians Thus you see I am not altogether blind but to one of my profession the eyes you speak of would be merely an incumbrance liable at any time to be put out by a toasting iron or a pitchfork To you I allow these optical affairs are indispensable Endeavor Bon Bon to use them well my vision is the soul Hereupon the guest helped himself to the wine upon the table and pouring out a bumper for Bon Bon requested him to drink it without scruple and make himself perfectly at home A clever book that of yours Pierre resumed his Majesty tapping our friend knowingly upon the shoulder as the latter put down his glass after a thorough compliance with his visiter s injunction A clever book that of yours upon my honor It s a work after my own heart Your arrangement of the matter I think however might be improved and many of your notions remind me of Aristotle That philosopher was one of my most intimate acquaintances I liked him as much for his terrible ill temper as for his happy knack at making a blunder There is only one solid truth in all that he has written and for that I gave him the hint out of pure compassion for his absurdity I suppose Pierre Bon Bon you very well know to what divine moral truth I am alluding Cannot say that I Indeed why it was I who told Aristotle that by sneezing men expelled superfluous ideas through the proboscis Which is hiccup undoubtedly the case said the metaphysician while he poured out for himself another bumper of Mousseux and offered his snuff box to the fingers of his visiter There was Plato too continued his Majesty modestly declining the snuff box and the compliment it implied there was Plato too for whom I at one time felt all the affection of a friend You knew Plato Bon Bon ah no I beg a thousand pardons He met me at Athens one day in the Parthenon and told me he was distressed for an idea I bade him write down that o nous estin aulos He said that he would do so and went home while I stepped over to the pyramids But my conscience smote me for having uttered a truth even to aid a friend and hastening back to Athens I arrived behind the philosopher s chair as he was inditing the aulos Giving the lambda a fillip with my finger I turned it upside down So the sentence now read o nous estin augos and is you perceive the fundamental doctrines in his metaphysics Were you ever at Rome asked the restaurateur as he finished his second bottle of Mousseux and drew from the closet a larger supply of Chambertin But once Monsieur Bon Bon but once There was a time said the devil as if reciting some passage from a book there was a time when occurred an anarchy of five years during which the republic bereft of all its officers had no magistracy besides the tribunes of the people and these were not legally vested with any degree of executive power at that time Monsieur Bon Bon at that time only I was in Rome and I have no earthly acquaintance consequently with any of its philosophy two Ils ecrivaient sur la Philosophie Cicero Lucretius Seneca mais c etait la Philosophie Grecque Condorcet What do you think of what do you think of hiccup Epicurus What do I think of whom said the devil in astonishment you cannot surely mean to find any fault with Epicurus What do I think of Epicurus Do you mean me sir I am Epicurus I am the same philosopher who wrote each of the three hundred treatises commemorated by Diogenes Laertes That s a lie said the metaphysician for the wine had gotten a little into his head Very well very well sir very well indeed sir said his Majesty apparently much flattered That s a lie repeated the restaurateur dogmatically that s a hiccup a lie Well well have it your own way said the devil pacifically and Bon Bon having beaten his Majesty at argument thought it his duty to conclude a second bottle of Chambertin As I was saying resumed the visiter as I was observing a little while ago there are some very outre notions in that book of yours Monsieur Bon Bon What for instance do you mean by all that humbug about the soul Pray sir what is the soul The hiccup soul replied the metaphysician referring to his MS is undoubtedly No sir Indubitably No sir Indisputably No sir Evidently No sir Incontrovertibly No sir Hiccup No sir And beyond all question a No sir the soul is no such thing Here the philosopher looking daggers took occasion to make an end upon the spot of his third bottle of Chambertin Then hic cup pray sir what what is it That is neither here nor there Monsieur Bon Bon replied his Majesty musingly I have tasted that is to say I have known some very bad souls and some too pretty good ones Here he smacked his lips and having unconsciously let fall his hand upon the volume in his pocket was seized with a violent fit of sneezing He continued There was the soul of Cratinus passable Aristophanes racy Plato exquisite not your Plato but Plato the comic poet your Plato would have turned the stomach of Cerberus faugh Then let me see there were Naevius and Andronicus and Plautus and Terentius Then there were Lucilius and Catullus and Naso and Quintus Flaccus dear Quinty as I called him when he sung a seculare for my amusement while I toasted him in pure good humor on a fork But they want flavor these Romans One fat Greek is worth a dozen of them and besides will keep which cannot be said of a Quirite Let us taste your Sauterne Bon Bon had by this time made up his mind to nil admirari and endeavored to hand down the bottles in question He was however conscious of a strange sound in the room like the wagging of a tail Of this although extremely indecent in his Majesty the philosopher took no notice simply kicking the dog and requesting him to be quiet The visiter continued I found that Horace tasted very much like Aristotle you know I am fond of variety Terentius I could not have told from Menander Naso to my astonishment was Nicander in disguise Virgilius had a strong twang of Theocritus Martial put me much in mind of Archilochus and Titus Livius was positively Polybius and none other Hic cup here replied Bon Bon and his majesty proceeded But if I have a penchant Monsieur Bon Bon if I have a penchant it is for a philosopher Yet let me tell you sir it is not every dev I mean it is not every gentleman who knows how to choose a philosopher Long ones are not good and the best if not carefully shelled are apt to be a little rancid on account of the gall Shelled I mean taken out of the carcass What do you think of a hic cup physician Don t mention them ugh ugh ugh Here his Majesty retched violently I never tasted but one that rascal Hippocrates smelt of asafoetida ugh ugh ugh caught a wretched cold washing him in the Styx and after all he gave me the cholera morbus The hiccup wretch ejaculated Bon Bon the hic cup absorption of a pill box and the philosopher dropped a tear After all continued the visiter after all if a dev if a gentleman wishes to live he must have more talents than one or two and with us a fat face is an evidence of diplomacy How so Why we are sometimes exceedingly pushed for provisions You must know that in a climate so sultry as mine it is frequently impossible to keep a spirit alive for more than two or three hours and after death unless pickled immediately and a pickled spirit is not good they will smell you understand eh Putrefaction is always to be apprehended when the souls are consigned to us in the usual way Hiccup hiccup good God how do you manage Here the iron lamp commenced swinging with redoubled violence and the devil half started from his seat however with a slight sigh he recovered his composure merely saying to our hero in a low tone I tell you what Pierre Bon Bon we must have no more swearing The host swallowed another bumper by way of denoting thorough comprehension and acquiescence and the visiter continued Why there are several ways of managing The most of us starve some put up with the pickle for my part I purchase my spirits vivente corpore in which case I find they keep very well But the body hiccup the body The body the body well what of the body oh ah I perceive Why sir the body is not at all affected by the transaction I have made innumerable purchases of the kind in my day and the parties never experienced any inconvenience There were Cain and Nimrod and Nero and Caligula and Dionysius and Pisistratus and and a thousand others who never knew what it was to have a soul during the latter part of their lives yet sir these men adorned society Why possession of his faculties mental and corporeal Who writes a keener epigram Who reasons more wittily Who but stay I have his agreement in my pocket book Thus saying he produced a red leather wallet and took from it a number of papers Upon some of these Bon Bon caught a glimpse of the letters Machi Maza Robesp with the words Caligula George Elizabeth His Majesty selected a narrow slip of parchment and from it read aloud the following words In consideration of certain mental endowments which it is unnecessary to specify and in further consideration of one thousand louis d or I being aged one year and one month do hereby make over to the bearer of this agreement all my right title and appurtenance in the shadow called my soul Signed A Here His Majesty repeated a name which I did not feel justified in indicating more unequivocally Quere Arouet A clever fellow that resumed he but like you Monsieur Bon Bon he was mistaken about the soul The soul a shadow truly The soul a shadow Ha ha ha he he he hu hu hu Only think of a fricasseed shadow Only think hiccup of a fricasseed shadow exclaimed our hero whose faculties were becoming much illuminated by the profundity of his Majesty s discourse Only think of a hiccup fricasseed shadow Now damme hiccup humph If I would have been such a hiccup nincompoop My soul mister humph Your soul Monsieur Bon Bon Yes sir hiccup my soul is What sir No shadow damme Did you mean to say Yes sir my soul is hiccup humph yes sir Did you not intend to assert My soul is hiccup peculiarly qualified for hiccup a What sir Stew Ha Soufflee Eh Fricassee Indeed Ragout and fricandeau and see here my good fellow I ll let you have it hiccup a bargain Here the philosopher slapped his Majesty upon the back Couldn t think of such a thing said the latter calmly at the same time rising from his seat The metaphysician stared Am supplied at present said his Majesty Hiccup e h said the philosopher Have no funds on hand What Besides very unhandsome in me Sir To take advantage of Hiccup Your present disgusting and ungentlemanly situation Here the visiter bowed and withdrew in what manner could not precisely be ascertained but in a well concerted effort to discharge a bottle at the villain the slender chain was severed that depended from the ceiling and the metaphysician prostrated by the downfall of the lamp SOME WORDS WITH A MUMMY THE symposium of the preceding evening had been a little too much for my nerves I had a wretched headache and was desperately drowsy Instead of going out therefore to spend the evening as I had proposed it occurred to me that I could not do a wiser thing than just eat a mouthful of supper and go immediately to bed A light supper of course I am exceedingly fond of Welsh rabbit More than a pound at once however may not at all times be advisable Still there can be no material objection to two And really between two and three there is merely a single unit of difference I ventured perhaps upon four My wife will have it five but clearly she has confounded two very distinct affairs The abstract number five I am willing to admit but concretely it has reference to bottles of Brown Stout without which in the way of condiment Welsh rabbit is to be eschewed Having thus concluded a frugal meal and donned my night cap with the serene hope of enjoying it till noon the next day I placed my head upon the pillow and through the aid of a capital conscience fell into a profound slumber forthwith But when were the hopes of humanity fulfilled I could not have completed my third snore when there came a furious ringing at the street door bell and then an impatient thumping at the knocker which awakened me at once In a minute afterward and while I was still rubbing my eyes my wife thrust in my face a note from my old friend Doctor Ponnonner It ran thus Come to me by all means my dear good friend as soon as you receive this Come and help us to rejoice At last by long persevering diplomacy I have gained the assent of the Directors of the City Museum to my examination of the Mummy you know the one I mean I have permission to unswathe it and open it if desirable A few friends only will be present you of course The Mummy is now at my house and we shall begin to unroll it at eleven to night Yours ever PONNONNER By the time I had reached the Ponnonner it struck me that I was as wide awake as a man need be I leaped out of bed in an ecstacy overthrowing all in my way dressed myself with a rapidity truly marvellous and set off at the top of my speed for the doctor s There I found a very eager company assembled They had been awaiting me with much impatience the Mummy was extended upon the dining table and the moment I entered its examination was commenced It was one of a pair brought several years previously by Captain Arthur Sabretash a cousin of Ponnonner s from a tomb near Eleithias in the Lybian mountains a considerable distance above Thebes on the Nile The grottoes at this point although less magnificent than the Theban sepulchres are of higher interest on account of affording more numerous illustrations of the private life of the Egyptians The chamber from which our specimen was taken was said to be very rich in such illustrations the walls being completely covered with fresco paintings and bas reliefs while statues vases and Mosaic work of rich patterns indicated the vast wealth of the deceased The treasure had been deposited in the Museum precisely in the same condition in which Captain Sabretash had found it that is to say the coffin had not been disturbed For eight years it had thus stood subject only externally to public inspection We had now therefore the complete Mummy at our disposal and to those who are aware how very rarely the unransacked antique reaches our shores it will be evident at once that we had great reason to congratulate ourselves upon our good fortune Approaching the table I saw on it a large box or case nearly seven feet long and perhaps three feet wide by two feet and a half deep It was oblong not coffin shaped The material was at first supposed to be the wood of the sycamore platanus but upon cutting into it we found it to be pasteboard or more properly papier mache composed of papyrus It was thickly ornamented with paintings representing funeral scenes and other mournful subjects interspersed among which in every variety of position were certain series of hieroglyphical characters intended no doubt for the name of the departed By good luck mister Gliddon formed one of our party and he had no difficulty in translating the letters which were simply phonetic and represented the word Allamistakeo We had some difficulty in getting this case open without injury but having at length accomplished the task we came to a second coffin shaped and very considerably less in size than the exterior one but resembling it precisely in every other respect The interval between the two was filled with resin which had in some degree defaced the colors of the interior box Upon opening this latter which we did quite easily we arrived at a third case also coffin shaped and varying from the second one in no particular except in that of its material which was cedar and still emitted the peculiar and highly aromatic odor of that wood Between the second and the third case there was no interval the one fitting accurately within the other Removing the third case we discovered and took out the body itself We had expected to find it as usual enveloped in frequent rolls or bandages of linen but in place of these we found a sort of sheath made of papyrus and coated with a layer of plaster thickly gilt and painted The paintings represented subjects connected with the various supposed duties of the soul and its presentation to different divinities with numerous identical human figures intended very probably as portraits of the persons embalmed Extending from head to foot was a columnar or perpendicular inscription in phonetic hieroglyphics giving again his name and titles and the names and titles of his relations Around the neck thus ensheathed was a collar of cylindrical glass beads diverse in color and so arranged as to form images of deities of the scarabaeus et cetera with the winged globe Around the small of the waist was a similar collar or belt Stripping off the papyrus we found the flesh in excellent preservation with no perceptible odor The color was reddish The skin was hard smooth and glossy The teeth and hair were in good condition The eyes it seemed had been removed and glass ones substituted which were very beautiful and wonderfully life like with the exception of somewhat too determined a stare The fingers and the nails were brilliantly gilded mister Gliddon was of opinion from the redness of the epidermis that the embalmment had been effected altogether by asphaltum but on scraping the surface with a steel instrument and throwing into the fire some of the powder thus obtained the flavor of camphor and other sweet scented gums became apparent We searched the corpse very carefully for the usual openings through which the entrails are extracted but to our surprise we could discover none No member of the party was at that period aware that entire or unopened mummies are not infrequently met The brain it was customary to withdraw through the nose the intestines through an incision in the side the body was then shaved washed and salted then laid aside for several weeks when the operation of embalming properly so called began As no trace of an opening could be found Doctor Ponnonner was preparing his instruments for dissection when I observed that it was then past two o clock Hereupon it was agreed to postpone the internal examination until the next evening and we were about to separate for the present when some one suggested an experiment or two with the Voltaic pile The application of electricity to a mummy three or four thousand years old at the least was an idea if not very sage still sufficiently original and we all caught it at once About one tenth in earnest and nine tenths in jest we arranged a battery in the Doctor s study and conveyed thither the Egyptian It was only after much trouble that we succeeded in laying bare some portions of the temporal muscle which appeared of less stony rigidity than other parts of the frame but which as we had anticipated of course gave no indication of galvanic susceptibility when brought in contact with the wire This the first trial indeed seemed decisive and with a hearty laugh at our own absurdity we were bidding each other good night when my eyes happening to fall upon those of the Mummy were there immediately riveted in amazement My brief glance in fact had sufficed to assure me that the orbs which we had all supposed to be glass and which were originally noticeable for a certain wild stare were now so far covered by the lids that only a small portion of the tunica albuginea remained visible With a shout I called attention to the fact and it became immediately obvious to all I cannot say that I was alarmed at the phenomenon because alarmed is in my case not exactly the word It is possible however that but for the Brown Stout I might have been a little nervous As for the rest of the company they really made no attempt at concealing the downright fright which possessed them Doctor Ponnonner was a man to be pitied mister Gliddon by some peculiar process rendered himself invisible mister Silk Buckingham I fancy will scarcely be so bold as to deny that he made his way upon all fours under the table After the first shock of astonishment however we resolved as a matter of course upon further experiment forthwith Our operations were now directed against the great toe of the right foot We made an incision over the outside of the exterior os sesamoideum pollicis pedis and thus got at the root of the abductor muscle Readjusting the battery we now applied the fluid to the bisected nerves when with a movement of exceeding life likeness the Mummy first drew up its right knee so as to bring it nearly in contact with the abdomen and then straightening the limb with inconceivable force bestowed a kick upon Doctor Ponnonner which had the effect of discharging that gentleman like an arrow from a catapult through a window into the street below We rushed out en masse to bring in the mangled remains of the victim but had the happiness to meet him upon the staircase coming up in an unaccountable hurry brimful of the most ardent philosophy and more than ever impressed with the necessity of prosecuting our experiment with vigor and with zeal It was by his advice accordingly that we made upon the spot a profound incision into the tip of the subject s nose while the Doctor himself laying violent hands upon it pulled it into vehement contact with the wire Morally and physically figuratively and literally was the effect electric In the first place the corpse opened its eyes and winked very rapidly for several minutes as does mister Barnes in the pantomime in the second place it sneezed in the third it sat upon end in the fourth it shook its fist in Doctor Ponnonner s face in the fifth turning to Messieurs Gliddon and Buckingham it addressed them in very capital Egyptian thus I must say gentlemen that I am as much surprised as I am mortified at your behavior Of Doctor Ponnonner nothing better was to be expected He is a poor little fat fool who knows no better I pity and forgive him But you mister Gliddon and you Silk who have travelled and resided in Egypt until one might imagine you to the manner born you I say who have been so much among us that you speak Egyptian fully as well I think as you write your mother tongue you whom I have always been led to regard as the firm friend of the mummies I really did anticipate more gentlemanly conduct from you What am I to think of your standing quietly by and seeing me thus unhandsomely used What am I to suppose by your permitting Tom Dick and Harry to strip me of my coffins and my clothes in this wretchedly cold climate In what light to come to the point am I to regard your aiding and abetting that miserable little villain Doctor Ponnonner in pulling me by the nose It will be taken for granted no doubt that upon hearing this speech under the circumstances we all either made for the door or fell into violent hysterics or went off in a general swoon One of these three things was I say to be expected Indeed each and all of these lines of conduct might have been very plausibly pursued And upon my word I am at a loss to know how or why it was that we pursued neither the one nor the other But perhaps the true reason is to be sought in the spirit of the age which proceeds by the rule of contraries altogether and is now usually admitted as the solution of every thing in the way of paradox and impossibility Or perhaps after all it was only the Mummy s exceedingly natural and matter of course air that divested his words of the terrible However this may be the facts are clear and no member of our party betrayed any very particular trepidation or seemed to consider that any thing had gone very especially wrong For my part I was convinced it was all right and merely stepped aside out of the range of the Egyptian s fist Doctor Ponnonner thrust his hands into his breeches pockets looked hard at the Mummy and grew excessively red in the face mister Glidden stroked his whiskers and drew up the collar of his shirt mister Buckingham hung down his head and put his right thumb into the left corner of his mouth The Egyptian regarded him with a severe countenance for some minutes and at length with a sneer said Why don t you speak mister Buckingham Did you hear what I asked you or not Do take your thumb out of your mouth mister Buckingham hereupon gave a slight start took his right thumb out of the left corner of his mouth and by way of indemnification inserted his left thumb in the right corner of the aperture above mentioned Not being able to get an answer from mister B the figure turned peevishly to mister Gliddon and in a peremptory tone demanded in general terms what we all meant mister Gliddon replied at great length in phonetics and but for the deficiency of American printing offices in hieroglyphical type it would afford me much pleasure to record here in the original the whole of his very excellent speech I may as well take this occasion to remark that all the subsequent conversation in which the Mummy took a part was carried on in primitive Egyptian through the medium so far as concerned myself and other untravelled members of the company through the medium I say of Messieurs Gliddon and Buckingham as interpreters These gentlemen spoke the mother tongue of the Mummy with inimitable fluency and grace but I could not help observing that owing no doubt to the introduction of images entirely modern and of course entirely novel to the stranger the two travellers were reduced occasionally to the employment of sensible forms for the purpose of conveying a particular meaning mister Gliddon at one period for example could not make the Egyptian comprehend the term politics until he sketched upon the wall with a bit of charcoal a little carbuncle nosed gentleman out at elbows standing upon a stump with his left leg drawn back right arm thrown forward with his fist shut the eyes rolled up toward Heaven and the mouth open at an angle of ninety degrees Just in the same way mister Buckingham failed to convey the absolutely modern idea wig until at Doctor Ponnonner s suggestion he grew very pale in the face and consented to take off his own It will be readily understood that mister Gliddon s discourse turned chiefly upon the vast benefits accruing to science from the unrolling and disembowelling of mummies apologizing upon this score for any disturbance that might have been occasioned him in particular the individual Mummy called Allamistakeo and concluding with a mere hint for it could scarcely be considered more that as these little matters were now explained it might be as well to proceed with the investigation intended Here Doctor Ponnonner made ready his instruments In regard to the latter suggestions of the orator it appears that Allamistakeo had certain scruples of conscience the nature of which I did not distinctly learn but he expressed himself satisfied with the apologies tendered and getting down from the table shook hands with the company all round When this ceremony was at an end we immediately busied ourselves in repairing the damages which our subject had sustained from the scalpel We sewed up the wound in his temple bandaged his foot and applied a square inch of black plaster to the tip of his nose It was now observed that the Count this was the title it seems of Allamistakeo had a slight fit of shivering no doubt from the cold The Doctor immediately repaired to his wardrobe and soon returned with a black dress coat made in Jennings best manner a pair of sky blue plaid pantaloons with straps a pink gingham chemise a flapped vest of brocade a white sack overcoat a walking cane with a hook a hat with no brim patent leather boots straw colored kid gloves an eye glass a pair of whiskers and a waterfall cravat Owing to the disparity of size between the Count and the doctor the proportion being as two to one there was some little difficulty in adjusting these habiliments upon the person of the Egyptian but when all was arranged he might have been said to be dressed mister Gliddon therefore gave him his arm and led him to a comfortable chair by the fire while the Doctor rang the bell upon the spot and ordered a supply of cigars and wine The conversation soon grew animated Much curiosity was of course expressed in regard to the somewhat remarkable fact of Allamistakeo s still remaining alive I should have thought observed mister Buckingham that it is high time you were dead Why replied the Count very much astonished I am little more than seven hundred years old My father lived a thousand and was by no means in his dotage when he died Here ensued a brisk series of questions and computations by means of which it became evident that the antiquity of the Mummy had been grossly misjudged It had been five thousand and fifty years and some months since he had been consigned to the catacombs at Eleithias But my remark resumed mister Buckingham had no reference to your age at the period of interment I am willing to grant in fact that you are still a young man and my illusion was to the immensity of time during which by your own showing you must have been done up in asphaltum In what said the Count In asphaltum persisted mister B Ah yes I have some faint notion of what you mean it might be made to answer no doubt but in my time we employed scarcely any thing else than the Bichloride of Mercury But what we are especially at a loss to understand said Doctor Ponnonner is how it happens that having been dead and buried in Egypt five thousand years ago you are here to day all alive and looking so delightfully well Had I been as you say dead replied the Count it is more than probable that dead I should still be for I perceive you are yet in the infancy of Calvanism and cannot accomplish with it what was a common thing among us in the old days But the fact is I fell into catalepsy and it was considered by my best friends that I was either dead or should be they accordingly embalmed me at once I presume you are aware of the chief principle of the embalming process Why not altogether Why I perceive a deplorable condition of ignorance Well I cannot enter into details just now but it is necessary to explain that to embalm properly speaking in Egypt was to arrest indefinitely all the animal functions subjected to the process I use the word animal in its widest sense as including the physical not more than the moral and vital being I repeat that the leading principle of embalmment consisted with us in the immediately arresting and holding in perpetual abeyance all the animal functions subjected to the process To be brief in whatever condition the individual was at the period of embalmment in that condition he remained Now as it is my good fortune to be of the blood of the Scarabaeus I was embalmed alive as you see me at present The blood of the Scarabaeus exclaimed Doctor Ponnonner Yes The Scarabaeus was the insignium or the arms of a very distinguished and very rare patrician family To be of the blood of the Scarabaeus is merely to be one of that family of which the Scarabaeus is the insignium I speak figuratively But what has this to do with you being alive Why it is the general custom in Egypt to deprive a corpse before embalmment of its bowels and brains the race of the Scarabaei alone did not coincide with the custom Had I not been a Scarabeus therefore I should have been without bowels and brains and without either it is inconvenient to live I perceive that said mister Buckingham and I presume that all the entire mummies that come to hand are of the race of Scarabaei Beyond doubt I thought said mister Gliddon very meekly that the Scarabaeus was one of the Egyptian gods One of the Egyptian what exclaimed the Mummy starting to its feet Gods repeated the traveller mister Gliddon I really am astonished to hear you talk in this style said the Count resuming his chair No nation upon the face of the earth has ever acknowledged more than one god The Scarabaeus the Ibis et cetera were with us as similar creatures have been with others the symbols or media through which we offered worship to the Creator too august to be more directly approached There was here a pause At length the colloquy was renewed by Doctor Ponnonner It is not improbable then from what you have explained said he that among the catacombs near the Nile there may exist other mummies of the Scarabaeus tribe in a condition of vitality There can be no question of it replied the Count all the Scarabaei embalmed accidentally while alive are alive now Even some of those purposely so embalmed may have been overlooked by their executors and still remain in the tomb Will you be kind enough to explain I said what you mean by purposely so embalmed With great pleasure answered the Mummy after surveying me leisurely through his eye glass for it was the first time I had ventured to address him a direct question With great pleasure he said The usual duration of man s life in my time was about eight hundred years Few men died unless by most extraordinary accident before the age of six hundred few lived longer than a decade of centuries but eight were considered the natural term After the discovery of the embalming principle as I have already described it to you it occurred to our philosophers that a laudable curiosity might be gratified and at the same time the interests of science much advanced by living this natural term in installments In the case of history indeed experience demonstrated that something of this kind was indispensable An historian for example having attained the age of five hundred would write a book with great labor and then get himself carefully embalmed leaving instructions to his executors pro tem that they should cause him to be revivified after the lapse of a certain period say five or six hundred years Resuming existence at the expiration of this time he would invariably find his great work converted into a species of hap hazard note book that is to say into a kind of literary arena for the conflicting guesses riddles and personal squabbles of whole herds of exasperated commentators These guesses et cetera which passed under the name of annotations or emendations were found so completely to have enveloped distorted and overwhelmed the text that the author had to go about with a lantern to discover his own book When discovered it was never worth the trouble of the search After re writing it throughout it was regarded as the bounden duty of the historian to set himself to work immediately in correcting from his own private knowledge and experience the traditions of the day concerning the epoch at which he had originally lived Now this process of re scription and personal rectification pursued by various individual sages from time to time had the effect of preventing our history from degenerating into absolute fable I beg your pardon said Doctor Ponnonner at this point laying his hand gently upon the arm of the Egyptian I beg your pardon sir but may I presume to interrupt you for one moment By all means sir replied the Count drawing up I merely wished to ask you a question said the Doctor You mentioned the historian s personal correction of traditions respecting his own epoch Pray sir upon an average what proportion of these Kabbala were usually found to be right The Kabbala as you properly term them sir were generally discovered to be precisely on a par with the facts recorded in the un re written histories themselves that is to say not one individual iota of either was ever known under any circumstances to be not totally and radically wrong But since it is quite clear resumed the Doctor that at least five thousand years have elapsed since your entombment I take it for granted that your histories at that period if not your traditions were sufficiently explicit on that one topic of universal interest the Creation which took place as I presume you are aware only about ten centuries before Sir said the Count Allamistakeo The Doctor repeated his remarks but it was only after much additional explanation that the foreigner could be made to comprehend them The latter at length said hesitatingly The ideas you have suggested are to me I confess utterly novel During my time I never knew any one to entertain so singular a fancy as that the universe or this world if you will have it so ever had a beginning at all I remember once and once only hearing something remotely hinted by a man of many speculations concerning the origin of the human race and by this individual the very word Adam or Red Earth which you make use of was employed He employed it however in a generical sense with reference to the spontaneous germination from rank soil just as a thousand of the lower genera of creatures are germinated the spontaneous germination I say of five vast hordes of men simultaneously upspringing in five distinct and nearly equal divisions of the globe Here in general the company shrugged their shoulders and one or two of us touched our foreheads with a very significant air mister Silk Buckingham first glancing slightly at the occiput and then at the sinciput of Allamistakeo spoke as follows The long duration of human life in your time together with the occasional practice of passing it as you have explained in installments must have had indeed a strong tendency to the general development and conglomeration of knowledge I presume therefore that we are to attribute the marked inferiority of the old Egyptians in all particulars of science when compared with the moderns and more especially with the Yankees altogether to the superior solidity of the Egyptian skull I confess again replied the Count with much suavity that I am somewhat at a loss to comprehend you pray to what particulars of science do you allude Here our whole party joining voices detailed at great length the assumptions of phrenology and the marvels of animal magnetism Having heard us to an end the Count proceeded to relate a few anecdotes which rendered it evident that prototypes of Gall and Spurzheim had flourished and faded in Egypt so long ago as to have been nearly forgotten and that the manoeuvres of Mesmer were really very contemptible tricks when put in collation with the positive miracles of the Theban savans who created lice and a great many other similar things I here asked the Count if his people were able to calculate eclipses He smiled rather contemptuously and said they were This put me a little out but I began to make other inquiries in regard to his astronomical knowledge when a member of the company who had never as yet opened his mouth whispered in my ear that for information on this head I had better consult Ptolemy whoever Ptolemy is as well as one Plutarch de facie lunae I then questioned the Mummy about burning glasses and lenses and in general about the manufacture of glass but I had not made an end of my queries before the silent member again touched me quietly on the elbow and begged me for God s sake to take a peep at Diodorus Siculus As for the Count he merely asked me in the way of reply if we moderns possessed any such microscopes as would enable us to cut cameos in the style of the Egyptians While I was thinking how I should answer this question little Doctor Ponnonner committed himself in a very extraordinary way Look at our architecture he exclaimed greatly to the indignation of both the travellers who pinched him black and blue to no purpose Look he cried with enthusiasm at the Bowling Green Fountain in New York or if this be too vast a contemplation regard for a moment the Capitol at Washington D C and the good little medical man went on to detail very minutely the proportions of the fabric to which he referred He explained that the portico alone was adorned with no less than four and twenty columns five feet in diameter and ten feet apart The Count said that he regretted not being able to remember just at that moment the precise dimensions of any one of the principal buildings of the city of Aznac whose foundations were laid in the night of Time but the ruins of which were still standing at the epoch of his entombment in a vast plain of sand to the westward of Thebes He recollected however talking of the porticoes that one affixed to an inferior palace in a kind of suburb called Carnac consisted of a hundred and forty four columns thirty seven feet in circumference and twenty five feet apart The approach to this portico from the Nile was through an avenue two miles long composed of sphynxes statues and obelisks twenty sixty and a hundred feet in height The palace itself as well as he could remember was in one direction two miles long and might have been altogether about seven in circuit Its walls were richly painted all over within and without with hieroglyphics He would not pretend to assert that even fifty or sixty of the Doctor s Capitols might have been built within these walls but he was by no means sure that two or three hundred of them might not have been squeezed in with some trouble That palace at Carnac was an insignificant little building after all He the Count however could not conscientiously refuse to admit the ingenuity magnificence and superiority of the Fountain at the Bowling Green as described by the Doctor Nothing like it he was forced to allow had ever been seen in Egypt or elsewhere I here asked the Count what he had to say to our railroads Nothing he replied in particular They were rather slight rather ill conceived and clumsily put together They could not be compared of course with the vast level direct iron grooved causeways upon which the Egyptians conveyed entire temples and solid obelisks of a hundred and fifty feet in altitude I spoke of our gigantic mechanical forces He agreed that we knew something in that way but inquired how I should have gone to work in getting up the imposts on the lintels of even the little palace at Carnac This question I concluded not to hear and demanded if he had any idea of Artesian wells but he simply raised his eyebrows while mister Gliddon winked at me very hard and said in a low tone that one had been recently discovered by the engineers employed to bore for water in the Great Oasis I then mentioned our steel but the foreigner elevated his nose and asked me if our steel could have executed the sharp carved work seen on the obelisks and which was wrought altogether by edge tools of copper This disconcerted us so greatly that we thought it advisable to vary the attack to Metaphysics We sent for a copy of a book called the Dial and read out of it a chapter or two about something that is not very clear but which the Bostonians call the Great Movement of Progress The Count merely said that Great Movements were awfully common things in his day and as for Progress it was at one time quite a nuisance but it never progressed We then spoke of the great beauty and importance of Democracy and were at much trouble in impressing the Count with a due sense of the advantages we enjoyed in living where there was suffrage ad libitum and no king He listened with marked interest and in fact seemed not a little amused When we had done he said that a great while ago there had occurred something of a very similar sort Thirteen Egyptian provinces determined all at once to be free and to set a magnificent example to the rest of mankind They assembled their wise men and concocted the most ingenious constitution it is possible to conceive For a while they managed remarkably well only their habit of bragging was prodigious The thing ended however in the consolidation of the thirteen states with some fifteen or twenty others in the most odious and insupportable despotism that was ever heard of upon the face of the Earth I asked what was the name of the usurping tyrant As well as the Count could recollect it was Mob Not knowing what to say to this I raised my voice and deplored the Egyptian ignorance of steam The Count looked at me with much astonishment but made no answer The silent gentleman however gave me a violent nudge in the ribs with his elbows told me I had sufficiently exposed myself for once and demanded if I was really such a fool as not to know that the modern steam engine is derived from the invention of Hero through Solomon de Caus We were now in imminent danger of being discomfited but as good luck would have it Doctor Ponnonner having rallied returned to our rescue and inquired if the people of Egypt would seriously pretend to rival the moderns in the all important particular of dress The Count at this glanced downward to the straps of his pantaloons and then taking hold of the end of one of his coat tails held it up close to his eyes for some minutes Letting it fall at last his mouth extended itself very gradually from ear to ear but I do not remember that he said any thing in the way of reply Hereupon we recovered our spirits and the Doctor approaching the Mummy with great dignity desired it to say candidly upon its honor as a gentleman if the Egyptians had comprehended at any period the manufacture of either Ponnonner s lozenges or Brandreth s pills We looked with profound anxiety for an answer but in vain It was not forthcoming The Egyptian blushed and hung down his head Never was triumph more consummate never was defeat borne with so ill a grace Indeed I could not endure the spectacle of the poor Mummy s mortification I reached my hat bowed to him stiffly and took leave Upon getting home I found it past four o clock and went immediately to bed It is now ten A M I have been up since seven penning these memoranda for the benefit of my family and of mankind The former I shall behold no more My wife is a shrew The truth is I am heartily sick of this life and of the nineteenth century in general I am convinced that every thing is going wrong Besides I am anxious to know who will be President in twenty forty five As soon therefore as I shave and swallow a cup of coffee I shall just step over to Ponnonner s and get embalmed for a couple of hundred years THE POETIC PRINCIPLE IN speaking of the Poetic Principle I have no design to be either thorough or profound While discussing very much at random the essentiality of what we call Poetry my principal purpose will be to cite for consideration some few of those minor English or American poems which best suit my own taste or which upon my own fancy have left the most definite impression By minor poems I mean of course poems of little length And here in the beginning permit me to say a few words in regard to a somewhat peculiar principle which whether rightfully or wrongfully has always had its influence in my own critical estimate of the poem I hold that a long poem does not exist I maintain that the phrase a long poem is simply a flat contradiction in terms I need scarcely observe that a poem deserves its title only inasmuch as it excites by elevating the soul The value of the poem is in the ratio of this elevating excitement But all excitements are through a psychal necessity transient That degree of excitement which would entitle a poem to be so called at all cannot be sustained throughout a composition of any great length After the lapse of half an hour at the very utmost it flags fails a revulsion ensues and then the poem is in effect and in fact no longer such There are no doubt many who have found difficulty in reconciling the critical dictum that the Paradise Lost is to be devoutly admired throughout with the absolute impossibility of maintaining for it during perusal the amount of enthusiasm which that critical dictum would demand This great work in fact is to be regarded as poetical only when losing sight of that vital requisite in all works of Art Unity we view it merely as a series of minor poems If to preserve its Unity its totality of effect or impression we read it as would be necessary at a single sitting the result is but a constant alternation of excitement and depression After a passage of what we feel to be true poetry there follows inevitably a passage of platitude which no critical prejudgment can force us to admire but if upon completing the work we read it again omitting the first book that is to say commencing with the second we shall be surprised at now finding that admirable which we before condemned that damnable which we had previously so much admired It follows from all this that the ultimate aggregate or absolute effect of even the best epic under the sun is a nullity and this is precisely the fact In regard to the Iliad we have if not positive proof at least very good reason for believing it intended as a series of lyrics but granting the epic intention I can say only that the work is based in an imperfect sense of art The modern epic is of the supposititious ancient model but an inconsiderate and blindfold imitation But the day of these artistic anomalies is over If at any time any very long poem were popular in reality which I doubt it is at least clear that no very long poem will ever be popular again That the extent of a poetical work is ceteris paribus the measure of its merit seems undoubtedly when we thus state it a proposition sufficiently absurd yet we are indebted for it to the Quarterly Reviews Surely there can be nothing in mere size abstractly considered there can be nothing in mere bulk so far as a volume is concerned which has so continuously elicited admiration from these saturnine pamphlets A mountain to be sure by the mere sentiment of physical magnitude which it conveys does impress us with a sense of the sublime but no man is impressed after this fashion by the material grandeur of even The Columbiad Even the Quarterlies have not instructed us to be so impressed by it As yet they have not insisted on our estimating Lamar tine by the cubic foot or Pollock by the pound but what else are we to infer from their continual plating about sustained effort If by sustained effort any little gentleman has accomplished an epic let us frankly commend him for the effort if this indeed be a thing conk mendable but let us forbear praising the epic on the effort s account It is to be hoped that common sense in the time to come will prefer deciding upon a work of Art rather by the impression it makes by the effect it produces than by the time it took to impress the effect or by the amount of sustained effort which had been found necessary in effecting the impression The fact is that perseverance is one thing and genius quite another nor can all the Quarterlies in Christendom confound them By and by this proposition with many which I have been just urging will be received as self evident In the meantime by being generally condemned as falsities they will not be essentially damaged as truths On the other hand it is clear that a poem may be improperly brief Undue brevity degenerates into mere epigrammatism A very short poem while now and then producing a brilliant or vivid never produces a profound or enduring effect There must be the steady pressing down of the stamp upon the wax De Beranger has wrought innumerable things pungent and spirit stirring but in general they have been too imponderous to stamp themselves deeply into the public attention and thus as so many feathers of fancy have been blown aloft only to be whistled down the wind A remarkable instance of the effect of undue brevity in depressing a poem in keeping it out of the popular view is afforded by the following exquisite little Serenade I arise from dreams of thee In the first sweet sleep of night When the winds are breathing low And the stars are shining bright I arise from dreams of thee And a spirit in my feet Has led me who knows how To thy chamber window sweet The wandering airs they faint On the dark the silent stream The champak odors fail Like sweet thoughts in a dream The nightingale s complaint It dies upon her heart As I must die on shine O beloved as thou art O lift me from the grass I die I faint I fail Let thy love in kisses rain On my lips and eyelids pale My cheek is cold and white alas My heart beats loud and fast O press it close to shine again Where it will break at last Very few perhaps are familiar with these lines yet no less a poet than Shelley is their author Their warm yet delicate and ethereal imagination will be appreciated by all but by none so thoroughly as by him who has himself arisen from sweet dreams of one beloved to bathe in the aromatic air of a southern midsummer night One of the finest poems by Willis the very best in my opinion which he has ever written has no doubt through this same defect of undue brevity been kept back from its proper position not less in the The shadows lay along Broadway Twas near the twilight tide And slowly there a lady fair Was walking in her pride Alone walk d she but viewlessly Walk d spirits at her side Peace charm d the street beneath her feet And Honor charm d the air And all astir looked kind on her And called her good as fair For all God ever gave to her She kept with chary care She kept with care her beauties rare From lovers warm and true For heart was cold to all but gold And the rich came not to won But honor d well her charms to sell If priests the selling do Now walking there was one more fair A slight girl lily pale And she had unseen company To make the spirit quail Twixt Want and Scorn she walk d forlorn And nothing could avail No mercy now can clear her brow From this world s peace to pray For as love s wild prayer dissolved in air Her woman s heart gave way But the sin forgiven by Christ in Heaven By man is cursed alway In this composition we find it difficult to recognize the Willis who has written so many mere verses of society The lines are not only richly ideal but full of energy while they breathe an earnestness an evident sincerity of sentiment for which we look in vain throughout all the other works of this author While the epic mania while the idea that to merit in poetry prolixity is indispensable has for some years past been gradually dying out of the public mind by mere dint of its own absurdity we find it succeeded by a heresy too palpably false to be long tolerated but one which in the brief period it has already endured may be said to have accomplished more in the corruption of our Poetical Literature than all its other enemies combined I allude to the heresy of The Didactic It has been assumed tacitly and avowedly directly and indirectly that the ultimate object of all Poetry is Truth Every poem it is said should inculcate a morals and by this moral is the poetical merit of the work to be adjudged We Americans especially have patronized this happy idea and we Bostonians very especially have developed it in full We have taken it into our heads that to write a poem simply for the poem s sake and to acknowledge such to have been our design would be to confess ourselves radically wanting in the true poetic dignity and force but the simple fact is that would we but permit ourselves to look into our own souls we should immediately there discover that under the sun there neither exists nor can exist any work more thoroughly dignified more supremely noble than this very poem this poem per se this poem which is a poem and nothing more this poem written solely for the poem s sake With as deep a reverence for the True as ever inspired the bosom of man I would nevertheless limit in some measure its modes of inculcation I would limit to enforce them I would not enfeeble them by dissipation The demands of Truth are severe She has no sympathy with the myrtles All that which is so indispensable in Song is precisely all that with which she has nothing whatever to do It is but making her a flaunting paradox to wreathe her in gems and flowers In enforcing a truth we need severity rather than efflorescence of language We must be simple precise terse We must be cool calm unimpassioned In a word we must be in that mood which as nearly as possible is the exact converse of the poetical He must be blind indeed who does not perceive the radical and chasmal difference between the truthful and the poetical modes of inculcation He must be theory mad beyond redemption who in spite of these differences shall still persist in attempting to reconcile the obstinate oils and waters of Poetry and Truth Dividing the world of mind into its three most immediately obvious distinctions we have the Pure Intellect Taste and the Moral Sense I place Taste in the middle because it is just this position which in the mind it occupies It holds intimate relations with either extreme but from the Moral Sense is separated by so faint a difference that Aristotle has not hesitated to place some of its operations among the virtues themselves Nevertheless we find the offices of the trio marked with a sufficient distinction Just as the Intellect concerns itself with Truth so Taste informs us of the Beautiful while the Moral Sense is regardful of Duty Of this latter while Conscience teaches the obligation and Reason the expediency Taste contents herself with displaying the charms waging war upon Vice solely on the ground of her deformity her disproportion her animosity to the fitting to the appropriate to the harmonious in a word to Beauty An immortal instinct deep within the spirit of man is thus plainly a sense of the Beautiful This it is which administers to his delight in the manifold forms and sounds and odors and sentiments amid which he exists And just as the lily is repeated in the lake or the eyes of Amaryllis in the mirror so is the mere oral or written repetition of these forms and sounds and colors and odors and sentiments a duplicate source of the light But this mere repetition is not poetry He who shall simply sing with however glowing enthusiasm or with however vivid a truth of description of the sights and sounds and odors and colors and sentiments which greet him in common with all mankind he I say has yet failed to prove his divine title There is still a something in the distance which he has been unable to attain We have still a thirst unquenchable to allay which he has not shown us the crystal springs This thirst belongs to the immortality of Man It is at once a consequence and an indication of his perennial existence It is the desire of the moth for the star It is no mere appreciation of the Beauty before us but a wild effort to reach the Beauty above Inspired by an ecstatic prescience of the glories beyond the grave we struggle by multiform combinations among the things and thoughts of Time to attain a portion of that Loveliness whose very elements perhaps appertain to eternity alone And thus when by Poetry or when by Music the most entrancing of the poetic moods we find ourselves melted into tears we weep then not as the Abbate Gravina supposes through excess of pleasure but through a certain petulant impatient sorrow at our inability to grasp now wholly here on earth at once and for ever those divine and rapturous joys of which through the poem or through the music we attain to but brief and indeterminate glimpses The struggle to apprehend the supernal Loveliness this struggle on the part of souls fittingly constituted has given to the world all that which it the world has ever been enabled at once to understand and to feel as poetic The Poetic Sentiment of course may develop itself in various modes in Painting in Sculpture in Architecture in the Dance very especially in Music and very peculiarly and with a wide field in the com position of the Landscape Garden Our present theme however has regard only to its manifestation in words And here let me speak briefly on the topic of rhythm Contenting myself with the certainty that Music in its various modes of metre rhythm and rhyme is of so vast a moment in Poetry as never to be wisely rejected is so vitally important an adjunct that he is simply silly who declines its assistance I will not now pause to maintain its absolute essentiality It is in Music perhaps that the soul most nearly attains the great end for which when inspired by the Poetic Sentiment it struggles the creation of supernal Beauty It may be indeed that here this sublime end is now and then attained in fact We are often made to feel with a shivering delight that from an earthly harp are stricken notes which cannot have been unfamiliar to the angels And thus there can be little doubt that in the union of Poetry with Music in its popular sense we shall find the widest field for the Poetic development The old Bards and Minnesingers had advantages which we do not possess and Thomas Moore singing his own songs was in the most legitimate manner perfecting them as poems To recapitulate then I would define in brief the Poetry of words as The Rhythmical Creation of Beauty Its sole arbiter is Taste With the Intellect or with the Conscience it has only collateral relations Unless incidentally it has no concern whatever either with Duty or with Truth A few words however in explanation That pleasure which is at once the most pure the most elevating and the most intense is derived I maintain from the contemplation of the Beautiful In the contemplation of Beauty we alone find it possible to attain that pleasurable elevation or excitement of the soul which we recognize as the Poetic Sentiment and which is so easily distinguished from Truth which is the satisfaction of the Reason or from Passion which is the excitement of the heart I make Beauty therefore using the word as inclusive of the sublime I make Beauty the province of the poem simply because it is an obvious rule of Art that effects should be made to spring as directly as possible from their causes no one as yet having been weak enough to deny that the peculiar elevation in question is at least most readily attainable in the poem It by no means follows however that the incitements of Passion or the precepts of Duty or even the lessons of Truth may not be introduced into a poem and with advantage for they may subserve incidentally in various ways the general purposes of the work but the true artist will always contrive to tone them down in proper subjection to that Beauty which is the atmosphere and the real essence of the poem I cannot better introduce the few poems which I shall present for your consideration than by the citation of the Proem to Longfellow s Waif The day is done and the darkness Falls from the wings of Night As a feather is wafted downward From an Eagle in his flight I see the lights of the village Gleam through the rain and the mist And a feeling of sadness comes o er me That my soul cannot resist A feeling of sadness and longing That is not akin to pain And resembles sorrow only As the mist resembles the rain Come read to me some poem Some simple and heartfelt lay That shall soothe this restless feeling And banish the thoughts of day Not from the grand old masters Not from the bards sublime Whose distant footsteps echo Through the corridors of Time For like strains of martial music Their mighty thoughts suggest Life s endless toil and endeavor And to night I long for rest Read from some humbler poet Whose songs gushed from his heart As showers from the clouds of summer Or tears from the eyelids start Who through long days of labor And nights devoid of ease Still heard in his soul the music Of wonderful melodies Such songs have power to quiet The restless pulse of care And come like the benediction That follows after prayer Then read from the treasured volume The poem of thy choice And lend to the rhyme of the poet The beauty of thy voice And the night shall be filled with music And the cares that infest the day Shall fold their tents like the Arabs And as silently steal away With no great range of imagination these lines have been justly admired for their delicacy of expression Some of the images are very effective Nothing can be better than the bards sublime Whose distant footsteps echo Down the corridors of Time The idea of the last quatrain is also very effective The poem on the whole however is chiefly to be admired for the graceful insouciance of its metre so well in accordance with the character of the sentiments and especially for the ease of the general manner This ease or naturalness in a literary style it has long been the fashion to regard as ease in appearance alone as a point of really difficult attainment But not so a natural manner is difficult only to him who should never meddle with it to the unnatural It is but the result of writing with the understanding or with the instinct that the tone in composition should always be that which the mass of mankind would adopt and must perpetually vary of course with the occasion The author who after the fashion of The North American Review should be upon all occasions merely quiet must necessarily upon many occasions be simply silly or stupid and has no more right to be considered easy or natural than a Cockney exquisite or than the sleeping Beauty in the waxworks Among the minor poems of Bryant none has so much impressed me as the one which he entitles June I quote only a portion of it There through the long long summer hours The golden light should lie And thick young herbs and groups of flowers Stand in their beauty by The oriole should build and tell His love tale close beside my cell The idle butterfly Should rest him there and there be heard The housewife bee and humming bird And what if cheerful shouts at noon Come from the village sent Or songs of maids beneath the moon With fairy laughter blent And what if in the evening light Betrothed lovers walk in sight Of my low monument I would the lovely scene around Might know no sadder sight nor sound I know I know I should not see The season s glorious show Nor would its brightness shine for me Nor its wild music flow But if around my place of sleep The friends I love should come to weep They might not haste to go Soft airs and song and the light and bloom Should keep them lingering by my tomb These to their soften d hearts should bear The thoughts of what has been And speak of one who cannot share The gladness of the scene Whose part in all the pomp that fills The circuit of the summer hills Is that his grave is green And deeply would their hearts rejoice To hear again his living voice The rhythmical flow here is even voluptuous nothing could be more melodious The poem has always affected me in a remarkable manner The intense melancholy which seems to well up perforce to the surface of all the poet s cheerful sayings about his grave we find thrilling us to the soul while there is the truest poetic elevation in the thrill The impression left is one of a pleasurable sadness And if in the remaining compositions which I shall introduce to you there be more or less of a similar tone always apparent let me remind you that how or why we know not this certain taint of sadness is inseparably connected with all the higher manifestations of true Beauty It is nevertheless A feeling of sadness and longing That is not akin to pain And resembles sorrow only As the mist resembles the rain The taint of which I speak is clearly perceptible even in a poem so full of brilliancy and spirit as The Health of Edward Coate Pinckney I fill this cup to one made up Of loveliness alone A woman of her gentle sex The seeming paragon To whom the better elements And kindly stars have given A form so fair that like the air Tis less of earth than heaven Her every tone is music s own Like those of morning birds And something more than melody Dwells ever in her words The coinage of her heart are they And from her lips each flows As one may see the burden d bee Forth issue from the rose Affections are as thoughts to her The measures of her hours Her feelings have the flagrancy The freshness of young flowers And lovely passions changing oft So fill her she appears The image of themselves by turns The idol of past years Of her bright face one glance will trace A picture on the brain And of her voice in echoing hearts A sound must long remain But memory such as mine of her So very much endears When death is nigh my latest sigh Will not be life s but hers I fill d this cup to one made up Of loveliness alone A woman of her gentle sex The seeming paragon Her health and would on earth there stood Some more of such a frame That life might be all poetry And weariness a name It was the misfortune of mister Pinckney to have been born too far south Had he been a New Englander it is probable that he would have been ranked as the first of American lyrists by that magnanimous cabal which has so long controlled the destinies of American Letters in conducting the thing called The North American Review The poem just cited is especially beautiful but the poetic elevation which it induces we must refer chiefly to our sympathy in the poet s enthusiasm We pardon his hyperboles for the evident earnestness with which they are uttered It was by no means my design however to expatiate upon the merits of what I should read you These will necessarily speak for themselves Boccalini in his Advertisements from Parnassus tells us that Zoilus once presented Apollo a very caustic criticism upon a very admirable book whereupon the god asked him for the beauties of the work He replied that he only busied himself about the errors On hearing this Apollo handing him a sack of unwinnowed wheat bade him pick out all the chaff for his reward Now this fable answers very well as a hit at the critics but I am by no means sure that the god was in the right I am by no means certain that the true limits of the critical duty are not grossly misunderstood Excellence in a poem especially may be considered in the light of an axiom which need only be properly put to become self evident It is not excellence if it require to be demonstrated as such and thus to point out too particularly the merits of a work of Art is to admit that they are not merits altogether Among the Melodies of Thomas Moore is one whose distinguished character as a poem proper seems to have been singularly left out of view I allude to his lines beginning Come rest in this bosom The intense energy of their expression is not surpassed by anything in Byron There are two of the lines in which a sentiment is conveyed that embodies the all in all of the divine passion of Love a sentiment which perhaps has found its echo in more and in more passionate human hearts than any other single sentiment ever embodied in words Come rest in this bosom my own stricken deer Though the herd have fled from thee thy home is still here Here still is the smile that no cloud can o ercast And a heart and a hand all thy own to the last Oh what was love made for if tis not the same Through joy and through torment through glory and shame I know not I ask not if guilt s in that heart I but know that I love thee whatever thou art Thou hast call d me thy Angel in moments of bliss And thy Angel I ll be mid the horrors of this Through the furnace unshrinking thy steps to pursue And shield thee and save thee or perish there too It has been the fashion of late days to deny Moore Imagination while granting him Fancy a distinction originating with Coleridge than whom no man more fully comprehended the great powers of Moore The fact is that the fancy of this poet so far predominates over all his other faculties and over the fancy of all other men as to have induced very naturally the idea that he is fanciful only But never was there a greater mistake Never was a grosser wrong done the fame of a true poet In the compass of the English language I can call to mind no poem more profoundly more weirdly imaginative in the best sense than the lines commencing I would I were by that dim lake which are the com position of Thomas Moore I regret that I am unable to remember them One of the noblest and speaking of Fancy one of the most singularly fanciful of modern poets was Thomas Hood His Fair Ines had always for me an inexpressible charm O saw ye not fair Ines She s gone into the West To dazzle when the sun is down And rob the world of rest She took our daylight with her The smiles that we love best With morning blushes on her cheek And pearls upon her breast O turn again fair Ines Before the fall of night For fear the moon should shine alone And stars unrivalltd bright And blessed will the lover be That walks beneath their light And breathes the love against thy cheek I dare not even write Would I had been fair Ines That gallant cavalier Who rode so gaily by thy side And whisper d thee so near Were there no bonny dames at home Or no true lovers here That he should cross the seas to win The dearest of the dear I saw thee lovely Ines Descend along the shore With bands of noble gentlemen And banners waved before And gentle youth and maidens gay And snowy plumes they wore It would have been a beauteous dream If it had been no more Alas alas fair Ines She went away with song With music waiting on her steps And shootings of the throng But some were sad and felt no mirth But only Music s wrong In sounds that sang Farewell Farewell To her you ve loved so long Farewell farewell fair Ines That vessel never bore So fair a lady on its deck Nor danced so light before Alas for pleasure on the sea And sorrow on the shorel The smile that blest one lover s heart Has broken many more The Haunted House by the same author is one of the truest poems ever written one of the truest one of the most unexceptionable one of the most thoroughly artistic both in its theme and in its execution It is moreover powerfully ideal imaginative I regret that its length renders it unsuitable for the purposes of this lecture In place of it permit me to offer the universally appreciated Bridge of Sighs One more Unfortunate Weary of breath Rashly importunate Gone to her death Take her up tenderly Lift her with care Fashion d so slenderly Young and so fair Look at her garments Clinging like cerements Whilst the wave constantly Drips from her clothing Take her up instantly Loving not loathing Touch her not scornfully Think of her mournfully Gently and humanly Not of the stains of her All that remains of her Now is pure womanly Make no deep scrutiny Into her mutiny Rash and undutiful Past all dishonor Death has left on her Only the beautiful Where the lamps quiver So far in the river With many a light From window and casement From garret to basement She stood with amazement Houseless by night The bleak wind of March Made her tremble and shiver But not the dark arch Or the black flowing river Mad from life s history Glad to death s mystery Swift to be hurl d Anywhere anywhere Out of the world In she plunged boldly No matter how coldly The rough river ran Over the brink of it Picture it think of it Dissolute Man Lave in it drink of it Then if you can Still for all slips of hers One of Eve s family Wipe those poor lips of hers Oozing so clammily Loop up her tresses Escaped from the comb Her fair auburn tresses Whilst wonderment guesses Where was her home Who was her father Who was her mother Had she a sister Had she a brother Or was there a dearer one Still and a nearer one Yet than all other Alas for the rarity Of Christian charity Under the sun Oh it was pitiful Near a whole city full Home she had none Sisterly brotherly Fatherly motherly Feelings had changed Love by harsh evidence Thrown from its eminence Even God s providence Seeming estranged Take her up tenderly Lift her with care Fashion d so slenderly Young and so fair Ere her limbs frigidly Stiffen too rigidly Decently kindly Smooth and compose them And her eyes close them Staring so blindly Dreadfully staring Through muddy impurity As when with the daring Last look of despairing Fixed on futurity Perhishing gloomily Spurred by contumely Cold inhumanity Burning insanity Into her rest Cross her hands humbly As if praying dumbly Over her breast Owning her weakness Her evil behavior And leaving with meekness Her sins to her Saviour The vigor of this poem is no less remarkable than its pathos The versification although carrying the fanciful to the very verge of the fantastic is nevertheless admirably adapted to the wild insanity which is the thesis of the poem Among the minor poems of Lord Byron is one which has never received from the critics the praise which it undoubtedly deserves Though the day of my destiny s over And the star of my fate bath declined Thy soft heart refused to discover The faults which so many could find Though thy soul with my grief was acquainted It shrunk not to share it with me And the love which my spirit bath painted It never bath found but in thee Then when nature around me is smiling The last smile which answers to mine I do not believe it beguiling Because it reminds me of shine And when winds are at war with the ocean As the breasts I believed in with me If their billows excite an emotion It is that they bear me from thee Though the rock of my last hope is shivered And its fragments are sunk in the wave Though I feel that my soul is delivered To pain it shall not be its slave There is many a pang to pursue me They may crush but they shall not contemn They may torture but shall not subdue me Tis of thee that I think not of them Though human thou didst not deceive me Though woman thou didst not forsake Though loved thou forborest to grieve me Though slandered thou never couldst shake Though trusted thou didst not disclaim me Though parted it was not to fly Though watchful twas not to defame me Nor mute that the world might belie Yet I blame not the world nor despise it Nor the war of the many with one If my soul was not fitted to prize it Twas folly not sooner to shun And if dearly that error bath cost me And more than I once could foresee I have found that whatever it lost me It could not deprive me of thee From the wreck of the past which bath perished Thus much I at least may recall It bath taught me that which I most cherished Deserved to be dearest of all In the desert a fountain is springing In the wide waste there still is a tree And a bird in the solitude singing Which speaks to my spirit of thee Although the rhythm here is one of the most difficult the versification could scarcely be improved No nobler theme ever engaged the pen of poet It is the soul elevating idea that no man can consider himself entitled to complain of Fate while in his adversity he still retains the unwavering love of woman From Alfred Tennyson although in perfect sincerity I regard him as the noblest poet that ever lived I have left myself time to cite only a very brief specimen I call him and think him the noblest of poets not because the impressions he produces are at all times the most profound not because the poetical excitement which he induces is at all times the most intense but because it is at all times the most ethereal in other words the most elevating and most pure No poet is so little of the earth earthy What I am about to read is from his last long poem The Princess Tears idle tears I know not what they mean Tears from the depth of some divine despair Rise in the heart and gather to the eyes In looking on the happy Autumn fields And thinking of the days that are no more Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail That brings our friends up from the underworld Sad as the last which reddens over one That sinks with all we love below the verge So sad so fresh the days that are no more Ah sad and strange as in dark summer dawns The earliest pipe of half awaken d birds To dying ears when unto dying eyes The casement slowly grows a glimmering square So sad so strange the days that are no more Dear as remember d kisses after death And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign d On lips that are for others deep as love Deep as first love and wild with all regret O Death in Life the days that are no more Thus although in a very cursory and imperfect manner I have endeavored to convey to you my conception of the Poetic Principle It has been my purpose to suggest that while this principle itself is strictly and simply the Human Aspiration for Supernal Beauty the manifestation of the Principle is always found in an elevating excitement of the soul quite independent of that passion which is the intoxication of the Heart or of that truth which is the satisfaction of the Reason For in regard to passion alas its tendency is to degrade rather than to elevate the Soul Love on the contrary Love the true the divine Eros the Uranian as distinguished from the Diona an Venus is unquestionably the purest and truest of all poetical themes And in regard to Truth if to be sure through the attainment of a truth we are led to perceive a harmony where none was apparent before we experience at once the true poetical effect but this effect is referable to the harmony alone and not in the least degree to the truth which merely served to render the harmony manifest We shall reach however more immediately a distinct conception of what the true Poetry is by mere reference to a few of the simple elements which induce in the Poet himself the poetical effect He recognizes the ambrosia which nourishes his soul in the bright orbs that shine in Heaven in the volutes of the flower in the clustering of low shrubberies in the waving of the grain fields in the slanting of tall eastern trees in the blue distance of mountains in the grouping of clouds in the twinkling of half hidden brooks in the gleaming of silver rivers in the repose of sequestered lakes in the star mirroring depths of lonely wells He perceives it in the songs of birds in the harp of Bolos in the sighing of the night wind in the repining voice of the forest in the surf that complains to the shore in the fresh breath of the woods in the scent of the violet in the voluptuous perfume of the hyacinth in the suggestive odour that comes to him at eventide from far distant undiscovered islands over dim oceans illimitable and unexplored He owns it in all noble thoughts in all unworldly motives in all holy impulses in all chivalrous generous and self sacrificing deeds He feels it in the beauty of woman in the grace of her step in the lustre of her eye in the melody of her voice in her soft laughter in her sigh in the harmony of the rustling of her robes He deeply feels it in her winning endearments in her burning enthusiasms in her gentle charities in her meek and devotional endurances but above all ah far above all he kneels to it he worships it in the faith in the purity in the strength in the altogether divine majesty of her love Let me conclude by the recitation of yet another brief poem one very different in character from any that I have before quoted It is by Motherwell and is called The Song of the Cavalier With our modern and altogether rational ideas of the absurdity and impiety of warfare we are not precisely in that frame of mind best adapted to sympathize with the sentiments and thus to appreciate the real excellence of the poem To do this fully we must identify ourselves in fancy with the soul of the old cavalier Then mounte then mounte brave gallants all And don your helmes amaine Deathe s couriers Fame and Honor call No shrewish teares shall fill your eye When the sword hilt s in our hand Heart whole we ll part and no whit sighe For the fayrest of the land Let piping swaine and craven wight Thus weepe and poling crye Our business is like men to fight OLD ENGLISH POETRY 
8466-285142-0000	train-other-500	IT should not be doubted that at least one third of the affection with which we regard the elder poets of Great Britain should be attributed to what is in itself a thing apart from poetry we mean to the simple love of the antique

8466-285142-0002	train-other-500	should not be looked upon as a merit appertaining to the authors of the poems Almost every devout admirer of the old bards if demanded his opinion of their productions would mention vaguely yet with perfect sincerity

MOST ENTHUSIASTIC ADMIRATION AND WITH THE MOST SINCERE ESTEEM eighteen forty five E A P PREFACE THESE trifles are collected and republished chiefly with a view to their redemption from the many improvements to which they have been subjected while going at random the rounds of the press I am naturally anxious that what I have written should circulate as I wrote it if it circulate at all In defence of my own taste nevertheless it is incumbent upon me to say that I think nothing in this volume of much value to the public or very creditable to myself Events not to be controlled have prevented me from making at any time any serious effort in what under happier circumstances would have been the field of my choice With me poetry has been not a purpose but a passion and the passions should be held in reverence they must not they can not at will be excited with an eye to the paltry compensations or the more paltry commendations of man kind E A P eighteen forty five POEMS OF LATER LIFE THE RAVEN Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered weak and weary Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore While I nodded nearly napping suddenly there came a tapping As of some one gently rapping rapping at my chamber door Tis some visiter I muttered tapping at my chamber door Only this and nothing more Ah distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor Eagerly I wished the morrow vainly I had sought to borrow From my books surcease of sorrow sorrow for the lost Lenore For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore Nameless here for evermore And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain Thrilled me filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before So that now to still the beating of my heart I stood repeating Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door This it is and nothing more Presently my soul grew stronger hesitating then no longer Sir said I or Madam truly your forgiveness I implore But the fact is I was napping and so gently you came rapping And so faintly you came tapping tapping at my chamber door That I scarce was sure I heard you here I opened wide the door Darkness there and nothing more Deep into that darkness peering long I stood there wondering fearing Doubting dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before But the silence was unbroken and the darkness gave no token And the only word there spoken was the whispered word Lenore This I whispered and an echo murmured back the word Lenore Merely this and nothing more Back into the chamber turning all my soul within me burning Soon I heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before Surely said I surely that is something at my window lattice Let me see then what thereat is and this mystery explore Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore Tis the wind and nothing more Open here I flung the shutter when with many a flirt and flutter In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore Not the least obeisance made he not an instant stopped or stayed he But with mien of lord or lady perched above my chamber door Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door Perched and sat and nothing more Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore Though thy crest be shorn and shaven thou I said art sure no craven Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night s Plutonian shore Quoth the raven Nevermore Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly Though its answer little meaning little relevancy bore For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door With such name as Nevermore But the raven sitting lonely on the placid bust spoke only That one word as if his soul in that one word he did outpour Nothing farther then he uttered not a feather then he fluttered Till I scarcely more than muttered Other friends have flown before On the morrow he will leave me as my hopes have flown before Then the bird said Nevermore Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken Doubtless said I what it utters is its only stock and store Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore Of Never nevermore But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and door Then upon the velvet sinking I betook myself to linking Fancy unto fancy thinking what this ominous bird of yore What this grim ungainly ghastly gaunt and ominous bird of yore Meant in croaking Nevermore This I sat engaged in guessing but no syllable expressing To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom s core This and more I sat divining with my head at ease reclining On the cushion s velvet lining that the lamplght gloated o er But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o er She shall press ah nevermore Then methought the air grew denser perfumed from an unseen censer Swung by Angels whose faint foot falls tinkled on the tufted floor Wretch I cried thy God hath lent thee by these angels he hath sent thee Respite respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore Quaff oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore Quoth the raven Nevermore Prophet said I thing of evil prophet still if bird or devil Whether Tempter sent or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore Desolate yet all undaunted on this desert land enchanted On this home by Horror haunted tell me truly I implore Is there is there balm in Gilead tell me tell me I implore Quoth the raven Nevermore Prophet said I thing of evil prophet still if bird or devil By that Heaven that bends above us by that God we both adore Tell this soul with sorrow laden if within the distant Aidenn It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore Quoth the raven Nevermore Be that word our sign of parting bird or fiend I shrieked upstarting Get thee back into the tempest and the Night s Plutonian shore Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken Leave my loneliness unbroken quit the bust above my door Take thy beak from out my heart and take thy form from off my door Quoth the raven Nevermore And the raven never flitting still is sitting still is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon s that is dreaming And the lamp light o er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor Shall be lifted nevermore Published eighteen forty five THE BELLS I HEAR the sledges with the bells Silver bells What a world of merriment their melody foretells How they tinkle tinkle tinkle In the icy air of night While the stars that oversprinkle All the heavens seem to twinkle With a crystalline delight Keeping time time time In a sort of Runic rhyme To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells From the bells bells bells bells Bells bells bells From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells II Hear the mellow wedding bells Golden bells What a world of happiness their harmony foretells Through the balmy air of night How they ring out their delight From the molten golden notes And all in tune What a liquid ditty floats To the turtle dove that listens while she gloats On the moon Oh from out the sounding cells What a gush of euphony voluminously wells How it swells How it dwells On the Future how it tells Of the rapture that impels To the swinging and the ringing Of the bells bells bells Of the bells bells bells bells Bells bells bells To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells III Hear the loud alarum bells Brazen bells What tale of terror now their turbulency tells In the startled ear of night How they scream out their affright Too much horrified to speak They can only shriek shriek Out of tune In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire Leaping higher higher higher With a desperate desire And a resolute endeavor Now now to sit or never By the side of the pale faced moon Oh the bells bells bells What a tale their terror tells Of Despair How they clang and clash and roar What a horror they outpour On the bosom of the palpitating air Yet the ear it fully knows By the twanging And the clanging How the danger ebbs and flows Yet the ear distinctly tells In the jangling And the wrangling How the danger sinks and swells By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells Of the bells Of the bells bells bells bells Bells bells bells In the clamour and the clangour of the bells IV Hear the tolling of the bells Iron bells What a world of solemn thought their monody compels In the silence of the night How we shiver with affright At the melancholy meaning of their tone For every sound that floats From the rust within their throats Is a groan And the people ah the people They that dwell up in the steeple All alone And who tolling tolling tolling In that muffled monotone Feel a glory in so rolling On the human heart a stone They are neither man nor woman They are neither brute nor human They are Ghouls And their king it is who tolls And he rolls rolls rolls rolls Rolls A paean from the bells And his merry bosom swells With the paean of the bells And he dances and he yells Keeping time time time In a sort of Runic rhyme To the paean of the bells Of the bells Keeping time time time In a sort of Runic rhyme To the throbbing of the bells Of the bells bells bells To the sobbing of the bells Keeping time time time As he knells knells knells In a happy Runic rhyme To the rolling of the bells Of the bells bells bells To the tolling of the bells Of the bells bells bells bells Bells bells bells To the moaning and the groaning of the bells eighteen forty nine ULALUME The skies they were ashen and sober The leaves they were crisped and sere The leaves they were withering and sere It was night in the lonesome October Of my most immemorial year It was hard by the dim lake of Auber In the misty mid region of Weir It was down by the dank tarn of Auber In the ghoul haunted woodland of Weir Here once through an alley Titanic Of cypress I roamed with my Soul Of cypress with Psyche my Soul There were days when my heart was volcanic As the scoriac rivers that roll As the lavas that restlessly roll Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek In the ultimate climes of the Pole That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek In the realms of the Boreal Pole Our talk had been serious and sober But our thoughts they were palsied and sere Our memories were treacherous and sere For we knew not the month was October And we marked not the night of the year Ah night of all nights in the year We noted not the dim lake of Auber Though once we had journeyed down here We remembered not the dank tarn of Auber Nor the ghoul haunted woodland of Weir And now as the night was senescent And star dials pointed to morn As the star dials hinted of morn At the end of our path a liquescent And nebulous lustre was born Out of which a miraculous crescent Arose with a duplicate horn Astarte s bediamonded crescent Distinct with its duplicate horn And I said She is warmer than Dian She rolls through an ether of sighs She revels in a region of sighs She has seen that the tears are not dry on These cheeks where the worm never dies And has come past the stars of the Lion To point us the path to the skies To the Lethean peace of the skies Come up in despite of the Lion To shine on us with her bright eyes Come up through the lair of the Lion With love in her luminous eyes But Psyche uplifting her finger Said Sadly this star I mistrust Her pallor I strangely mistrust Ah hasten ah let us not linger Ah fly let us fly for we must In terror she spoke letting sink her Wings till they trailed in the dust In agony sobbed letting sink her Plumes till they trailed in the dust Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust I replied This is nothing but dreaming Let us on by this tremulous light Let us bathe in this crystalline light Its Sybillic splendor is beaming With Hope and in Beauty to night See it flickers up the sky through the night Ah we safely may trust to its gleaming And be sure it will lead us aright We safely may trust to a gleaming That cannot but guide us aright Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her And tempted her out of her gloom And conquered her scruples and gloom And we passed to the end of the vista But were stopped by the door of a tomb By the door of a legended tomb And I said What is written sweet sister On the door of this legended tomb She replied Ulalume Ulalume T is the vault of thy lost Ulalume Then my heart it grew ashen and sober As the leaves that were crisped and sere As the leaves that were withering and sere And I cried It was surely October On this very night of last year That I journeyed I journeyed down here That I brought a dread burden down here On this night of all nights in the year Ah what demon has tempted me here Well I know now this dim lake of Auber This misty mid region of Weir Well I know now this dank tarn of Auber This ghoul haunted woodland of Weir eighteen forty seven TO HELEN I saw thee once once only years ago I must not say how many but not many It was a July midnight and from out A full orbed moon that like thine own soul soaring Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven There fell a silvery silken veil of light With quietude and sultriness and slumber Upon the upturned faces of a thousand Roses that grew in an enchanted garden Where no wind dared to stir unless on tiptoe Fell on the upturn d faces of these roses That gave out in return for the love light Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death Fell on the upturn d faces of these roses That smiled and died in this parterre enchanted By thee and by the poetry of thy presence Clad all in white upon a violet bank I saw thee half reclining while the moon Fell on the upturn d faces of the roses And on thine own upturn d alas in sorrow Was it not Fate that on this July midnight Was it not Fate whose name is also Sorrow That bade me pause before that garden gate To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses No footstep stirred the hated world an slept Save only thee and me Oh Heaven oh God How my heart beats in coupling those two words Save only thee and me I paused I looked And in an instant all things disappeared Ah bear in mind this garden was enchanted The pearly lustre of the moon went out The mossy banks and the meandering paths The happy flowers and the repining trees Were seen no more the very roses odors Died in the arms of the adoring airs All all expired save thee save less than thou Save only the divine light in thine eyes Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes I saw but them they were the world to me I saw but them saw only them for hours Saw only them until the moon went down What wild heart histories seemed to he enwritten Upon those crystalline celestial spheres How dark a woe yet how sublime a hope How silently serene a sea of pride How daring an ambition yet how deep How fathomless a capacity for love But now at length dear Dian sank from sight Into a western couch of thunder cloud And thou a ghost amid the entombing trees Didst glide away Only thine eyes remained They would not go they never yet have gone Lighting my lonely pathway home that night They have not left me as my hopes have since They follow me they lead me through the years They are my ministers yet I their slave Their office is to illumine and enkindle My duty to be saved by their bright light And purified in their electric fire And sanctified in their elysian fire They fill my soul with Beauty which is Hope And are far up in Heaven the stars I kneel to In the sad silent watches of my night While even in the meridian glare of day I see them still two sweetly scintillant Venuses unextinguished by the sun ANNABEL LEE It was many and many a year ago In a kingdom by the sea That a maiden lived whom you may know By the name of ANNABEL LEE And this maiden she lived with no other thought Than to love and be loved by me I was a child and She was a child In this kingdom by the sea But we loved with a love that was more than love I and my ANNABEL LEE With a love that the winged seraphs of Heaven Coveted her and me And this was the reason that long ago In this kingdom by the sea A wind blew out of a cloud by night Chilling my ANNABEL LEE So that her high born kinsmen came And bore her away from me To shut her up in a sepulchre In this kingdom by the sea The angels not half so happy in Heaven Went envying her and me Yes that was the reason as all men know In this kingdom by the sea That the wind came out of the cloud chilling And killing my ANNABEL LEE But our love it was stronger by far than the love Of those who were older than we Of many far wiser than we And neither the angels in Heaven above Nor the demons down under the sea Can ever dissever my soul from the soul Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE And the stars never rise but I see the bright eyes Of the beautiful ANNABEL LEE And so all the night tide I lie down by the side Of my darling my darling my life and my bride In her sepulchre there by the sea In her tomb by the side of the sea eighteen forty nine A VALENTINE For her this rhyme is penned whose luminous eyes Brightly expressive as the twins of Loeda Shall find her own sweet name that nestling lies Upon the page enwrapped from every reader Search narrowly the lines they hold a treasure Divine a talisman an amulet That must be worn at heart Search well the measure The words the syllables Do not forget The trivialest point or you may lose your labor And yet there is in this no Gordian knot Which one might not undo without a sabre If one could merely comprehend the plot Enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering Eyes scintillating soul there lie perdus Three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing Of poets by poets as the name is a poet s too Its letters although naturally lying Like the knight Pinto Mendez Ferdinando Still form a synonym for Truth Cease trying You will not read the riddle though you do the best you can do eighteen forty six To discover the names in this and the following poem read the first letter of the first line in connection with the second letter of the second line the third letter of the third line the fourth of the fourth and so on to the end AN ENIGMA Seldom we find says Solomon Don Dunce Half an idea in the profoundest sonnet Through all the flimsy things we see at once As easily as through a Naples bonnet Trash of all trash how can a lady don it Yet heavier far than your Petrarchan stuff Owl downy nonsense that the faintest puff Twirls into trunk paper the while you con it And veritably Sol is right enough The general tuckermanities are arrant Bubbles ephemeral and so transparent But this is now you may depend upon it Stable opaque immortal all by dint Of the dear names that lie concealed within t eighteen forty seven TO MY MOTHER Because I feel that in the Heavens above The angels whispering to one another Can find among their burning terms of love None so devotional as that of Mother Therefore by that dear name I long have called you You who are more than mother unto me And fill my heart of hearts where Death installed you In setting my Virginia s spirit free My mother my own mother who died early Was but the mother of myself but you Are mother to the one I loved so dearly And thus are dearer than the mother I knew By that infinity with which my wife Was dearer to my soul than its soul life eighteen forty nine The above was addressed to the poet s mother in law missus Clemm Ed FOR ANNIE Thank Heaven the crisis The danger is past And the lingering illness Is over at last And the fever called Living Is conquered at last Sadly I know I am shorn of my strength And no muscle I move As I lie at full length But no matter I feel I am better at length And I rest so composedly Now in my bed That any beholder Might fancy me dead Might start at beholding me Thinking me dead The moaning and groaning The sighing and sobbing Are quieted now With that horrible throbbing At heart ah that horrible Horrible throbbing The sickness the nausea The pitiless pain Have ceased with the fever That maddened my brain With the fever called Living That burned in my brain And oh of all tortures That torture the worst Has abated the terrible Torture of thirst For the naphthaline river Of Passion accurst I have drank of a water That quenches all thirst Of a water that flows With a lullaby sound From a spring but a very few Feet under ground From a cavern not very far Down under ground And ah let it never Be foolishly said That my room it is gloomy And narrow my bed For man never slept In a different bed And to sleep you must slumber In just such a bed My tantalized spirit Here blandly reposes Forgetting or never Regretting its roses Its old agitations Of myrtles and roses For now while so quietly Lying it fancies A holier odor About it of pansies A rosemary odor Commingled with pansies With rue and the beautiful Puritan pansies And so it lies happily Bathing in many A dream of the truth And the beauty of Annie Drowned in a bath Of the tresses of Annie She tenderly kissed me She fondly caressed And then I fell gently To sleep on her breast Deeply to sleep From the heaven of her breast When the light was extinguished She covered me warm And she prayed to the angels To keep me from harm To the queen of the angels To shield me from harm And I lie so composedly Now in my bed Knowing her love That you fancy me dead And I rest so contentedly Now in my bed With her love at my breast That you fancy me dead That you shudder to look at me Thinking me dead But my heart it is brighter Than all of the many Stars in the sky For it sparkles with Annie It glows with the light Of the love of my Annie With the thought of the light Of the eyes of my Annie eighteen forty nine TO F BELOVED amid the earnest woes That crowd around my earthly path Drear path alas where grows Not even one lonely rose My soul at least a solace hath In dreams of thee and therein knows An Eden of bland repose And thus thy memory is to me Like some enchanted far off isle In some tumultuos sea Some ocean throbbing far and free With storms but where meanwhile Serenest skies continually Just o re that one bright island smile eighteen forty five TO FRANCES S OSGOOD THOU wouldst be loved then let thy heart From its present pathway part not Being everything which now thou art Be nothing which thou art not So with the world thy gentle ways Thy grace thy more than beauty Shall be an endless theme of praise And love a simple duty eighteen forty five ELDORADO Gaily bedight A gallant knight In sunshine and in shadow Had journeyed long Singing a song In search of Eldorado But he grew old This knight so bold And o er his heart a shadow Fell as he found No spot of ground That looked like Eldorado And as his strength Failed him at length He met a pilgrim shadow Shadow said he Where can it be This land of Eldorado Over the Mountains Of the Moon Down the Valley of the Shadow Ride boldly ride The shade replied If you seek for Eldorado eighteen forty nine EULALIE I DWELT alone In a world of moan And my soul was a stagnant tide Till the fair and gentle Eulalie became my blushing bride Till the yellow haired young Eulalie became my smiling bride Ah less less bright The stars of the night Than the eyes of the radiant girl And never a flake That the vapour can make With the moon tints of purple and pearl Can vie with the modest Eulalie s most unregarded curl Can compare with the bright eyed Eulalie s most humble and careless curl Now Doubt now Pain Come never again For her soul gives me sigh for sigh And all day long Shines bright and strong Astarte within the sky While ever to her dear Eulalie upturns her matron eye While ever to her young Eulalie upturns her violet eye eighteen forty five A DREAM WITHIN A DREAM Take this kiss upon the brow And in parting from you now Thus much let me avow You are not wrong who deem That my days have been a dream Yet if hope has flown away In a night or in a day In a vision or in none Is it therefore the less gone All that we see or seem Is but a dream within a dream I stand amid the roar Of a surf tormented shore And I hold within my hand Grains of the golden sand How few yet how they creep Through my fingers to the deep While I weep while I weep O God can I not grasp Them with a tighter clasp O God can I not save One from the pitiless wave Is all that we see or seem But a dream within a dream eighteen forty nine TO MARIE LOUISE SHEW Of all who hail thy presence as the morning Of all to whom thine absence is the night The blotting utterly from out high heaven The sacred sun of all who weeping bless thee Hourly for hope for life ah above all For the resurrection of deep buried faith In Truth in Virtue in Humanity Of all who on Despair s unhallowed bed Lying down to die have suddenly arisen At thy soft murmured words Let there be light At the soft murmured words that were fulfilled In the seraphic glancing of thine eyes Of all who owe thee most whose gratitude Nearest resembles worship oh remember The truest the most fervently devoted And think that these weak lines are written by him By him who as he pens them thrills to think His spirit is communing with an angel s eighteen forty seven TO MARIE LOUISE SHEW NOT long ago the writer of these lines In the mad pride of intellectuality Maintained the power of words denied that ever A thought arose within the human brain Beyond the utterance of the human tongue And now as if in mockery of that boast Two words two foreign soft dissyllables Italian tones made only to be murmured By angels dreaming in the moonlit dew That hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill Have stirred from out the abysses of his heart Unthought like thoughts that are the souls of thought Richer far wider far diviner visions Than even the seraph harper Israfel Who has the sweetest voice of all God s creatures Could hope to utter And I my spells are broken The pen falls powerless from my shivering hand With thy dear name as text though bidden by thee I can not write I can not speak or think Alas I can not feel for tis not feeling This standing motionless upon the golden Threshold of the wide open gate of dreams Gazing entranced adown the gorgeous vista And thrilling as I see upon the right Upon the left and all the way along Amid empurpled vapors far away To where the prospect terminates thee only eighteen forty eight THE CITY IN THE SEA Lo Death has reared himself a throne In a strange city lying alone Far down within the dim West Wherethe good and the bad and the worst and the best Have gone to their eternal rest There shrines and palaces and towers Time eaten towers that tremble not Resemble nothing that is ours Around by lifting winds forgot Resignedly beneath the sky The melancholy waters lie No rays from the holy heaven come down On the long night time of that town But light from out the lurid sea Streams up the turrets silently Gleams up the pinnacles far and free Up domes up spires up kingly halls Up fanes up Babylon like walls Up shadowy long forgotten bowers Of scultured ivy and stone flowers Up many and many a marvellous shrine Whose wreathed friezes intertwine The viol the violet and the vine Resignedly beneath the sky The melancholy waters lie So blend the turrets and shadows there That all seem pendulous in air While from a proud tower in the town Death looks gigantically down There open fanes and gaping graves Yawn level with the luminous waves But not the riches there that lie In each idol s diamond eye Not the gaily jewelled dead Tempt the waters from their bed For no ripples curl alas Along that wilderness of glass No swellings tell that winds may be Upon some far off happier sea No heavings hint that winds have been On seas less hideously serene But lo a stir is in the air The wave there is a movement there As if the towers had thrown aside In slightly sinking the dull tide As if their tops had feebly given A void within the filmy Heaven The waves have now a redder glow The hours are breathing faint and low And when amid no earthly moans Down down that town shall settle hence Hell rising from a thousand thrones Shall do it reverence eighteen forty five THE SLEEPER At midnight in the month of June I stand beneath the mystic moon An opiate vapour dewy dim Exhales from out her golden rim And softly dripping drop by drop Upon the quiet mountain top Steals drowsily and musically Into the univeral valley The rosemary nods upon the grave The lily lolls upon the wave Wrapping the fog about its breast The ruin moulders into rest Looking like Lethe see the lake A conscious slumber seems to take And would not for the world awake All Beauty sleeps and lo where lies Her easement open to the skies Irene with her Destinies Oh lady bright can it be right This window open to the night The wanton airs from the tree top Laughingly through the lattice drop The bodiless airs a wizard rout Flit through thy chamber in and out And wave the curtain canopy So fitfully so fearfully Above the closed and fringed lid Neath which thy slumb ring sould lies hid That o er the floor and down the wall Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall Oh lady dear hast thous no fear Why and what art thou dreaming here Sure thou art come p er far off seas A wonder to these garden trees Strange is thy pallor strange thy dress Strange above all thy length of tress And this all solemn silentness The lady sleeps Oh may her sleep Which is enduring so be deep Heaven have her in its sacred keep This chamber changed for one more holy This bed for one more melancholy I pray to God that she may lie Forever with unopened eye While the dim sheeted ghosts go by My love she sleeps Oh may her sleep As it is lasting so be deep Soft may the worms about her creep Far in the forest dim and old For her may some tall vault unfold Some vault that oft hath flung its black And winged pannels fluttering back Triumphant o er the crested palls Of her grand family funerals Some sepulchre remote alone Against whose portal she hath thrown In childhood many an idle stone Some tomb fromout whose sounding door She ne er shall force an echo more Thrilling to think poor child of sin It was the dead who groaned within eighteen forty five BRIDAL BALLAD THE ring is on my hand And the wreath is on my brow Satins and jewels grand Are all at my command And I am happy now And my lord he loves me well But when first he breathed his vow I felt my bosom swell For the words rang as a knell And the voice seemed his who fell In the battle down the dell And who is happy now But he spoke to re asure me And he kissed my pallid brow While a reverie came o re me And to the church yard bore me And I sighed to him before me Thinking him dead D Elormie Oh I am happy now And thus the words were spoken And this the plighted vow And though my faith be broken And though my heart be broken Behold the golden token That proves me happy now Would God I could awaken For I dream I know not how And my soul is sorely shaken Lest an evil step be taken Lest the dead who is forsaken May not be happy now eighteen forty five NOTES one The Raven was first published on the twenty ninth January eighteen forty five in the New York Evening Mirror a paper its author was then assistant editor of It was prefaced by the following words understood to have been written by N P Willis We are permitted to copy in advance of publication from the second number of the American Review the following remarkable poem by Edgar Poe In our opinion it is the most effective single example of fugitive poetry ever published in this country and unsurpassed in English poetry for subtle conception masterly ingenuity of versification and consistent sustaining of imaginative lift and pokerishness It is one of those dainties bred in a book which we feed on It will stick to the memory of everybody who reads it In the February number of the American Review the poem was published as by Quarles and it was introduced by the following note evidently suggested if not written by Poe himself The following lines from a correspondent besides the deep quaint strain of the sentiment and the curious introduction of some ludicrous touches amidst the serious and impressive as was doubtless intended by the author appears to us one of the most felicitous specimens of unique rhyming which has for some time met our eye The resources of English rhythm for varieties of melody measure and sound producing corresponding diversities of effect having been thoroughly studied much more perceived by very few poets in the language While the classic tongues especially the Greek possess by power of accent several advantages for versification over our own chiefly through greater abundance of spondaic feet we have other and very great advantages of sound by the modern usage of rhyme Alliteration is nearly the only effect of that kind which the ancients had in common with us It will be seen that much of the melody of The Raven arises from alliteration and the studious use of similar sounds in unusual places In regard to its measure it may be noted that if all the verses were like the second they might properly be placed merely in short lines producing a not uncommon form but the presence in all the others of one line mostly the second in the verse stanza which flows continuously with only an aspirate pause in the middle like that before the short line in the Sapphic Adonic while the fifth has at the middle pause no similarity of sound with any part besides gives the versification an entirely different effect We could wish the capacities of our noble language in prosody were better understood ED Am reverend two The bibliographical history of The Bells is curious The subject and some lines of the original version having been suggested by the poet s friend missus Shew Poe when he wrote out the first draft of the poem headed it The Bells By missus M A Shew This draft now the editor s property consists of only seventeen lines and read thus I The bells ah the bells The little silver bells How fairy like a melody there floats From their throats From their merry little throats From the silver tinkling throats Of the bells bells bells Of the bells II The bells ah the bells The heavy iron bells How horrible a monody there floats From their throats From their deep toned throats From their melancholy throats How I shudder at the notes Of the bells bells bells Of the bells In the autumn of eighteen forty eight Poe added another line to this poem and sent it to the editor of the Union Magazine It was not published So in the following February the poet forwarded to the same periodical a much enlarged and altered transcript Three months having elapsed without publication another revision of the poem similar to the current version was sent and in the following October was published in the Union Magazine three This poem was first published in Colton s American Review for December eighteen forty seven as To Ulalume a Ballad Being reprinted immediately in the Home Journal it was copied into various publications with the name of the editor N P Willis appended and was ascribed to him When first published it contained the following additional stanza which Poe subsequently at the suggestion of missus Whitman wisely suppressed Said we then we two then Ah can it Have been that the woodlandish ghouls The pitiful the merciful ghouls To bar up our path and to ban it From the secret that lies in these wolds Had drawn up the spectre of a planet From the limbo of lunary souls This sinfully scintillant planet From the Hell of the planetary souls four To Helen missus S Helen Whitman was not published until November eighteen forty eight although written several months earlier It first appeared in the Union Magazine and with the omission contrary to the knowledge or desire of Poe of the line Oh God oh Heaven how my heart beats in coupling those two words five Annabel Lee was written early in eighteen forty nine and is evidently an expression of the poet s undying love for his deceased bride although at least one of his lady admirers deemed it a response to her admiration Poe sent a copy of the ballad to the Union Magazine in which publication it appeared in January eighteen fifty three months after the author s death While suffering from hope deferred as to its fate Poe presented a copy of Annabel Lee to the editor of the Southern Literary Messenger who published it in the November number of his periodical a month after Poe s death In the meantime the poet s own copy left among his papers passed into the hands of the person engaged to edit his works and he quoted the poem in an obituary of Poe in the New York Tribune before any one else had an opportunity of publishing it six A Valentine one of three poems addressed to missus Osgood appears to have been written early in eighteen forty six seven An Enigma addressed to missus Sarah Anna Lewis Stella was sent to that lady in a letter in November eighteen forty seven and the following March appeared in Sartain s Union Magazine eight The sonnet To My Mother Maria Clemm was sent for publication to the short lived Flag of our Union early in eighteen forty nine but does not appear to have been issued until after its author s death when it appeared in the Leaflets of Memory for eighteen fifty nine For Annie was first published in the Flag of our Union in the spring of eighteen forty nine Poe annoyed at some misprints in this issue shortly afterwards caused a corrected copy to be inserted in the Home Journal ten To F Frances Sargeant Osgood appeared in the Broadway journal for April eighteen forty five These lines are but slightly varied from those inscribed To Mary in the Southern Literary Messenger for July eighteen thirty five and subsequently republished with the two stanzas transposed in Graham s Magazine for March eighteen forty two as To One Departed eleven To F s S O d a portion of the poet s triune tribute to missus Osgood was published in the Broadway Journal for September eighteen forty five The earliest version of these lines appeared in the Southern Literary Messenger for September eighteen thirty five as Lines written in an Album and was addressed to Eliza White the proprietor s daughter Slightly revised the poem reappeared in Burton s Gentleman s Magazine for August eighteen thirty nine as To twelve Although Eldorado was published during Poe s lifetime in eighteen forty nine in the Flag of our Union it does not appear to have ever received the author s finishing touches POEMS OF MANHOOD LENORE AH broken is the golden bowl the spirit flown forever Let the bell toll a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river And Guy De Vere hast thou no tear weep now or never more See on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love Lenore Come let the burial rite be read the funeral song be sung An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young A dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young Wretches ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride And when she fell in feeble health ye blessed her that she died How shall the ritual then be read the requiem how be sung By you by yours the evil eye by yours the slanderous tongue That did to death the innocent that died and died so young Peccavimus but rave not thus and let a Sabbath song Go up to God so solemnly the dead may feel so wrong The sweet Lenore hath gone before with Hope that flew beside Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy bride For her the fair and debonair that now so lowly lies The life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes The life still there upon her hair the death upon her eyes Avaunt to night my heart is light No dirge will I upraise But waft the angel on her flight with a Paean of old days Let no bell toll lest her sweet soul amid its hallowed mirth Should catch the note as it doth float up from the damned Earth To friends above from fiends below the indignant ghost is riven From Hell unto a high estate far up within the Heaven From grief and groan to a golden throne beside the King of Heaven TO ONE IN PARADISE THOU wast all that to me love For which my soul did pine A green isle in the sea love A fountain and a shrine All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers And all the flowers were mine Ah dream too bright to last Ah starry Hope that didst arise But to be overcast A voice from out the Future cries On on but o er the Past Dim gulf my spirit hovering lies Mute motionless aghast For alas alas with me The light of Life is o er No more no more no more Such language holds the solemn sea To the sands upon the shore Shall bloom the thunder blasted tree Or the stricken eagle soar And all my days are trances And all my nightly dreams Are where thy dark eye glances And where thy footstep gleams In what ethereal dances By what eternal streams eighteen thirty five THE COLISEUM TYPE of the antique Rome Rich reliquary Of lofty contemplation left to Time By buried centuries of pomp and power At length at length after so many days Of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst Thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie I kneel an altered and an humble man Amid thy shadows and so drink within My very soul thy grandeur gloom and glory Vastness and Age and Memories of Eld Silence and Desolation and dim Night I feel ye now I feel ye in your strength O spells more sure than e er Judaean king Taught in the gardens of Gethsemane O charms more potent than the rapt Chaldee Ever drew down from out the quiet stars Here where a hero fell a column falls Here where the mimic eagle glared in gold A midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat Here where the dames of Rome their gilded hair Waved to the wind now wave the reed and thistle Here where on golden throne the monarch lolled Glides spectre like unto his marble home Lit by the wanlight wan light of the horned moon The swift and silent lizard of the stones But stay these walls these ivy clad arcades These mouldering plinths these sad and blackened shafts These vague entablatures this crumbling frieze These shattered cornices this wreck this ruin These stones alas these gray stones are they all All of the famed and the colossal left By the corrosive Hours to Fate and me Not all the Echoes answer me not all Prophetic sounds and loud arise forever From us and from all Ruin unto the wise As melody from Memnon to the Sun We rule the hearts of mightiest men we rule With a despotic sway all giant minds We are not impotent we pallid stones Not all our power is gone not all our fame Not all the magic of our high renown Not all the wonder that encircles us Not all the mysteries that in us lie Not all the memories that hang upon And cling around about us as a garment Clothing us in a robe of more than glory eighteen thirty three THE HAUNTED PALACE IN the greenest of our valleys By good angels tenanted Once a fair and stately palace Radiant palace reared its head In the monarch Thought s dominion It stood there Never seraph spread a pinion Over fabric half so fair Banners yellow glorious golden On its roof did float and flow This all this was in the olden Time long ago And every gentle air that dallied In that sweet day Along the ramparts plumed and pallid A winged odour went away Wanderers in that happy valley Through two luminous windows saw Spirits moving musically To a lute s well tuned law Round about a throne where sitting Porphyrogene In state his glory well befitting The ruler of the realm was seen And all with pearl and ruby glowing Was the fair palace door Through which came flowing flowing flowing And sparkling evermore A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty Was but to sing In voices of surpassing beauty The wit and wisdom of their king But evil things in robes of sorrow Assailed the monarch s high estate Ah let us mourn for never sorrow Shall dawn upon him desolate And round about his home the glory That blushed and bloomed Is but a dim remembered story Of the old time entombed And travellers now within that valley Through the red litten windows see Vast forms that move fantastically To a discordant melody While lie a ghastly rapid river Through the pale door A hideous throng rush out forever And laugh but smile no more eighteen thirty eight THE CONQUEROR WORM LO tis a gala night Within the lonesome latter years An angel throng bewinged bedight In veils and drowned in tears Sit in a theatre to see A play of hopes and fears While the orchestra breathes fitfully The music of the spheres Mimes in the form of God on high Mutter and mumble low And hither and thither fly Mere puppets they who come and go At bidding of vast formless things That shift the scenery to and fro Flapping from out their Condor wings Invisible Wo That motley drama oh be sure It shall not be forgot With its Phantom chased for evermore By a crowd that seize it not Through a circle that ever returneth in To the self same spot And much of Madness and more of Sin And Horror the soul of the plot But see amid the mimic rout A crawling shape intrude A blood red thing that writhes from out The scenic solitude It writhes it writhes with mortal pangs The mimes become its food And the angels sob at vermin fangs In human gore imbued Out out are the lights out all And over each quivering form The curtain a funeral pall Comes down with the rush of a storm And the angels all pallid and wan Uprising unveiling affirm That the play is the tragedy Man And its hero the Conqueror Worm eighteen thirty eight SILENCE THERE are some qualities some incorporate things That have a double life which thus is made A type of that twin entity which springs From matter and light evinced in solid and shade There is a two fold Silence sea and shore Body and soul One dwells in lonely places Newly with grass o ergrown some solemn graces Some human memories and tearful lore Render him terrorless his name s No More He is the corporate Silence dread him not No power hath he of evil in himself But should some urgent fate untimely lot Bring thee to meet his shadow nameless elf That haunteth the lone regions where hath trod No foot of man commend thyself to God eighteen forty DREAM LAND BY a route obscure and lonely Haunted by ill angels only Where an Eidolon named NIGHT On a black throne reigns upright I have reached these lands but newly From an ultimate dim Thule From a wild weird clime that lieth sublime Out of SPACE out of TIME Bottomless vales and boundless floods And chasms and caves and Titian woods With forms that no man can discover For the dews that drip all over Mountains toppling evermore Into seas without a shore Seas that restlessly aspire Surging unto skies of fire Lakes that endlessly outspread Their lone waters lone and dead Their still waters still and chilly With the snows of the lolling lily By the lakes that thus outspread Their lone waters lone and dead Their sad waters sad and chilly With the snows of the lolling lily By the mountains near the river Murmuring lowly murmuring ever By the grey woods by the swamp Where the toad and the newt encamp By the dismal tarns and pools Where dwell the Ghouls By each spot the most unholy In each nook most melancholy There the traveller meets aghast Sheeted Memories of the Past Shrouded forms that start and sigh As they pass the wanderer by White robed forms of friends long given In agony to the Earth and Heaven For the heart whose woes are legion Tis a peaceful soothing region For the spirit that walks in shadow Tis oh tis an Eldorado But the traveller travelling through it May not dare not openly view it Never its mysteries are exposed To the weak human eye unclosed So wills its King who hath forbid The uplifting of the fringed lid And thus the sad Soul that here passes Beholds it but through darkened glasses By a route obscure and lonely Haunted by ill angels only Where an Eidolon named NIGHT On a black throne reigns upright I have wandered home but newly From this ultimate dim Thule eighteen forty four HYMN AT morn at noon at twilight dim Maria thou hast heard my hymn In joy and wo in good and ill Mother of God be with me still When the Hours flew brightly by And not a cloud obscured the sky My soul lest it should truant be Thy grace did guide to thine and thee Now when storms of Fate o ercast Darkly my Present and my Past Let my Future radiant shine With sweet hopes of thee and thine eighteen thirty five TO ZANTE FAIR isle that from the fairest of all flowers Thy gentlest of all gentle names dost take How many memories of what radiant hours At sight of thee and thine at once awake How many scenes of what departed bliss How many thoughts of what entombed hopes How many visions of a maiden that is No more no more upon thy verdant slopes No more alas that magical sad sound Transfomring all Thy charms shall please no more Thy memory no more Accursed ground Henceforth I hold thy flower enamelled shore O hyacinthine isle O purple Zante Isoa d oro Fior di Levante eighteen thirty seven SCENES FROM POLITIAN AN UNPUBLISHED DRAMA I ROME A Hall in a Palace Alessandra and Castiglione Alessandra Thou art sad Castiglione

And lovest thou me Lal Hist hush within the gloom Of yonder trees methought a figure passed A spectral figure solemn and slow and noiseless Like the grim shadow Conscience solemn and noiseless walks across and returns I was mistaken twas but a giant bough Stirred by the autumn wind Politian Pol My Lalage my love why art thou moved Why dost thou turn so pale Not Conscience self Far less a shadow which thou likenest to it Should shake the firm spirit thus But the night wind Is chilly and these melancholy boughs Throw over all things a gloom Lal Politian Thou speakest to me of love Knowest thou the land With which all tongues are busy a land new found Miraculously found by one of Genoa A thousand leagues within the golden west A fairy land of flowers and fruit and sunshine And crystal lakes and over arching forests And mountains around whose towering summits the winds Of Heaven untrammelled flow which air to breathe Is Happiness now and will be Freedom hereafter In days that are to come

Baldazzar That knowing no cause of quarrel or of feud Between the Earl Politian and himself He doth decline your cartel Pol What didst thou say What answer was it you brought me good Baldazzar With what excessive fragrance the zephyr comes Laden from yonder bowers a fairer day Or one more worthy Italy methinks No mortal eyes have seen what said the Count Bal That he Castiglione not being aware Of any feud existing or any cause Of quarrel between your lordship and himself Cannot accept the challenge Pol It is most true All this is very true When saw you sir When saw you now Baldazzar in the frigid Ungenial Britain which we left so lately A heaven so calm as this so utterly free From the evil taint of clouds and he did say Bal No more my lord than I have told you sir The Count Castiglione will not fight Having no cause for quarrel Pol Now this is true All very true Thou art my friend Baldazzar And I have not forgotten it thou lieutenant do me A piece of service wilt thou go back and say Unto this man that I the Earl of Leicester Hold him a villain thus much I prythee say Unto the Count it is exceeding just He should have cause for quarrel Bal My lord my friend Pol aside Tis he he comes himself aloud Thou reasonest well I know what thou wouldst say not send the message Well I will think of it I will not send it Now prythee leave me hither doth come a person With whom affairs of a most private nature I would adjust Bal I go to morrow we meet Do we not at the Vatican Pol At the Vatican exit Bal Enter Castigilone Cas The Earl of Leicester here Pol I am the Earl of Leicester and thou seest Dost thou not that I am here Cas My lord some strange Some singular mistake misunderstanding Hath without doubt arisen thou hast been urged Thereby in heat of anger to address Some words most unaccountable in writing To me Castiglione the bearer being Baldazzar Duke of Surrey I am aware Of nothing which might warrant thee in this thing Having given thee no offence Ha am I right Twas a mistake undoubtedly we all Do err at times Pol Draw villain and prate no more Cas Ha draw and villain have at thee then at once Proud Earl draws Pol drawing Thus to the expiatory tomb Untimely sepulchre I do devote thee In the name of Lalage Cas letting fall his sword and recoiling to the extremity of the stage Of Lalage Hold off thy sacred hand avaunt I say Avaunt I will not fight thee indeed I dare not Pol Thou wilt not fight with me didst say Sir Count Shall I be baffled thus now this is well Didst say thou darest not Ha Cas I dare not dare not Hold off thy hand with that beloved name So fresh upon thy lips I will not fight thee I cannot dare not Pol Now by my halidom I do believe thee coward I do believe thee Cas Ha coward this may not be clutches his sword and staggers towards POLITIAN but his purpose is changed before reaching him and he falls upon his knee at the feet of the Earl Alas my lord It is it is most true In such a cause I am the veriest coward O pity me Pol greatly softened Alas I do indeed I pity thee Cas And Lalage Pol Scoundrel arise and die Cas It needeth not be thus thus O let me die Thus on my bended knee It were most fitting That in this deep humiliation I perish For in the fight I will not raise a hand Against thee Earl of Leicester Strike thou home baring his bosom Here is no let or hindrance to thy weapon Strike home I will not fight thee Pol Now s Death and Hell Am I not am I not sorely grievously tempted To take thee at thy word But mark me sir Think not to fly me thus Do thou prepare For public insult in the streets before The eyes of the citizens I ll follow thee Like an avenging spirit I ll follow thee Even unto death Before those whom thou lovest Before all Rome I ll taunt thee villain I ll taunt thee Dost hear with cowardice thou wilt not fight me Thou liest thou shalt exit Cas Now this indeed is just Most righteous and most just avenging Heaven NOTE twenty nine Such portions of Politian as are known to the public first saw the light of publicity in the Southern Literary Messenger for December eighteen thirty five and January eighteen thirty six being styled Scenes from Politian an unpublished drama These scenes were included unaltered in the eighteen forty five collection of Poems by Poe The larger portion of the original draft subsequently became the property of the present editor but it is not considered just to the poet s memory to publish it The work is a hasty and unrevised production of its author s earlier days of literary labor and beyond the scenes already known scarcely calculated to enhance his reputation As a specimen however of the parts unpublished the following fragment from the first scene of Act II may be offered The Duke it should be premised is uncle to Alessandra and father of Castiglione her betrothed Duke Why do you laugh Castiglione Indeed I hardly know myself Stay Was it not On yesterday we were speaking of the Earl Of the Earl Politian Yes it was yesterday Alessandra you and one you must remember We were walking in the garden Duke Perfectly I do remember it what of it what then Cas zero nothing nothing at all Duke Nothing at all It is most singular that you should laugh At nothing at all Cas Most singular singular Duke Look you Castiglione be so kind As tell me sir at once what tis you mean What are you talking of Cas Was it not so We differed in opinion touching him Duke Him Whom Cas Why sir the Earl Politian Duke The Earl of Leicester Yes is it he you mean We differed indeed If I now recollect The words you used were that the Earl you knew Was neither learned nor mirthful Cas Ha ha now did I Duke That did you sir and well I knew at the time You were wrong it being not the character Of the Earl whom all the world allows to be A most hilarious man Be not my son Too positive again Cas Tis singular Most singular I could not think it possible So little time could so much alter one To say the truth about an hour ago As I was walking with the Count San Ozzo All arm in arm we met this very man The Earl he with his friend Baldazzar Having just arrived in Rome Hal ha he is altered Such an account he gave me of his journey Twould have made you die with laughter such tales he told Of his caprices and his merry freaks Along the road such oddity such humor Such wit such whim such flashes of wild merriment Set off too in such full relief by the grave Demeanor of his friend who to speak the truth Was gravity itself Duke Did I not tell you Cas You did and yet tis strange but true as strange How much I was mistaken I always thought The Earl a gloomy man Duke So so you see Be not too positive Whom have we here It can not be the Earl Cas The Earl Oh no Tis not the Earl but yet it is and leaning Upon his friend Baldazzar AM welcome sir Enter Politian and Baldazzar My lord a second welcome let me give you To Rome his Grace the Duke of Broglio Father this is the Earl Politian Earl Of Leicester in Great Britain Politian bows haughtily That his friend Baldazzar Duke of Surrey The Earl has letters So please you for Your Grace Duke Hal ha Most welcome To Rome and to our palace Earl Politian And you most noble Duke I am glad to see you I knew your father well my Lord Politian Castiglione call your cousin hither And let me make the noble Earl acquainted With your betrothed You come sir at a time Most seasonable The wedding Politian Touching those letters sir Your son made mention of your son is he not Touching those letters sir I wot not of them If such there be my friend Baldazzar here Baldazzar ah my friend Baldazzar here Will hand them to Your Grace I would retire Duke Retire So soon Came What ho Benito Rupert His lordship s chambers show his lordship to them His lordship is unwell Enter Benito Ben This way my lord Exit followed by Politian Duke Retire Unwell Bal So please you sir I fear me Tis as you say his lordship is unwell The damp air of the evening the fatigue Of a long journey the indeed I had better Follow his lordship He must be unwell I will return anon Duke Return anon Now this is very strange Castiglione This way my son I wish to speak with thee You surely were mistaken in what you

8459_285173_000000_000000	train-clean-360	 DEAR B 
8459_285173_000000_000001	train-clean-360	Believing only a portion of my former volume to be worthy a second edition that small portion I thought it as well to include in the present book as to republish by itself 
8459_285173_000000_000002	train-clean-360	I have therefore herein combined Al Aaraaf and Tamerlane with other poems hitherto unprinted 
none	none	Nor have I hesitated to insert from the Minor Poems now omitted whole lines and even passages to the end that being placed in a fairer light and the trash shaken from them in which they were imbedded they may have some chance of being seen by posterity
8459_285173_000001_000000	train-clean-360	 It has been said that a good critique on a poem may be written by one who is no poet himself 
none	none	This according to your idea and mine of poetry I feel to be false the less poetical the critic the less just the critique and the converse 
8459_285173_000001_000002	train-clean-360	On this account and because there are but few B s in the world I would be as much ashamed of the world s good opinion as proud of your own 
8459_285173_000001_000003	train-clean-360	Another than yourself might here observe Shakespeare is in possession of the world s good opinion and yet Shakespeare is the greatest of poets 
none	none	It appears then that the world judge correctly why should you be ashamed of their favorable judgment The difficulty lies in the interpretation of the word judgment or opinion The opinion is the world s truly but it may be called theirs as a man would call a book his having bought it he did not write the book but it is his they did not originate the opinion but it is theirs 
8459_285173_000001_000005	train-clean-360	A fool for example thinks Shakespeare a great poet yet the fool has never read Shakespeare 
none	none	But the fool s neighbor who is a step higher on the Andes of the mind whose head that is to say his more exalted thought is too far above the fool to be seen or understood but whose feet by which I mean his everyday actions are sufficiently near to be discerned and by means of which that superiority is ascertained which but for them would never have been discovered this neighbor asserts that Shakespeare is a great poet the fool believes him and it is henceforward his opinion This neighbor s own opinion has in like manner been adopted from one above him and so ascendingly to a few gifted individuals who kneel around the summit beholding face to face the master spirit who stands upon the pinnacle
8459_285173_000002_000000	train-clean-360	 You are aware of the great barrier in the path of an American writer He is read if at all in preference to the combined and established wit of the world 
none	none	I say established for it is with literature as with law or empire an established name is an estate in tenure or a throne in possession 
8459_285173_000002_000002	train-clean-360	Besides one might suppose that books like their authors improve by travel their having crossed the sea is with us so great a distinction 
8459_285173_000002_000003	train-clean-360	Our antiquaries abandon time for distance our very fops glance from the binding to the bottom of the title page where the mystic characters which spell London Paris or Genoa are precisely so many letters of recommendation 
none	none	I mentioned just now a vulgar error as regards criticism 
8459_285173_000003_000001	train-clean-360	I think the notion that no poet can form a correct estimate of his own writings is another 
8459_285173_000003_000002	train-clean-360	I remarked before that in proportion to the poetical talent would be the justice of a critique upon poetry 
none	none	Therefore a bad poet would I grant make a false critique and his self love would infallibly bias his little judgment in his favor but a poet who is indeed a poet could not I think fail of making a just critique whatever should be deducted on the score of self love might be replaced on account of his intimate acquaintance with the subject in short we have more instances of false criticism than of just where one s own writings are the test simply because we have more bad poets than good There are of course many objections to what I say Milton is a great example of the contrary but his opinion with respect to the Paradise Regained is by no means fairly ascertained By what trivial circumstances men are often led to assert what they do not really believe 
8459_285173_000003_000005	train-clean-360	Perhaps an inadvertent word has descended to posterity 
8459_285173_000003_000006	train-clean-360	But in fact the Paradise Regained is little if at all inferior to the Paradise Lost and is only supposed so to be because men do not like epics whatever they may say to the contrary and reading those of Milton in their natural order are too much wearied with the first to derive any pleasure from the second 
8459_285173_000004_000000	train-clean-360	 I dare say Milton preferred Comus to either if so justly 
8459_285173_000005_000000	train-clean-360	 As I am speaking of poetry it will not be amiss to touch slightly upon the most singular heresy in its modern history the heresy of what is called very foolishly the Lake School 
8459_285173_000005_000001	train-clean-360	Some years ago I might have been induced by an occasion like the present to attempt a formal refutation of their doctrine at present it would be a work of supererogation 
none	none	The wise must bow to the wisdom of such men as Coleridge and Southey but being wise have laughed at poetical theories so prosaically exemplifled Aristotle with singular assurance has declared poetry the most philosophical of all writings but it required a Wordsworth to pronounce it the most metaphysical He seems to think that the end of poetry is or should be instruction yet it is a truism that the end of our existence is happiness if so the end of every separate part of our existence everything connected with our existence should be still happiness 
8459_285173_000006_000002	train-clean-360	Therefore the end of instruction should be happiness and happiness is another name for pleasure therefore the end of instruction should be pleasure yet we see the above mentioned opinion implies precisely the reverse 
none	none	To proceed ceteris paribus he who pleases is of more importance to his fellow men than he who instructs since utility is happiness and pleasure is the end already obtained which instruction is merely the means of obtaining I see no reason then why our metaphysical poets should plume themselves so much on the utility of their works unless indeed they refer to instruction with eternity in view in which case sincere respect for their piety would not allow me to express my contempt for their judgment contempt which it would be difficult to conceal since their writings are professedly to be understood by the few and it is the many who stand in need of salvation 
8459_285173_000008_000001	train-clean-360	In such case I should no doubt be tempted to think of the devil in Melmoth who labors indefatigably through three octavo volumes to accomplish the destruction of one or two souls while any common devil would have demolished one or two thousand 
8459_285173_000009_000000	train-clean-360	 Against the subtleties which would make poetry a study not a passion it becomes the metaphysician to reason but the poet to protest Yet Wordsworth and Coleridge are men in years the one imbued in contemplation from his childhood the other a giant in intellect and learning 
8459_285173_000009_000001	train-clean-360	The diffidence then with which I venture to dispute their authority would be overwhelming did I not feel from the bottom of my heart that learning has little to do with the imagination intellect with the passions or age with poetry 
8459_285173_000010_000000	train-clean-360	 Trifles like straws upon the surface flow He who would search for pearls must dive below 
none	none	are lines which have done much mischief 
8459_285173_000011_000001	train-clean-360	As regards the greater truths men oftener err by seeking them at the bottom than at the top Truth lies in the huge abysses where wisdom is sought not in the palpable palaces where she is found 
none	none	The ancients were not always right in hiding the goddess in a well witness the light which Bacon has thrown upon philosophy witness the principles of our divine faith that moral mechanism by which the simplicity of a child may overbalance the wisdom of a man We see an instance of Coleridge s liability to err in his Biographia Literaria professedly his literary life and opinions but in fact a treatise de omni scibili et quibusdam aliis He goes wrong by reason of his very profundity and of his error we have a natural type in the contemplation of a star 
8459_285173_000012_000002	train-clean-360	He who regards it directly and intensely sees it is true the star but it is the star without a ray while he who surveys it less inquisitively is conscious of all for which the star is useful to us below its brilliancy and its beauty 
8459_285173_000013_000000	train-clean-360	 As to Wordsworth I have no faith in him 
none	none	That he had in youth the feelings of a poet I believe for there are glimpses of extreme delicacy in his writings and delicacy is the poet s own kingdom his El Dorado but they have the appearance of a better day recollected and glimpses at best are little evidence of present poetic fire we know that a few straggling flowers spring up daily in the crevices of the glacier
8459_285173_000014_000000	train-clean-360	 He was to blame in wearing away his youth in contemplation with the end of poetizing in his manhood 
8459_285173_000014_000001	train-clean-360	With the increase of his judgment the light which should make it apparent has faded away 
8459_285173_000014_000002	train-clean-360	His judgment consequently is too correct 
8459_285173_000014_000003	train-clean-360	This may not be understood but the old Goths of Germany would have understood it who used to debate matters of importance to their State twice once when drunk and once when sober sober that they might not be deficient in formality drunk lest they should be destitute of vigor 
none	none	The long wordy discussions by which he tries to reason us into admiration of his poetry speak very little in his favor they are full of such assertions as this I have opened one of his volumes at random Of genius the only proof is the act of doing well what is worthy to be done and what was never done before indeed then it follows that in doing what is unworthy to be done or what has been done before no genius can be evinced yet the picking of pockets is an unworthy act pockets have been picked time immemorial and Barrington the pickpocket in point of genius would have thought hard of a comparison with William Wordsworth the poet
8459_285173_000016_000000	train-clean-360	 Again in estimating the merit of certain poems whether they be Ossian s or Macpherson s can surely be of little consequence yet in order to prove their worthlessness mister W has expended many pages in the controversy 
none	none	Tantaene animis Can great minds descend to such absurdity 
8459_285173_000016_000003	train-clean-360	But worse still that he may bear down every argument in favor of these poems he triumphantly drags forward a passage in his abomination with which he expects the reader to sympathize 
none	none	It is the beginning of the epic poem Temora The blue waves of Ullin roll in light the green hills are covered with day trees shake their dusty heads in the breeze And this this gorgeous yet simple imagery where all is alive and panting with immortality this William Wordsworth the author of Peter Bell has selected for his contempt 
8459_285173_000016_000005	train-clean-360	We shall see what better he in his own person has to offer 
8459_285173_000016_000006	train-clean-360	Imprimis 
none	none	And now she s at the pony s tail And now she s at the pony s head On that side now and now on this And almost stifled with her bliss 
8459_285173_000018_000000	train-clean-360	A few sad tears does Betty shed She pats the pony where or when She knows not happy Betty Foy Oh Johnny never mind the doctor 
none	none	Secondly The dew was falling fast the stars began to blink I heard a voice it said Drink pretty creature drink And looking o er the hedge be fore me I espied A snow white mountain lamb with a maiden at its side No other sheep was near the lamb was all alone And by a slender cord was tether d to a stone
8459_285173_000021_000000	train-clean-360	 Now we have no doubt this is all true we will believe it indeed we will mister W Is it sympathy for the sheep you wish to excite 
8459_285173_000021_000001	train-clean-360	I love a sheep from the bottom of my heart 
8459_285173_000022_000000	train-clean-360	 But there are occasions dear B there are occasions when even Wordsworth is reasonable 
8459_285173_000022_000001	train-clean-360	Even Stamboul it is said shall have an end and the most unlucky blunders must come to a conclusion 
8459_285173_000022_000002	train-clean-360	Here is an extract from his preface 
none	none	Those who have been accustomed to the phraseology of modem writers if they persist in reading this book to a conclusion impossible will no doubt have to struggle with feelings of awkwardness ha ha ha they will look round for poetry ha ha ha ha and will be induced to inquire by what species of courtesy these attempts have been permitted to assume that title Ha ha ha ha ha
8459_285173_000024_000000	train-clean-360	 Yet let not mister W despair he has given immortality to a wagon and the bee Sophocles has transmitted to eternity a sore toe and dignified a tragedy with a chorus of turkeys 
8459_285173_000025_000000	train-clean-360	 Of Coleridge I can not speak but with reverence 
8459_285173_000025_000001	train-clean-360	His towering intellect his gigantic power 
none	none	To use an author quoted by himself Tai trouve souvent que la plupart des sectes ont raison dans une bonne partie de ce qu elles avancent mais non pas en ce qu elles nient and to employ his own language he has imprisoned his own conceptions by the barrier he has erected against those of others It is lamentable to think that such a mind should be buried in metaphysics and like the Nyctanthes waste its perfume upon the night alone In reading that man s poetry I tremble like one who stands upon a volcano conscious from the very darkness bursting from the crater of the fire and the light that are weltering below What is poetry Poetry that Proteus like idea with as many appellations as the nine titled Corcyra Give me I demanded of a scholar some time ago give me a definition of poetry Tresvolontiers and he proceeded to his library brought me a doctor Johnson and overwhelmed me with a definition 
8459_285173_000026_000001	train-clean-360	Shade of the immortal Shakespeare 
8459_285173_000026_000002	train-clean-360	I imagine to myself the scowl of your spiritual eye upon the profanity of that scurrilous Ursa Major 
8459_285173_000026_000003	train-clean-360	Think of poetry dear B think of poetry and then think of doctor Samuel Johnson 
8459_285173_000026_000004	train-clean-360	Think of all that is airy and fairy like and then of all that is hideous and unwieldy think of his huge bulk the Elephant and then and then think of the Tempest the Midsummer Night s Dream Prospero Oberon and Titania 
none	none	A poem in my opinion is opposed to a work of science by having for its immediate object pleasure not truth to romance by having for its object an indefinite instead of a definite pleasure being a poem only so far as this object is attained romance presenting perceptible images with definite poetry with indefinite sensations to which end music is an essential since the comprehension of sweet sound is our most indefinite conception Music when combined with a pleasurable idea is poetry music without the idea is simply music the idea wi thout the music is prose from its very definitiveness What was meant by the invective against him who had no music in his soul
8459_285173_000029_000000	train-clean-360	 To sum up this long rigmarole I have dear B what you no doubt perceive for the metaphysical poets as poets the most sovereign contempt 
8459_285173_000029_000001	train-clean-360	That they have followers proves nothing 
none	none	No Indian prince has to his palace More followers than a thief to the gallows SONNET TO SCIENCE SCIENCE true daughter of Old Time thou art Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes Why preyest thou thus upon the poet s heart Vulture whose wings are dull realities How should he love thee or how deem thee wise Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car And driven the Hamadryad from the wood To seek a shelter in some happier star Hast thous not torn the Naiad from her flood The Elfin from the green grass and from me The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree AL AARAAF PART I O NOTHING earthly save the ray Thrown back from flowers of Beauty s eye As in those gardens where the day Springs from the gems of Circassy O nothing earthly save the thrill Of melody in woodland rill Or music of the passion hearted Joy s voice so peacefully departed That like the murmur in the shell Its echo dwelleth and will dwell Oh nothing of the dross of ours Yet all the beauty all the flowers That list our Love and deck our bowers Adorn yon world afar afar The wandering star Twas a sweet time for Nesace for there Her world lay lolling on the golden air Near four bright suns a temporary rest An oasis in desert of the blest A star was discovered by Tycho Brahe which appeared suddenly in the heavens attained in a few days a brilliancy surpassing that of Jupiter then as suddenly disappeared and has never been seen since Away away mid seas of rays that roll Empyrean splendor o er th unchained soul The soul that scarce the billows are so dense Can struggle to its destin d eminence To distant spheres from time to time she rode And late to ours the favour d one of God But now the ruler of an anchor d realm She throws aside the sceptre leaves the helm And amid incense and high spiritual hymns Laves in quadruple light her angel limbs Now happiest loveliest in yon lovely Earth Whence sprang the Idea of Beauty into birth Falling in wreaths thro many a startled star Like woman s hair mid pearls until afar It lit on hills Achaian and there dwelt She look d into Infinity and knelt Rich clouds for canopies about her curled Fit emblems of the model of her world Seen but in beauty not impeding sight Of other beauty glittering thro the light A wreath that twined each starry form around And all the opal d air in color bound All hurriedly she knelt upon a bed Of flowers of lilies such as rear d the head On the fair Capo Deucato and sprang So eagerly around about to hang Upon the flying footsteps of deep pride Of her who lov d a mortal and so died The Sephalica budding with young bees Uprear d its purple stem around her knees On Santa Maura olim Deucadia And gemmy flower of Trebizond misnam d Inmate of highest stars where erst it sham d All other loveliness its honied dew The fabled nectar that the heathen knew Deliriously sweet was dropp d from Heaven And fell on gardens of the unforgiven In Trebizond and on a sunny flower So like its own above that to this hour It still remaineth torturing the bee With madness and unwonted reverie In Heaven and all its environs the leaf And blossom of the fairy plant in grief Disconsolate linger grief that hangs her head Repenting follies that full long have fled Heaving her white breast to the balmy air Like guilty beauty chasten d and more fair Nyctanthes too as sacred as the light She fears to perfume perfuming the night And Clytia pondering between many a sun While pettish tears adown her petals run And that aspiring flower that sprang on Earth And died ere scarce exalted into birth Bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing Its way to Heaven from garden of a king This flower is much noticed by Lewenhoeck and Tournefort The bee feeding upon its blossom becomes intoxicated Clytia The Chrysanthemum Peruvianum or to employ a better known term the turnsol which continually turns towards the sun covers itself like Peru the country from which it comes with dewy clouds which cool and refresh its flowers during the most violent heat of the day B de saint Pierre There is cultivated in the king s garden at Paris a species of serpentine aloes without prickles whose large and beautiful flower exhales a strong odour of the vanilla during the time of its expansion which is very short It does not blow till towards the month of July you then perceive it gradually open its petals expand them fade and die St Pierre And Valisnerian lotus thither flown From struggling with the waters of the Rhone And thy most lovely purple perfume Zante Isola d oro Fior di Levante And the Nelumbo bud that floats for ever With Indian Cupid down the holy river Fair flowers and fairy to whose care is given To bear the Goddess song in odors up to Heaven Spirit that dwellest where In the deep sky The terrible and fair In beauty vie Beyond the line of blue The boundary of

for the dead and which in some minds resembles the delirium of opium The passionate excitement of Love and the buoyancy of spirit attendant upon intoxication are its less holy pleasures the price of which to those souls who make choice of Al Aaraaf as their residence after life is final death and annihilation What guilty spirit in what shrubbery dim Heard not the stirring summons of that hymn But

Time my wing did disenthral Thence sprang I as the eagle from his tower And years I left behind me in an hour What time upon her airy bounds I hung One half the garden of her globe was flung Unrolling

downward tremulous motion thro Light brazen rays this golden star unto Nor long the measure of my falling hours For nearest of all stars was thine to ours Dread star that came amid a night of mirth A red Daedalion on the timid Earth We came and to thy Earth but not to us Be given our lady s bidding to discuss We came my love around above below Gay fire fly of the night we come and go Nor ask a

They had gone unto the wars Trusting to the mild eyed stars Nightly from their azure towers To keep watch above the flowers In the midst of which all day The red sun light lazily lay Now each visiter shall confess The sad valley s restlessness Nothing there is motionless Nothing save the airs that brood Over the magic solitude Ah by no wind are stirred those trees That palpitate like the chill seas Around the misty Hebrides Ah by no wind those clouds are driven That rustle through the unquiet Heaven Uneasily from morn till even Over the violets there that lie In myriad types of the human eye Over the lilies there that wave And weep above a nameless grave They wave from out their fragrant tops Eternal dews come down in drops They weep from off their delicate stems Perennial tears descend in gems eighteen thirty one ISRAFEL IN Heaven a spirit doth dwell Whose heart strings are a lute None sing so wildly well As the angel Israfel And the giddy stars so legends tell Ceasing their

in Heaven And they say the starry choir And all the listening things That Israfeli s fire Is owing to that lyre By which he sits and sings The trembling living wire Of those unusual strings And the angel Israfel whose heart strings are a lut and who has the sweetest voice of all God s creatures KORAN But the skies that angel trod Where deep thoughts are a duty Where Love s a grown up God Where the Houri glances are Imbued with all the beauty Which we worship in a star Therefore thou art not wrong Israfeli who despisest An unimpassion d song To thee the laurels belong Best bard because the wisest Merrily live and long The extacies above With thy burning measures suit Thy grief thy joy thy hate thy love With the fervor of thy lute Well may the stars be mute Yes Heaven is thine but this Is a world of sweets and sours Our flowers are merely flowers And the shadow of thy perfect bliss Is the sunshine of ours If I could dwell Where Israfel Hath dwelt and he where I He might not sing so

clear flow Of crystal wandering water Thou art an emblem of the glow Of beauty the unhidden heart The playful maziness of art In old Alberto s daughter But when within thy wave she looks Which

not down From their high thrones in the Heaven With light like Hope to mortals given But their red orbs without beam To thy weariness shall seem As a burning and a fever Which would cling to thee for ever four Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish Now are visions ne er to vanish From thy spirit shall they pass No more like dew drop from the grass five The breeze the breath of God is still And the mist upon the hill Shadowy shadowy yet unbroken Is a symbol and a token How it hangs upon the trees A mystery of mysteries eighteen twenty seven A DREAM In visions of the dark night I have dreamed of joy departed But a waking dreams of life and light Hath left me broken hearted Ah what is not a dream by day To him whose eyes are cast On things around him with a ray Turned back upon the past That holy dream that holy dream While all the world were chiding Hath cheered me as a lovely beam A lonely spirit guiding What though that light thro storm and night So trembled from afar What could there be more purely bright In Truths day star eighteen twenty seven ROMANCE ROMANCE who loves to nod and sing With drowsy head and folded wing Among the green leaves as they shake Far down within some shadowy lake To me a painted paroquet Hath been a most familiar bird Taught me my alphabet to say To lisp my very earliest word While in the wild wood I did lie A child with a most knowing eye Of late eternal Condor years So shake the very Heaven on high With tumult as they thunder by I have no time for idle cares Through gazing on the unquiet sky And when an hour with calmer wings Its down upon thy spirit flings That little time with lyre and rhyme To while away forbidden things My heart would feel to be a crime Unless it trembled with the strings eighteen twenty nine FAIRY LAND DIM vales

places And they put out the star light With the breath from their pale faces About twelve by the moon dial One more filmy than the rest A kind which upon trial They have found to be the best Comes down still down and down With its centre on the crown Of a mountain s eminence While its wide circumference In easy drapery falls Over hamlets over halls Wherever they may be O er the strange woods o er the sea Over spirits on the wing Over every drowsy thing And buries them up quite In a labyrinth of light And then how deep O deep Is the passion of their sleep In the morning they arise And their moony covering Is soaring in the skies With the tempests as they toss Like almost any thing Or a yellow Albatross They use that moon no more For the same end as before Videlicet a tent Which I think extravagant Its atomies however Into a shower dissever Of which those butterflies Of Earth who seek the skies And so come down again Never contented things Have brought a specimen Upon their quivering wings eighteen thirty one THE LAKE TO IN spring of youth it was my lot To haunt of the wide earth a spot The which I could not love the less So lovely was the loneliness Of a wild lake with black rock bound And the tall pines that tower d around But when the Night had thrown her pall Upon that spot as upon all And the mystic wind went by Murmuring in melody Then ah then I would awake To the terror of the lone lake Yet that terror was not fright But a tremulous delight A feeling not the jewelled mine Could teach or bribe me to define Nor Love although the Love were thine Death was in that poisonous wave And in its gulf a fitting grave For him who thence could solace bring To his lone imagining Whose solitary soul could make An Eden of that dim lake eighteen twenty seven EVENING STAR TWAS noontide of summer And midtime of night And stars in their orbits Shone pale through the light Of the brighter cold moon Mid planets her slaves Herself in the Heavens Her beam on the waves I gazed awhile On her cold smile Too cold too cold for me There passed as a shroud A fleecy cloud And I turned away to thee Proud Evening Star In thy glory afar And dearer thy beam shall be For joy to my heart Is the proud part Thou bearest in Heaven at night And more I admire Thy distant fire Than that colder lowly light eighteen twenty seven THE HAPPIEST DAY I THE happiest day the happiest hour My seared and blighted heart hath known The highest hope of pride and power I feel hath flown Of power said I Yes such I ween But they have vanished long alas The visions of my youth have been But let them pass III And pride what have I now with thee Another brow may ev n inherit The venom thou hast poured on me Be still my spirit IV The happiest day the happiest hour Mine eyes shall see have ever seen The brightest glance of pride and power I feet have been V But were that hope of pride and power Now offered with the pain Ev n then I felt that brightest hour I would not live again VI For on its wing was dark alloy And as it fluttered fell An essence powerful to destroy A soul that knew it well eighteen twenty seven IMITATION A dark unfathom d tide Of interminable pride A mystery and a dream Should my early life seem I say that dream was fraught With a wild and waking thought Of beings that have been Which my spirit hath not seen Had I let them pass me by With a dreaming eye Let none of earth inherit That vision on my spirit Those thoughts I would control As a spell upon his soul For that bright hope at last And that light time have past And my worldly rest hath gone With a sigh as it pass d on I care not tho it perish With a thought I then did cherish eighteen twenty seven HYMN TO ARISTOGEITON AND HARMODIUS Translation from the Greek I WREATHED in myrtle my sword I ll conceal Like those champions devoted and brave When they plunged in the tyrant their steel And to Athens deliverance gave II Beloved heroes your deathless souls roam In the joy breathing isles of the blest Where the mighty of old have their home Where Achilles and Diomed rest III In fresh myrtle my blade I ll entwine Like Harmodius the gallant and good When he made at the tutelar shrine A libation of Tyranny s blood IV Ye deliverers of Athens from shame Ye avengers of Liberty s wrongs Endless ages shall cherish your fame Embalmed in their echoing songs eighteen twenty seven DREAMS Oh that my young life were a lasting dream My spirit not awak ning till the beam Of an Eternity should bring the morrow Yes tho that long dream were of hopeless sorrow Twere better than the dull reality Of waking life to him whose heart shall be And hath been ever on the chilly earth A chaos of deep passion from his birth But should it be that dream eternally Continuing as dreams have been to me In my young boyhood should it thus be given Twere folly still to hope for higher Heaven For I have revell d when the sun was bright In the summer sky in dreamy fields of light And left unheedingly my very heart In climes of mine imagining apart From mine own home with beings that have been Of mine own thought what more could I have seen Twas once only once the wild hour From my rememberance shall not pass some power Or spell had bound me twas the chilly wind Came o er me in the night left behind Its image on my spirit or the moon Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon Too coldly or the stars howe er it was That dream was as that night wind let it pass I have been happy tho but in a dream I have been happy I love the theme Dreams in their vivid colouring of life As in that fleeting shadowy misty strife Of semblance with reality which brings To the delirious eye more lovely things Of Paradise Love all our own Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known IN YOUTH I HAVE KNOWN ONE How often we forget all time when lone Admiring Nature s universal throne Her woods her wilds her mountains the intense Reply of Hers to Our intelligence I IN youth I have known one with whom the Earth In secret communing held as he with it In daylight and in beauty from his birth Whose fervid flickering torch of life was lit From the sun and stars whence he had drawn forth A passionate light such for his spirit was fit And yet that spirit knew not in the hour Of its own fervor what had o er it power II Perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought To a fever by the moonbeam that hangs o er But I will half believe that wild light fraught With more of sovereignty than ancient lore Hath ever told or is it of a thought The unembodied essence and no more That with a quickening spell doth o er us pass As dew of the night time o er the summer grass III Doth o er us pass when as th expanding eye To the loved object so the tear to the lid Will start which lately slept in apathy And yet it need not be that object hid From us in life but common which doth lie Each hour before us but then only bid With a strange sound as of a harp string broken T awake us Tis a symbol and a token IV Of what in other worlds shall be and given In beauty by our God to those alone Who otherwise would fall from life and Heaven Drawn by their heart s passion and that tone That high tone of the spirit which hath striven Though not with Faith with godliness whose throne With desperate energy t hath beaten down Wearing its own deep feeling as a crown Query fervor ED A PAEAN I How shall the burial rite be read The solemn song be sung The requiem for the loveliest dead That ever died so young II Her friends are gazing on her And on her gaudy bier And weep oh to dishonor Dead beauty with a tear III They loved her for her wealth And they hated her for her pride But she grew in feeble health And they love her that she died IV They tell me while they speak Of her costly broider d pall That my voice is growing weak That I should not sing at all V Or that my tone should be Tun d to such solemn song So mournfully so mournfully That the dead may feel no wrong VI But she is gone above With young Hope at her side And I am drunk with love Of the dead who is my bride VII Of the dead dead who lies All perfum d there With the death upon her eyes And the life upon her hair VIII Thus on the coffin loud and long I strike the murmur sent Through the grey chambers to my song Shall be the accompaniment IX Thou died saint in thy life s June But thou did saint not die too fair Thou did saint not die too soon Nor with too calm an air X From more than fiends on earth Thy life and love are riven To join the untainted mirth Of more than thrones in heaven XII Therefore to thee this night I will no requiem raise But waft thee on thy flight With a Paean of old days NOTES thirty On the Poems written in Youth little comment is needed This section includes the pieces printed for first volume of eighteen twenty seven which was subsequently suppressed such poems from the first and second published volumes of eighteen twenty nine and eighteen thirty one as have not already been given in their revised versions and a few others collected from various sources Al Aaraaf first appeared with the sonnet To Silence prefixed to it in eighteen twenty nine and is substantially as originally issued In the edition for eighteen thirty one however this poem its author s longest was introduced by the following twenty nine lines which have been omitted in all subsequent collections AL AARAAF Mysterious star Thou wert my dream All a long summer night Be now my theme By this clear stream Of thee will I write Meantime from afar Bathe me in light I Thy world has not the dross of ours Yet all the beauty all the flowers That list our love or deck our bowers In dreamy gardens where do lie Dreamy maidens all the day While the silver winds of Circassy On violet couches faint away Little oh little dwells in thee Like unto what on earth we see Beauty s eye is here the bluest In the falsest and untruest On the sweetest air doth float The most sad and solemn note If with thee be broken hearts Joy so peacefully departs That its echo still doth dwell Like the murmur in the shell Thou thy truest type of grief Is the gently falling leaf Thy framing is so holy Sorrow is not melancholy thirty one The earliest version of Tamerlane was included in the suppressed volume of eighteen twenty seven but differs very considerably from the poem as now published The present draft besides innumerable verbal alterations and improvements upon the original is more carefully punctuated and the lines being indented presents a more pleasing appearance to the eye at least thirty two To Helen first appeared in the eighteen thirty one volume as did also The Valley of Unrest as The Valley Nis Israfel and one or two others of the youthful pieces The poem styled Romance constituted the Preface of the eighteen twenty nine volume but with the addition of the following lines Succeeding years too wild for song Then rolled like tropic storms along Where through the garish lights that fly Dying along the troubled sky Lay bare through vistas thunder riven The blackness of the general Heaven That very blackness yet doth Ring Light on the lightning s silver wing For being an idle boy lang syne Who read Anacreon and drank wine I early found Anacreon rhymes Were almost passionate sometimes And by strange alchemy of brain His pleasures always turned to pain His naivete to wild desire His wit to love his wine to fire And so being young and dipt in folly I fell in love with melancholy And used to throw my earthly rest And quiet all away in jest I could not love except where Death Was mingling his with Beauty s breath Or Hymen Time and Destiny Were stalking between her and me But now my soul hath too much room Gone are the glory and the gloom The black hath mellow d into gray And all the fires are fading away My draught of passion hath been deep I revell d and I now would sleep And after drunkenness of soul Succeeds the glories of the bowl An idle longing night and day To dream my very life away But dreams of those who dream as I Aspiringly are damned and die Yet should I swear I mean alone By notes so very shrilly blown To break upon Time s monotone While yet my vapid joy and grief Are tintless of the yellow leaf Why not an imp the graybeard hath Will shake his shadow in my path And e en the graybeard will o erlook Connivingly my dreaming book DOUBTFUL POEMS ALONE From childhood s hour I have not been As others were I have not seen As others saw I could not bring My passions from a common spring From the same source I have not taken My sorrow I could not awaken My heart to joy at the same tone And all I lov d I lov d alone Then in my childhood in the dawn Of a most stormy life was drawn From ev ry depth of good and ill The mystery which binds me still From the torrent or the fountain From the red cliff of the mountain From the sun that round me roll d In its autumn tint of gold From the lightning in the sky As it pass d me flying by From the thunder and the storm And the cloud that took the form When the rest of Heaven was blue Of a demon in my view TO ISADORE I BENEATH the vine clad eaves Whose shadows fall before Thy lowly cottage door Under the lilac s tremulous leaves Within thy snowy claspeed hand The purple flowers it bore Last eve in dreams I saw thee stand Like queenly nymphs from Fairy land Enchantress of the flowery wand Most beauteous Isadore II And when I bade the dream Upon thy spirit flee Thy violet eyes to me Upturned did overflowing seem With the deep untold delight Of Love s serenity Thy classic brow like lilies white And pale as the Imperial Night Upon her throne with stars bedight Enthralled my soul to thee III Ah I ever I behold Thy dreamy passionate eyes Blue as the languid skies Hung with the sunset s fringe of gold Now strangely clear thine image grows And olden memories Are startled from their long repose Like shadows on the silent snows When suddenly the night wind blows Where quiet moonlight ties IV Like music heard in dreams Like strains of harps unknown Of birds forever flown Audible as the voice of streams That murmur in some leafy dell I hear thy gentlest tone And Silence cometh with her spell Like that which on my tongue doth dwell When tremulous in dreams I tell My love to thee alone V In every valley heard Floating from tree to tree Less beautiful to me The music of the radiant bird Than artless accents such as thine Whose echoes never flee Ah how for thy sweet voice I pine For uttered in thy tones benign Enchantress this rude name of mine Doth seem a melody THE VILLAGE STREET IN these rapid restless shadows Once I walked at eventide When a gentle silent maiden Wal ked in beauty at my side She alone there walked beside me All in beauty like a bride Pallidly the moon was shining On the dewy meadows nigh On the silvery silent rivers On the mountains far and high On the ocean s star lit waters Where the winds a weary die Slowly silently we wandered From the open cottage door Underneath the elm s long branches To the pavement bending o er Underneath the mossy willow And the dying sycamore With the myriad stars in beauty All bedight the heavens were seen Radiant hopes were bright around me Like the light of stars serene Like the mellow midnight splendor Of the Night s irradiate queen Audibly the elm leaves whispered Peaceful pleasant melodies Like the distant murmured music Of unquiet lovely seas While the winds were hushed in slumber In the fragrant flowers and trees Wondrous and unwonted beauty Still adorning all did seem While I told my love in fables Neath the willows by the stream Would the heart have kept unspoken Love that was its rarest dream Instantly away we wandered In the shadowy twilight tide She the silent scornful maiden Walking calmly at my side With a step serene and stately All in beauty all in pride Vacantly I walked beside her On the earth mine eyes were cast Swift and keen there came unto me Ritter memories of the past On me like the rain in Autumn On the dead leaves cold and fast Underneath the elms we parted By the lowly cottage door One brief word alone was uttered Never on our lips before And away I walked forlornly Broken hearted evermore Slowly silently I loitered Homeward in the night alone Sudden anguish bound my spirit That my youth had never known Wild unrest like that which cometh When the Night s first dream hath flown Now to me the elm leaves whisper Mad discordant melodies And keen melodies like shadows Haunt the moaning willow trees And the sycamores with laughter Mock me in the nightly breeze Sad and pale the Autumn moonlight Through the sighing foliage streams And each morning midnight shadow Shadow of my sorrow seems Strive zero heart forget thine idol And zero soul forget thy dreams THE FOREST REVERIE Tis said that when The hands of men Tamed this primeval wood And hoary trees with groans of woe Like warriors by an unknown foe Were in their strength subdued The virgin Earth Gave instant birth To springs that ne er did flow That in the sun Did rivulets run And all around rare flowers did blow The wild rose pale Perfumed the gale And the queenly lily adown the dale Whom the sun and the dew And the winds did woo With the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew So when in tears The love of years Is wasted like the snow And the fine fibrils of its life By the rude wrong of instant strife Are broken at a blow Within the heart Do springs upstart Of which it doth now know And strange sweet dreams Like silent streams That from new fountains overflow With the earlier tide Of rivers glide Deep in the heart whose hope has died Quenching the fires its ashes hide Its ashes whence will spring and grow Sweet flowers ere long The rare and radiant flowers of song NOTES Of the many verses from time to time ascribed to the pen of Edgar Poe and not included among his known writings the lines entitled Alone have the chief claim to our notice Fac simile copies of this piece had been in possession of the present editor some time previous to its publication in Scribner s Magazine for September eighteen seventy five but as proofs of the authorship claimed for it were not forthcoming he refrained from publishing it as requested The desired proofs have not yet been adduced and there is at present nothing but internal evidence to guide us Alone is stated to have been written by Poe in the album of a Baltimore lady missus Balderstone on March seventeenth eighteen twenty nine and the facsimile given in Scribner s is alleged to be of his handwriting If the caligraphy be Poe s it is different in all essential respects from all the many specimens known to us and strongly resembles that of the writer of the heading and dating of the manuscript both of which the contributor of the poem acknowledges to have been recently added The lines however if not by Poe are the most successful imitation of his early mannerisms yet made public and in the opinion of one well qualified to speak are not unworthy on the whole of the parentage claimed for them While Edgar Poe was editor of the Broadway Journal some lines To Isadore appeared therein and like several of his known pieces bore no signature They were at once ascribed to Poe and in order to satisfy questioners an editorial paragraph subsequently appeared saying they were by A Ide junior Two previous poems had appeared in the Broadway journal over the signature of A M Ide and whoever wrote them was also the author of the lines To Isadore In order doubtless to give a show of variety Poe was then publishing some of his known works in his journal over noms de plume and as no other writings whatever can be traced to any person bearing the name of A M Ide it is not impossible that the poems now republished in this collection may be by the author of The Raven Having been published without his usual elaborate revision Poe may have wished to hide his hasty work under an assumed name The three pieces are included in the present collection so the reader can judge for himself what pretensions they possess to be by the author of The Raven End of Project Gutenberg s The Works of Edgar Allan Poe by Edgar Allan Poe
