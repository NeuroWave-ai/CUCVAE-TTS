into a House The Ideal Author Not That it Matters The Pleasure of Writing Sometimes when the printer is waiting for an article which really should have been sent to him the day before I sit at my desk and wonder if there is any possible subject in the whole world upon which I can possibly find anything to say On one such occasion I left it to Fate which decided by means of a dictionary opened at random that I should deliver myself of a few thoughts about goldfish You will find this article later on in the book But to day I do not need to bother about a subject To day I am without a care Nothing less has happened than that I have a new nib in my pen In the ordinary way when Shakespeare writes a tragedy or mister Blank gives you one of his charming little essays a certain amount of thought goes on before pen is put to paper One cannot write Scene I An Open Place Thunder and Lightning Enter Three Witches or As I look up from my window the nodding daffodils beckon to me to take the morning one cannot give of one s best in this way on the spur of the moment At least others cannot But when I have a new nib in my pen then I can go straight from my breakfast to the blotting paper and a new sheet of foolscap fills itself magically with a stream of blue black words When poets and idiots talk of the pleasure of writing they mean the pleasure of giving a piece of their minds to the public with an old nib a tedious business They do not mean as I do the pleasure of the artist in seeing beautifully shaped k s and sinuous s s grow beneath his steel Anybody else writing this article might wonder Will my readers like it I only tell myself How the compositors will love it But perhaps they will not love it Maybe I am a little above their heads I remember on one First of January receiving an anonymous postcard wishing me a happy New Year and suggesting that I should give the compositors a happy New Year also by writing more generously In those days I got a thousand words upon one sheet eight in by five in I adopted the suggestion but it was a wrench as it would be for a painter of miniatures forced to spend the rest of his life painting the Town Council of Boffington in the manner of Herkomer My canvases are bigger now but they are still impressionistic Pretty but what is it remains the obvious comment one steps back a pace and saws the air with the hand You see it better from here my love one says to one s wife But if there be one compositor not carried away by the mad rush of life who in a leisurely hour the luncheon one for instance looks at the beautiful words with the eye of an artist not of a wage earner he I think will be satisfied he will be as glad as I am of my new nib Does it matter then what you who see only the printed word think of it A woman who had studied what she called the science of calligraphy once offered to tell my character from my handwriting I prepared a special sample for her it was full of sentences like To be good is to be happy Faith is the lode star of life We should always be kind to animals and so on I wanted her to do her best She gave the morning to it and told me at lunch that I was synthetic Probably you think that the compositor has failed me here and printed synthetic when I wrote sympathetic In just this way I misunderstood my calligraphist at first and I looked as sympathetic as I could However she repeated synthetic so that there could be no mistake I begged her to tell me more for I had thought that every letter would reveal a secret but all she would add was and not analytic I went about for the rest of the day saying proudly to myself I am synthetic I am synthetic I am synthetic and then I would add regretfully Alas I am not analytic I had no idea what it meant And how do you think she had deduced my syntheticness Simply from the fact that to save time I join some of my words together That isn t being synthetic it is being in a hurry What she should have said was You are a busy man your life is one constant whirl and probably you are of excellent moral character and kind to animals Then one would feel that one did not write in vain My pen is getting tired it has lost its first fair youth However I can still go on I was at school with a boy whose uncle made nibs If you detect traces of erudition in this article of which any decent man might be expected to be innocent I owe it to that boy He once told me how many nibs his uncle made in a year luckily I have forgotten Thousands probably Every term that boy came back with a hundred of them one expected him to be very busy After all if you haven t the brains or the inclination to work it is something to have the nibs These nibs however were put to better uses There is a game you can play with them you flick your nib against the other boy s nib and if a lucky shot puts the head of yours under his then a sharp tap capsizes him and you have a hundred and one in your collection There is a good deal of strategy in the game whose finer points I have now forgotten and I have no doubt that they play it at the Admiralty in the off season Another game was to put a clean nib in your pen place it lightly against the cheek of a boy whose head was turned away from you and then call him suddenly As Kipling says we are the only really humorous race This boy s uncle died a year or two later and left about eighty thousand but none of it to his nephew Of course he had had the nibs every term One mustn t forget that The nib I write this with is called the Canadian Quill made I suppose from some steel goose which flourishes across the seas and which Canadian housewives have to explain to their husbands every Michaelmas Well it has seen me to the end of what I wanted to say if indeed I wanted to say anything For it was enough for me this morning just to write with spring coming in through the open windows and my good Canadian quill in my hand I could have copied out a directory That is the real pleasure of writing Acacia Road Of course there are disadvantages of suburban life In the fourth act of the play there may be a moment when the fate of the erring wife hangs in the balance and utterly regardless of this the last train starts from Victoria at eleven point fifteen It must be annoying to have to leave her at such a crisis it must be annoying too to have to preface the curtailed pleasures of the play with a meat tea and a hasty dressing in the afternoon But after all one cannot judge life from its facilities for playgoing It would be absurd to condemn the suburbs because of the eleven point fifteen There is a road eight miles from London up which I have walked sometimes on my way to golf I think it is called Acacia Road some pretty name like that 
7507-100422-0000	train-other-500	It may rain in Acacia Road but never when I am there The sun shines on Laburnum Lodge with its pink may tree on the Cedars with its two clean limes
none	none	 it casts its shadow on the ivy of Holly House and upon the whole road there rests a pleasant afternoon peace I cannot walk along Acacia Road without feeling that life could be very happy in it when the sun is shining It must be jolly for instance to live in Laburnum Lodge with its pink may tree Sometimes I fancy that a suburban home 
7507-100422-0001	train-other-500	is the true home after all When I pass Laburnum Lodge I think of Him saying good bye to Her at the gate as he takes the air each morning on his way to the station What if the train is crowded
none	none	 He has his newspaper That will see him safely to the City 
7507-100422-0002	train-other-500	And then how interesting will be everything which happens to him there since he has Her to tell it to when he comes home The most ordinary street accident becomes exciting if a story has to be made of it
7507-100422-0003	train-other-500	Happy the man who can say of each little incident I must remember to tell Her when I get home And it is only in the suburbs that one gets home One does not
7507-100422-0004	train-other-500	get home to Grosvenor Square one is simply in or out But the master of Laburnum Lodge may have something better to tell his wife than the incident of the runaway horse
7507-100422-0005	train-other-500	he may have heard a new funny story at lunch The joke may have been all over the City but it is unlikely that his wife in the suburbs will have heard it Put it on the credit side of marriage that you can treasure up your jokes for some one else
none	none	 And perhaps She has something for him too some backward plant it may be has burst suddenly into flower at least he will walk more eagerly up Acacia Road for wondering 
7507-100422-0006	train-other-500	So it will be a happy meeting under the pink may tree of Laburnum Lodge when these two are restored safely to each other after the excitements of the day Possibly
7507-100422-0007	train-other-500	they will even do a little gardening together in the still glowing evening If life has anything more to offer than this it will be found at Holly House where there are babies
7507-100422-0008	train-other-500	Babies give an added excitement to the master s homecoming for almost anything may have happened to them while he has been away
none	none	 Dorothy perhaps has cut a new tooth and Anne may have said something really clever about the baker s man 
7507-100422-0009	train-other-500	In the morning too Anne will walk with him to the end of the road
none	none	 it is perfectly safe for in Acacia Road nothing untoward could occur Even the dogs are quiet and friendly I like to think of the master of Holly House 
7507-100422-0010	train-other-500	saying good bye to Anne at the end of the road and knowing that she will be alive when he comes back in the evening That ought to make the day s work go quickly But it is the Cedars which gives us the secret of the happiness of the suburbs
none	none	 The Cedars you observe is a grander house altogether there is a tennis lawn at the back And there are grown up sons and daughters at the Cedars In such houses in Acacia Road 
7507-100422-0011	train-other-500	the delightful business of love making is in full swing Marriages are not arranged in the suburbs they grow naturally out of the pleasant intercourse between the Cedars
7507-100422-0012	train-other-500	the Elms and Rose Bank I see Tom walking over to the Elms racket in hand to play tennis with Miss Muriel He is hoping for an invitation to remain to supper
none	none	 and indeed I think he will get it 
7507-100422-0013	train-other-500	Anyhow he is going to ask Miss Muriel to come across to lunch to morrow
none	none	 his mother has so much to talk to her about 
7507-100422-0014	train-other-500	But it will be Tom who will do most of the talking I am sure that the marriages made in Acacia Road are happy That is why I have no fears for Holly House and Laburnum Lodge Of course they didn t make love in this Acacia Road
7507-100422-0015	train-other-500	they are come from the Acacia Road of some other suburb wisely deciding that they will be better away from their people But they met each other in the same way as Tom and Muriel are meeting
none	none	 He has seen Her in Her own home in His home 
7507-100422-0016	train-other-500	at the tennis club surrounded by the young bounders confound them of Turret Court and the Wilderness She has heard of him falling off his bicycle or quarrelling with his father Bless you they know all about each other
none	none	 they are going to be happy enough together And now I think of it why of course there is a local theatre where they can do their play going if they are as keen on it as that For ten shillings they can spread from the stage box an air of luxury and refinement over the house and they can nod in an easy manner across the stalls to the Cedars in the opposite box in the deep recesses of which Tom and Muriel you may be sure are holding hands My Library When I moved into a new house a few weeks ago my books as was natural moved with me Strong perspiring men shovelled them into packing cases and staggered with them to the van cursing Caxton as they went On arrival at this end they staggered with them into the room selected for my library heaved off the lids of the cases and awaited orders The immediate need was for an emptier room Together we hurried the books into the new white shelves which awaited them the order in which they stood being of no matter so long as they were off the floor Armful after armful was hastily stacked the only pause being when in the curious way in which these things happen my own name suddenly caught the eye of the foreman Did you write this one sir he asked I admitted it H m he said noncommittally He glanced along the names of every armful after that and appeared a little surprised at the number of books which I hadn t written An easy going profession evidently So we got the books up at last and there they are still I told myself that when a wet afternoon came along I would arrange them properly When the wet afternoon came I told myself that I would arrange them one of these fine mornings As they are now I have to look along every shelf in the search for the book which I want To come to Keats is no guarantee that we are on the road to Shelley Shelley if he did not drop out on the way is probably next to How to Be a Golfer Though Middle aged Having written as far as this I had to get up and see where Shelley really was It is worse than I thought He is between Geometrical Optics and Studies in New Zealand Scenery Ella Wheeler Wilcox whom I find myself to be entertaining unawares sits beside Anarchy or Order which was apparently sent in the hope that you will become a member of the Duty and Discipline Movement a vain hope it would seem for I have not yet paid my subscription What I Found Out by an English Governess shares a corner with The Recreations of a Country Parson they are followed by Villette and Baedeker s Switzerland Something will have to be done about it But I am wondering what is to be done If I gave you the impression that my books were precisely arranged in their old shelves I misled you They were arranged in the order known as all anyhow Possibly they were a little less anyhow than they are now in that the volumes of any particular work were at least together but that is all that can be claimed for them For years I put off the business of tidying them up just as I am putting it off now It is not laziness it is simply that I don t know how to begin Let us suppose that we decide to have all the poetry together It sounds reasonable But then Byron is eleven inches 
7517_100429_000003_000001	train-clean-100	high 
none	none	my tallest poet and Beattie my shortest is just over four inches How foolish they will look standing side by side Perhaps you don t know Beattie but I assure you that he was a poet He wrote those majestic lines The shepherd swain of whom I mention made On Scotia s mountains fed his little flock The sickle scythe or plough he never swayed An honest heart was almost all his stock Of course one would hardly expect a shepherd to sway a plough in the ordinary way but Beattie was quite right to remind us that Edwin didn t either Edwin was the name of the shepherd swain And yet poor Edwin was no vulgar boy we are told a little further on in a line that should live Well having satisfied you that Beattie was really a poet I can now return to my argument that an eleven inch Byron cannot stand next to a four inch Beattie and be followed by an eight inch Cowper without making the shelf look silly Yet how can I discard Beattie Beattie who wrote And now the downy cheek and deepened voice Gave dignity to Edwin s blooming prime You see the difficulty If you arrange your books according to their contents you are sure to get an untidy shelf If you arrange your books according to their size and colour you get an effective wall but the poetically inclined visitor may lose sight of Beattie altogether Before then we decide what to do about it we must ask ourselves that very awkward question Why do we have books on our shelves at all It is a most embarrassing question to answer Of course you think that the proper answer in your own case is an indignant protest that you bought them in order to read them and that yon put them on your shelves in order that you could refer to them when necessary A little reflection will show you what a stupid answer that is If you only want to read them why are some of them bound in morocco and half calf and other expensive coverings Why did you buy a first edition when a hundredth edition was so much cheaper Why have you got half a dozen copies of The Rubaiyat What is the particular value of this other book that you treasure it so carefully Why the fact that its pages are uncut If you cut the pages and read it the value would go So then your library is not just for reference You know as well as I do that it furnishes your room that it furnishes it more effectively than does paint or mahogany or china Of course it is nice to have the books there so that one can refer to them when one wishes One may be writing an article on sea bathing for instance and have come to the sentence which begins In the well remembered words of Coleridge perhaps almost too familiar to be quoted and then one may have to look them up On these occasions a library is not only ornamental but useful But do not let us be ashamed that we find it ornamental Indeed the more I survey it the more I feel that my library is sufficiently ornamental as it stands Any reassembling of the books might spoil the colour scheme Baedeker s Switzerland and Villette are both in red a colour which is neatly caught up again after an interlude in blue by a volume of Browning and Jevons Elementary Logic We had a woman here only yesterday who said How pretty your books look and I am inclined to think that that is good enough There is a careless rapture about them which I should lose if I started to arrange them methodically But perhaps I might risk this to the extent of getting all their heads the same way up Yes on one of these fine days or wet nights I shall take my library seriously in hand There are still one or two books which are the wrong way round I shall put them the right way round The Chase The fact as revealed in a recent lawsuit that there is a gentleman in this country who spends ten thousand a year upon his butterfly collection would have disturbed me more in the early nineties than it does to day I can bear it calmly now but twenty five years ago the knowledge would have spoilt my pride in my own collection upon which I was already spending the best part of threepence a week pocket money Perhaps though I should have consoled myself with the thought that I was the truer enthusiast of the two for when my rival hears of a rare butterfly in Brazil he sends a man out to Brazil to capture it whereas I when I heard that there was a Clouded Yellow in the garden took good care that nobody but myself encompassed its death Our aims also were different I purposely left Brazil out of it Whether butterfly hunting is good or bad for the character I cannot undertake to decide No doubt it can be justified as clearly as fox hunting If the fox eats chickens the butterfly s child eats vegetables if fox hunting improves the breed of horses butterfly hunting improves the health of boys But at least we never told ourselves that butterflies liked being pursued as I understand foxes like being hunted We were moderately honest about it And we comforted ourselves in the end with the assurance of many eminent naturalists that insects don t feel pain I have often wondered how naturalists dare to speak with such authority Do they never have dreams at night of an after life in some other world wherein they are pursued by giant insects eager to increase their naturalist collection insects who assure each other carelessly that naturalists don t feel pain Perhaps they do so dream But we at any rate slept well for we had never dogmatized about a butterfly s feelings We only quoted the wise men But if there might be doubt about the sensitiveness of a butterfly there could be no doubt about his distinguishing marks It was amazing to us how many grown up and presumably educated men and women did not know that a butterfly had knobs on the end of his antennae and that the moth had none Where had they been all these years to be so ignorant Well meaning but misguided aunts with mysterious promises of a new butterfly for our collection would produce some common Yellow Underwing from an envelope innocent for which they may be forgiven that only a personal capture had any value to us but unforgivably ignorant that a Yellow Underwing was a moth We did not collect moths there were too many of them And moths are nocturnal creatures A hunter whose bed time depends upon the whim of another is handicapped for the night chase But butterflies come out when the sun comes out which is just when little boys should be out and there are not too many butterflies in England I knew them all by name once and could have recognized any that I saw yes even Hampstead s Albion Eye or was it Albion s Hampstead Eye of which only one specimen had ever been caught in this country presumably by Hampstead or Albion In my day dreams the second specimen was caught by me Yet he was an insignificant looking fellow and perhaps I should have been better pleased with a Camberwell Beauty a Purple Emperor or a Swallowtail Unhappily the Purple Emperor so the book told us haunted the tops of trees which was to take an unfair advantage of a boy small for his age and the Swallowtail haunted Norfolk which was equally inconsiderate of a family which kept holiday in the south The Camberwell Beauty sounded more hopeful but I suppose the trams disheartened him I doubt if he ever haunted Camberwell in my time With threepence a week one has to be careful It was necessary to buy killing boxes and setting boards but butterfly nets could be made at home A stick a piece of copper wire and some muslin were all that were necessary One liked the muslin to be green for there was a feeling that this deceived the butterfly in some way he thought that Birnam Wood was merely coming to Dunsinane when he saw it approaching arid that the queer looking thing behind was some local efflorescence So he resumed his dalliance with the herbaceous border and was never more surprised in his life than when it turned out to be a boy and a butterfly net Green muslin then but a plain piece of cane for the stick None of your collapsible fishing rods suitable for a Purple Emperor Leave those to the millionaire s sons It comes back to me now that I am doing this afternoon what I did more than twenty five years ago I am writing an article upon the way to make a butterfly net For my first contribution to the press was upon this subject I sent it to the editor of some boys paper and his failure to print it puzzled me a good deal since every word in it I was sure was correctly spelt Of course I see now that you want more in an article than that But besides being puzzled I was extremely disappointed for I wanted badly the money that it should have brought in I wanted it in order to buy a butterfly net the stick and the copper wire and the green muslin being in my hands at any rate more suited to an article Superstition I have just read a serious column on the prospects for next year 
7502-100425-0000	train-other-500	This article consisted of contributions from experts in the various branches of industry including one from a meteorological expert who I need hardly tell you forecasted a wet summer and ended with a general summing up of the year by Old Moore or one of the minor prophets
7502-100425-0001	train-other-500	Old Moore I am sorry to say left me cold I should like to believe in astrology but I cannot I should like to believe that the heavenly bodies sort themselves into certain positions in order that Zadkiel may be kept in touch with the future
7502-100425-0002	train-other-500	the idea of a star whizzing a million miles out of its path by way of indicating a sensational divorce case in high life is extraordinarily massive But candidly I do not believe the stars bother What the stars are for
7502-100425-0003	train-other-500	what they are like when you get there I do not know but a starry night would not be so beautiful if it were simply meant as a warning to some unpleasant financier that Kaffirs were going up The ordinary man looks at the heavens and thinks what an insignificant atom he is beneath them
7502-100425-0004	train-other-500	the believer in astrology looks up and realizes afresh his overwhelming importance Perhaps after all I am glad I do not believe Life must be a very tricky thing for the superstitious
7502-100425-0005	train-other-500	At dinner a night or two ago I happened to say that I had never been in danger of drowning I am not sure now that it was true but I still think that it was harmless However before I had time to elaborate my theme whatever it was I was peremptorily ordered to touch wood
7502-100425-0006	train-other-500	I protested that both my feet were on the polished oak and both my elbows on the polished mahogany one always knew that some good instinct inspired the pleasant habit of elbows on the table and that anyhow I did not see the need However because one must not argue at dinner
7502-100425-0007	train-other-500	I tapped the table two or three times and now I suppose I am immune At the same time I should like to know exactly whom I have appeased For this must be the idea of the wood touching superstition that a malignant spirit dogs one s conversational footsteps
7502-100425-0008	train-other-500	listening eagerly for the complacent word I have never had the mumps you say airily Ha ha says the spirit haven t you Just you wait till next Tuesday my boy Unconsciously we are crediting Fate with our own human weaknesses
7502-100425-0009	train-other-500	If a man standing on the edge of a pond said aloud I have never fallen into a pond in my life and we happened to be just behind him the temptation to push him in would be irresistible Irresistible that is by us
7502-100425-0010	train-other-500	but it is charitable to assume that Providence can control itself by now
none	none	 Of course nobody really thinks that our good or evil spirits have any particular feeling about wood 
7502-100425-0011	train-other-500	that they like it stroked nobody I suppose not even the most superstitious really thinks that Fate is especially touchy in the matter of salt and ladders Equally of course many people who throw spilt salt over their left shoulders are not superstitious in the least
7502-100425-0012	train-other-500	and are only concerned to display that readiness in the face of any social emergency which is said to be the mark of good manners
none	none	 But there are certainly many who feel that it is the part of a wise man to propitiate the unknown 
7502-100425-0013	train-other-500	to bend before the forces which work for harm and they pay tribute to Fate by means of these little customs in the hope that they will secure in return an immunity from evil The tribute is nominal but it is an acknowledgment all the same
7502-100425-0014	train-other-500	A proper sense of proportion leaves no room for superstition A man says I have never been in a shipwreck and becoming nervous touches wood Why is he nervous He has this paragraph before his eyes
none	none	 Among the deceased was mister By 
7502-100425-0015	train-other-500	a remarkable coincidence this gentleman had been saying only a few days before that he had never been in a shipwreck Little did he think that his next voyage would falsify his words so tragically
none	none	 It occurs to him that he has read paragraphs like that again and again 
7502-100425-0016	train-other-500	Perhaps he has Certainly he has never read a paragraph like this Among the deceased was mister By a
none	none	 remarkable coincidence this gentleman had never made the remark that he had not yet been in a shipwreck 
7502-100425-0017	train-other-500	Yet that paragraph could have been written truthfully thousands of times A sense of proportion would tell you that if only one side of a case is ever recorded that side acquires an undue importance The truth is that Fate does not go out of its way to be dramatic
7502-100425-0018	train-other-500	If you or I had the power of life and death in our hands we should no doubt arrange some remarkably bright and telling effects A man who spilt the salt callously would be drowned next week in the Dead Sea and a couple who married in May would expire simultaneously in the May following
none	none	 But Fate cannot worry to think out all the clever things that we should think out 
7502-100425-0019	train-other-500	It goes about its business solidly and unromantically and by the ordinary laws of chance it achieves every now and then something startling and romantic Superstition thrives on the fact that only the accidental dramas are reported
7502-100425-0020	train-other-500	But there are charms to secure happiness as well as charms to avert evil In these I am a firm believer I do not mean that I believe that a horseshoe hung up in the house will bring me good luck
none	none	 I mean that if anybody does believe this then the hanging up of his horseshoe will probably bring him good luck For if you believe that you are going to be lucky you go about your business with a smile you take disaster with a smile you start afresh with a smile And to do that is to be in the way of happiness 
7502-100426-0000	train-other-500	The Charm of Golf When he reads of the notable doings of famous golfers the eighteen handicap man has no envy in his heart For by this time he has discovered the great secret of golf
7502-100426-0001	train-other-500	Before he began to play he wondered wherein lay the fascination of it now he knows Golf is so popular simply because it is the best game in the world at which to be bad Consider what it is to be bad at cricket
7502-100426-0002	train-other-500	You have bought a new bat perfect in balance
none	none	 a new pair of pads white as driven snow 
7502-100426-0003	train-other-500	gloves of the very latest design Do they let you use them No After one ball in the negotiation of which neither your bat nor your pads nor your gloves came into play they send you back into the pavilion to spend the rest of the afternoon
7502-100426-0004	train-other-500	listening to fatuous stories of some old gentleman who knew Fuller Pilch And when your side takes the field
none	none	 where are you 
7502-100426-0005	train-other-500	Probably at long leg both ends exposed to the public gaze as the worst fieldsman in London How devastating are your emotions Remorse anger mortification fill your heart above all envy
7502-100426-0006	train-other-500	envy of the lucky immortals who disport themselves on the green level of Lord s Consider what it is to be bad at lawn tennis True
none	none	 you are allowed to hold on to your new racket all through the game but how often are you allowed to employ it usefully

none	none	 Mine and bundle you out of the way 
7502-100426-0008	train-other-500	Is there pleasure in playing football badly You may spend the full eighty minutes in your new boots
none	none	 but your relations with the ball will be distant 
7502-100426-0009	train-other-500	They do not give you a ball to yourself at football But how different a game is golf At golf it is the bad player who gets the most strokes However good his opponent the bad player has the right to play out each hole to the end
7502-100426-0010	train-other-500	he will get more than his share of the game He need have no fears that his new driver will not be employed He will have as many swings with it as the scratch man more if he misses the ball altogether upon one or two tees If he buys a new niblick
none	none	 he is certain to get fun out of it on the very first day 
7502-100426-0011	train-other-500	And above all there is this to be said for golfing mediocrity the bad player can make the strokes of the good player The poor cricketer has perhaps never made fifty in his life as soon as he stands at the wickets
none	none	 he knows that he is not going to make fifty to day 
7502-100426-0012	train-other-500	But the eighteen handicap man has some time or other played every hole on the course to perfection
none	none	 He has driven a ball two hundred fifty yards 
7502-100426-0013	train-other-500	he has made superb approaches he has run down the long putt Any of these things may suddenly happen to him again
none	none	 And therefore it is not his fate to have to sit in the club smoking room after his second round 
7502-100426-0014	train-other-500	and listen to the wonderful deeds of others He can join in too He can say with perfect truth I once carried the ditch at the fourth with my second or I remember when I drove into the bunker guarding the eighth green or even
none	none	 I did a three at the eleventh this afternoon 
7502-100426-0015	train-other-500	bogey being five But if the bad cricketer says I remember when I took a century in forty minutes off Lockwood and Richardson he is nothing but a liar For these and other reasons golf is the best game in the world for the bad player
none	none	 And sometimes I am tempted to go further and say that it is a better game for the bad player than for the good player 
7502-100426-0016	train-other-500	The joy of driving a ball straight after a week of slicing the joy of putting a mashie shot dead the joy of even a moderate stroke with a brassie best of all the joy of the perfect cleek shot these things the good player will never know
7502-100426-0017	train-other-500	Every stroke we bad players make we make in hope
none	none	 It is never so bad but it might have been worse it is never so bad but we are confident of doing better next time 
7502-100426-0018	train-other-500	And if the next stroke is good what happiness fills our soul How eagerly we tell ourselves that in a little while all our strokes will be as good What does Vardon know of this If he does a five hole in four he blames himself that he did not do it in three
7502-100426-0019	train-other-500	if he does it in five he is miserable He will never experience that happy surprise with which we hail our best strokes Only his bad strokes surprise him and then we may suppose that he is not happy His length and accuracy are mechanical
none	none	 they are not the result as so often in our case of some suddenly applied maxim 
7502-100426-0020	train-other-500	or some suddenly discovered innovation The only thing which can vary in his game is his putting and putting is not golf but croquet But of course we too are going to be as good as Vardon one day
none	none	 We are only postponing the day because meanwhile it is so pleasant to be bad 
7502-100426-0021	train-other-500	And it is part of the charm of being bad at golf that in a moment in a single night we may become good If the bad cricketer said to a good cricketer What am I doing wrong the only possible answer would be Nothing particular except that you can t play cricket
7502-100426-0022	train-other-500	But if you or I were to say to our scratch friend What am I doing wrong he would reply at once Moving the head or Dropping the right knee or Not getting the wrists in soon enough and by to morrow we should be different players
7502-100426-0023	train-other-500	Upon such a little depends or seems to the eighteen handicap to depend excellence in golf And so perfectly happy in our present badness and perfectly confident of our future goodness we long handicap men remain
7502-100426-0024	train-other-500	Perhaps it would be pleasanter to be a little more certain of getting the ball safely off the first tee perhaps at the fourteenth hole where there is a right of way and the public encroach we should like to feel that we have done with topping perhaps
none	none	 Well perhaps we might get our handicap down to fifteen this summer But no lower certainly no lower Goldfish Let us talk about well anything you will Goldfish for instance Goldfish are a symbol of old world tranquillity or mid Victorian futility according to their position in the home Outside the home in that wild state from which civilization has dragged them they may have stood for dare devil courage or constancy or devotion I cannot tell I may only speak of them now as I find them which is in the garden or in the drawing room In their lily leaved pool sunk deep in the old flagged terrace upon whose borders the blackbird whistles his early morning song they remind me of sundials and lavender and old delightful things But in their cheap glass bowl upon the three legged table above which the cloth covered canary maintains a stolid silence they remind me of antimacassars and horsehair sofas and all that is depressing It is hard that the goldfish himself should have so little choice in the matter Goldfish look pretty in the terrace pond yet I doubt if it was the need for prettiness which brought them there Rather the need for some thing to throw things to No one of the initiate can sit in front of Nature s most wonderful effect the sea without wishing to throw stones into it the physical pleasure of the effort and the aesthetic pleasure of the splash combining to produce perfect contentment So by the margin of the pool the same desires stir within one and because ants eggs do not splash and look untidy on the surface of the water there must be a gleam of gold and silver to put the crown upon one s pleasure Perhaps when you have been feeding the goldfish you have not thought of it like that But at least you must have wondered why of all diets they should prefer ants eggs Ants eggs are I should say the very last thing which one would take to without argument It must be an acquired taste and this being so one naturally asks oneself how goldfish came to acquire it I suppose but I am lamentably ignorant on these as on all other matters that there was a time when goldfish lived a wild free life of their own They roamed the sea or the river or whatever it was fighting for existence and Nature showed them as she always does the food which suited them Now I have often come across ants nests in my travels but never when swimming In seas and rivers pools and lakes I have wandered but Nature has never put ants eggs in my way No doubt it would be only right the goldfish has a keener eye than I have for these things but if they had been there should I have missed them so completely I think not for if they had been there they must have been there in great quantities I can imagine a goldfish slowly acquiring the taste for them through the centuries but only if other food were denied to him only if wherever he went ants eggs ants eggs ants eggs drifted down the stream to him Yet since it would seem that he has acquired the taste it can only be that the taste has come to him with captivity has been forced upon him I should have said The old wild goldfish this is my theory was a more terrible beast than we think Given his proper diet he could not have been kept within the limits of the terrace pool He would have been unsuited to domestic life he would have dragged in the shrieking child as she leant to feed him As the result of many experiments ants eggs were given him to keep him thin you can see for yourself what a bloodless diet it is ants eggs were given him to quell his spirit and just as a man if he has sufficient colds can get up a passion even for ammoniated quinine so the goldfish has grown in captivity to welcome the once hated omelette Let us consider now the case of the goldfish in the house His diet is the same but how different his surroundings If his bowl is placed on a table in the middle of the floor he has but to flash his tail once and he has been all round the drawing room The drawing room may not seem much to you but to him this impressionist picture through the curved glass must be amazing Let not the outdoor goldfish boast of his freedom What does he in his little world of water lily roots know of the vista upon vista which opens to his more happy brother as he passes jauntily from china dog to ottoman and from ottoman to Henry s father Ah here is life It may be that in the course of years he will get used to it even bored by it indeed for that reason I always advocate giving him a glance at the dining room or the bedrooms on Wednesdays and Saturdays but his first day in the bowl must be the opening of an undreamt of heaven to him Again what an adventurous life is his At any moment a cat may climb up and fetch him out a child may upset him grown ups may neglect to feed him or to change his water The temptation to take him up and massage him must be irresistible to outsiders All these dangers the goldfish in the pond avoids he lives a sheltered and unexciting life and when he wants to die he dies unnoticed unregretted but for his brother the tears and the solemn funeral Yes now that I have thought it out I can see that I was wrong in calling the indoor goldfish a symbol of mid Victorian futility An article of this sort is no good if it does not teach the writer something as well as his readers I recognize him now as the symbol of enterprise and endurance of restlessness and Post Impressionism He is not mid Victorian he is Fifth Georgian Which is all I want to say about goldfish Saturday to Monday The happy man would have happy faces round him a sad face is a reproach to him for his happiness So when I escape by the two point ten on Saturday I distribute largesse with a liberal hand The cabman feeling that an effort is required of him mentions that I am the first gentleman he has met that day he penetrates my mufti and calls me captain leaving it open whether he regards me as a Salvation Army captain or the captain of a barge The porters hasten to the door of my cab there is a little struggle between them as to who shall have the honour of waiting upon me Inside the station things go on as happily The booking office clerk gives me a pleasant smile he seems to approve of the station I am taking Some do go to Brighton he implies but for a gentleman like you He pauses to point out that with this ticket I can come back on the Tuesday if I like as between ourselves I hope to do In exchange for his courtesies I push him my paper through the pigeon hole A dirty little boy thrust it into my cab I didn t want it but as we are all being happy to day he had his penny I follow my porter to the platform On the left says the ticket collector He has said it mechanically to a hundred persons but he becomes human and kindly as he says it to me I feel that he really wishes me to get into the right train to have a pleasant journey down to be welcomed heartily by my friends when I arrive It is not as to one of a mob but to an individual that he speaks The porter has found me an empty carriage He is full of ideas for my comfort he tells me which way the train will start where we stop and when we may be expected to arrive Am I sure I wouldn t like my bag in the van Can he get me any papers No no thanks I don t want to read I give him sixpence and there is another one of us happy Presently the guard He also seems pleased that I have selected this one particular station from among so many Pleased but not astonished he expected it of me It is a very good run down in his train and he shouldn t be surprised if we had a fine week end I stand at the door of ray carriage feeling very happy It is good to get out of London Come to think of it we are all getting out of London and none of us is going to do any work to morrow How jolly Oh but what about my porter Bother I wish now I d given him more than sixpence Still he may have a sweetheart and be happy that way We are off I have nothing to read but then I want to think It is the ideal place in which to think a railway carriage the ideal place in which to be happy I wonder if I shall be in good form this week end at cricket and tennis and croquet and billiards and all the other jolly games I mean to play Look at those children trying to play cricket in that dirty backyard Poor little beggars Fancy living in one of those horrible squalid houses But you cannot spoil to day for me little backyards On Tuesday perhaps when I am coming again to the ugly town your misery will make me miserable I shall ask myself hopelessly what it all means but just now I am too happy for pity After all why should I assume that you envy me you two children swinging on a gate and waving to me You are happy aren t you Of course we are all happy to day See I am waving back to you My eyes wander round the carriage and rest on my bag Have I put everything in Of course I have Then why this uneasy feeling that I have left something very important out Well I can soon settle the question Let s start with to night Evening clothes they re in I know Shirts collars I go through the whole programme for the week end allotting myself in my mind suitable clothes for each occasion Yes I seem to have brought everything that I can possibly want But what a very jolly programme I am drawing up for myself Will it really be as delightful as that Well it was last time and the time before that is why I am so happy The train draws up at its only halt in the glow of a September mid afternoon There is a little pleasant bustle nice people get out and nice people meet them everybody seems very cheery and contented Then we are off again and now the next station is mine We are there A porter takes my things with a kindly smile and a Nice day I see Brant outside with the wagonette not the trap then I am not the only guest coming by this train Who are the others I wonder Anybody I know Why yes it s Bob and missus Bob and hallo Cynthia And isn t that old Anderby How splendid I must get that shilling back from Bob that I lost to him at billiards last time And if Cynthia really thinks that she can play croquet We greet each other happily and climb into the wagonette Never has the country looked so lovely No no rain at all says Brant and the glass is going up The porter puts our luggage in the cart and comes round with a smile It is a rotten life being a porter and I do so want everybody to enjoy this afternoon Besides I haven t any coppers I slip half a crown into his palm Now we are all very very happy The Pond My friend Aldenham s pond stands at a convenient distance from the house and is reached by a well drained gravel path so that in any weather one may walk alone or in company dry shod to its brink and estimate roughly how many inches of rain have fallen in the night 
7517_100429_000002_000001	train-clean-100	The ribald call it the hippopotamus pond tracing a resemblance between it and the bath of the hippopotamus at the Zoo beneath the waters of which if you particularly desire to point the hippopotamus out to somebody he always lies hidden 
7517_100429_000002_000002	train-clean-100	To the rest of us it is known simply as the pond a designation which ignores the existence of several neighbouring ponds the gifts of nature and gives the whole credit to the handiwork of man 
7517_100429_000002_000003	train-clean-100	For the pond is just a small artificial affair of cement entirely unpretentious 
none	none	There are seven steps to the bottom of the pond and each step is ten in high Thus the steps help to make the pond a convenient rain gauge for obviously when only three steps are left uncovered as was the case last Monday you know that there have been forty in of rain since last month when the pond began to fill To strangers this may seem surprising and it is only fair to tell them the great secret which is that much of the surrounding land drains secretly into the pond too 
7517_100429_000003_000004	train-clean-100	This seems to me to give a much fairer indication of the rain that has fallen than do the official figures in the newspapers 
none	none	For when your whole day s cricket has been spoilt it is perfectly absurd to be told that twenty six of an inch of rain has done the damage the soul yearns for something more startling than that The record of the pond that there has been another five in soothes us where the record of the ordinary pedantic rain gauge would leave us infuriated 
7517_100429_000003_000006	train-clean-100	It speaks much for my friend Aldenham s breadth of view that he understood this and planned the pond accordingly 
7517_100429_000004_000000	train-clean-100	A most necessary thing in a country house is that there should be a recognized meeting place where the people who have been writing a few letters after breakfast may when they have finished meet those who have no intention of writing any and arrange plans with them for the morning 
none	none	I am one of those who cannot write letters in another man s house and when my pipe is well alight I say to Miss Robinson or whoever it may be Let s go and look at the pond Right oh she says willingly enough having spent the last quarter of an hour with The Times Financial Supplement all of the paper that is left to the women in the first rush for the cricket news 
7517_100429_000004_000002	train-clean-100	We wander down to the pond together and perhaps find Brown and Miss Smith there 
7517_100429_000004_000003	train-clean-100	 A lot of rain in the night says Brown 
none	none	It was only just over the third step after lunch yesterday We have a little argument about it Miss Robinson being convinced that she stood on the second step after breakfast and Miss Smith repeating that it looks exactly the same to her this morning 
7517_100429_000004_000005	train-clean-100	By and by two or three others stroll up and we all make measurements together 
none	none	The general opinion is that there has been a lot of rain in the night and that forty three in in three weeks must be a record 
7517_100429_000004_000007	train-clean-100	But anyhow it is fairly fine now and what about a little lawn tennis 
7517_100429_000004_000008	train-clean-100	Or golf 
7517_100429_000004_000009	train-clean-100	Or croquet 
none	none	Or 
7517_100429_000004_000011	train-clean-100	And so the arrangements for the morning are made 
7517_100429_000005_000000	train-clean-100	And they can be made more readily out of doors for supposing it is fine the fresh air calls you to be doing something and the sight of the newly marked tennis lawn fills you with thoughts of revenge for your accidental defeat the evening before 
7517_100429_000005_000001	train-clean-100	But indoors it is so easy to drop into a sofa after breakfast and once there with all the papers to be disinclined to leave it till lunch time 
7517_100429_000005_000002	train-clean-100	A man or woman as lazy as this must not be rushed 
7517_100429_000005_000003	train-clean-100	Say to such a one Come and play and the invitation will be declined 
7517_100429_000005_000004	train-clean-100	Say Come and look at the pond and the worst sluggard will not refuse such gentle exercise 
none	none	And once he is out he is out 
7517_100429_000006_000000	train-clean-100	All this for those delightful summer days when there are fine intervals but consider the advantages of the pond when the rain streams down in torrents from morning till night 
7517_100429_000006_000001	train-clean-100	How tired we get of being indoors on these days even with the best of books the pleasantest of companions the easiest of billiard tables Yet if our hostess were to see us marching out with an umbrella how odd she would think us 
none	none	Where are you off to she would ask and we could only answer lamely Er I was just going to er walk about a bit But now we tell her brightly I m going to see the pond 
7517_100429_000006_000003	train-clean-100	It must be nearly full 
7517_100429_000006_000004	train-clean-100	Won t you come too And with any luck she comes 
7517_100429_000006_000005	train-clean-100	And you know it even reconciles us a little to these streaming days to reflect that it all goes to fill the pond 
7517_100429_000006_000006	train-clean-100	For there is ever before our minds that great moment in the future when the pond is at last full 
none	none	What will happen then 
7517_100429_000006_000008	train-clean-100	Aldenham may know but we his guests do not 
7517_100429_000006_000009	train-clean-100	Some think there will be merely a flood over the surrounding paths and the kitchen garden but for myself I believe that we are promised something much bigger than that 
7517_100429_000006_000010	train-clean-100	A man with such a broad and friendly outlook towards rain gauges will be sure to arrange something striking when the great moment arrives 
7517_100429_000006_000011	train-clean-100	Some sort of fete will help to celebrate it I have no doubt with an open air play tank drama or what not 
7517_100429_000006_000012	train-clean-100	At any rate we have every hope that he will empty the pond as speedily as possible so that we may watch it fill again 
7517_100429_000007_000000	train-clean-100	I must say that he has been a little lucky in his choice of a year for inaugurating the pond 
none	none	But all the same there are now forty five in of rain in it forty five in of rain have fallen in the last three weeks and I think that something ought to be done about it A Seventeenth Century Story There is a story in every name in that first column of The Times Births Marriages and Deaths down which we glance each morning but unless the name is known to us we do not bother about the stories of other people They are those not very interesting people our contemporaries But in a country churchyard a name on an old tombstone will set us wondering a little What sort of life came to an end there a hundred years ago In the parish register we shall find the whole history of them when they were born when they were married how many children they had when they died a skeleton of their lives which we can clothe with our fancies and make living again Simple lives we make them in that pleasant countryside Man comes and tills the field and lies beneath that is all Simple work simple pleasures and a simple death Of course we are wrong There were passions and pains in those lives tragedies perhaps The tombstones and the registers say nothing of them or if they say it it is in a cypher to which we have not the key Yet sometimes the key is almost in our hands Here is a story from the register of a village church four entries only but they hide a tragedy which with a little imagination we can almost piece together for ourselves The first entry is a marriage John Meadowes of Littlehaw Manor bachelor took Mary Field to wife both of this parish on seventh November sixteen eighty one There were no children of the marriage Indeed it only lasted a year A year later on lsecond November sixteen eighty two John died and was buried Poor Mary Meadowes was now alone at the Manor We picture her sitting there in her loneliness broken hearted refusing to be comforted Until we come to the third entry John has only been in his grave a month but here is the third entry telling us that on lsecond December sixteen eighty two Robert Cliff bachelor was married to Mary Meadowes widow It spoils our picture of her And then the fourth entry It is the fourth entry which reveals the tragedy which makes us wonder what is the story hidden away in the parish register of Littlehaw the mystery of Littlehaw Manor For here is another death the death of Mary Cliff and Mary Cliff died on lthird December sixteen eighty two And she was buried in unconsecrated ground For Mary Cliff we must suppose had killed herself She had killed herself on the day after her marriage to her second husband Well what is the story We shall have to make it up for ourselves Here is my rendering of it I have no means of finding out if it is the correct one but it seems to fit itself within the facts as we know them Mary Field was the daughter of well to do parents an only child and the most desirable bride from the worldly point of view in the village No wonder then that her parents choice of a husband for her fell upon the most desirable bridegroom of the village John Meadowes The Fields land adjoined Littlehaw Manor one day the child of John and Mary would own it all Let a marriage then be arranged But Mary loved Robert Cliff whole heartedly Robert a man of no standing at all A ridiculous notion said her parents but the silly girl would grow out of it She was taken by a handsome face Once she was safely wedded to John she would forget her foolishness John might not be handsome but he was a solid steady fellow which was more much more as it turned out than could be said for Robert So John and Mary married But she still loved Robert Did she kill her husband Did she and Robert kill him together Or did she only hasten his death by her neglect of him in some illness Did she dare him to ride some devil of a horse which she knew he could not master did she taunt him into some foolhardy feat or did she deliberately kill him with or without her lover s aid I cannot guess but of this I am certain His death was on her conscience Directly or indirectly she was responsible for it or at any rate felt herself responsible for it But she would not think of it too closely she had room for only one thought in her mind She was mistress of Littlehaw Manor now and free to marry whom she wished Free at last to marry Robert Whatever had been done had been worth doing for that So she married him And then so I read the story she discovered the truth Robert had never loved her He had wanted to marry the rich Miss Field that was all Still more he had wanted to marry the rich missus Meadowes He was quite callous about it She might as well know the truth now as later It would save trouble in the future if she knew So Mary killed herself She had murdered John for nothing Whatever her responsibility for John s death in the bitterness of that discovery she would call it murder She had a murder on her conscience for love s sake and there was no love What else to do but follow John Is that the story I wonder Our Learned Friends 
7515_100431_000004_000000	train-clean-360	I do not know why the Bar has always seemed the most respectable of the professions a profession which the hero of almost any novel could adopt without losing caste 
7515_100431_000004_000001	train-clean-360	But so it is 
7515_100431_000004_000002	train-clean-360	A schoolmaster can be referred to contemptuously as an usher a doctor is regarded humorously as a licensed murderer a solicitor is always retiring to gaol for making away with trust funds and in any case is merely an attorney while a civil servant sleeps from ten to four every day and is only waked up at sixty in order to be given a pension 
7515_100431_000004_000003	train-clean-360	But there is no humorous comment to be made upon the barrister unless it is to call him my learned friend He has much more right than the actor to claim to be a member of the profession 
7515_100431_000004_000004	train-clean-360	I don t know why 
7515_100431_000004_000005	train-clean-360	Perhaps it is because he walks about the Temple in a top hat 
7515_100431_000005_000000	train-clean-360	So many of one s acquaintances at some time or other have eaten dinners that one hardly dares to say anything against the profession

7515_100431_000005_000002	train-clean-360	However I shall take the risk and put the barrister in the dock 
7515_100431_000005_000003	train-clean-360	 Gentlemen of the jury observe this well dressed gentleman before you 
7515_100431_000005_000004	train-clean-360	What shall we say about him 
7515_100431_000006_000000	train-clean-360	Let us begin by asking ourselves what we expect from a profession 
7515_100431_000006_000001	train-clean-360	In the first place certainly we expect a living but I think we want something more than that 
7515_100431_000006_000002	train-clean-360	If we were offered a thousand a year to walk from Charing Cross to Barnet every day reasons of poverty might compel us to accept the offer but we should hardly be proud of our new profession 
7515_100431_000006_000003	train-clean-360	We should prefer to earn a thousand a year by doing some more useful work 
none	none	Indeed to a man of any fine feeling the profession of Barnet walking would only be tolerable if he could persuade himself that by his exertions he was helping to revive the neglected art of pedestrianism or to make more popular the neglected beauties of Barnet if he could hope that after his three hundredth journey inquisitive people would begin to follow him wondering what he was after and so come suddenly upon the old Norman church at the cross roads or if they missed this at any rate upon a much better appetite for their dinner

7515_100431_000007_000000	train-clean-360	It seems to me then that a profession is a noble or an ignoble one according as it offers or denies to him who practises it the opportunity of working for some other end than his own advancement

7515_100431_000007_000006	train-clean-360	We tell ourselves that we will follow the light as it has been revealed to us that our ideals shall never be lowered that we will refuse to sacrifice our principles to our interests We fail of course

7515_100431_000007_000012	train-clean-360	It beckons to us 
7515_100431_000008_000000	train-clean-360	Now what of the Bar 
7515_100431_000008_000001	train-clean-360	Is the barrister after anything other than his own advancement 
7515_100431_000008_000002	train-clean-360	He follows what gleam 
7515_100431_000008_000003	train-clean-360	What are his ideals Never mind whether he fails more often or less often than others to attain them I am not bothering about that 
7515_100431_000008_000004	train-clean-360	I only want to know what it is that he is after 
none	none	In the quiet hours when we are alone with ourselves and there is nobody to tell us what fine fellows we are we come sometimes upon a weak moment in which we wonder not how much money we are earning nor how famous we are becoming but what good we are doing 
7515_100431_000008_000006	train-clean-360	If a barrister ever has such a moment what is his consolation 
7515_100431_000008_000007	train-clean-360	It can only be that he is helping Justice to be administered 
7515_100431_000008_000008	train-clean-360	If he is to be proud of his profession and in that lonely moment tolerant of himself he must feel that he is taking a noble part in the vindication of legal right the punishment of legal wrong 
7515_100431_000008_000009	train-clean-360	But he must do more than this 
none	none	Just as the doctor with increased knowledge and experience becomes a better fighter against disease advancing himself no doubt but advancing also medical science just as the schoolmaster having learnt new and better ways of teaching can now give a better education to his boys increasing thereby the sum of knowledge so the barrister must be able to tell himself that the more expert he becomes as an advocate the better will he be able to help in the administration of this Justice which is his ideal 
7515_100431_000009_000000	train-clean-360	Can he tell himself this 
7515_100431_000009_000001	train-clean-360	I do not see how he can 
7515_100431_000009_000002	train-clean-360	His increased expertness will be of increased service to himself of increased service to his clients but no ideal will be the better served by reason of it 
none	none	Let us take a case Smith v Jones 
7515_100431_000009_000005	train-clean-360	Counsel is briefed for Smith 
7515_100431_000009_000006	train-clean-360	After examining the case he tells himself in effect this As far as I can see the Law is all on the other side 
7515_100431_000009_000007	train-clean-360	Luckily however sentiment is on our side 
7515_100431_000009_000008	train-clean-360	Given an impressionable jury there s just a chance that we might pull it off 
7515_100431_000009_000009	train-clean-360	It s worth trying He tries and if he is sufficiently expert he pulls it off 
7515_100431_000009_000010	train-clean-360	A triumph for himself but what has happened to the ideal 
7515_100431_000009_000011	train-clean-360	Did he even think Of course I m bound to do the best for my client but he s in the wrong and I hope we lose I imagine not 
7515_100431_000009_000012	train-clean-360	The whole teaching of the Bar is that he must not bother about justice but only about his own victory What ultimately then is he after 
7515_100431_000009_000013	train-clean-360	What does the Bar offer its devotees beyond material success 
7515_100431_000010_000000	train-clean-360	I asked just now what were a barrister s ideals 
7515_100431_000010_000001	train-clean-360	Suppose we ask instead What is the ideal barrister 
7515_100431_000010_000002	train-clean-360	If one spoke loosely of an ideal doctor one would not necessarily mean a titled gentleman in Harley Street 
7515_100431_000010_000003	train-clean-360	An ideal schoolmaster is not synonymous with the Headmaster of Eton or the owner of the most profitable preparatory school 
7515_100431_000010_000004	train-clean-360	But can there be an ideal barrister other than a successful barrister 
7515_100431_000010_000005	train-clean-360	The eager young writer just beginning a literary career might fix his eyes upon Francis Thompson rather than upon Sir Hall Caine the eager young clergyman might dream dreams over the Life of Father Damien more often than over the Life of the Archbishop of Canterbury but to what star can the eager young barrister hitch his wagon save to the star of material success 
7515_100431_000010_000006	train-clean-360	If he does not see himself as Sir Edward Carson it is only because he thinks that perhaps after all Sir John Simon s manner is the more effective 
7515_100431_000011_000000	train-clean-360	There may be other answers to the questions I have asked than the answers I have given but it is no answer to ask me how the law can be administered without barristers 
7515_100431_000011_000001	train-clean-360	I do not know nor do I know how the roads can be swept without getting somebody to sweep them 
7515_100431_000011_000002	train-clean-360	But that would not disqualify me from saying that road sweeping was an unattractive profession 
7515_100431_000011_000003	train-clean-360	So also I am entitled to my opinion about the Bar which is this 
none	none	That because it offers material victories only and never spiritual ones that because there can be no standard by which its disciples are judged save the earthly standard that because there is no place within its ranks for the altruist or the idealist for these reasons the Bar is not one of the noble professions A Word for Autumn Last night the waiter put the celery on with the cheese and I knew that summer was indeed dead Other signs of autumn there may be the reddening leaf the chill in the early morning air the misty evenings but none of these comes home to me so truly There may be cool mornings in July in a year of drought the leaves may change before their time it is only with the first celery that summer is over I knew all along that it would not last Even in April I was saying that winter would soon be here Yet somehow it had begun to seem possible lately that a miracle might happen that summer might drift on and on through the months a final upheaval to crown a wonderful year The celery settled that Last night with the celery autumn came into its own There is a crispness about celery that is of the essence of October It is as fresh and clean as a rainy day after a spell of heat It crackles pleasantly in the mouth Moreover it is excellent I am told for the complexion One is always hearing of things which are good for the complexion but there is no doubt that celery stands high on the list After the burns and freckles of summer one is in need of something How good that celery should be there at one s elbow A week ago A little more cheese waiter a week ago I grieved for the dying summer I wondered how I could possibly bear the waiting the eight long months till May In vain to comfort myself with the thought that I could get through more work in the winter undistracted by thoughts of cricket grounds and country houses In vain equally to tell myself that I could stay in bed later in the mornings Even the thought of after breakfast pipes in front of the fire left me cold But now suddenly I am reconciled to autumn I see quite clearly that all good things must come to an end The summer has been splendid but it has lasted long enough This morning I welcomed the chill in the air this morning I viewed the falling leaves with cheerfulness and this morning I said to myself Why of course I ll have celery for lunch More bread waiter Season of mists and mellow fruitfulness said Keats not actually picking out celery in so many words but plainly including it in the general blessings of the autumn Yet what an opportunity he missed by not concentrating on that precious root Apples grapes nuts and vegetable marrows he mentions specially and how poor a selection For apples and grapes are not typical of any month so ubiquitous are they vegetable marrows are vegetables pour rire and have no place in any serious consideration of the seasons while as for nuts have we not a national song which asserts distinctly Here we go gathering nuts in May Season of mists and mellow celery then let it be A pat of butter underneath the bough a wedge of cheese a loaf of bread and Thou How delicate are the tender shoots unfolded layer by layer Of what a whiteness is the last baby one of all of what a sweetness his flavour It is well that this should be the last rite of the meal finis coronat opus so that we may go straight on to the business of the pipe Celery demands a pipe rather than a cigar and it can be eaten better in an inn or a London tavern than in the home Yes and it should be eaten alone for it is the only food which one really wants to hear oneself eat Besides in company one may have to consider the wants of others Celery is not a thing to share with any man Alone in your country inn you may call for the celery but if you are wise you will see that no other traveller wanders into the room Take warning from one who has learnt a lesson One day I lunched alone at an inn finishing with cheese and celery Another traveller came in and lunched too We did not speak I was busy with my celery From the other end of the table he reached across for the cheese That was all right it was the public cheese But he also reached across for the celery my private celery for which I owed Foolishly you know how one does I had left the sweetest and crispest shoots till the last tantalizing myself pleasantly with the thought of them Horror to see them snatched from me by a stranger He realized later what he had done and apologized but of what good is an apology in such circumstances Yet at least the tragedy was not without its value Now one remembers to lock the door Yes I can face the winter with calm I suppose I had forgotten what it was really like I had been thinking of the winter as a horrid wet dreary time fit only for professional football Now I can see other things crisp and sparkling days long pleasant evenings cheery fires Good work shall be done this winter Life shall be lived well The end of the summer is not the end of the world Here s to October and waiter some more celery A Christmas Number The common joke against the Christmas number is that it is planned in July and made up in September This enables it to be published in the middle of November and circulated in New Zealand by Christmas If it were published in England at Christmas New Zealand wouldn t get it till February Apparently it is more important that the colonies should have it punctually than that we should Anyway whenever it is made up all journalists hate the Christmas number But they only hate it for one reason this being that the ordinary weekly number has to be made up at the same time As a journalist I should like to devote the autumn exclusively to the Christmas number and as a member of the public I should adore it when it came out Not having been asked to produce such a number on my own I can amuse myself here by sketching out a plan for it I follow the fine old tradition First let us get the stories settled Story No one deals with the escaped convict The heroine is driving back from the country house ball where she has had two or three proposals when suddenly in the most lonely part of the snow swept moor a figure springs out of the ditch and covers the coachman with a pistol Alarms and confusions Oh sir says the heroine spare my aunt and I will give you all my jewels The convict for such it is staggers back Lucy he cries Harold she gasps The aunt says nothing for she has swooned At this point the story stops to explain how Harold came to be in knickerbockers He had either been falsely accused or else he had been a solicitor Anyhow he had by this time more than paid for his folly and Lucy still loved him Get in she says and drives him home Next day he leaves for New Zealand in an ordinary lounge suit Need I say that Lucy joins him later No that shall be left for your imagination The End So much for the first story The second is an i faith and stap me story of the good old days It is not seasonable for most of the action takes place in my lord s garden amid the scent of roses but it brings back to us the old romantic days when fighting and swearing were more picturesque than they are now and when women loved and worked samplers This sort of story can be read best in front of the Christmas log it is of the past and comes naturally into a Christmas number I shall not describe its plot for that is unimportant it is the stap me s and the la sirs which matter But I may say that she marries him all right in the end and he goes off happily to the wars We want another story What shall this one be about It might be about the amateur burglar or the little child who reconciled old Sir John to his daughter s marriage or the ghost at Enderby Grange or the millionaire s Christmas dinner or the accident to the Scotch express Personally I do not care for any of these my vote goes for the desert island story Proud Lady Julia has fallen off the deck of the liner and Ronald refused by her that morning dives off the hurricane deck or the bowsprit or wherever he happens to be and seizes her as she is sinking for the third time It is a foggy night and their absence is unnoticed Dawn finds them together on a little coral reef They are in no danger for several liners are due to pass in a day or two and Ronald s pockets are full of biscuits and chocolate but it is awkward for Lady Julia who had hoped that they would never meet again So they sit on the beach back to back drawn by Dana Gibson and throw sarcastic remarks over their shoulders at each other In the end he tames her proud spirit I think by hiding the turtles eggs from her and the next liner but one takes the happy couple back to civilization But it is time we had some poetry I propose to give you one serious poem about robins and one double page humorous piece well illustrated in colours I think the humorous verses must deal with hunting Hunting does not lend itself to humour for there are only two hunting jokes the joke of the horse which came down at the brook and the joke of the Cockney who overrode hounds but there are traditions to keep up and the artist always loves it So far we have not considered the artist sufficiently Let us give him four full pages One of pretty girls hanging up mistletoe one of the squire and his family going to church in the snow one of a brokendown coach with highwaymen coming over the hill and one of the postman bringing loads and loads of parcels You have all Christmas in those four pictures But there is room for another page let it be a coloured page of half a dozen sketches the period and the lettering very early English Ye Baron de Marchebankes calleth for hys varlet Ye varlet cometh righte hastilie You know the delightful kind of thing I confess that this is the sort of Christmas number which I love You may say that you have seen it all before I say that that is why I love it The best of Christmas is that it reminds us of other Christmases it should be the boast of Christmas numbers that they remind us of other Christmas numbers But though I doubt if I shall get quite what I want from any one number this year yet there will surely be enough in all the numbers to bring Christmas very pleasantly before the eyes In a dull November one likes to be reminded that Christmas is coming It is perhaps as well that the demands of the colonies give us our Christmas numbers so early At the same time it is difficult to see why New Zealand wants a Christmas number at all As I glance above at the plan of my model paper I feel more than ever how adorable it would be but not oh not with the thermometer at a hundred in the shade No Flowers by Request If a statement is untrue it is not the more respectable because it has been said in Latin We owe the war directly no doubt to the Kaiser but indirectly to the Roman idiot who said Si vis pacem para bellum Having mislaid my Dictionary of Quotations I cannot give you his name but I have my money on him as the greatest murderer in history Yet there have always been people who would quote this classical lie as if it were at least as authoritative as anything said in the Sermon on the Mount It was said a long time ago and in a strange language that was enough for them In the same way they will say De mortuis nil nisi bonum But I warn them solemnly that it will take a good deal more than this to stop me from saying what I want to say about the recently expired month of February I have waited purposely until February was dead Cynics may say that this was only wisdom in that a damnatory notice from me might have inspired that unhappy month to an unusually brilliant run out of sheer wilfulness I prefer to think that it was good manners which forbade me to be disrespectful to her very face It is bad manners to speak the truth to the living but February is dead De mortuis nil nisi veritas The truth about poor February is that she is the worst month of the year But let us be fair to her She has never had a chance We cannot say to her Look upon this picture and on this This you might have been this you are There is no might have been for her no ideal February The perfect June we can imagine for ourselves Personally I do not mind how hot it be but there must be plenty of strawberries The perfect April ah one dare not think of the perfect April That can only happen in the next world Yet April may always be striving for it though she never reach it But the perfect February what is it I know not Let us pity February then even while we blame her For February comes just when we are sick of winter and therefore she may not be wintry Wishing to do her best she ventures her spring costume crocus and primrose and daffodil days days when the first faint perfume of mint is blown down the breezes and one begins to wonder how the lambs are shaping Is that the ideal February Ah no For we cannot be deceived We know that spring is not here that March is to come with its frosts and perchance its snows a worse March for the milder February a plunge back into the winter which poor February tried to flatter us was over Such a February is a murderer an accessory to the murders of March She lays the ground bait for the victims Out pop the stupid little flowers eager to be deceived one could forgive the annuals but the perennials ought to know better by now and down comes March a roaring lion to gobble them up And how much lost fruit do we not owe to February One feels a layman like myself feels that it should be enough to have a strawberry bed a peach tree a fig tree If these are not enough then the addition of a gardener should make the thing a certainty Yet how often will not a gardener refer one back to February as the real culprit The tree blossomed too early the late frosts killed it in the annoyance of the moment one may reproach the gardener for allowing it to blossom so prematurely but one cannot absolve February of all blame It is no good then for February to try to be spring no hope for her to please us by prolonging winter What is left to her She cannot even give us the pleasure of the hairshirt Did April follow her she could make the joys of that wonderful month even keener for us by the contrast but she is followed by March What can one do with March One does not wear a hair shirt merely to enjoy the pleasure of following it by one slightly less hairy Well we may agree that February is no good Oh to be out of England now that February s here is what Browning should have said One has no use for her in this country Pope Gregory or whoever it was that arranged the calendar must have had influential relations in England who urged on him the need for making February the shortest month of the year Let us be grateful to His Holiness that he was so persuaded He was a little obstinate about Leap Year a more imaginative pontiff would have given the extra day to April but he was amenable enough for a man who only had his relations word for it Every first of March I raise my glass to Gregory Even as a boy I used to drink one of his powders to him at about this time of the year February fill dyke Well that s all that can be said for it The Unfairness of Things The most interesting column in any paper always excepting those which I write myself is that entitled The World s Press wherein one may observe the world as it appears to a press of which one has for the most part never heard It is in this column that I have just made the acquaintance of The Shoe Manufacturers Monthly the journal to which the elect turn eagerly upon each new moon Its one time rival The Footwear Fortnightly has I am told quite lost its following The bon mot of the current number of The S M M is a note to the effect that Kaffirs have a special fondness for boots which make a noise I quote this simply as an excuse for referring to the old problem of the squeaky boots and the squeaky collar the problem in fact of the unfairness of things The majors and clubmen who assist their country with columns of advice on clothes have often tried to explain why a collar squeaks but have never done so to the satisfaction of any man of intelligence They say that the collar is too large or too small too dirty or too clean They say that if you have your collars made for you like a gentleman you will be all right but that if you buy the cheap ready made article what can you expect They say that a little soap on the outside of the shirt or a little something on the inside of something else that this that and the other will abate the nuisance They are quite wrong The simple truth and everybody knows it really is that collars squeak for some people and not for others A squeaky collar round the neck of a man is a comment not upon the collar but upon the man That man is unlucky Things are against him Nature may have done all for him that she could have given him a handsome outside and a noble inside but the world of inanimate objects is against him We all know the man whom children or dogs love instinctively It is a rare gift to be able to inspire this affection The Fates have been kind to him But to inspire the affection of inanimate things is something greater The man to whom a collar or a window sash takes instinctively is a man who may truly be said to have luck on his side Consider him for a moment His collar never squeaks his clothes take a delight in fitting him At a dinner party he walks as by instinct straight to his seat what time you and I are dragging our partners round and round the table in search of our cards The windows of taxicabs open to him easily When he travels by train his luggage works its way to the front of the van and is the first to jump out at Paddington String hastens to undo itself when he approaches he is the only man who can make a decent impression with sealing wax If he is asked by the hostess in a crowded drawing room to ring the bell that bell comes out from behind the sofa where it hid from us and places itself in a convenient spot before his eyes Asparagus stiffens itself at sight of him macaroni winds itself round his fork You will observe that I am not describing just the ordinary lucky man He may lose thousands on the Stock Exchange he may be jilted whenever he goes to the Oval to see Hobbs Hobbs may be out first ball he may invariably get mixed up in railway accidents That is a kind of ill luck which one can bear not indeed without grumbling but without rancour The man who is unlucky to experience these things at least has the consolation of other people s sympathy but the man who is the butt of inanimate things has no one s sympathy We may be on a motor bus which overturns and nobody will say that it is our fault but if our collar deliberately and maliciously squeaks everybody will say that we ought to buy better collars if our dinner cards hide from us or the string of our parcel works itself into knots we are called clumsy our asparagus and macaroni give us a reputation for bad manners our luggage gets us a name for dilatoriness I think we we others have a right to complain However lucky we may be in other ways if we have not this luck of inanimate things we have a right to complain It is pleasant I admit to win five hundred on the Stock Exchange by a stroke of sheer good fortune but even in the blue of this there is a cloud for the next five hundred that we win by a stroke of shrewd business will certainly be put down to luck Luck is given the credit of all our successes but the other man is given the credit of all his luck That is why we have a right to complain I do not know why things should conspire against a man Perhaps there is some justice in it It is possible nay probable that the man whom things love is hated by animals and children even by his fellow men Certainly he is hated by me Indeed the more I think of him the more I see that he is not a nice man in any way The gods have neglected him he has no good qualities He is a worm No wonder then that this small compensation is doled out to him the gift of getting on with inanimate things This gives him with the unthinking a certain reputation for readiness and dexterity If ever you meet a man with such a reputation you will know what he really is Circumstances connected with the hour at which I rose this morning ordained that I should write this article in a dressing gown I shall now put on a collar I hope it will squeak Daffodils The confession book I suppose has disappeared It is twenty years since I have seen one As a boy I told some inquisitive owner what was my favourite food porridge I fancy my favourite hero in real life and in fiction my favourite virtue in woman and so forth I was a boy and it didn t really matter what were my likes and dislikes then for I was bound to outgrow them But Heaven help the journalist of those days who had to sign his name to opinions so definite For when a writer has said in print as I am going to say directly that the daffodil is his favourite flower simply because looking round his room for inspiration he has seen a bowl of daffodils on his table and thought it beautiful it would be hard on him if some confession album owner were to expose him in the following issue as already committed on oath to the violet Imaginative art would become impossible Fortunately I have no commitments and I may affirm that the daffodil is and always has been my favourite flower Many people will put their money on the rose but it is impossible that the rose can give them the pleasure which the daffodil gives them just as it is impossible that a thousand pounds can give Rockefeller the pleasure which it gives you or me For the daffodil comes not only before the swallow comes which is a matter of indifference as nobody thinks any the worse of the swallow in consequence but before all the many flowers of summer it comes on the heels of a flowerless winter Whereby it is as superior to the rose as an oasis in the Sahara is to champagne at a wedding Yes a favourite flower must be a spring flower there is no doubt about that You have your choice then of the daffodil the violet the primrose and the crocus The bluebell comes too late the cowslip is but an indifferent primrose camelias and anemones and all the others which occur to you come into a different class Well then will you choose the violet or the crocus Or will you follow the legendary Disraeli and have primroses on your statue I write as one who spends most of his life in London and for me the violet the primrose and the crocus are lacking in the same necessary quality they pick badly My favourite flower must adorn my house to show itself off to the best advantage within doors it must have a long stalk A crocus least of all is a flower to be plucked I admit its charm as the first hint of spring that is vouchsafed to us in the parks but I want it nearer home than that You cannot pick a crocus and put it in water nor can you be so cruel as to spoil the primrose and the violet by taking them from their natural setting but the daffodil cries aloud to be picked It is what it is waiting for Long stalks please Who being commanded by his lady to bring in flowers for the house has not received this warning And was there ever a stalk to equal the daffodil s for length and firmness and beauty Other flowers must have foliage to set them off but daffodils can stand by themselves in a bowl and their green and yellow dress brings all spring into the room A house with daffodils in it is a house lit up whether or no the sun be shining outside Daffodils in a green bowl and let it snow if it will Wordsworth wrote a poem about daffodils He wrote poems about most flowers If a plant would be unique it must be one which had never inspired him to song But he did not write about daffodils in a bowl The daffodils which I celebrate are stationary Wordsworth s lived on the banks of Ullswater and fluttered and tossed their heads and danced in the breeze He hints that in their company even he might have been jocose a terrifying thought which makes me happier to have mine safely indoors When he first saw them there so he says he gazed and gazed and little thought what wealth the show to him had brought Strictly speaking it hadn t brought him in anything at the moment but he must have known from his previous experiences with the daisy and the celandine that it was good for a certain amount A simple daffodil to him Was so much matter for a slim Volume at two and four You may say of course that I am in no better case but then I have never reproached other people as he did for thinking of a primrose merely as a primrose But whether you prefer them my way or Wordsworth s indoors or outdoors will make no difference in this further matter to which finally I call your attention Was there ever a more beautiful name in the world than daffodil Say it over to yourself and then say agapanthus or chrysanthemum or anything else you please and tell me if the daffodils do not have it Pansies lilies kingcups daisies Let them live upon their praises Long as there s a sun that sets Primroses will have their glory Long as there are violets They will have a place in story But for flowers my bowls to fill Give me just the daffodil As Wordsworth ought to have said A Household Book

7517_100437_000004_000001	train-clean-100	I say the second best so that if you remind me of Tom Jones or The Mayor of Casterbridge or any other that you fancy I can say that of course that one is the best Well I discovered him just as Voltaire discovered Habakkuk or your little boy discovered Shakespeare the other day and I committed my discovery to the world in two glowing articles 
7517_100437_000004_000002	train-clean-100	Not unnaturally the world remained unmoved 
7517_100437_000004_000003	train-clean-100	It knew all about Samuel Butler 
7517_100437_000005_000000	train-clean-100	Last week I discovered a Frenchman Claude Tillier who wrote in the early part of last century a book called Mon Oncle Benjamin which may be freely translated My Uncle Benjamin I read it in the translation Eager as I am to be lyrical about it I shall refrain 
7517_100437_000005_000001	train-clean-100	I think that I am probably safer with Tillier than with Butler but I dare not risk it 
7517_100437_000005_000002	train-clean-100	The thought of your scorn at my previous ignorance of the world famous Tillier your amused contempt because I have only just succeeded in borrowing the classic upon which you were brought up this is too much for me Let us say no more about it 
7517_100437_000005_000003	train-clean-100	Claude Tillier who has not heard of Claude Tillier 
none	none	Mon oncle Benjamin who has not read it in French or as I did in American 
7517_100437_000005_000005	train-clean-100	Let us pass on to another book 
7517_100437_000006_000000	train-clean-100	For I am going to speak of another discovery of a book which should be a classic but is not of a book of which nobody has heard unless through me 
7517_100437_000006_000001	train-clean-100	It was published some twelve years ago the last published book of a well known writer 
none	none	When I tell you his name you will say Oh yes 
7517_100437_000006_000003	train-clean-100	I LOVE his books and you will mention SO AND SO and its equally famous sequel SUCH AND SUCH But when I ask you if you have read MY book you will profess surprise and say that you have never heard of it 
7517_100437_000006_000004	train-clean-100	 Is it as good as SO AND SO and SUCH AND SUCH you will ask hardly believing that this could be possible 
7517_100437_000006_000005	train-clean-100	 Much better I shall reply and there if these things were arranged properly would be another ten per cent in my pocket 
7517_100437_000006_000006	train-clean-100	But believe me I shall be quite content with your gratitude 
7517_100437_000006_000007	train-clean-100	Well the writer of my book is Kenneth Grahame 
7517_100437_000006_000008	train-clean-100	You have heard of him 
7517_100437_000006_000009	train-clean-100	Good I thought so 
7517_100437_000006_000010	train-clean-100	The books you have read are The Golden Age and Dream Days 
7517_100437_000006_000011	train-clean-100	Am I not right 
7517_100437_000006_000012	train-clean-100	Thank you 
7517_100437_000006_000013	train-clean-100	But the book you have not read my book is The Wind in the Willows 
7517_100437_000006_000014	train-clean-100	Am I not right again 
7517_100437_000006_000015	train-clean-100	Ah I was afraid so 
7517_100437_000007_000000	train-clean-100	The reason why I knew you had not read it is the reason why I call it my book 
7517_100437_000007_000001	train-clean-100	For the last ten or twelve years I have been recommending it 
7517_100437_000007_000002	train-clean-100	Usually I speak about it at my first meeting with a stranger 
7517_100437_000007_000003	train-clean-100	It is my opening remark just as yours is something futile about the weather 
7517_100437_000007_000004	train-clean-100	If I don t get it in at the beginning I squeeze it in at the end 
none	none	The stranger has got to have it some time 
7517_100437_000007_000006	train-clean-100	Should I ever find myself in the dock and one never knows my answer to the question whether I had anything to say would be Well my lord if I might just recommend a book to the jury before leaving mister Justice Darling would probably pretend that he had read it but he wouldn t deceive me 
7517_100437_000008_000000	train-clean-100	For one cannot recommend a book to all the hundreds of people whom one has met in ten years without discovering whether it is well known or not 
none	none	It is the amazing truth that none of those hundreds had heard of The Wind in the Willows until I told them about it Some of them had never heard of Kenneth Grahame well one did not have to meet them again and it takes all sorts to make a world 
7517_100437_000008_000003	train-clean-100	But most of them were in your position great admirers of the author and his two earlier famous books but ignorant thereafter 
7517_100437_000008_000004	train-clean-100	I had their promise before they left me and waited confidently for their gratitude 
7517_100437_000008_000005	train-clean-100	No doubt they also spread the good news in their turn and it is just possible that it reached you in this way but it was to me none the less that your thanks were due 
7517_100437_000008_000006	train-clean-100	For instance you may have noticed a couple of casual references to it as if it were a classic known to all in a famous novel published last year 
7517_100437_000008_000007	train-clean-100	It was I who introduced that novelist to it six months before 
7517_100437_000008_000008	train-clean-100	Indeed I feel sometimes that it was I who wrote The Wind in the Willows and recommended it to Kenneth Grahame but perhaps I am wrong here for I have not the pleasure of his acquaintance 
7517_100437_000008_000009	train-clean-100	Nor as I have already lamented am I financially interested in its sale an explanation which suspicious strangers require from me sometimes 
7517_100437_000009_000000	train-clean-100	I shall not describe the book for no description would help it But I shall just say this that it is what I call a Household Book 
7517_100437_000009_000001	train-clean-100	By a Household Book I mean a book which everybody in the household loves and quotes continually ever afterwards a book which is read aloud to every new guest and is regarded as the touchstone of his worth 
7517_100437_000009_000002	train-clean-100	But it is a book which makes you feel that though everybody in the house loves it it is only you who really appreciate it at its true value and that the others are scarcely worthy of it 
7517_100437_000009_000003	train-clean-100	It is obvious you persuade yourself that the author was thinking of you when he wrote it 
none	none	I hope this will please Jones were his final words as he laid down his pen 
7517_100437_000010_000000	train-clean-100	Well of course you will order the book at once 
none	none	But I must give you one word of warning 
7517_100437_000010_000002	train-clean-100	When you sit down to it don t be so ridiculous as to suppose that you are sitting in judgment on my taste still less on the genius of Kenneth Grahame 
7517_100437_000010_000003	train-clean-100	You are merely sitting in judgment on yourself 
7517_100437_000010_000004	train-clean-100	You may be worthy I do not know 
none	none	But it is you who are on trial Lunch Food is a subject of conversation more spiritually refreshing even than the weather for the number of possible remarks about the weather is limited whereas of food you can talk on and on and on Moreover no heat of controversy is induced by mention of the atmospheric conditions seeing that we are all agreed as to what is a good day and what is a bad one and where there can be no controversy there can be no intimacy in agreement But tastes in food differ so sharply as has been well said in Latin and I believe also in French that a pronounced agreement in them is of all bonds of union the most intimate Thus if a man hates tapioca pudding he is a good fellow and my friend To each his favourite meal But if I say that lunch is mine I do not mean that I should like lunch for breakfast dinner and tea I do not mean that of the four meals or five counting supper lunch is the one which I most enjoy at which I do myself most complete justice This is so far from being true that I frequently miss lunch altogether the exigencies of the journalistic profession To day for instance I shall probably miss it No what I mean is that lunch is the meal which in the abstract appeals to me most because of its catholicity We breakfast and dine at home or at other people s homes but we give ourselves up to London for lunch and London has provided an amazing variety for us We can have six courses and a bottle of champagne with a view of the river or one poached egg and a box of dominoes with a view of the skylights we can sit or we can stand and without doubt we could if we wished recline in the Roman fashion we can spend two hours or five minutes at it we can have something different every day of the week or cling permanently as I know one man to do to a chop and chips and what you do with the chips I have never discovered for they combine so little of nourishment with so much of inconvenience that Nature can never have meant them for provender Perhaps as counters But I am wandering from my theme There is this of romance about lunch that one can imagine great adventures with stockbrokers actor managers publishers and other demigods to have had their birth at the luncheon table If it is a question of bulling margarine or bearing boot polish if the name for the new play is still unsettled if there is some idea of an American edition whatever the emergency the final word on the subject is always the same Come and have lunch with me and we ll talk it over and when the waiter has taken your hat and coat and you have looked diffidently at the menu and in reply to your host s question What will you drink have made the only possible reply Oh anything that you re drinking thus showing him that you don t insist on a bottle to yourself THEN you settle down to business and the history of England is enlarged by who can say how many pages And not only does one inaugurate business matters at lunch but one also renews old friendships Who has not had said to him in the Strand Hallo old fellow I haven t seen you for ages you must come and lunch with me one day And who has not answered Rather I should love to and passed on with a glow at the heart which has not died out until the next day when the incident is forgotten An invitation to dinner is formal to tea unnecessary to breakfast impossible but there is a casualness very friendly and pleasant about invitations to lunch which make them complete in themselves and in no way dependent on any lunch which may or may not follow Without having exhausted the subject of lunch in London and I should like to say that it is now certain that I shall not have time to partake to day let us consider for a moment lunch in the country I do not mean lunch in the open air for it is obvious that there is no meal so heavenly as lunch thus eaten and in a short article like this I have no time in which to dwell upon the obvious I mean lunch at a country house Now the most pleasant feature of lunch at a country house is this that you may sit next to whomsoever you please At dinner she may be entrusted to quite the wrong man at breakfast you are faced with the problem of being neither too early for her nor yet too late for a seat beside her at tea people have a habit of taking your chair at the moment when a simple act of courtesy has drawn you from it in search of bread and butter but at lunch you follow her in and there you are fixed But there is a place neither London nor the country which brings out more than any other place all that is pleasant in lunch It was really the recent experience of this which set me writing about lunch Lunch in the train It should be the second meal about one point thirty because then you are really some distance from London and are hungry The panorama flashes by outside nearer and nearer comes the beautiful West you cross rivers and hurry by little villages you pass slowly and reverently through strange old towns and inside the waiter leaves the potatoes next to you and slips away Well it is his own risk Here goes What I say is that if a man really likes potatoes he must be a pretty decent sort of fellow 
7502-100439-0000	train-other-500	The Friend of Man When swords went out of fashion walking sticks I suppose came into fashion The present custom has its advantages Even in his busiest day the hero s sword must have returned at times to its scabbard
7502-100439-0001	train-other-500	and what would he do then with nothing in his right hand But our walking sticks have no scabbards We grasp them always ready at any moment to summon a cab to point out a view or to dig an enemy in the stomach Meanwhile we slash the air in defiance of the world
7502-100439-0002	train-other-500	My first stick was a malacca silver at the collar and polished horn as to the handle For weeks it looked beseechingly at me from a shop window until a lucky birthday tip sent me in after it We went back to school together that afternoon
none	none	 and if anything can lighten the cloud which hangs over the last day of holidays it is the glory of some such stick as mine 
7502-100439-0003	train-other-500	Of course it was too beautiful to live long yet its death became it I had left many a parental umbrella in the train unhonoured and unsung My malacca was mislaid in an hotel in Norway
none	none	 And even now when the blinds are drawn and we pull up our chairs closer round the wood fire 
7502-100439-0004	train-other-500	what time travellers tell to awestruck stay at homes tales of adventure in distant lands even now if by a lucky chance Norway is mentioned I tap the logs carelessly with the poker and drawl I suppose you didn t happen to stay at Vossvangen
7502-100439-0005	train-other-500	I left a malacca cane there once Rather a good one too
none	none	 So that there is an impression among my friends that there is hardly a town in Europe but has had its legacy from me And this I owe to my stick 
7502-100439-0006	train-other-500	My last is of ebony ivory topped
none	none	 Even though I should spend another fortnight abroad 
7502-100439-0007	train-other-500	I could not take this stick with me It is not a stick for the country its heart is in Piccadilly Perhaps it might thrive in Paris if it could stand the sea voyage But no I cannot see it crossing the Channel in a cap I am no companion for it
7502-100439-0008	train-other-500	Could I step on to the boat in a silk hat and then retire below but I am always unwell below and that would not suit its dignity It stands now in a corner of my room crying aloud to be taken to the opera I used to dislike men who took canes to Covent Garden
7502-100439-0009	train-other-500	but I see now how it must have been with them An ebony stick topped with ivory has to be humoured Already I am considering a silk lined cape and it is settled that my gloves are to have black stitchings Such is my last stick
7502-100439-0010	train-other-500	for it was given to me this very morning At my first sight of it I thought that it might replace the common one which I lost in an Easter train That was silly of me I must have a stick of less gentle birth which is not afraid to be seen with a soft hat
none	none	 It must be a stick which I can drop or on occasion kick 
7502-100439-0011	train-other-500	one with which I can slash dandelions one for which when ultimately I leave it in a train conscience does not drag me to Scotland Yard In short a companionable stick for a day s journey a country stick
7502-100439-0012	train-other-500	The ideal country stick will never be found It must be thick enough to stand much rough usage of a sort which I will explain presently and yet it must be thin so that it makes a pleasant whistling sound through the air
none	none	 Its handle must be curved so that it can pull down the spray of blossom of which you are in need 
7502-100439-0013	train-other-500	or pull up the luncheon basket which you want even more badly
none	none	 and yet it must be straight so that you can drive an old golf ball with it 
7502-100439-0014	train-other-500	It must be unadorned so that it shall lack ostentation and yet it must have a band so that when you throw stones at it you can count two if you hit the silver You begin to see how difficult it is to achieve the perfect stick Well
7502-100439-0015	train-other-500	each one of us must let go those properties which his own stick can do best without For myself I insist on this my stick must be good for hitting and good to hit with A stick we are agreed is something to have in the hand when walking
7502-100439-0016	train-other-500	But there are times when we sit down and if our journey shall have taken us to the beach our stick must at once be propped in the sand while from a suitable distance we throw stones at it However beautiful the sea its beauty can only be appreciated properly in this fashion
none	none	 Scenery must not be taken at a gulp 
7502-100439-0017	train-other-500	we must absorb it unconsciously With the mind gently exercised as to whether we scored a two on the band or a one just below it and with the muscles of the arm at stretch we are in a state ideally receptive of beauty And for my other essential of a country stick
7502-100439-0018	train-other-500	it must be possible to grasp it by the wrong end and hit a ball with it So it must have no ferrule and the handle must be heavy and straight
none	none	 In this way was golf born its creator roamed the fields after his picnic lunch knocking along the cork from his bottle At first he took seventy nine from the gate in one field to the oak tree in the next afterwards fifty four Then suddenly he saw the game We cannot say that he w is no lover of Nature The desire to knock a ball about to play silly games with a stick comes upon a man most keenly when he is happy let it be ascribed that he is happy to the streams and the hedges and the sunlight through the trees And so let my stick have a handle heavy and straight and let there be no ferrule on the end Be sure that I have an old golf ball in my pocket In London one is not so particular 
7502-100439-0019	train-other-500	Chiefly we want a stick for leaning on when we are talking to an acquaintance suddenly met After the initial Hulloa and the discovery that we have nothing else of importance to say the situation is distinctly eased by the remembrance of our stick It gives us a support moral and physical
7502-100439-0020	train-other-500	such as is supplied in a drawing room by a cigarette For this purpose size and shape are immaterial Yet this much is essential it must not be too slippery or in our nervousness we may drop it altogether My ebony stick with the polished ivory top
none	none	 But I have already decided that my ebony stick is out of place with the everyday hat It stands in its corner waiting for the opera season I must get another stick for rough work The Diary Habit A newspaper has been lamenting the decay of the diary keeping habit with the natural result that several correspondents have written to say that they have kept diaries all their lives 
7502-100440-0000	train-other-500	No doubt all these diaries now contain the entry
none	none	 Wrote to the Daily to deny the assertion that the diary keeping habit is on the wane 
7502-100440-0001	train-other-500	Of such little things are diaries made I suppose this is the reason why diaries are so rarely kept nowadays that nothing ever happens to anybody
none	none	 A diary would be worth writing up if it could be written like this 
7502-100440-0002	train-other-500	MONDAY Another exciting day Shot a couple of hooligans on my way to business and was forced to give my card to the police On arriving at the office was surprised to find the building on fire
7502-100440-0003	train-other-500	but was just in time to rescue the confidential treaty between England and Switzerland Had this been discovered by the public war would infallibly have resulted Went out to lunch and saw a runaway elephant in the Strand Thought little of it at the time
7502-100440-0004	train-other-500	but mentioned it to my wife in the evening She agreed that it was worth recording TUESDAY
none	none	 Letter from solicitor informing me that I have come into one million through the will of an Australian gold digger named Tomkins On referring to my diary I find that I saved his life two years ago by plunging into the Serpentine This is very gratifying 
7502-100440-0005	train-other-500	Was late at the office as I had to look in at the Palace on the way in order to get knighted but managed to get a good deal of work done before I was interrupted by a madman with a razor
none	none	 who demanded one hundred Shot him after a desperate struggle Tea at an ABC where I met the Duke of 
7502-100440-0007	train-other-500	Fell into the Thames on my way home but swam ashore without difficulty Alas we cannot do this Our diaries are very prosaic very dull indeed They read like this
7502-100440-0008	train-other-500	Monday Felt inclined to stay in bed this morning and send an excuse to the office but was all right after a bath and breakfast
none	none	 Worked till one point thirty and had lunch 
7502-100440-0009	train-other-500	Afterwards worked till five and had my hair cut on the way home After dinner read A Man s Passion by Theodora Popgood Rotten Went to bed at eleven Tuesday Had a letter from Jane
7502-100440-0010	train-other-500	Did some good work in the morning and at lunch met Henry who asked me to play golf with him on Saturday Told him I was playing with Peter but said I would like a game with him on the Saturday after However it turned out he was playing with William then so we couldn t fix anything up
none	none	 Bought a pair of shoes on my way home but think they will be too tight The man says though that they will stretch 
7502-100440-0011	train-other-500	Wednesday Played dominoes at lunch and won fivepence If this sort of diary is now falling into decay
none	none	 the world is not losing much But at least it is a harmless pleasure to some 
7502-100440-0012	train-other-500	to enter up their day s doings each evening and in years to come it may just possibly be of interest to the diarist to know that it was on Monday
none	none	 twenty seventh April that he had his hair cut Again if in the future any question arose as to the exact date of Henry s decease 
7502-100440-0013	train-other-500	we should find in this diary proof that anyhow he was alive as late as Tuesday twenty eighth April
none	none	 That might though it probably won t be of great importance 
7502-100440-0014	train-other-500	But there is another sort of diary which can never be of any importance at all I make no apology for giving a third selection of extracts Monday Rose at nine and came down to find a letter from Mary How little we know our true friends
7502-100440-0015	train-other-500	Beneath the mask of outward affection there may lurk unknown to us the serpent s tooth of jealousy Mary writes that she can make nothing for my stall at the bazaar as she has her own stall to provide for Ate my breakfast mechanically my thoughts being far away
7502-100440-0016	train-other-500	What after all is life Meditated deeply on the inner cosmos till lunch time Afterwards I lay down for an hour and composed my mind I was angry this morning with Mary Ah how petty Shall I never be free from the bonds of my own nature
7502-100440-0017	train-other-500	Is the better self within me never to rise to the sublime heights of selflessness of which it is capable Rose at four and wrote to Mary forgiving her This has been a wonderful day for the spirit Yes
none	none	 I suspect that a good many diaries record adventures of the mind and soul for lack of stirring adventures to the body 
7502-100440-0018	train-other-500	If they cannot say Attacked by a lion in Bond Street to day they can at least say
none	none	 Attacked by doubt in saint Paul s Cathedral 
7502-100440-0019	train-other-500	Most people will prefer in the absence of the lion to say nothing or nothing more important than Attacked by the hairdresser with a hard brush but there are others who must get pen to paper somehow and who find that only in regard to their emotions have they anything unique to say
7502-100440-0020	train-other-500	But of course there is ever within the breasts of all diarists the hope that their diaries may some day be revealed to the world They may be discovered by some future generation amazed at the simple doings of the twentieth century
7502-100440-0021	train-other-500	or their publication may be demanded by the next generation eager to know the inner life of the great man just dead Best of all they may be made public by the writers themselves in their autobiographies
none	none	 Yes the diarist must always have his eye on a possible autobiography I remember he will write in that great work having forgotten all about it I distinctly remember and here he will refer to his diary meeting X at lunch one Sunday and saying to him What he said will not be of much importance but it will show you what a wonderful memory the distinguished author retains in his old age Midsummer Day There is magic in the woods on Midsummer Day so people tell me Titania conducts her revels Let others attend her court for myself I will beg to be excused I have no heart for revelling on Midsummer Day On any other festival I will be as jocund as you please but on the longest day of the year I am overburdened by the thought that from this moment the evenings are beginning to draw in We are on the way to winter It is on Midsummer Day or thereabouts that the cuckoo changes his tune knowing well that the best days are over and that in a little while it will be time for him to fly away I should like this to be a learned article on The Habits of the Cuckoo and yet if it were I doubt if I should love him at the end of it It is best to know only the one thing of him that he lays his eggs in another bird s nest a friendly idea and beyond that to take him as we find him And we find that his only habit which matters is the delightful one of saying Cuckoo The nightingale is the bird of melancholy the thrush sings a disturbing song of the good times to come the blackbird whistles a fine cool note which goes best with a February morning and the skylark trills his way to a heaven far out of the reach of men and what the lesser white throat says I have never rightly understood But the cuckoo is the bird of present joys he keeps us company on the lawns of summer he sings under a summer sun in a wonderful new world of blue and green I think only happy people hear him He is always about when one is doing pleasant things He never sings when the sun hides behind banks of clouds or if he does it is softly to himself so that he may not lose the note Then Cuckoo he says aloud and you may be sure that everything is warm and bright again But now he is leaving us Where he goes I know not but I think of him vaguely as at Mozambique a paradise for all good birds who like their days long If geography were properly taught at schools I should know where Mozambique was and what sort of people live there But it may be that with all these cuckoos cuckooing and swallows swallowing from July to April the country is so full of immigrants that there is no room for a stable population It may also be of course that Mozambique is not the place I am thinking of yet it has a birdish sound The year is arranged badly If mister Willett were alive he would do something about it Why should the days begin to get shorter at the moment when summer is fully arrived Why should it be possible for the vicar to say that the evenings are drawing in when one is still having strawberries for tea Sometimes I think that if June were called August and April June these things would be easier to bear The fact that in what is now called August we should be telling each other how wonderfully hot it was for October would help us to bear the slow approach of winter On a Midsummer Day in such a calendar one would revel gladly and there would be no midsummer madness Already the oak trees have taken on an autumn look I am told that this is due to a local irruption of caterpillars and not to the waning of the summer but it has a suspicious air Probably the caterpillars knew It seems strange now to reflect that there was a time when I liked caterpillars when I chased them up suburban streets and took them home to fondle them when I knew them all by their pretty names assisted them to become chrysalises and watched over them in that unprotected state as if I had been their mother Ah how dear were my little charges to me then But now I class them with mosquitoes and blight and harvesters the pests of the countryside Why I would let them crawl up my arm in those happy days of old and now I cannot even endure to have them dropping gently into my hair And I should not know what to say to a chrysalis There are great and good people who know all about solstices and zeniths and they can tell you just why it is that twenty fourth June is so much hotter and longer than twenty fourth December why it is so in England I should say For I believe and they will correct me if I am wrong that at the equator the days and nights are always of equal length This must make calling almost an impossibility for if one cannot say to one s hostess How quickly the days are lengthening or drawing in one might as well remain at home How stationary the days are remaining might pass on a first visit but the old inhabitants would not like it rubbed into them They feel I am sure that however saddening a Midsummer Day may be an unchanging year is much more intolerable One can imagine the superiority of a resident who lived a couple of miles off the equator and took her visitors proudly to the end of the garden where the seasons were most mutable There would be no bearing with her In these circumstances I refuse to be depressed I console myself with the thought that if twenty fifth June is the beginning of winter at least there is a next summer to which I may look forward Next summer anything may happen I suppose a scientist would be considerably surprised if the sun refused to get up one morning or having got up declined to go to bed again It would not surprise ME The amazing thing is that Nature goes on doing the same things in the same way year after year any sudden little irrelevance on her part would be quite understandable When the wise men tell us so confidently that there will be an eclipse of the sun in nineteen twenty one invisible at Greenwich do they have no qualms of doubt as the day draws near Do they glance up from their whitebait at the appointed hour just in case it IS visible after all Or if they have journeyed to Pernambuco or wherever the best view is to be obtained do they wonder perhaps and tell each other the night before that of course they were coming to Pernambuco anyhow to see an aunt Perhaps they don t But for myself I am not so certain and I have hopes that certainly next year possibly even this year the days will go on lengthening after midsummer is over At the Bookstall 
7517_100442_000002_000000	train-clean-100	I have often longed to be a grocer 
none	none	To be surrounded by so many interesting things sardines bottled raspberries biscuits with sugar on the top preserved ginger hams brawn under glass everything in fact that makes life worth living at one moment to walk up a ladder in search of nutmeg at the next to dive under a counter in pursuit of cinnamon to serve little girls with a ha porth of pear drops and lordly people like you and me with a pint of cherry gin is not this to follow the king of trades Some day I shall open a grocer s shop and you will find me in my spare evenings aproned behind the counter Look out for the currants in the window as you come in I have an idea for something artistic in the way of patterns there but as you love me do not offer to buy any 
7517_100442_000002_000003	train-clean-100	We grocers only put the currants out for show and so that we may run our fingers through them luxuriously when business is slack 
7517_100442_000002_000004	train-clean-100	I have a good line in shortbreads madam if I can find the box but no currants this evening I beg you 
7517_100442_000003_000000	train-clean-100	Yes to be a grocer is to live well but after all it is not to see life 
7517_100442_000003_000001	train-clean-100	A grocer in as far as it is possible to a man who sells both scented soap and pilchards would become narrow 
7517_100442_000003_000002	train-clean-100	We do not come into contact with the outside world much save through the medium of potted lobster and to sell a man potted lobster is not to have our fingers on his pulse 
7517_100442_000003_000003	train-clean-100	Potted lobster does not define a man 
7517_100442_000003_000004	train-clean-100	All customers are alike to the grocer provided their money is good 
none	none	I perceive now that I was over hasty in deciding to become a grocer 
7517_100442_000003_000006	train-clean-100	That is rather for one s old age While one is young and interested in persons rather than in things there is only one profession to follow the profession of bookstall clerk 
7517_100442_000004_000000	train-clean-100	To be behind a bookstall is indeed to see life 
none	none	The fascination of it struck me suddenly as one stood in front of a station bookstall last Monday and wondered who bought the tie clips 
7517_100442_000004_000002	train-clean-100	The answer came to me just as I got into my train Ask the man behind the bookstall 
7517_100442_000004_000003	train-clean-100	He would know 
7517_100442_000004_000004	train-clean-100	Yes and he would know who bought all his papers and books and pamphlets and to know this is to know something about the people in the world 
7517_100442_000004_000005	train-clean-100	You cannot tell a man by the lobster he eats but you can tell something about him by the literature he reads 
7517_100442_000005_000000	train-clean-100	For instance I once occupied a carriage on an eastern line with among others a middle aged woman 
7517_100442_000005_000001	train-clean-100	As soon as we left Liverpool Street she produced a bag of shrimps grasped each individual in turn firmly by the head and tail and ate him 
7517_100442_000005_000002	train-clean-100	When she had finished she emptied the ends out of the window wiped her hands and settled down comfortably to her paper 
7517_100442_000005_000003	train-clean-100	What paper You ll never guess I shall have to tell you The Morning Post Now doesn t that give you the woman 
7517_100442_000005_000004	train-clean-100	The shrimps alone no the paper alone no but the two to gether 
7517_100442_000005_000005	train-clean-100	Conceive the holy joy of the bookstall clerk as she and her bag of shrimps yes he could have told at once they were shrimps approached and asked for The Morning Post 
7517_100442_000006_000000	train-clean-100	The day can never be dull to the bookstall clerk 
7517_100442_000006_000001	train-clean-100	I imagine him assigning in his mind the right paper to each customer 
7517_100442_000006_000002	train-clean-100	This man will ask for Golfing wrong he wants Cage Birds that one over there wants The Motor ah well The Auto Car that s near enough 
7517_100442_000006_000003	train-clean-100	Soon he would begin to know the different types he would learn to distinguish between the patrons of The Dancing Times and of The Vote The Era and The Athenaeum 
none	none	Delightful surprises would overwhelm him at intervals as when a red letter day in all the great stations a gentleman in a check waistcoat makes the double purchase of Homer s Penny Stories and The Spectator On those occasions and they would be very rare his faith in human nature would begin to ooze away until all at once he would tell himself excitedly that the man was obviously an escaped criminal in disguise rather overdoing the part After which he would hand over The Winning Post and The Animals Friend to the pursuing detective in a sort of holy awe 
7517_100442_000006_000006	train-clean-100	What a life 
7517_100442_000007_000000	train-clean-100	But he has other things than papers to sell 
none	none	He knows who buys those little sixpenny books of funny stories a problem which has often puzzled us others he understands by now the type of man who wants to read up a few good jokes to tell them down at old Robinson s where he is going for the week end 
7517_100442_000007_000002	train-clean-100	Our bookstall clerk doesn t wait to be asked 
7517_100442_000007_000003	train-clean-100	As soon as this gentleman approaches he whips out the book dusts it and places it before the raconteur 
7517_100442_000007_000004	train-clean-100	He recognizes also at a glance the sort of silly ass who is always losing his indiarubber umbrella ring 
none	none	Half way across the station he can see him and he hastens to get a new card out in readiness Or we would let you have seven for sixpence sir And even when one of those subtler characters draws near about whom it is impossible to say immediately whether they require a fountain pen with case or the Life and Letters reduced to threes sixd of Major General Clement Bulger C B even then the man behind the bookstall is not found wanting 
7517_100442_000007_000006	train-clean-100	If he is wrong the first time he never fails to recover with his second 
7517_100442_000007_000007	train-clean-100	 Bulger sir 
7517_100442_000007_000008	train-clean-100	One of our greatest soldiers 
7517_100442_000008_000000	train-clean-100	I thought of these things last Monday and definitely renounced the idea of becoming a grocer and as I wandered round the bookstall thinking I came across a little book sixpence in cloth a shilling in leather called Proverbs and Maxims 
7517_100442_000008_000001	train-clean-100	It contained some thousands of the best thoughts in all languages such as have guided men along the path of truth since the beginning of the world from What ho she bumps to Ich dien and more 
7517_100442_000008_000002	train-clean-100	The thought occurred to me that an interesting article might be extracted from it so I bought the book 
7517_100442_000008_000003	train-clean-100	Unfortunately enough I left it in the train before I had time to master it 
7517_100442_000008_000004	train-clean-100	I shall be at the bookstall next Monday and I shall have to buy another copy 
7517_100442_000008_000005	train-clean-100	That will be all right you shan t miss it 
7517_100442_000009_000000	train-clean-100	But I am wondering now what the bookstall clerk will make of me A man who keeps on buying Proverbs and Maxims 
7517_100442_000009_000001	train-clean-100	Well as I say they see life 
none	none	Who s Who I like my novels long When I had read three pages of this one I glanced at the end and found to my delight that there were two thousand seven hundred and twenty five pages more to come I returned with a sigh of pleasure to page four I was just at the place where Leslie Patrick Abercrombie wins the prize for laying out Prestatyn some local wrestler presumably who had challenged the crowd at a country fair After laying him out Abercrombie returns to his books and becomes editor of the Town Planning Review A wonderfully drawn character The plot of this oddly named novel is too complicated to describe at length It opens with the conferment of the C M G on Kuli Khan Abbas in nineteen oh three an incident of which the anonymous author might have made a good deal more and closes with a brief description of the reverend Samuel Marinus Zwemer s home in New York City but much has happened in the meanwhile Thousands of characters have made their brief appearance on the stage and have been hustled off to make room for others but so unerringly are they drawn that we feel that we are in the presence of living people Take Colette Willy for example who comes in on page twenty six fifty six at a time when the denouement is clearly at hand The author who is working up to his great scene the appointment of doctor Norman Wilsmore to the International Commission for the Publication of Annual Tables of Physical and Chemical Constants draws her for us in a few lightning touches She is authoress actress She has written two little books Dialogue de Betes and La Retraite Sentimentale That is all But is it not enough Has he not made Colette Willy live before us A lesser writer might have plunged into elaborate details about her telephone number and her permanent address but like the true artist that he is our author leaves all those things unsaid For though he can be a realist when necessary as in the case of Wallis Budge to which I shall refer directly he does not hesitate to trust to the impressionist sketch when the situation demands it Wallis Budge is apparently the hero of the taie at any rate the author devotes most space to him some hundred and twenty lines or so He does not appear until page three hundred forty one by which time we are on familiar terms with some two or three thousand of the less important characters It is typical of the writer that once he has described a character to us has so to speak set him on his feet he appears to lose interest in his creation and it is only rarely that further reference is made to him Alfred Budd for instance who became British Vice Consul of San Sebastian in nineteen oh seven and resides as the intelligent reader will have guessed at the San Sebastian British Vice Consulate obtains the M V O in nineteen oh eight Nothing is said however of the resultant effect on his character nor is any adequate description given either then or later of the San Sebastian scenery On the other hand Bucy who first appears on page three hundred forty turns up again on page six hundred forty four as the Marquess de Bucy a Grandee of Spain I was half expecting that the body would be discovered about this time but the author is still busy over his protagonists and only leaves the Marquess in order to introduce to us his three musketeers de Bunsen de Burgh and de Butts But it is time that I returned to our hero doctor Wallis Budge Although Budge is a golfer of world wide experience having conducted excavations in Egypt the Island of Meroe Nineveh and Mesopotamia it is upon his mental rather than his athletic abilities that the author dwells most lovingly The fact that in eighteen eighty six he wrote a pamphlet upon The Coptic History of Elijah the Tishbite and followed it up in eighteen eighty eight with one on The Coptic Martyrdom of George of Cappadocia which is of course in every drawing room may not seem at first to have much bearing upon the tremendous events which followed later But the author is artistically right in drawing our attention to them for it is probable that had these popular works not been written our hero would never have been encouraged to proceed with his Magical Texts of Za Walda Hawaryat Tasfa Maryam Sebhat Le ab Gabra Shelase Tezasu Aheta Mikael which had such a startling effect on the lives of all the other characters and led indirectly to the finding of the blood stain on the bath mat My own suspicions fell immediately upon Thomas Rooke of whom we are told nothing more than R W S which is obviously the cabbalistic sign of some secret society One of the author s weaknesses is a certain carelessness in the naming of his characters For instance no fewer than two hundred and forty one of them are called Smith True he endeavours to distinguish between them by giving them such different Christian names as John Henry Charles and so forth but the result is bound to be confusing Sometimes indeed he does not even bother to distinguish between their Christian names Thus we have three Henry Smiths who appear to have mixed themselves up even in the author s mind He tells us that Colonel Henry s chief recreation is the study of the things around him but it sounds much more like that of the Reverend Henry whose opportunities in the pulpit would be considerably greater It is the same with the Thomsons the Williamses and others When once he hits upon one of these popular names he is carried away for several pages and insists on calling everybody Thomson But occasionally he has an inspiration Temistocle Zammit is a good name though the humour of calling a famous musician Zimbalist is perhaps a little too obvious In conclusion one can say that while our author s merits are many his faults are of no great moment Certainly he handles his love scenes badly Many of his characters are married but he tells us little of the early scenes of courtship and says nothing of any previous engagements which were afterwards broken off Also he is apparently incapable of describing a child unless it is the offspring of titled persons and will itself succeed to the title even then he prefers to dismiss it in a parenthesis But as a picture of the present day Englishman his novel can hardly be surpassed He is not a writer who is only at home with one class He can describe the utterly unknown and unimportant with as much gusto as he describes the genius or the old nobility True he overcrowds his canvas but one must recognize this as his method It is so that he expresses himself best just as one painter can express himself best in a rendering of the whole Town Council of Slappenham while another only requires a single haddock on a plate His future will be watched with interest He hints in his introduction that he has another volume in preparation in which he will introduce to us several entirely new C B E s besides carrying on the histories in the familiar manner of our modern novelists of many of those with whom we have already made friends Who s Who nineteen twenty it is to be called and I for one shall look out for it with the utmost eagerness A Day at Lord s When one has been without a certain pleasure for a number of years one is accustomed to find on returning to it that it is not quite so delightful as one had imagined In the years of abstinence one had built up too glowing a picture and the reality turns out to be something much more commonplace Pleasant yes but after all nothing out of the ordinary Most of us have made this discovery for ourselves in the last few months of peace We have been doing the things which we had promised ourselves so often during the war and though they have been jolly enough they are not quite all that we dreamed in France and Flanders As for the negative pleasures the pleasure of not saluting or not attending medical boards they soon lose their first freshness Yet I have had one pre war pleasure this week which carried with it no sort of disappointment It was as good as I had thought it would be I went to Lord s and watched first class cricket again There are people who want to brighten cricket They remind me of a certain manager to whom I once sent a play He told me more politely than truthfully how much he had enjoyed reading it and then pointed out what was wrong with the construction You have two brothers here he said They oughtn t to have been brothers they should have been strangers Then one of them marries the heroine That s wrong the other one ought to have married her Then there s Aunt Jane she strikes me as a very colourless person If she could have been arrested in the second act for bigamy And then I should leave out your third act altogether and put the fourth act at Monte Carlo and let the heroine be blackmailed by what s the fellow s name See what I mean I said that I saw You don t mind my criticizing your play he added carelessly I said that he wasn t criticizing my play He was writing another one one which I hadn t the least wish to write myself And this is what the brighteners of cricket are doing They are inventing a new game a game which those of us who love cricket have not the least desire to watch If anybody says that he finds Lord s or the Oval boring I shall not be at all surprised the only thing that would surprise me would be to hear that he found it more boring than I find Epsom or Newmarket Cricket is not to everybody s taste nor is racing But those who like cricket like it for what it is and they don t want it brightened by those who don t like it Lord Lonsdale I am sure would hate me to brighten up Newmarket for him Lord s as it is which is as it was five years ago is good enough for me I would not alter any of it To hear the pavilion bell ring out again was to hear the most musical sound in the world The best note is given at eleven point twenty in the morning later on it lacks something of its early ecstasy When people talk of the score of this or that opera I smile pityingly to myself They have never heard the true music The clink of ice against glass gives quite a good note on a suitable day but it has not the magic of the Lord s bell As was my habit on these occasions five years ago I bought a copy of The Daily Telegraph on entering the ground In the ordinary way I do not take in this paper but I have always had a warm admiration for it holding it to have qualities which place it far above any other London journal of similar price For the seats at Lord s are uncommonly hard and a Daily Telegraph folded twice and placed beneath one brings something of the solace which good literature will always bring My friends had noticed before the war without being able to account for it that my views became noticeably more orthodox as the summer advanced only to fall away again with the approach of autumn I must have been influenced subconsciously by the leading articles It rained and play was stopped for an hour or two Before the war I should have been annoyed about this and I should have said bitterly that it was just my luck But now I felt that I was indeed lucky thus to recapture in one day all the old sensations It was delightful to herald again a break in the clouds and to hear the crowd clapping hopefully as soon as ever the rain had ceased to applaud the umpires brave fellows when they ventured forth at last to inspect the pitch to realize from the sudden activity of the groundsmen that the decision was a favourable one to see the umpires this time in their white coats come out again with the ball and the bails and so to settle down once more to the business of the day Perhaps the cricket was slow from the point of view of the follower of league football but I do not feel that this is any condemnation of it An essay of Lamb s would be slow to a reader of William le Queux s works who wanted a new body in each chapter I shall not quarrel with anyone who holds that a day at Lord s is a dull day if he thinks so let him take his amusement elsewhere But let him not quarrel with me because I keep to my opinion as firmly now as before the war that a day at Lord s is a joyous day If he will leave me the old Lord s I will promise not to brighten his football for him By the Sea It is very pleasant in August to recline in Fleet Street or wherever stern business keeps one and to think of the sea I do not envy the millions at Margate and Blackpool at Salcombe and Minehead for I have persuaded myself that the sea is not what it was in my day Then the pools were always full of starfish crabs really big crabs stalked the deserted sands and anemones waved their feelers at you from every rock Poets have talked of the unchanging sea and they may be right as regards the actual water but I fancy that the beach must be deteriorating In the last ten years I don t suppose I have seen more than five starfishes though I have walked often enough by the margin of the waves and not only to look for lost golf balls There have been occasional belated little crabs whom I have interrupted as they were scuttling home but none of those dangerous monsters to whom in fearful excitement and as a challenge to one s companion one used to offer a forefinger I refuse regretfully your explanation that it is my finger which is bigger I should like to think that it were indeed so and that the boys and girls of to day find their crabs and starfishes in the size and quantity to which I was accustomed But I am afraid we cannot hide it from ourselves that the supply is giving out It is in fact obvious that one cannot keep on taking starfishes home and hanging them up in the hall as barometers without detriment to the coming race We had another amusement as children in which I suppose the modern child is no longer able to indulge We used to wait until the tide was just beginning to go down and then start to climb round the foot of the cliffs from one sandy bay to another The waves lapped the cliffs a single false step would have plunged us into the sea and we had all the excitement of being caught by the tide without any of the danger We had the further excitement if we were lucky of seeing frantic people waving to us from the top of the cliff people of inconceivable ignorance who thought that the tide was coming up and that we were in desperate peril But it was a very special day when that happened I have done a little serious climbing since those days but not any which was more enjoyable The sea was never more than a foot below us and never more than two feet deep but the shock of falling into it would have been momentarily as great as that of falling down a precipice You had therefore the two joys of climbing the physical pleasure of the accomplished effort and the glorious mental reaction when your heart returns from the middle of your throat to its normal place in your chest And you had the additional advantages that you couldn t get killed and that if an insuperable difficulty presented itself you were not driven back but merely waited five minutes for the tide to lower itself and disclose a fresh foothold But as I say these are not joys for the modern child The tide I dare say is not what it was it does not perhaps go down so certainly Or the cliffs are of a different and of an inferior shape Or people are no longer so ignorant as to mistake the nature of your position One way or another I expect I do better in Fleet Street I shall stay and imagine myself by the sea I shall not disappoint myself with the reality But I imagine myself away from bands and piers for a band by a moonlit sea calls you to be very grown up and the beach and the crabs such as are left call you to be a child and between the two you can very easily be miserable I can see myself with a spade and bucket being extraordinarily happy The other day I met a lucky little boy who had a pile of sand in his garden to play with and I was fortunate enough to get an order for a tunnel The tunnel which I constructed for him was a good one but not so good that I couldn t see myself building a better one with practice I came away with an ambition for architecture If ever I go to the sea again I shall build a proper tunnel and afterwards well we shall see At the moment I feel in tremendous form I feel that I could do a cathedral There is one joy of childhood however which one can never recapture and that is the joy of getting wet in the sea There is a statue not so far from Fleet Street of the man who introduced Sunday schools into England but the man whom boys and girls would really like to commemorate in lasting stone is the doctor who first said that salt water couldn t give you a cold Whether this was true or not I do not know but it was a splendid and never failing retort to anxious grown ups and added much to the joys of the seaside But it is a joy no longer possible to one who is his own master I for instance can get my feet wet in fresh water if I like to get them wet in salt water is no special privilege Feeling as I do writing as I have written it is sad for me to know that if I really went to the sea this August it would not be with a spade and a bucket but with a bag of golf clubs that even my evenings would be spent not on the beach but on a bicycle riding to the nearest town for a paper Yet it is useless for you to say that I do not love the sea with my old love that I am no longer pleased with the old childish things I shall maintain that it is the sea which is not what it was and that I am very happy in Fleet Street thinking of it as it used to be Golden Fruit Of the fruits of the year I give my vote to the orange In the first place it is a perennial if not in actual fact at least in the greengrocer s shop On the days when dessert is a name given to a handful of chocolates and a little preserved ginger when macdoine de fruits is the title bestowed on two prunes and a piece of rhubarb then the orange however sour comes nobly to the rescue and on those other days of plenty when cherries and strawberries and raspberries and gooseberries riot together upon the table the orange sweeter than ever is still there to hold its own Bread and butter beef and mutton eggs and bacon are not more necessary to an ordered existence than the orange It is well that the commonest fruit should be also the best Of the virtues of the orange I have not room fully to speak It has properties of health giving as that it cures influenza and establishes the complexion It is clean for whoever handles it on its way to your table but handles its outer covering its top coat which is left in the hall It is round and forms an excellent substitute with the young for a cricket ball The pips can be flicked at your enemies and quite a small piece of peel makes a slide for an old gentleman But all this would count nothing had not the orange such delightful qualities of taste I dare not let myself go upon this subject I am a slave to its sweetness I grudge every marriage in that it means a fresh supply of orange blossom the promise of so much golden fruit cut short However the world must go on Next to the orange I place the cherry The cherry is a companionable fruit You can eat it while you are reading or talking and you can go on and on absent mindedly as it were though you must mind not to swallow the stone The trouble of disengaging this from the fruit is just sufficient to make the fruit taste sweeter for the labour The stalk keeps you from soiling your fingers it enables you also to play bob cherry Lastly it is by means of cherries that one penetrates the great mysteries of life when and whom you will marry and whether she really loves you or is taking you for your worldly prospects I may add here that I know a girl who can tie a knot in the stalk of a cherry with her tongue It is a tricky business and I am doubtful whether to add it to the virtues of the cherry or not There are only two ways of eating strawberries One is neat in the strawberry bed and the other is mashed on the plate The first method generally requires us to take up a bent position under a net in a hot sun very uncomfortable and at any time fatal to the hair The second method takes us into the privacy of the home for it demands a dressing gown and no spectators For these reasons I think the strawberry an overrated fruit Yet I must say that I like to see one floating in cider cup It gives a note of richness to the affair and excuses any shortcomings in the lunch itself Raspberries are a good fruit gone wrong A raspberry by itself might indeed be the best fruit of all but it is almost impossible to find it alone I do not refer to its attachment to the red currant rather to the attachment to it of so many of our dumb little friends The instinct of the lower creatures for the best is well shown in the case of the raspberry If it is to be eaten it must be picked by the hand well shaken and then taken When you engage a gardener the first thing to do is to come to a clear understanding with him about the peaches The best way of settling the matter is to give him the carrots and the black currants and the rhubarb for himself to allow him a free hand with the groundsel and the walnut trees and to insist in return for this that you should pick the peaches when and how you like If he is a gentleman he will consent Supposing that some satisfactory arrangement were come to and supposing also that you had a silver bladed pocket knife with which you could peel them in the open air then peaches would come very high in the list of fruits But the conditions are difficult Gooseberries burst at the wrong end and smother you melons as the nigger boy discovered make your ears sticky currants when you have removed the skin and extracted the seeds are unsatisfying blackberries have the faults of raspberries without their virtues plums are never ripe Yet all these fruits are excellent in their season Their faults are faults which we can forgive during a slight acquaintance which indeed seem but pleasant little idiosyncrasies in the stranger But we could not live with them Yet with the orange we do live year in and year out That speaks well for the orange The fact is that there is an honesty about the orange which appeals to all of us If it is going to be bad for even the best of us are bad sometimes it begins to be bad from the outside not from the inside How many a pear which presents a blooming face to the world is rotten at the core How many an innocent looking apple is harbouring a worm in the bud But the orange has no secret faults Its outside is a mirror of its inside and if you are quick you can tell the shopman so before he slips it into the bag Signs of Character Wellington is said to have chosen his officers by their noses and chins The standard for them in noses must have been rather high to judge by the portraits of the Duke but no doubt he made allowances Anyhow by this method he got the men he wanted Some people however may think that he would have done better to have let the mouth be the deciding test The lines of one s nose are more or less arranged for one at birth A baby born with a snub nose would feel it hard that the decision that he would be no use to Wellington should be come to so early And even if he arrived in the world with a Roman nose he might smash it up in childhood and with it his chances of military fame This I think you will agree with me would be unfair Now the mouth is much more likely to be a true index of character A man may clench his teeth firmly or smile disdainfully or sneer or do a hundred things which will be reflected in his mouth rather than in his nose or chin It is through the mouth and eyes that all emotions are expressed and in the mouth and eyes therefore that one would expect the marks of such emotions to be left I did read once of a man whose nose quivered with rage but it is not usual I never heard of anyone whose chin did anything It would be absurd to expect it to But there arises now the objection that a man may conceal his mouth and by that his character with a moustache There arises too the objection that a person whom you thought was a fool because he always went about with his mouth open may only have had a bad cold in the head In fact the difficulties of telling anyone s character by his face seem more insuperable every moment How then are we to tell whether we may safely trust a man with our daughter or our favourite golf club or whatever we hold most dear Fortunately a benefactor has stepped in at the right moment with an article on the cigar manner Our gentleman has made the discovery that you can tell a man s nature by the way he handles his cigar and he gives a dozen illustrations to explain his theory True this leaves out of account the men who don t smoke cigars although of course you might sum them all up with a certain amount of justification as foolish But you do get I am assured a very important index to the characters of smokers which is as much as to say of the people who really count I am not going to reveal all the clues to you now partly because I might be infringing the copyright of another partly because I have forgotten them But the idea roughly is that if a man holds his cigar between his finger and thumb he is courageous and kind to animals or whatever it may be and if he holds it between his first and second fingers he is impulsive but yet considerate to old ladies and if he holds it upside down he is besides being an ass jealous and self assertive and if he sticks a knife into the stump so as to smoke it to the very end he is yes you have guessed this one he is mean You see what a useful thing a cigar may be I think now I am sorry that this theory has been given to the world Yes I blame myself for giving it further publicity In the old days when we bought or better had presented to us a cigar a doubt as to whether it was a good one was all that troubled us We bit one end and lit the other and the doubt having been solved proceeded tranquilly to enjoy ourselves But all this will be changed now We shall be horribly self conscious When we take our cigars from our mouths we shall feel our neighbours eyes rooted upon our hands the while we try to remember which of all the possible manipulations is the one which represents virtue at its highest power Speaking for myself I hold my cigar in a dozen different ways during an evening though never of course on the end of a knife and I tremble to think of the diabolically composite nature which the modern Wellingtons of the table must attribute to me In future I see that I must concentrate on one method If only I could remember the one which shows me at my best But the tobacco test is not the only one We may be told by the way we close our hands the tilt of a walking stick may unmask us It is useless to model ourselves now on the strong silent man of the novel whose face is a shutter to hide his emotions This is a pity yes I am convinced now that it is a pity If my secret fault is cheque forging I do not want it to be revealed to the world by the angle of my hat still less do I wish to discover it in a friend whom I like or whom I can beat at billiards How dull the world would be if we knew every acquaintance inside out as soon as we had offered him our cigar case Suppose I put an extreme case to you suppose a pleasant young bachelor who admired our bowling showed himself by his shoe laces to be a secret wife beater What could we do Cut so unique a friend Ah no Let us pray to remain in ignorance of the faults of those we like Let us pray it as sincerely as we pray that they shall remain in ignorance of ours Intellectual Snobbery A good many years ago I had a painful experience I was discovered by my house master reading in bed at the unauthorized hour of midnight Smith minor in the next bed we shared a candle was also reading We were both discovered But the most annoying part of the business as it seemed to me then was that Smith minor was discovered reading Alton Locke and that I was discovered reading Marooned Among Cannibals If only our house master had come in the night before Then he would have found me reading Alton Locke Just for a moment it occurred to me to tell him this but after a little reflection I decided that it would be unwise He might have misunderstood the bearings of the revelation There is hardly one of us who is proof against this sort of intellectual snobbery A detective story may have been a very good friend to us but we don t want to drag it into the conversation we prefer a casual reference to The Egoist with which we have perhaps only a bowing acquaintance a reference which leaves the impression that we are inseparable companions or at any rate inseparable until such day when we gather from our betters that there are heights even beyond The Egoist Dead or alive we would sooner be found with a copy of Marcus Aurelius than with a copy of Marie Corelli I used to know a man who carried always with him a Russian novel in the original not because he read Russian but because a day might come when as the result of some accident the pockets of the deceased would be exposed in the public Press As he said you never know but the only accident which happened to him was to be stranded for twelve hours one August at a wayside station in the Highlands After this he maintained that the Russians were overrated I should like to pretend that I myself have grown out of these snobbish ways by this time but I am doubtful if it would be true It happened to me not so long ago to be travelling in company of which I was very much ashamed and to be ashamed of one s company is to be a snob At this period I was trying to amuse myself and if it might be so other people by writing a burlesque story in the manner of an imaginary collaboration by Sir Hall Caine and missus Florence Barclay In order to do this I had to study the works of these famous authors and for many week ends in succession I might have been seen travelling to or returning from the country with a couple of their books under my arm To keep one book beneath the arm is comparatively easy to keep two is much more difficult Many was the time while waiting for my train to come in that one of those books slipped from me Indeed there is hardly a junction in the railway system of the southern counties at which I have not dropped on some Saturday or other a Caine or a Barclay to have it restored to me a moment later by a courteous fellow passenger courteous but with a smile of gentle pity in his eye as he glimpsed the author s name Thanks very much I would stammer blushing guiltily and perhaps I would babble about a sick friend to whom I was taking them or that I was running out of paper weights But he never believed me He knew that he would have said something like that himself Nothing is easier than to assume that other people share one s weaknesses No doubt Jack the Ripper excused himself on the ground that it was human nature possibly indeed he wrote an essay like this in which he speculated mildly as to the reasons which made stabbing so attractive to us all So I realize that I may be doing you an injustice in suggesting that you who read may also have your little snobberies But I confess that I should like to cross examine you If in conversation with you on the subject let us say of heredity a subject to which you had devoted a good deal of study I took it for granted that you had read Ommany s Approximations would you make it quite clear to me that you had not read it Or would you let me carry on the discussion on the assumption that you knew it well would you even in answer to a direct question say shamefacedly that though you had not er actually read it you er knew about it of course and had er read extracts from it Somehow I think that I could lead you on to this perhaps even make you say that you had actually ordered it from your library before I told you the horrid truth that Ommany s Approximations was an invention of my own It is absurd that we I say we for I include you now should behave like this for there is no book over which we need be ashamed either to have read it or not to have read it Let us therefore be frank In order to remove the unfortunate impression of myself which I have given you I will confess that I have only read three of Scott s novels and begun but never finished two of Henry James I will also confess and here I am by way of restoring that unfortunate impression that I do quite well in Scottish and Jacobean circles on those five books For if a question arises as to which is Scott s masterpiece it is easy for me to suggest one of my three with the air of one who has chosen it not over two others but over twenty Perhaps one of my three is the acknowledged masterpiece I do not know If it is then of course all is well But if it is not then I must appear rather a clever fellow for having rejected the obvious With regard to Henry James my position is not quite so secure but at least I have good reason for feeling that the two novels which I was unable to finish cannot be his best and with a little tact I can appear to be defending this opinion hotly against some imaginary authority who has declared in favour of them One might have read the collected works of both authors yet make less of an impression Indeed sometimes I feel that I have read their collected works and Ommany s Approximations and many other books with which you would be only too glad to assume familiarity For in giving others the impression that I am on terms with these masterpieces I have but handed on an impression which has gradually formed itself in my own mind So I take no advantage of them and if it appears afterwards that we have been deceived together I shall be at least as surprised and indignant about it as they A Question of Form The latest invention on the market is the wasp gun In theory it is something like a letter clip you pull the trigger and the upper and lower plates snap together with a suddenness which would surprise any insect in between The trouble will be to get him in the right place before firing But I can see that a lot of fun can be got out of a wasp drive We shall stand on the edge of the marmalade while the beaters go through it and given sufficient guns there will not be many insects to escape A loader to clean the weapon at regular intervals will be a necessity Yet I am afraid that society will look down upon the wasp gun Anything useful and handy is always barred by the best people I can imagine a bounder being described as the sort of person who uses a wasp gun instead of a teaspoon As we all know a hat guard is the mark of a very low fellow I suppose the idea is that you and I being so dashed rich do not much mind if our straw hat does blow off into the Serpentine it is only the poor wretch of a clerk unable to afford a new one every day who must take precautions against losing his first Yet how neat how useful is the hat guard With what pride its inventor must have given birth to it Probably he expected a statue at the corner of Cromwell Road fitting reward for a public benefactor He did not understand that since his invention was useful it was probably bad form Consider again the Richard or dicky Could there be anything neater or more dressy anything more thoroughly useful Yet you and I scorn to wear one I remember a terrible situation in a story by mister W S Jackson The hero found himself in a foreign hotel without his luggage To that hotel came with her father the girl whom he adored silently An invitation was given him to dinner with them and he had to borrow what clothes he could from friendly waiters These alas included a dicky Well the dinner began well our hero made an excellent impression all was gaiety Suddenly a candle was overturned and the flame caught the heroine s frock The hero knew what the emergency demanded He knew how heroes always whipped off their coats and wrapped them round burning heroines He jumped up like a bullet or whatever jumps up quickest and remembered He had a dicky on Without his coat he would discover the dicky to the one person of all from whom he wished to hide it Yet if he kept his coat on she might die A truly horrible dilemma I forget which horn he impaled himself upon but I expect you and I would have kept the secret of the Richard at all costs And what really is wrong with a false shirt front Nothing except that it betrays the poverty of the wearer Laundry bills don t worry us bless you who have a new straw hat every day but how terrible if it was suspected that they did Our gentlemanly objection to the made up tie seems to rest on a different foundation I am doubtful as to the psychology of that Of course it is a deception but a deception is only serious when it passes itself off as something which really matters Nobody thinks that a self tied tie matters nobody is really proud of being able to make a cravat out of a length of silk I suppose it is simply the fact that a made up tie saves time which condemns it the safety razor was nearly condemned for a like reason We of the leisured classes can spend hours over our toilet by all means let us despise those who cannot As far as dress goes a man only knows the things which a man mustn t do It would be interesting if women would tell us what no real lady ever does I have heard a woman classified contemptuously as one who does her hair up with two hair pins and no doubt bad feminine form can be observed in other shocking directions But again it seems to be that the semblance of poverty whether of means or of leisure is the one thing which must be avoided Why then should the wasp gun be considered bad form I don t know but I have an instinctive feeling that it will be Perhaps a wasp gun indicates a lack of silver spoons suitable for lethal uses Perhaps it shows too careful a consideration of the marmalade A man of money drowns his wasp in the jar with his spoon and carelessly calls for another pot to be opened The poor man waits on the outskirts with his gun and the marmalade void of corpses can still be passed round Your gun proclaims your poverty then let it be avoided All the same I think I shall have one I have kept clear of hat guards and Richards and made up ties without quite knowing why but honestly I have not felt the loss of them The wasp gun is different having seen it I feel that I should be miserable without it It is going to be excellent sport wasp shooting a steady hand a good eye and a certain amount of courage will be called for When the season opens I shall be there good form or bad form We shall shoot the apple quince coverts first Hornet over A Slice of Fiction This is a jolly world and delightful things go on in it For instance I had a picture post card only yesterday from William Benson who is staying at Ilfracombe He wrote to say that he had gone down to Ilfracombe for a short holiday and had been much struck by the beauty of the place On one of his walks he happened to notice that there was to be a sale of several plots of land occupying a quite unique position in front of the sea He had immediately thought of me in connection with it My readiness to consider a good investment had long been known to him and in addition he had heard rumours that I might be coming down to Ilfracombe in order to recruit my health If so here was a chance which should be brought to my knowledge Further particulars and so on Which was extremely friendly of William Benson In fact my only complaint of William is that he has his letters lithographed a nasty habit in a friend But I have allowed myself to be carried away It was not really of mister Benson that I was thinking when I said that delightful things go on in this world but of a certain pair of lovers the tragedy of whose story has been revealed to me in a two line agony in a morning paper When anything particularly attractive happens in real life we express our appreciation by saying that it is the sort of thing which one reads about in books perhaps the highest compliment we can pay to Nature Well the story underlying this advertisement reeks of the feuilleton and the stage PAT I was alone when you called You heard me talking to the dog PLEASE make appointment DAISY You will agree with me when you read this that it is almost too good to be true There is a freshness and a naivet about it which is only to be found in American melodrama Let us reconstruct the situation and we shall see at once how delightfully true to fiction real life can be Pat was in love with Daisy engaged to her we may say with confidence for a reason which will appear in a moment But even though she had plighted her troth to him he was jealous miserably jealous of every male being who approached her One day last week he called on her at the house in Netting Hill The parlour maid opened the door and smiled brightly at him Miss Daisy is upstairs in the drawing room she said Thank you he replied I will announce myself Now you see how we know that they were engaged He must have announced himself in order to have reached the situation implied in the agony and he would not have been allowed to do so if he had not had the standing of a fiance For a moment before knocking Patrick stood outside the drawing room door and in that moment the tragedy occurred he heard his lady s voice DARLING it said she SHALL kiss her sweetest ownest little pupsy wupsy Patrick s brow grew black His strong jaw clenched just like the jaws of those people on the stage and he staggered back from the door This is the end he muttered Then he strode down the stairs and out into the stifling streets And up in the drawing room of the house in Netting Hill Daisy and the toy pom sat and wondered why their lord and master was so late Now we come to the letter which Patrick wrote to Daisy telling her that it was all over He would explain to her how he had accidentally he would dwell upon that accidentally overheard her and her probably he was rather coarse here exchanging terms of endearment he would accuse her of betraying one whose only fault was that he loved her not wisely but too well he would announce gloomily that he had lost his faith in women All this is certain But it would appear also that he made some such threat as this most likely in a postscript It is no good your writing There can be no explanation Your letters will be destroyed unopened It is a question however if even this would have prevented Daisy from trying an appeal by post for though one may talk about destroying letters unopened it is an extremely difficult thing to do I feel therefore that Patrick s letter almost certainly contained a P P S also to this effect I cannot remain in London where we have spent so many happy hours together I am probably leaving for the Rocky Mountains to night Letters will not be forwarded Do not attempt to follow me And so Daisy was left with only the one means of communication and explanation the agony columns of the morning newspapers I was alone when you called You heard me talking to the dog PLEASE make appointment In the last sentence there is just a hint of irony which I find very attractive It seems to me to say Don t for heaven s sake come rushing back to Notting Hill all love and remorse without warning or you might hear me talking to the cat or the canary Make an appointment and I ll take care that there s NOTHING in the room when you come We may tell ourselves I think that Daisy understands her Patrick In fact I am beginning to understand Patrick myself and I see now that the real reason why Daisy chose the agony column as the medium of communication was that she knew Patrick would prefer it Patrick is distinctly the sort of man who likes agony columns I am sure it was the first thing he turned to on Wednesday morning It occurs to me to wonder if the honeymoon will be spent at Ilfracombe Patrick must have received William Benson s picture post card too We have all had one Just fancy if he HAD gone to the Rocky Mountains almost certainly mister Benson s letters would not have been forwarded The Label On those rare occasions when I put on my best clothes and venture into society I am always astonished at the number of people in it whom I do not know I have stood in a crowded ball room or sat in a crowded restaurant and reflected that of all the hundreds of souls present there was not one of whose existence I had previously had any suspicion Yet they all live tremendously important lives lives not only important to themselves but to numbers of friends and relations every day they cross some sort of Rubicon and to each one of them there comes a time when the whole of the rest of the world including confound it me seems absolutely of no account whatever That I had lived all these years in contented ignorance of their existence makes me a little ashamed To day in my oldest clothes I have wandered through the index of The Times Literary Supplement and I am now feeling a little ashamed of my ignorance of so many books Of novels alone there seem to be about nine hundred To write even a thoroughly futile novel is to my thinking a work of extraordinary endurance yet in say six hundred houses this work has been going on and I and you and all of us have remained utterly unmoved Well I have been making up for my indifference this morning I have been reading the titles of the books That is not so good or bad as reading the books themselves but it enables me to say that I have heard of such and such a novel and in some cases it does give me a slight clue to what goes on inside I should imagine that the best part of writing a novel was the choosing a title My idea of a title is that it should be something which reflects the spirit of your work and gives the hesitating purchaser some indication of what he is asked to buy To call your book Ethnan Frame or Esther Grant or John Temple or John Merridew I quote from the index is to help the reader not at all All it tells him is that one of the characters inside will be called John or Esther a matter probably of indifference to him Phyllis is a better title because it does give a suggestion of the nature of the book No novel with a tragic ending no powerful realistic novel would be called Phyllis Without having read Phyllis I should say that it was a charming story of suburban life told mostly in dialogue and that Phyllis herself was a perfect dear though a little cruel about that first box of chocolates he sent her However she married him in the end all right But if you don t call your book Phyllis or John Temple or missus Elmsley what I hear you asking are you to call it Well you might call it Kapak as I see somebody has done The beauty of Kapak as a title is that if you come into the shop by the back entrance and so approach the book from the wrong end it is still Kapak A title which looks the same from either end is of immense advantage to an author Besides in this particular case there is a mystery about Kapak which one is burning to solve Is it the bride s pet name for her father in law the password into the magic castle or that new stuff with which you polish brown boots Or is it only a camera Let us buy the book at once and find out Another mystery title is The Man with Thicker Beard which probably means something It is like Kapak in this that it reads equally well backwards but it is not so subtle Still we should probably be lured on to buy it On the other hand A Welsh Nightingale and a Would be Suffragette is just the sort of book to which we would not be tempted by the title It is bad enough to have to say to the shopman Have you A Welsh Nightingale and a Would be Suffragette but if we forgot the title as we probably should and had to ask at random for a would be nightingale and a Welsh suffragette or a wood nightingale and a Welsh rabbit or the Welsh suffragette s night in gaol we should soon begin to wish that we had decided on some quite simple book such as Greed Earth or Jonah And this is why a French title is always such a mistake Authors must remember that their readers have not only to order the book in many cases verbally but also to recommend it to their friends So I think mister Oliver Onions made a mistake when he called his collection of short stories Pot au Feu It is a good title but it is the sort of title to which the person to whom you are recommending the book always answers What And when people say What in reply to your best Parisian accent the only thing possible for you is to change the subject altogether But it is quite time that we came to some sort of decision as to what makes the perfect title Kapak will attract buyers as I have said though to some it may not seem quite fair Excellent from a commercial point of view it does not satisfy the conditions we laid down at first The title we agreed must reflect the spirit of the book In one sense Five Gallons of Gasolene does this but of course nobody could ask for that in a book shop Well then here is a perfect title Their High Adventure That explains itself just sufficiently When a Man s Married For Henri and Navarre and The King Over the Water are a little more obvious but they are still good The Love Story of a Mormon makes no attempt to deceive the purchaser but it can hardly be called a beautiful title Melody in Silver on the other hand is beautiful but for this reason makes one afraid to buy it lest there should be disappointment within In fact as I look down the index I am beginning to feel glad that there are so many hundreds of novels which I haven t read In most of them there would be disappointment And really one only reads books nowadays so as to be able to say to one s neighbour on one s rare appearances in society HAVE you read The Forged Coupon and WHAT do you think of The Muck Rake And for this an index is quite enough The Profession I have been reading a little book called How to Write for the Press Other books which have been published upon the same subject are How to Be an Author How to Write a Play How to Succeed as a Journalist How to Write for the Magazines and How to Earn six hundred a Year with the Pen Of these the last named has I think the most pleasing title Anybody can write a play the trouble is to get it produced Almost anybody can be an author the business is to collect money and fame from this state of being Writing for the magazines again sounds a delightful occupation but literally it means nothing without the company operation of the editors of the magazines and it is this company operation which is so difficult to secure But to earn six hundred a year with the pen is to do a definite thing if the book could really tell the secret of that it would have an enormous sale I have not read it so I cannot say what the secret is Perhaps it was only a handbook on forgery How to Write for the Press disappointed me It is concerned not with the literary journalist as I believe he is called but with the reporter as he is never called the proper title being special representative It gives in tabular form a list of the facts you should ascertain at the different functions you attend with this book in your pocket there would be no excuse if you neglected to find out at a wedding the names of the bride and bridegroom It also gives and I think this is very friendly of it a list of useful synonyms for the principal subjects animate and inanimate of description The danger of calling the protagonists at the court of Hymen this one is not from the book I thought of it myself just now the danger of calling them the happy pair more than once in a column is that your readers begin to suspect that you are a person of extremely limited mind and when once they get this idea into their heads they are not in a proper state to appreciate the rest of your article But if in your second paragraph you speak of the joyful couple and in your third of the ecstatic brace you give an impression of careless mystery of the language which can never be shed away Among the many interesting chapters is one dealing with contested elections One of the questions to which the special representative was advised to find an answer was this What outside bodies are taking active part in the contest In the bad old days now happily gone for ever the outside bodies of dead cats used to take an active and important part in the contest and as the same body would often be used twice the reporter in search of statistics was placed in a position of great responsibility Nowadays I suppose he is only meant to concern himself with such bodies as the Coal Consumers League and the Tariff Reform League and there would be no doubt in the mind of anybody as to whether they were there or not I am afraid I should not be a success as our special representative I should never think of half the things which occur to the good reporter You read in your local paper a sentence like this The bride s brother who only arrived last week from Australia where he held an important post under the Government and is about to proceed on a tour through Canada with curiously enough a nephew of the bride groom gave her away Well what a mass of information has to be gleaned before that sentence can be written Or this The hall was packed to suffocation and beneath the glare of the electric light specially installed for this occasion by Messrs Ampre Son of Pumpton the building being at ordinary times strikingly deficient in the matter of artificial lighting in spite of the efforts of the more progressive members of the town council the faces of not a few of the fairer sex could be observed You know I am afraid I should have forgotten all that I should simply have obtained a copy of the principal speech and prefaced it with the words mister Dodberry then spoke as follows or if my conscience would not allow of such a palpable misstatement mister Dodberry then rose with the intention of speaking as follows In the more human art of interviewing I should be equally at fault The interview itself would be satisfactory but I am afraid that its publication would lead people to believe that all the best things had been said by me To remember what anybody else has said is easy to remember even five minutes after what one has said oneself is almost impossible For to recall YOUR remarks in our argument at the club last night is simply a matter of memory to recall MINE I have to forget all that I meant to have said all that I ought to have said and all that I have thought upon the subject since In fact I begin to see that the successful reporter must eliminate his personality altogether whereas the successful literary journalist depends for his success entirely upon his personality which is what is meant by style I suppose it is for this reason that when the literary journalist is sent as our extra special representative to report a prize fight or a final cup tie or a political meeting the result is always appalling The ego bulges out of every line obviously conscious that it is showing us no ordinary reporting determined that it will not be overshadowed by the importance of the subject And those who are more interested in the matter than in the manner regard him as an intruder and the others regret that he is so greatly overtaxing his strength So each to his business and his handbook to each How to Write for the Press to the special representative and How to Be an Author to the author There is no book I believe called How to Be a Solicitor or a doctor or an admiral or a brewer That is a different matter altogether but any fool can write for the papers Smoking as a Fine Art My first introduction to Lady Nicotine 
7507-100453-0000	train-other-500	was at the innocent age of eight when finding a small piece of somebody else s tobacco lying unclaimed on the ground
7507-100453-0001	train-other-500	I decided to experiment with it Numerous desert island stories had told me that the pangs of hunger could be allayed by chewing tobacco it was thus that the hero staved off death
7507-100453-0002	train-other-500	before discovering the bread fruit tree Every right minded boy of eight hopes to be shipwrecked one day and it was proper that I should find out for myself whether my authorities could be trusted in this matter
7507-100453-0003	train-other-500	So I chewed tobacco In the sense that I certainly did not desire food for some time afterwards my experience justified the authorities but I felt at the time that it was not so much for staving off death
7507-100453-0004	train-other-500	as for reconciling oneself to it that tobacco chewing
7507-100453-0005	train-other-500	was to be recommended I have never practised it since At eighteen I went to Cambridge and bought two pipes in a case In those days Greek was compulsory but not more so
7507-100453-0006	train-other-500	than two pipes in a case One of the pipes had an amber stem and the other a vulcanite stem and both of them had silver belts That also was compulsory
7507-100453-0007	train-other-500	Having bought them one was free to smoke cigarettes However at the end of my first year I got to work seriously on a shilling briar and I have smoked that or something like it ever since
7507-100453-0008	train-other-500	In the last four years there has grown up a new school of pipe smokers by which I suspect I am hardly regarded as a pipe smoker at all
7507-100453-0009	train-other-500	This school buys its pipes always at one particular shop its pupils would as soon think of smoking a pipe without the white spot as of smoking brown paper So far are they from smoking brown paper
7507-100453-0010	train-other-500	that each one of them has his tobacco specially blended according to the colour of his hair his taste in revues and the locality in which he lives The first blend is naturally
7507-100453-0011	train-other-500	not the ideal one It is only when he has been a confirmed smoker for at least three months and knows the best and worst of all tobaccos that his exact requirements can be satisfied However
7507-100453-0012	train-other-500	it is the pipe rather than the tobacco which marks him as belonging to this particular school He pins his faith not so much to its labour saving devices
7507-100453-0013	train-other-500	as to the white spot outside the white spot of an otherwise aimless life This tells the world that it is one of THE pipes Never was an announcement more superfluous
7507-100453-0014	train-other-500	From the moment shortly after breakfast when he strikes his first match to the moment just before bed time when he strikes his hundredth it is obviously THE pipe which he is smoking
7507-100453-0015	train-other-500	For whereas men of an older school like myself smoke for the pleasure of smoking men of this school smoke for the pleasure of pipe owning of selecting which of their many white spotted pipes they will fill

none	none	 and letting it go out again of polishing it up with their own special polisher 
7507-100453-0017	train-other-500	and putting it to bed and then the pleasure of beginning all over again with another white spotted one They are not so much pipe smokers as pipe keepers and to have spoken as I did just now
7507-100453-0018	train-other-500	of their owning pipes was wrong for it is they who are in bondage to the white spot This school is founded firmly on four years of war When at the age of eighteen you are suddenly given a cheque book and called Sir
7507-100453-0019	train-other-500	you must do something by way of acknowledgment A pipe in the mouth makes it clear that there has been no mistake you are undoubtedly a man But you may be excused for feeling after the first pipe
7507-100453-0020	train-other-500	that the joys of smoking have been rated too high and for trying to extract your pleasure from the polish on the pipe s surface the pride of possessing a special mixture of your own and such like matters
7507-100453-0021	train-other-500	rather than from the actual inspiration and expiration of smoke In the same way a man not fond of reading
7507-100453-0022	train-other-500	may find delight in a library of well bound books They are pleasant to handle pleasant to talk about
none	none	 pleasant to show to friends 
7507-100453-0023	train-other-500	But it is the man without the library of well bound books who generally does most of the reading So I feel that it is we of the older school who do most of the smoking We smoke unconsciously
7507-100453-0024	train-other-500	while we are doing other things THEY try but not very successfully to do other things while they are consciously smoking No doubt they despise us and tell themselves that we are
7507-100453-0025	train-other-500	not real smokers but I fancy that they feel a little uneasy sometimes For my young friends are always trying to persuade me to join their school to become one of the white spotted ones
7507-100453-0026	train-other-500	I have no desire to be of their company but I am prepared to make a suggestion to the founder of the school It is that he should invent a pipe white spot and all which smokes itself
none	none	 His pupils could hang it in the mouth as picturesquely as before but the incidental bother of keeping it alight would no longer trouble them The Path to Glory My friend mister Sidney Mandragon is getting on He is now one of the great ones of the earth He has just been referred to as Among those present was mister Sidney Mandragon 
7507-100454-0000	train-other-500	As everybody knows or will know when they have read this article the four stages along the road to literary fame are marked by the four different manners
7507-100454-0001	train-other-500	in which the traveller s presence at a public function is recorded in the Press At the first stage the reporter glances at the list of guests and says to himself mister George Meredith
7507-100454-0002	train-other-500	never heard of him and for all the world knows next morning
none	none	 mister George Meredith might just as well have stayed at home At the second stage some years later 
7507-100454-0003	train-other-500	the reporter murmurs to his neighbour in a puzzled sort of way George Meredith
none	none	 George Meredith 
7507-100454-0004	train-other-500	Now where have I come across that name lately Wasn t he the man who pushed a wheelbarrow across America
none	none	 Or was he the chap who gave evidence in that murder trial last week And feeling that in either case his readers will be interested in the fellow 
7507-100454-0005	train-other-500	he says The guests included mister George Meredith and many others
none	none	 At the third stage the reporter knows at last who mister George Meredith is 
7507-100454-0006	train-other-500	Having seen an advertisement of one of his books and being pretty sure that the public has read none of them he refers to him as mister George Meredith the well known novelist
7507-100454-0007	train-other-500	The fourth and final stage beyond the reach of all but the favoured few
none	none	 is arrived at when the reporter can leave the name 
7507-100454-0008	train-other-500	to his public unticketed and says again Among those present was mister George Meredith The third stage is easy to reach indeed too easy The well known actresses
7507-100454-0009	train-other-500	are not Ellen Terry
none	none	 Irene Vanbrugh 
7507-100454-0010	train-other-500	and Marie Tempest but Miss Birdie
none	none	 Vavasour 
7507-100454-0011	train-other-500	who has discovered a new way of darkening the hair and Miss Girlie de Tracy who has been arrested for shop lifting In the same way the more the Press insists that a writer is
none	none	 well known the less hope will he have that the public has heard of him 
7507-100454-0012	train-other-500	Better far to remain at the second stage and to flatter oneself that one has really arrived at the fourth But my friend Sidney Mandragon is indeed at the final stage now
none	none	 for he had been the well known writer for at least a dozen years previously Of course he has been helped by his name Shakespeare may say what he likes but a good name goes a long way in the writing profession It was my business at one time to consider contributions for a certain paper and there was one particular contributor whose work I approached with an awe begotten solely of his name 
7507-100454-0013	train-other-500	It was not exactly Milton and not exactly Carlyle
none	none	 and not exactly Charles Lamb but it was a sort of mixture of all three and of many other famous names thrown in so that without having seen any of his work printed elsewhere 
7507-100454-0014	train-other-500	I felt that I could not take the risk of refusing it myself This is a good man I would say before beginning his article this man obviously has style And I shouldn t be surprised
none	none	 to hear that he was an authority on fishing I wish I could remember his name now and then you would see for yourself 
7507-100454-0015	train-other-500	Well take mister Hugh Walpole if he will allow me It is safe to say that when mister Walpole s first book came out the average reader felt vaguely that she had heard of him before
7507-100454-0016	train-other-500	She hadn t actually read his famous Letters but she had often wanted to
none	none	 and 
7507-100454-0017	train-other-500	or was that his uncle Anyway she had often heard people talking about him What a very talented family it was In the same way Sidney Mandragon has had
none	none	 the great assistance of one of the two Christian names which carry weight in journalism The other of course is Harold If you are Sidney or Harold the literary world is before you 
7507-100454-0018	train-other-500	Another hall mark by which we can tell whether a man has arrived or not is provided by the interview If say a Lepidopterist is just beginning his career
7507-100454-0019	train-other-500	nobody bothers about his opinions on anything If he is moderately well known in his profession the papers will seek his help whenever his own particular subject comes up
7507-100454-0020	train-other-500	in the day s news There is a suggestion perhaps in Parliament that butterflies should be muzzled and Our Representative
none	none	 promptly calls upon the well known Lepidopterist to ask what HE thinks about it But if he be of an established reputation then his professional opinion is no longer sought 
7507-100454-0021	train-other-500	What the world is eager for now is to be told his views on Sunday Games the Decadence of the Theatre or Bands in the Parks
7507-100454-0022	train-other-500	The modern advertising provides a new scale of values No doubt mister Pelman offers his celebrated hundred guineas fee equally to all his victims but we may be pretty sure
7507-100454-0023	train-other-500	that in his business like brain he has each one of them nicely labelled a Gallant Soldier being good for so much new business a titled Man of Letters
none	none	 being good for slightly less and that real Fame is best measured by the number of times that one s unbiased views on Pelmanism or Tonics or Hair Restorers are considered to be worth reprinting In this matter my friend Mandragon is doing nicely For a suitable fee he is prepared to attribute his success to anything in reason and his confession of faith can count upon a place in every full page advertisement of the mixture and frequently in the odd half columns I never quite understand why a tonic which has tightened up Mandragon s fibres or a Mind Training System which has brought General Blank s intellect to its present pitch should be accepted more greedily by the man in the street than a remedy which has only proved its value in the case of his undistinguished neighbour but then I can never understand quite a number of things However that doesn t matter All that matters at the moment is that mister Sidney Mandragon has now achieved glory Probably the papers have already pigeon holed his obituary notice It is a pleasing thought A Problem in Ethics Life is full of little problems which arise suddenly and find one wholly unprepared with a solution For instance you travel down to Wimbledon on the District Railway first class let us suppose because it is your birthday On your arrival you find that you have lost your ticket Now doubtless there is some sort of recognized business to be gone through which relieves you of the necessity of paying again You produce an affidavit of a terribly affirmative nature together with your card and a testimonial from a beneficed member of the Church of England Or you conduct a genial correspondence with the traffic manager which spreads itself over six months To save yourself this bother you simply tell the collector that you haven t a ticket and have come from Charing Cross Is it necessary to add first class Of course one has a strong feeling that one ought to but I think a still stronger feeling that one isn t defrauding the railway company if one doesn t I will try not to get so many ones into my next sentence For you may argue fairly that you established your right to travel first class when you stepped into the carriage with your ticket and it may be had it examined therein by an inspector All that you want to do now is to establish your right to leave the Wimbledon platform for the purer air of the common And you can do this perfectly easily with a third class ticket However this is a problem which will only arise if you are careless with your property But however careful you are it may happen to you at any moment that you become suddenly the owner of a shilling with a hole in it I am such an owner I entered into possession a week ago Heaven knows who played the thing off on me As soon as I made the discovery I went into a tobacconist s and bought a box of matches This he said looking at me reproachfully is a shilling with a hole in it I know I said but it s all right thanks I don t want to wear it any longer The fact is Joanna has thrown me However I needn t go into that He passed it back to me I am afraid I can t take it he said Why not I managed to However I had to give him one without a hole before he would let me out of his shop Next time I was more thoughtful I handed three to the cashier at my restaurant in payment of lunch and the ventilated one was in the middle He saw the joke of it just as I was escaping down the stairs Hi he said this shilling has a hole in it I went back and looked at it Sure enough it had Well that s funny I said Did you drop it or what He handed the keepsake back to me He also had something of reproach in his eye Thanks very much I said I wouldn t have lost it for worlds Emily But I mustn t bore you with the story Good day to you And I gave him a more solid coin and went Well that s how we are at present A more unscrupulous person than myself would have palmed it off long ago He would have told himself with hateful casuistry that the coin was none the worse for the air hole in it and that if everybody who came into possession of it pressed it on to the next man nobody would be injured by its circulation But I cannot argue like this It pleases me to give my shilling a run with the others sometimes I like to put it down on a counter with one or two more preferably in the middle of them where the draught cannot blow through it but I should indeed be surprised I mean sorry if it did not come back to me at once There is one thing anyhow that I will not do I will not give it to a waiter or a taxi driver or to anybody else as a tip If you estimate the market value of a shilling with a hole in it at anything from ninepence to fourpence according to the owner s chances of getting rid of it then it might be considered possibly a handsome anyhow an adequate tip for a driver but somehow the idea does not appeal to me at all For if the recipient did not see the hole you would feel that you had been unnecessarily generous to him and that one last effort to have got it off on to a shopkeeper would have been wiser while if he did see it well we know what cabmen are He couldn t legally object it is a voluntary gift on your part and even regarded as a contribution to his watch chain worthy of thanks but Well I don t like it I don t think it s sportsmanlike However I have an idea at last I know a small boy who owns some lead soldiers I propose to borrow one of these a corporal or perhaps a serjeant and boil him down and then fill up the hole in the shilling with lead Shillings you know are not solid silver oh no they have alloy in them This one will have a little more than usual perhaps One cannot tie oneself down to an ounce or two We set out I believe to discuss the morals of the question It is a most interesting subject The Happiest Half Hours of Life Yesterday I should have gone back to school had I been a hundred years younger My most frequent dream nowadays or nowanights I suppose I should say is that I am back at school and trying to construe difficult passages from Greek authors unknown to me That they are unknown is my own fault as will be pointed out to me sternly in a moment Meanwhile I stand up and gaze blankly at the text wondering how it is that I can have forgotten to prepare it Er him the er him the the er many wiled Odysseus h r m then him addressing the many wiled Odysseus er addressed Er er the er And then sweet relief I wake up That is one of my dreams and another is that I am trying to collect my books for the next school and that an algebra or whatever you like is missing The bell has rung as it seems hours ago I am searching my shelves desperately I am diving under my table behind the chair I shall be late I shall be late late late No doubt I had these bad moments in real life a hundred years ago Indeed I must have had them pretty often that they should come back to me so regularly now But it is curious that I should never dream that I am going back to school for the misery of going back must have left a deeper mark on my mind than all the little accidental troubles of life when there I was very happy at school but oh the utter wretchedness of the last day of the holidays One began to be apprehensive on the Monday Foolish visitors would say sometimes on the Monday When are you going back to school and make one long to kick them for their tactlessness As well might they have said to a condemned criminal When are you going to be hanged or What kind of er knot do you think they ll use Througout Monday and Tuesday we played the usual games amused ourselves in the usual way but with heavy hearts In the excitement of the moment we would forget and be happy and then suddenly would come the thought We re going back on Wednesday And on Tuesday evening we would bring a moment s comfort to ourselves by imagining that we were not going back on the morrow Our favourite dream was that the school was burnt down early on Wednesday morning and that a telegram arrived at breakfast apologizing for the occurrence and pointing out that it would be several months before even temporary accommodation could be erected No Vandal destroyed historic buildings so light heartedly as we And on Tuesday night we prayed that if the lightnings of Heaven failed us at least a pestilence should be sent in aid Somehow SOMEHOW let the school be uninhabitable But the telegram never came We woke on Wednesday morning as wakes the murderer on his last day We took a dog or two for a walk we pretended to play a game of croquet After lunch we donned the badges of our servitude The comfortable careless dirty flannels were taken off and the black coats and stiff white collars put on At three point thirty an early tea was ready for us something rather special a last mockery of holiday Dressed crab I remember on one occasion and I travelled with my back to the engine after it a position I have never dared to assume since Then good byes tips kisses a last look and the four point ten was puffing out of the station And nothing nothing had happened I can remember thinking in the train how unfair it all was Fifty two weeks in the year I said to myself and only fifteen of them spent at home A child snatched from his mother at nine and never again given back to her for more than two months at a time Is this Russia I said and getting no answer could only comfort myself with the thought This day twelve weeks And once the incredible did happen It was through no intervention of Providence no it was entirely our own doing We got near some measles and for a fortnight we were kept in quarantine I can say truthfully that we never spent a duller two weeks There seemed to be nothing to do at all The idea that we were working had to be fostered by our remaining shut up in one room most of the day and within the limits of that room we found very little in the way of amusement We were bored extremely And always we carried with us the thought of Smith or Robinson taking our place in the Junior House team and making hundreds of runs Because of course we were very happy at school really The trouble was that we were so much happier in the holidays I have had many glorious moments since I left school but I have no doubt as to what have been the happiest half hours in my life They were the half hours on the last day of term before we started home We spent them on a lunch of our own ordering It was the first decent meal we had had for weeks and when it was over there were all the holidays before us Life may have better half hours than that to offer but I have not met them Natural Science It is when Parliament is not sitting that the papers are most interesting to read I have found an item of news to day which would never have been given publicity in the busy times and it has moved me strangely Here it is backed by the authority of doctor Chalmers Mitchell The caterpillar of the puss moth not satisfied with Nature s provisions for its safety makes faces at young birds and is said to alarm them considreably I like that is said to Probably the young bird would deny indignantly that he was alarmed and would explain that he was only going away because he suddenly remembered that he had an engagement on the croquet lawn or that he had forgotten his umbrella But whether he alarms them or not the fact remains that the caterpillar of the puss moth does make faces at young birds and we may be pretty sure that even if he began the practice in self defence the habit is one that has grown on him Indeed I can see him actually looking out for a thrush s nest and then climbing up to it popping his head over the edge suddenly and making a face Probably too the mother birds frighten their young ones by telling them that if they aren t good the puss moth caterpillar will be after them while the poor caterpillar himself never having known a mother s care has had no one to tell him that if he goes on making such awful faces he will be struck like that one day These delvings into natural history bring back my youth very vividly I never kept a puss moth but I had a goat moth which ate its way out of a match box and as far as I remember took all the matches with it There were caterpillars though of a gentler nature who stayed with me and of these some were obliging enough to turn into chrysalises Not all by any means A caterpillar is too modest to care about changing in public To conduct his metamorphosis in some quiet corner where he is not poked every morning to see if he is getting stiffer is what your caterpillar really wants Mine had no private life to mention They were as much before the world as royalty or an actress And even those who brought off the first event safely never emerged into the butterfly world Something would always happen to them Have you seen my chrysalis we used to ask each other I left him in the bathroom yesterday But what I kept most successfully were minerals One is or is not a successful mineralogist according as one is or is not allowed a geological hammer I had a geological hammer To scour the cliffs armed with a geological hammer and a bag for specimens is to be a king among boys The only specimen I can remember taking with my hammer was a small piece of shin That was enough however to end my career as a successful mineralogist As an unsuccessful one I persevered for some months and eventually had a collection of eighteen units They were put out on the bed every evening in order of size and ranged from a large lump of Iceland spar down to a small dead periwinkle In those days I could have told you what granite was made of In those days I had over my bed a map of the geological strata of the district in different colours like a chocolate macaroon And in those days I knew my way to the Geological Museum As a botanist I never really shone but two of us joined an open air course and used to be taken expeditions into Kew Gardens and such places where our lecturer explained to his pupils all grown up save ourselves the less recondite mysteries There was one golden Saturday when we missed the rendezvous at Pinner and had a picnic by ourselves instead and after that many other golden Saturdays when some unaccountable accident separated us from the party I remember particularly a day in Highgate Woods a good place for losing a botanical lecturer in if you had been there you would have seen two little boys very content lying one each side of a large stone slab racing caterpillars against each other But there was one episode in my career as a natural scientist a career whose least details are brought back by the magic word caterpillar over which I still go hot with the sense of failure This was an attempt to stuff a toad I don t know to this day if toads can be stuffed but when our toad died he had to be commemorated in some way and failing a marble statue it seemed good to stuff him It was when we had got the skin off him that we began to realize our difficulties I don t know if you have had the skin of a fair sized toad in your hand if so you will understand that our first feeling was one of surprise that a whole toad could ever have got into it There seemed to be no shape about the thing at all You could have carried it no doubt we did I have forgotten in the back of a watch But it had lost all likeness to a toad and it was obvious that stuffing meant nothing to it Of course little boys ought not to skin toads and carry geological hammers and deceive learned professors of botany I know it is wrong And of course caterpillars of the puss moth variety oughtn t to make faces at timid young thrushes But it is just these things which make such pleasant memories afterwards when professors and toads are departed when the hammers lie rusty in the coal cellar and when the young thrushes are grown up to be quite big birds There are fortunate mortals who can always comfort themselves with a clich If any question arises as to the moral value of Racing whether in war time or in peace time they will murmur something about improving the breed of horses and sleep afterwards with an easy conscience To one who considers how many millions of people are engaged upon this important work it is surprising that nothing more notable in the way of a super horse has as yet emerged one would have expected at least by this time something which combined the flying powers of the hawk with the diving powers of the seal No doubt this is what the followers of the Colonel s Late Wire are aiming at and even if they have to borrow ten shillings from the till in the good cause they feel that possibly by means of that very ten shillings Nature has approximated a little more closely to the desired animal Supporters of Hunting again will tell you speaking from inside knowledge that the fox likes it and one is left breathless at the thought of the altruism of the human race which will devote so much time and money to amusing a small bushy tailed four legged friend who might otherwise be bored And the third member of the Triple Alliance which has made England what it is is Beer and in support of Beer there is also a clich ready Talk to anybody about Intemperance and he will tell you solemnly as if this disposed of the trouble that one can just as easily be intemperate in other matters as in the matter of alcohol After which it seems almost a duty to a broad minded man to go out and get drunk It is of course true that we can be intemperate in eating as well as in drinking but the results of the intemperance would appear to be different After a fifth help of rice pudding one does not become over familiar with strangers nor does an extra slice of ham inspire a man to beat his wife After five pints of beer or fifteen or fifty a man will go anywhere in reason but he won t go home after five helps of rice pudding I imagine home would seem to him the one desired haven The two intemperances may be equally blameworthy but they are not equally offensive to the community Yet for some reason over eating is considered the mark of the beast and over drinking the mark of rather a fine fellow The poets and other gentlemen who have written so much romantic nonsense about good red wine and good brown ale are responsible for this I admit that a glass of Burgundy is a more beautiful thing than a blancmange but I do not think that it follows that a surfeit of one is more heroic than a surfeit of the other There may be a divinity in the grape which excuses excess but if so one would expect it to be there even before the grape had been trodden on by somebody else Yet no poet ever hymned the man who tucked into the dessert or told him that he was by way of becoming a jolly good fellow He is only by way of becoming a pig It is the true the blushful Hippocrene To tell oneself this is to pardon everything However unpleasant a drunken man may seem at first sight as soon as one realizes that he has merely been putting away a blushful Hippocrene one ceases to be angry with him If Keats or somebody had said of a piece of underdone mutton It is the true the blushful Canterbury indigestion would carry a more romantic air and at the third helping one could claim to be a bit of a devil The beaded bubbles winking at the brim this might also have been sung of a tapioca pudding in which case a couple of tapioca puddings would certainly qualify the recipient as one of the boys If only the poets had praised over eating rather than over drinking how much pleasanter the streets would be on festival nights I suppose that I have already said enough to have written myself down a Temperance Fanatic a Thin Blooded Cocoa Drinker and a number of other things equally contemptible which is all very embarrassing to a man who is composing at the moment on port and who gets entangled in the skin of cocoa whenever he tries to approach it But if anything could make me take kindly to cocoa it would be the sentimental rubbish which is written about the manliness of drinking alcohol It is no more manly to drink beer not even if you call it good brown ale than it is to drink beef tea It may be more healthy I know nothing about that nor from the diversity of opinion expressed do the doctors it may be cheaper more thirst quenching anything you like But it is a thing the village idiot can do and often does without becoming thereby the spiritual comrade of Robin Hood King Harry the Fifth Drake and all the other heroes who if we are to believe the Swill School have made old England great on beer But to doubt the spiritual virtues of alcohol is not to be a Prohibitionist For my own sake I want neither England nor America dry Whether I want them dry for the sake of England and America I cannot quite decide But if I ever do come to a decision it will not be influenced by that other clich which is often trotted out complacently as if it were something to thank Heaven for You can t make people moral by Act of Parliament It is not a question of making them moral but of keeping them from alcohol It may be a pity to do this but it is obviously possible just as it is possible to keep them that is to say the overwhelming majority of them from opium Nor shall I be influenced by the argument that such prohibition is outside the authority of a Government For if a Government can demand a man s life for reasons of foreign policy it can surely demand his whisky for reasons of domestic policy if it can call upon him to start fighting it can call upon him to stop drinking But if opium and alcohol is prohibited you say why not tobacco When tobacco is mentioned I feel like the village Socialist who was quite ready to share two theoretical cows with his neighbour but when asked if the theory applied also to pigs answered indignantly What are you talking about I ve GOT two pigs I could bear an England which went dry but an England which went out So before assenting to the right of a Government to rob the working man of his beer I have to ask myself if I assent to its right to rob me of my pipe Well if it were agreed by a majority of the community in spite of all my hymns to Nicotine that England would be happier without tobacco then I think I should agree also But I might feel that I should be happier without England Just a little way without the Isle of Man say Chess has this in common with making poetry that the desire for it comes upon the amateur in gusts It is very easy for him not to make poetry sometimes he may go for months without writing a line of it But when once he is delivered of an ode then the desire to write another ode is strong upon him A sudden passion for rhyme masters him and must work itself out It will be all right in a few weeks he will go back to prose or bills of parcels or whatever is his natural method of expressing himself none the worse for his adventure But he will have gained this knowledge for his future guidance that poems never come singly Every two or three years I discover the game of chess In normal times when a man says to me Do you play chess I answer coldly Well I know the moves Would you like a game he asks and I say I don t think I will thanks very much I hardly ever play And there the business ends But once in two years or it may be three circumstances are too strong for me I meet a man so keen or a situation so dull that politeness or boredom leads me to accept The board is produced I remind myself that the queen stands on a square of her own colour and that the knight goes next to the castle I push forward the king s pawn two squares and we are off Yes we are off but not for one game only For a month at least I shall dream of chess at night and make excuses to play it in the day For a month chess will be even more to me than golf or billiards games which I adore because I am so bad at them For a month starting from yesterday when I was inveigled into a game you must regard me please as a chess maniac Among small boys with no head for the game I should probably be described as a clever player If my opponent only learnt yesterday and is still a little doubtful as to what a knight can do I know one or two rather good tricks for removing his queen My subtlest stroke is to wait until Her Majesty is in front of the king and then to place my castle in front of her with a pawn in support Sometimes I forget the pawn and he takes my castle in which case I try to look as if the loss of my castle was the one necessary preliminary to my plan of campaign and that now we were off When he is busy on one side of the board I work a knight up on the other and threaten two of his pieces simultaneously To the extreme novice I must seem rather resourceful But then I am an old hand at the game My career dates from well years ago when I won my house championship at school This championship may have carried a belt with it I have forgotten But there was certainly a prize a prize of five solid shillings supposing the treasurer had managed to collect the subscriptions In the year when I won it I was also treasurer I assure you that the quickness and skill necessary for winning the competition were as nothing to that necessary for collecting the money If any pride remains to me over that affair if my name is written in letters of fire in the annals of our house chess club it is because I actually obtained the five shillings After this the game did not trouble me for some time But there came a day when a friend and I lunched at a restaurant in which chess boards formed as permanent a part the furniture of the dining tables as the salt and mustard Partly in joke because it seemed to be the etiquette of the building we started a game We stayed there two hours and the fever remained with me for two months Another year or so of normal development followed Then I caught influenza and spent dull days in bed Nothing can be worse for an influenza victim than chess but I suppose my warders did not realize how much I suffered under the game Anyhow I played it all day and dreamed of it all night a riot of games in which all the people I knew moved diagonally and up and down took each other and became queens And now I have played again and am once more an enthusiast You will agree with me will you not that it is a splendid game People mock at it They say that it is not such good exercise as cricket or golf How wrong they are That it brings the same muscles into play as does cricket I do not claim for it Each game develops a different set of sinews but what chess player who has sat with an extended forefinger on the head of his queen for five minutes before observing the enemy s bishop in the distance and bringing back his piece to safety what chess player I say will deny that the muscles of the hand ridge up like lumps of iron after a month at the best of games What chess player who has stretched his arm out in order to open with the Ruy Lopez gambit who has then withdrawn it as the possibilities of the Don Quixote occur to him and who has finally after another forward and backward movement decided to rely upon the bishop s declined pawn what chess player I ask will not affirm that the biceps are elevated by this noblest of pastimes And finally what chess player who in making too eagerly the crowning move has upset with his elbow the victims of the preliminary skirmishing so that they roll upon the floor what chess player who has to lean down and pick them up will not be the better for the strain upon his diaphragm No say what you will against chess but do not mock at it for its lack of exercise Yet there is this against it The courtesies of the game are few I think that this must be why the passion for it leaves me after a month When at cricket you are bowled first ball the wicketkeeper can comfort you by murmuring that the light is bad when at tennis your opponent forces for the dedans and strikes you heavily under the eye he can shout Sorry when at golf you reach a bunker in four and take three to get out your partner can endear himself by saying Hard luck but at chess everything that the enemy does to you is deliberate He cannot say Sorry as he takes your knight he does not call it hard luck when your king is surrounded by vultures eager for his death and though it would be kindly in him to attribute to the bad light the fact that you never noticed his castle leaning against your queen yet it would be quite against the etiquette of the game Indeed it is impossible to win gracefully at chess No man yet has said Mate in a voice which failed to sound to his opponent bitter boastful and malicious It is the tone of that voice which after a month I find it impossible any longer to stand A Doubtful Character I find it difficult to believe in Father Christmas If he is the jolly old gentleman he is always said to be why doesn t he behave as such How is it that the presents go so often to the wrong people This is no personal complaint I speak for the world The rich people get the rich presents and the poor people get the poor ones That may not be the fault of Father Christmas he may be under contract for a billion years to deliver all presents just as they are addressed but how can he go on smiling He must long to alter all that There is Miss Priscilla A who gets five guineas worth of the best every year from mister Cyril B who hopes to be her heir Mustn t that make Father Christmas mad Yet he goes down the chimney with it just the same When his contract is over and he has a free hand he ll arrange something about THAT I m sure If he is the jolly old gentleman of the pictures his sense of humour must trouble him He must be itching to have jokes with the parcels Only just this once he would plead Let me give missus Brown the safety razor and mister Brown the night dress case I swear I won t touch any of the others Of course that wouldn t be a very subtle joke but jolly old gentlemen with white beards aren t very subtle in their humour They lean to the broader effects the practical joke and the pun I can imagine Father Christmas making his annual pun on the word reindeer and the eldest reindeer making a feeble attempt to smile The younger ones wouldn t so much as try Yet he would make it so gaily that you would love him even if you couldn t laugh Coming down chimneys is dangerous work for white beards and if I believed in him I should ask myself how he manages to keep so clean I suppose his sense of humour suggested the chimney to him in the first place and for a year or two it was the greatest joke in the world But now he must wish sometimes that he came in by the door or the window Some chimneys are very dirty for white beards Have you noticed that children who hang up their stockings always get lots of presents and that we grown ups who don t hang up our stockings never get any This makes me think that perhaps after all Father Christmas has some say in the distribution When he sees an empty stocking he pops in a few things on his own account with from Aunt Emma pinned on to them Then you write to Aunt Emma to thank her for her delightful present and she is so ashamed of herself for not having sent you one that she never lets on about it But when Father Christmas doesn t see a stocking he just leaves you the embroidered tobacco pouch from your sister and the postal order from your rich uncle and is glad to get out of the house Of his attitude towards Christmas cards I cannot speak with certainty but I fancy that he does not bring these down the chimney too the truth being probably that it is he who composes the mottoes on them and that with the customary modesty of the author he leaves the distribution of them to others The old old wish a merry Christmas and a happy New Year he considers to be his masterpiece so far but A righte merrie Christemasse runs it close May happy hours be yours is another epigram in the same vein which has met with considerable success You can understand how embarrassing it would be to an author if he had to cart round his own works and practically to force them on people This is why you so rarely find a Christmas card in your stocking There is one other thing at which Father Christmas draws the line he will not deliver venison The reindeer say it comes too near home to them But apart from this he is never so happy as when dealing with hampers He would put a plum pudding into every stocking if he could for like all jolly old gentlemen with nice white beards he loves to think of people enjoying their food I am not sure that he holds much with chocolates although he is entrusted with so many boxes that he has learnt to look on them with kindly tolerance But the turkey idea I imagine though I cannot speak with authority the turkey idea was entirely his own Nothing like turkey for making the beard grow If I believed in Father Christmas I should ask myself what he does all the summer all the year indeed after his one day is over The reindeer of course are put out to grass But where is Father Christmas Does he sleep for fifty one weeks Does he shave and mix with us mortals Or does he yes that must be it does he spend the year in training in keeping down his figure Chimney work is terribly trying the figure wants watching if one is to carry it through successfully This is especially so in the case of jolly old gentlemen with white beards I can see Father Christmas as soon as his day is over taking himself off to the Equator and running round and round it By next December he is in splendid condition When his billion years are over when his contract expires and he is allowed a free hand with the presents I suppose I shall not be alive to take part in the distribution But none the less I like to think of the things I should get There are at least half a dozen things which I deserve and Father Christmas knows it In any equitable scheme of allotment I should come out well Half a minute he would say I must just put these cigars aside for the gentleman who had the picture post card last year What have you got there The country cottage and the complete edition of Meredith Ah yes perhaps he d better have those too That would be something like a Father Christmas Thoughts on Thermometers Our thermometer went down to eleven deg the other night The excitement was intense It was of course the first person down to breakfast who rushed into the garden and made the discovery and as each of us appeared he was greeted with the news I say do you know there were twenty one degrees of frost last night Really By Jove We were all very happy and talkative at breakfast an event rare enough to be chronicled It was not that we particularly wanted a frost but that we felt that if it was going to freeze it might as well do it properly so as to show other nations that England was still to be reckoned with And there was also the feeling that if the thermometer could get down to eleven deg it might some day get down to zero and then perhaps the Thames would be frozen over again at Westminster and the papers would be full of strange news and generally speaking life would be a little different from the ordinary In a word there would be a chance of something happening which I take it is why one buys a thermometer and watches it so carefully Of course every nice thermometer has a device for registering the maximum and minimum temperatures which can only be set with a magnet This gives you an opportunity of using a magnet in ordinary life an opportunity which occurs all too seldom Indeed I can think of no other occasion on which it plays any important part in one s affairs It would be interesting to know if the sale of magnets exceeds the sale of thermometers and if so why and it would also be interesting to know why magnets are always painted red as if they were dangerous or belonged to the Government or but this is a question into which it is impossible to go now My present theme is thermometers Our thermometer which went down to eleven deg the other night is not one of your common mercury ones it is filled with a pink fluid which I am told is alcohol though I have never tried It hangs in the kitchen garden This gives you an excuse in summer for going into the kitchen garden and leaning against the fruit trees Let s go and look at the thermometer you say to your guest from London and just for the moment he thinks that the amusements of the country are not very dramatic But after a day or two he learns that what you really mean is Let s go and see if any fruit has blown down in the night And he takes care to lean against the right tree An elaborate subterfuge but necessary if your gardener is at all strict But whether your thermometer hangs in the kitchen garden or at the back of the shrubbery you must recognize one thing about it namely that it is an open air plant There are people who keep thermometers shut up indoors which is both cruel and unnecessary When you complain that the library is a little chilly as surely you are entitled to they look at the thermometer nailed to the Henry Fielding shelf and say Oh no I don t think so It s sixty five As if anybody wanted a thermometer to know if a room were cold or not These people insult thermometers and their guests further by placing one of the former in the bathroom soap dish in order that the latter may discover whether it is a hot or cold bath which they are having All decent people know that a hot bath is one which you can just bear to get into and that a cold bath is one which you cannot bear to think of getting into but have to for honour s sake They do riot want to be told how many degrees Fahrenheit it is The undersized temperature taker which the doctor puts under your tongue before telling you to keep warm and take plenty of milk puddings is properly despised by every true thermometer lover Any record which it makes is too personal for a breakfast table topic and moreover it is a thermometer which affords no scope for the magnet Altogether it is a contemptible thing An occasional devotee will bite it in two before returning it to its owner but this is rather a strong line to take It is perhaps best to avoid it altogether by not being ill A thermometer must always be treated with care for the mercury once spilt can only be replaced with great difficulty It is considered to be one of the most awkward things to pick up after dinner and only a very steady hand will be successful Some people with a gift for handling mercury or alcohol make their own thermometers but even when you have got the stuff into the tube it is always a question where to put the little figures So much depends upon them Now I must tell you the one hereditary failing of the thermometer I had meant to hide it from you but I see that you are determined to have it It is this you cannot go up to it and tap it At least you can but you don t get that feeling of satisfaction from it which the tapping of a barometer gives you Of course you can always put a hot thumb on the bulb and watch the mercury run up this is satisfying for a short time but it is not the same thing as tapping And I am wrong to say always for in some thermometers indeed in ours alas the bulb is wired in so that no falsifying thumb can get to work However this has its compensations for if no hot thumb can make our thermometer untrue to itself neither can any cold thumb And so when I tell you again that our thermometer did go down to eleven deg the other night you have no excuse for not believing that our twenty one degrees of frost was a genuine affair In fact you will appreciate our excitement at breakfast For a Wet Afternoon Let us consider something seasonable let us consider indoor games for a moment And by indoor games I do not mean anything so serious as bridge and billiards nor anything so commercial as vingt et un with fish counters nor anything so strenuous as bumps The games I mean are those jolly sociable ones in which everybody in the house can join with an equal chance of distinction those friendly games which are played with laughter round a fire what time the blizzards rattle against the window pane These games may be divided broadly into two classes namely paper games and guessing games The initial disadvantage of the paper game is that pencils have to be found for everybody generally a difficult business Once they are found there is no further trouble until the game is over when the pencils have to be collected from everybody generally an impossible business If you are a guest in the house insist upon a paper game for it gives you a chance of acquiring a pencil if you are the host consider carefully whether you would not rather play a guessing game But the guessing game has one great disadvantage too It demands periodically that a member of the company should go out by himself into the hall and wait there patiently until his companions have thought of something It may be supposed that he too is thinking of something in the cold hall but perhaps not liking to say it However careful the players are unpleasantness is bound to arise sometimes over this preliminary stage of the game I knew of one case where the people in the room forgot all about the lady waiting in the hall and began to tell each other ghost stories The lights were turned out and sitting round the flickering fire the most imaginative members of the household thrilled their hearers with ghostly tales of the dead Suddenly in the middle of the story of Torfrida of the Towers a lady who had strangled her children and ever afterwards haunted the battlements headless and in a night gown the door opened softly and Miss Robinson entered to ask how much longer they would be Miss Robinson was wearing a white frock and the effect of her entry was tremendous I remember too another evening when we were playing proverbs William who had gone outside was noted for his skill at the game and we were determined to give him something difficult something which hadn t a camel or a glass house or a stable door in it After some discussion a member of the company suggested a proverb from the Persian as he alleged It went something like this A wise man is kind to his dog but a poor man riseth early in the morning We took his word for it and feeling certain that William would never guess called him to come in Unfortunately William who is a trifle absentminded had gone to bed To avoid accidents of this nature it is better to play clumps a guessing game in which the procedure is slightly varied In clumps two people go into the hall and think of something while the rest remain before the fire Thus however long the interval of waiting all are happy for the people inside can tell each other stories or as a last resort play some other game and the two outside are presumably amusing themselves in arranging something very difficult Personally I adore clumps not only for this reason but because of its revelation of hidden talent There may be a dozen persons in each clump and in theory every one of the dozen is supposed to take a hand in the cross examination but in practice it is always one person who extracts the information required by a cataract of searching questions Always one person and generally a girl I love to see her coming out of her shell She has excelled at none of the outdoor games perhaps she has spoken hardly a word at meals In our little company she has scarcely seemed to count But suddenly she awakes into life Clumps is the family game at home she has been brought up on it In a moment she discovers herself as our natural leader a leader whom we follow humbly And however we may spend the rest of our time together the effect of her short hour s triumph will not wholly wear away She is now established But the paper games will always be most popular and once you are over the difficulty of the pencils you may play them for hours without wearying But of course you must play the amusing ones and not the dull ones The most common paper game of all that of making small words out of a big one has nothing to recommend it for there can be no possible amusement in hearing somebody else read out but bat bet bin ben and so forth riot even if you spend half an hour discussing whether ben is really a word On the other hand your game however amusing ought to have some finality about it a game is not really a game unless somebody can win it For this reason I cannot wholly approve telegrams To concoct a telegram whose words begin with certain selected letters of the alphabet say the first ten is to amuse yourself anyhow and possibly your friends whether you say Am bringing camel down early Friday Got hump Inform Jamrach or Afraid better cancel dinner engagement Fred got horrid indigestion JANE But it is impossible to declare yourself certainly the winner Fortunately however there are games which combine amusement with a definite result games in which the others can be funny while you can get the prize or if you prefer it the other way about When I began to write this the rain was streaming against the window panes It is now quite fine This you will notice often happens when you decide to play indoor games on a wet afternoon Just as you have found the pencils the sun comes out Declined with Thanks A paragraph in the papers of last week recorded the unusual action of a gentleman called Smith or some such name who had refused for reasons of conscience to be made a justice of the peace Smith s case was that the commission was offered to him as a reward for political services and that this was a method of selecting magistrates of which he did not approve So he showed his contempt for the system by refusing an honour which most people covet and earned by this such

7507-100463-0032	train-other-500	that he was not in the present case worrying about moral points of view he was simply expressing his opinion that the luxury of not having little notes passed to him in court

are they who know how to refuse runs the club s motto for they will have a chance to be clean On Going into a House It is nineteen years since I lived in a house nineteen years since I went upstairs to bed and came downstairs to breakfast Of course I have done these things in other people s houses from time to time but what we do in other people s houses does not count We are holiday making then We play cricket and golf and croquet and run up and down stairs and amuse ourselves in a hundred difierent ways but all this is no fixed part of our life Now however for the first time for nineteen years I am actually living in a house I have imagine my excitement a staircase of my own Flats may be convenient I thought so myself when I lived in one some days ago but they have their disadvantages One of the disadvantages is that you are never in complete possession of the flat You may think that the drawing room floor to take a case is your very own but it isn t you share it with a man below who uses it as a ceiling If you want to dance a step dance you have to consider his plaster I was always ready enough to accommodate myself in this matter to his prejudices but I could not put up with his old fashioned ideas about bathroom ceilings It is very cramping to one s style in the bath to reflect that the slightest splash may call attention to itself on the ceiling of the gentleman below This is to share a bathroom with a stranger an intolerable position for a proud man To day I have a bathroom of my own for the first time in my life I can see already that living in a house is going to be extraordinarily healthy both for mind and body At present I go upstairs to my bedroom and downstairs again about once in every half hour not simply from pride of ownership to make sure that the bedroom is still there and that the staircase is continuing to perform its functions but in order to fetch something a letter or a key which as likely as not I have forgotten about again as soon as I have climbed to the top of the house No such exercise as this was possible in a flat and even after two or three days I feel the better for it But obviously I cannot go on like this if I am to have leisure for anything else With practice I shall so train my mind that when I leave my bedroom in the morning I leave it with everything that I can possibly require until nightfall This I imagine will not happen for some years yet meanwhile physical training has precedence Getting up to breakfast means something different now it means coming down to breakfast To come down to breakfast brings one immediately in contact with the morning The world flows past the window that small and as it seems to me particularly select portion of the world which finds itself in our quiet street I can see it as I drink my tea When I lived in a flat days and days ago anything might have happened to London and I should never have known it until the afternoon Everybody else could have perished in the night and I should settle down as complacently as ever to my essay on making the world safe for democracy Not so now As soon as I have reached the bottom of my delightful staircase I am one with the outside world Also one with the weather which is rather convenient On the third floor it is almost impossible to know what sort of weather they are having in London A day which looks cold from a third floor window may be very sultry down below but by that time one is committed to an overcoat How much better to live in a house and to step from one s front door and inhale a sample of whatever day the gods have sent Then one can step back again and dress accordingly But the best of a house is that it has an outside personality as well as an inside one Nobody not even himself could admire a man s flat from the street nobody could look up and say What very delightful people must live behind those third floor windows Here it is different Any of you may find himself some day in our quiet street and stop a moment to look at our house at the blue door with its jolly knocker at the little trees in their blue tubs standing within a ring of blue posts linked by chains at the bright coloured curtains You may not like it but we shall be watching you from one of the windows and telling each other that you do In any case we have the pleasure of looking at it ourselves and feeling that we are contributing something to London whether for better or for worse We are part of a street now and can take pride in that street Before we were only part of a big unmanageable building It is a solemn thought that I have got this house for apparently eighty seven years One never knows and it may be that by the end of that time I shall be meditating an article on the advantages of living in a flat A flat I shall say is so convenient The Ideal Author Samuel Butler made a habit and urged it upon every young writer of carrying a notebook about with him The most profitable ideas he felt do not come from much seeking but rise unbidden in the mind and if they are not put down at once on paper they may be lost for ever But with a notebook in the pocket you are safe no thought is too fleeting to escape you Thus if an inspiration for a five thousand word story comes suddenly to you during the dessert you murmur an apology to your neighbour whip out your pocket book and jot down a few rough notes Hero choked peach stone eve marriage Lady Honoria Pchtree planted by jltd frst love Ironyofthings Tragic Next morning you extract your notebook from its white waistcoat and prepare to develop your theme if legible a little more fully Possibly it does not seem so brilliant in the cold light of morning as it did after that fourth glass of Bollinger If this be so you can then make another note say for a short article on Disillusionment One way or another a notebook and a pencil will keep you well supplied with material If I do not follow Butler s advice myself it is not because I get no brilliant inspirations away from my inkpot nor because having had the inspirations I am capable of retaining them until I get back to my inkpot again but simply because I should never have the notebook and the pencil in the right pockets But though I do not imitate him I can admire his wisdom even while making fun of it Yet I am sure it was unwise of him to take the public into his confidence The public prefers to think that an author does not require these earthly aids to composition It will never quite reconcile itself to the fact that an author is following a profession a profession by means of which he pays the rent and settles the weekly bills No doubt the public wants its favourite writers to go on living but not in the sordid way that its barrister and banker friends live It would prefer to feel that manna dropped on them from Heaven and that the ravens erected them a residence but having regretfully to reject this theory it likes to keep up the pretence that the thousand pounds that an author received for his last story came as something of a surprise to him being in fact really more of a coincidence than a reward The truth is that a layman will never take an author quite seriously He regards authorship not as a profession but as something between au inspiration and a hobby In as far as it is an inspiration it is a gift from Heaven and ought therefore to be shared with the rest of the world in as far as it is a hobby it is something which should be done not too expertly but in a casual amateur haphazard fashion For this reason a layman will never hesitate to ask of an author a free contribution for some local publication on such slender grounds as that he and the author were educated at the same school or had both met Robinson But the same man would be horrified at the idea of asking a Harley Street surgeon perhaps even more closely connected with him to remove his adenoids for nothing To ask for this he would feel would be almost as bad as to ask a gift of ten guineas or whatever the fee is whereas to ask a writer for an article is like asking a friend to decant your port for you a delicate compliment to his particular talent But in truth the matter is otherwise and it is the author who has the better right to resent such a request For the supply of available adenoids is limited and if the surgeon hesitates to occupy himself in removing one pair for nothing it does not follow that in the time thus saved he can be certain of getting employment upon a ten guinea pair But when a Harley Street author has written an article there are a dozen papers which will give him his own price for it and if he sends it to his importunate schoolfellow for nothing he is literally giving up not only ten or twenty or a hundred guineas but a publicity for his work which he may prize even more highly Moreover he has lost what can never be replaced an idea whereas the surgeon would have lost nothing Since then the author is not to be regarded as a professional he must by no means adopt the professional notebook He is to write by inspiration which comes as regularly to him it is to be presumed as indigestion to a lesser favoured mortal He must know things by intuition not by experience or as the result of reading This at least is what one gathers from hearing some people talk about our novelists The hero of Smith s new book goes to the Royal College of Science and the public says scornfully Of course he WOULD Because Smith went to the Royal College himself all his heroes have to go there This isn t art this is photography In his next novel Smith sends his hero to Cambridge and the public says indignantly What the deuce does SMITH know about Cambridge Trying to pretend he is a Varsity man when everybody knows that he went to the Royal College of Science I suppose he s been mugging it up in a book Perhaps Brown s young couple honeymoons in Switzerland So did Brown sneer his acquaintances Or they go to Central Africa How ridiculous say his friends this time Why he actually writes as though he d been there I suppose he s just spent a week end with Sir Harry Johnston Meredith has been blamed lately for being so secretive about his personal affairs but he knew what he was doing Happy is the writer who has no personal affairs at any rate he will avoid this sort of criticism Indeed Isaiah was the ideal author He intruded no private affairs upon the public He took no money for his prophecies and yet managed to live on it He responded readily I imagine to any request for something prophetic you know from acquaintances or even strangers Above all he kept to one style and did not worry the public when once it had got used to him by tentative gropings after a new method And Isaiah
