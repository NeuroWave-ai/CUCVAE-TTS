will explain the plan of the series of which this is the third volume There is no kind of reading more attractive than biography and if properly treated there is none more instructive It appears therefore to be peculiarly fitted to the purposes of education it readily excites the curiosity and awakens the interest of the pupil and while it stores his mind with facts dates and events displays to his view the workings of the human heart and makes him better acquainted with himself and mankind In the selection of subjects for a biographical series of works for youth the editor has been led by two considerations to prefer those which belong to our own country In the first place it is more particularly necessary that our youth should be made acquainted with the lives of those men who were associated with the history of their native land and in the second place no country can afford happier subjects for biography than this There are few such lives as those of Columbus Washington and Franklin in the annals of any nation In the preparation of the work the author has sought to adapt it to youth by the use of a simple style and by the introduction of many illustrative tales sketches anecdotes and adventures Questions for examining the pupils are printed in the pages which may be used or not at the choice of the Teacher The Life of Columbus and the Life of Washington on a plan similar to this have been already published and other volumes containing the lives of celebrated Indian Chiefs celebrated American Statesmen c will appear hereafter if those already in progress should meet with success CONTENTS Page CHAPTER I Birth of Franklin Early Education Anecdote Choice of a Trade He is placed with a Cutler His Fondness for Reading Bound Apprentice to his Brother Makes a

8199-284020-0000	train-other-500	and at eight years of age was put to a grammar school His readiness in learning and his attention to study confirmed the first intention of his parents
8199-284020-0001	train-other-500	The plan also met with the approbation of his uncle Benjamin who promised to give him some volumes of sermons that he had taken down in short hand
none	none	 from the lips of the most eminent preachers of the day three He continued at the grammar school however only about a year 
8199-284020-0002	train-other-500	though he had risen to the head of his class and promised to be a very fine scholar
none	none	 His father was burthened with a numerous family 
8199-284020-0003	train-other-500	and could not carry him through a course of college education He accordingly changed his first purpose and sent Benjamin to a school for writing and arithmetic kept by mister George
none	none	 Brownwell four This master was quite skilful in his profession 
8199-284020-0004	train-other-500	being mild and kind to his scholars but very successful in teaching them Benjamin learned to write a good hand in a short time but he could not manage arithmetic so easily
8199-284020-0005	train-other-500	At ten years of age he was taken from school to help his father in the business of a tallow chandler and was employed in cutting the wick for the candles going errands
none	none	 and tending the shop five Benjamin disliked the trade 
8199-284020-0006	train-other-500	and had a strong inclination to go to sea but his father opposed his wishes in this respect and determined to keep him at home The house in which he lived happened to be near the water
8199-284020-0007	train-other-500	and Benjamin was always playing with boats and swimming When sailing with other boys he was usually the leader
none	none	 and he confesses that he sometimes led them into difficulties six There was a salt marsh 
8199-284020-0008	train-other-500	which bounded part of the mill pond on the edge of which the boys used to stand to fish for minnows They had trampled it so much however as to make it a mere quagmire Franklin proposed to his friends to build a wharf there
8199-284020-0009	train-other-500	for them to stand upon and showed them a large heap of stones which were intended for a new house near the marsh
none	none	 and would answer their purpose exactly seven Accordingly that evening when the workmen were gone home he assembled a number of his playfellows 
8199-284020-0010	train-other-500	and they worked diligently like so many emmets sometimes two or three to a stone till they had brought them all to make their little wharf On the next morning the workmen were surprised on missing the stones
8199-284020-0011	train-other-500	The authors of the removal were detected complained of and punished by their parents Franklin attempted to show the usefulness of their work but his father took that occasion to convince him
none	none	 that that which was not truly honest could not be truly useful eight Benjamin continued employed in the business of his father about two years that is till he was twelve years old 
8199-284020-0012	train-other-500	His brother John who had also been brought up to the trade had left his father married and set up for himself in Rhode Island
8199-284020-0013	train-other-500	There was now every appearance that Benjamin was destined to become a tallow chandler As his dislike to the trade continued his father was afraid that if he did not put Benjamin to one that was more agreeable
8199-284020-0014	train-other-500	he would run away and go to sea as an elder brother of his had done In consequence of this apprehension he used to take him to walk to see joiners bricklayers turners
none	none	 and braziers at their work that he might observe his inclination and fix it on some trade or profession that would keep him on land nine His father at length 
8199-284020-0015	train-other-500	determined on the cutler s trade and placed him for some days on trial with his cousin Samuel who was bred to that trade in London and had just established himself in Boston
8199-284020-0016	train-other-500	It was then usual to ask a sum of money for receiving an apprentice and the cutler charged so much for taking Benjamin that his father was displeased
none	none	 and put him to his old business again ten From his infancy 
8199-284020-0017	train-other-500	Benjamin had been passionately fond of reading and all the money that he could get was laid out in purchasing books He was very fond of voyages and travels
none	none	 The dangers and adventures of sailors in the different parts of the world 
8199-284020-0018	train-other-500	and stories of the strange people and customs they met with
none	none	 he would always read with delight eleven The first books that he was able to buy 
8199-284020-0019	train-other-500	were the works of a famous old English writer named John Bunyan These he afterwards sold in order to purchase some volumes of Historical Collections
8199-284020-0020	train-other-500	His father s library consisted principally of works on divinity
none	none	 most of which he read at an early age 
8199-284020-0021	train-other-500	Beside these there was a book by De Foe the author of Robinson Crusoe and another called An Essay to do Good by doctor Mather
none	none	 an old New England divine twelve This fondness for books at length determined his father to bring him up as a printer 
8199-284020-0022	train-other-500	though he had already one son in that employment In seventeen seventeen this son returned from England with a press and letters to set up his business in Boston
8199-284020-0023	train-other-500	Benjamin liked this trade much better than that of his father but still had a desire to go to sea To prevent this step
none	none	 his father was impatient to have him bound apprentice to his brother and at length persuaded him to consent to it thirteen He was to serve as apprentice till he was twenty one years of age and during the last year was to be allowed the wages of a journeyman In a little time he made great progress in the business and became quite useful He was now able to obtain better books An acquaintance with the apprentices of the booksellers sometimes enabled him to borrow a small one which he was careful to return clean and in good season He often sat up in his chamber the greater part of the night to read a book that he was obliged to return in the morning Illustration Franklin reading at night fourteen After some time an ingenious and sensible merchant mister Matthew Adams who had a pretty collection of books took notice of Franklin at the printing office and invited him to see his library He very kindly offered to lend him any work that he might like to read fifteen He now took a strong inclination for poetry and wrote some little pieces His brother supposed that he might use this talent to advantage and encouraged him to cultivate it About this time he produced two ballads One was called the Light House Tragedy and contained an account of the shipwreck of Captain Worthilake with his two daughters the other was a sailor s song on the taking of the famous Blackbeard the pirate sixteen They were written in the doggerel street ballad style and when they were printed his brother sent Benjamin about the town to sell them The first sold very rapidly 
8199-284020-0024	train-other-500	as the event on which it was founded had recently occurred and made a great deal of noise This success flattered his vanity very much but his father discouraged him by criticising his ballads and telling him
none	none	 that verse makers were generally beggars seventeen This prevented him from giving any further attention to poetry 
8199-284020-0025	train-other-500	and led him to devote more time and care to prose compositions He was at this time intimately acquainted with another lad very fond of books named John Collins
8199-284020-0026	train-other-500	They sometimes discussed different questions together and had become very apt
none	none	 to indulge in arguments and disputes eighteen A question was once started between them on the propriety of educating the female sex in learned studies 
8199-284020-0027	train-other-500	and their abilities for these studies As they parted without settling the point and were not to see one another again for a long time Franklin sat down to put his arguments in writing
none	none	 He then made a fair copy of them and sent it to Collins nineteen Three or four letters passed between them on the subject 
8199-284020-0028	train-other-500	when the father of Franklin happened to find the papers and read them Without entering into the subject in dispute he took occasion to talk to him about his manner of writing
8199-284020-0029	train-other-500	He marked the defects in his expressions and in the arrangement of his sentences but gave him the credit of spelling and pointing with great correctness
none	none	 This he had learned in the printing office but he had never before been taught any thing about manner and style twenty About this time he met with an odd volume of the Spectator a very famous work published by several English wits in the year seventeen eleven 
8199-284020-0030	train-other-500	He bought it read it over and over and was much delighted with it This book was now his continual study and he himself tried to write as much as possible in its very pleasant
8199-284020-0031	train-other-500	and popular style The improvement which he made was encouraging
none	none	 and led him to hope he might some day 
8199-284020-0032	train-other-500	become a good English writer
none	none	 a distinction of which he was very ambitious one Where was Franklin born When two For what profession did his parents intend to educate him three What induced his father to change his intention four To what trade was Benjamin put and when six Relate the anecdote about Franklin and his companions seven What maxim did his father teach him in consequence of this adventure eight What were his father s fears in relation to his new occupation nine On what trade did his father finally determine ten Describe his early fondness for reading and the books of which he was most fond eleven What books did he first buy twelve What induced his father to bring up Benjamin as a printer To whom was he bound apprentice thirteen How did he succeed in his new trade fourteen What advantages did it afford him for pursuing his studies fifteen Relate the account of his first attempts in poetry sixteen How did his ballads succeed seventeen How did his father discourage his new taste eighteen What was the subject of his discussion with his friend Collins nineteen What praise and advice did his father give him on this occasion twenty With what book was Franklin at this time so much pleased Did he attempt to imitate it CHAPTER II Franklin gives up eating Meat His Economy of Time Studies Arithmetic James Franklin establishes a Newspaper Benjamin writes for it His Brother is imprisoned Benjamin manages the Paper Leaves his Brother Goes to New York Sails thence for Philadelphia Anecdote of the Dutchman one When about sixteen years of age Franklin happened to meet with a book that recommended a vegetable diet He determined to adopt it His brother being unmarried did not keep house but boarded himself and his apprentices in another family By refusing to eat meat Franklin occasioned a good deal of inconvenience and he was frequently chid for his singularity He accordingly learned the manner of boiling potatoes and rice and of making hasty pudding and then proposed to his brother if he would give him weekly half the money he paid for his board to board himself His brother instantly agreed to it and Franklin soon found that he could save half of what he received two This was a new fund for buying books But this was not the only advantage When his brother and the apprentices had gone to their meals he was left in the printing office alone He immediately despatched his slight repast which was often no more than a biscuit or a slice of bread and a handful of raisins or a tart from the pastry cook s and a glass of water and had the rest of the time till their return for study By being thus economical of his time he was able to make considerable progress in his books three He now began to feel the want of a knowledge of figures and was once very much mortified by his ignorance of them As he had entirely failed of learning them at school he took Cocker s Arithmetic and went through the whole of it by himself with the greatest ease The mortification he had met with induced him to make great exertions and we can succeed in any thing to which we give our earnest attention four While he was intent on improving his language and style Franklin met with an English grammar at the end of which were two little sketches on the arts of rhetoric and logic The latter of these finished with a dispute in the manner of Socrates a very famous philosopher of Greece Franklin was charmed with this modest and artful manner and cured himself of the tricks of contradiction and too much positiveness These habits are very disagreeable and no one should allow himself to fall into them five In fact if you wish to instruct others says Franklin a positive and dogmatical manner in advancing your sentiments may occasion opposition and prevent a candid attention If you desire improvement from others you should not at the same time express yourself fixed in your present opinions Modest and sensible men who do not love disputation will leave you undisturbed in the possession of your errors In adopting such a manner you can seldom expect to please your hearers or obtain the concurrence you desire six In the year seventeen twenty or twenty one James Franklin began to print a newspaper It was the second that appeared in America and was called the New England Courant The only one before it was the Boston News Letter Some of his friends endeavored to dissuade him from the undertaking They thought it would not succeed as in their opinion one newspaper was sufficient for all America There are now in the United States alone over eight hundred newspapers seven The undertaking however went on Benjamin assisted in setting the types helped to print off the sheets and was then employed in carrying the papers to the subscribers Several men of information and talents wrote little pieces for the paper which were amusing and gained considerable credit These gentlemen often visited the printing office eight Hearing their conversations and their accounts of the praise their pieces received from the public Benjamin was excited to try his fortune among them He was afraid however as he was still a boy his brother would object to print any thing of his composition in the paper It was necessary therefore to disguise his hand writing and to send his piece to the office in such a way that it should not be known from whom it came nine When his friends came in James showed them the communication from an unknown writer They read it praised it and made several guesses as to the author In these guesses none were named but men of some character for talents and learning They never once suspected it was written by the little printer s boy who stood at their elbows chuckling in silence over the secret ten Encouraged by the success of this attempt he continued to write and send other pieces in the same way to the press He kept his secret as long as he saw fit and then confessed himself the author of the writings they had been so long guessing about Benjamin now began to be more noticed by his brother s acquaintance which made him a little vain and led to some serious difficulties eleven His brother notwithstanding the relationship between them considered himself as master and Benjamin as his apprentice and accordingly expected the same services from him that he would from another In some of these services the young printer felt himself degraded and thought that he should receive greater indulgence His brother was passionate and frequently beat him and finding the apprenticeship exceedingly tedious Benjamin was looking forward for an opportunity to shorten it This at length happened in a very unexpected manner twelve One of the pieces in the paper on some political subject gave offence to the Assembly one of the most important branches of the government of Massachusetts James Franklin was taken up censured and imprisoned for a month because he would not discover the author Benjamin was also called up and examined before the council but considering him as an apprentice who was bound to keep his master s secret they dismissed him without punishment thirteen During his brother s confinement Benjamin had the management of the paper and indulged in very smart remarks upon the government This pleased his brother though it made others look upon him in an unfavorable light as a youth who had a turn for satire and libeling The discharge of the imprisoned printer was accompanied with an order that James Franklin should no longer print the newspaper called the New England Courant fourteen On a consultation held at the printing office it was proposed to change the name of the paper and in this manner elude the order of the council As there were many difficulties in the way of this project it was determined to let the paper for the future be printed in the name of BENJAMIN FRANKLIN fifteen When apprentices are bound out it is usual to have certain agreements drawn up between them and their masters sealed and signed according to certain forms required by law These papers are called indentures James was afraid that the censure of the Assembly would fall on him as still printing the paper by his apprentice and contrived that his old indenture should be returned to Benjamin with a discharge on the back of it sixteen This was to be shown only in case of necessity and in order to secure his services for the remainder of the time it was agreed that Benjamin should sign new indentures These were to be kept private This was a very flimsy scheme but the paper continued to be printed in this manner for several months At length fresh difficulties arose and Benjamin determined to take advantage of his discharge thinking that his brother would be afraid to produce the new indentures It was unfair to take this advantage but he was urged to it by very unkind and even cruel treatment seventeen When his brother found out his intentions he went round to every master printer in town to prevent his getting employment In consequence of this he concluded to remove to New York that being the nearest place where there was another printer His father opposed his removal and took side with his brother in the dispute Benjamin sold his books to furnish the means of paying his passage went privately on board of a sloop had a fair wind and in three days found himself in New York three hundred miles from home at the age of seventeen There was no one in the place whom he knew he was without any recommendations and had very little money in his pocket eighteen By this time he had entirely lost all his love for the sea or he might have been induced to gratify it Having another profession and considering himself a good workman he offered his services to a printer of the place old mister W Bradford This man had been the first printer in Pennsylvania and had removed from there in consequence of a quarrel with the governor General Keith nineteen He had a sufficient number of workmen and little to do and could give Franklin no employment But he said My son at Philadelphia has lately lost his principal hand Aquila Rose by death and if you go thither I believe he may employ you twenty Philadelphia was one hundred miles farther but Franklin concluded to go there In crossing the bay a squall struck the little vessel he was in and tore her rotten sails to pieces She was driven upon Long Island twenty one On the way a drunken Dutchman who was a passenger in the boat tumbled overboard As he was sinking Franklin reached out and caught him by a very bushy head of hair and drew him up again This sobered him a little and he went to sleep having first taken a book out of his pocket which he desired Franklin to dry for him It proved to be a Dutch copy of his old favorite book Bunyan s Pilgrim s Progress and he carefully complied with the wish of the sleepy owner one What induced Franklin to adopt a vegetable diet What arrangement did he make with his brother on this account two What advantage resulted from this Describe Benjamin s economy of time three How did he learn arithmetic four With what treatise was Franklin so much pleased Of what disagreeable habits did it cure him five What advice does he give on the manner of conversation six Who printed the second newspaper in New England What was it called seven How was Benjamin connected with it eight What first induced him to write for it Describe his first attempt nine How was his communication received ten What was the consequence of his success eleven What were the difficulties between the brothers twelve What happened at this time to James Franklin thirteen How did Benjamin conduct the paper What was the order of the council fourteen How was it evaded fifteen What is the custom in binding out apprentices How was Benjamin discharged from his indentures sixteen What unfair advantage did he take of this discharge seventeen What course did his brother pursue on this occasion His father Benjamin eighteen To whom did he apply for employment nineteen With what success twenty Where did he determine to go twenty one What is the anecdote of the Dutchman CHAPTER III His Journey His Dinner with the old Gingerbread Woman Arrives in Philadelphia Anecdote of the Rolls Attends the Meeting House of the Quakers Suspected of being a Runaway Employed by Keimer Noticed by Governor Keith Visit to Boston Return one On approaching the island the crew found themselves in a place where there could be no landing as it was a stony beach and a violent surf was rolling They cast anchor and remained in that situation through the night As the spray dashed over the boat they were all in a very short time as wet as the unfortunate Dutchman The wind went down on the next morning and they were able to reach Amboy before night having been thirty hours on the water without victuals or any drink but a bottle of dirty rum two In the evening Franklin found himself feverish and went to bed As he drank plentifully of cold water his fever left him and in the morning he proceeded on his journey After crossing the ferry he travelled on foot notwithstanding a violent rain till noon Being now thoroughly soaked and tired he stopped at a poor inn where he spent the remainder of the day and all night three He now began to wish that he had never left home His prospect of procuring employment even when he should arrive at Philadelphia was uncertain He thought of the distress his sudden disappearance must have occasioned to his parents Besides all this he made such a sorry figure that he was suspected of being a runaway servant and in danger of being taken up on that suspicion four On the next day however he continued his journey and arrived that night at an inn within eight or ten miles of Burlington The next morning he reached Burlington where he expected to find boats to sail immediately for Philadelphia It was Saturday and he had the mortification to find that the regular boats had just gone and that no others were expected to sail before Tuesday five Franklin returned to the shop of an old woman of whom he had bought some gingerbread to eat on his passage and asked her where he had better go to find lodgings She proposed to lodge him in her own house till a passage by some other boat offered itself He accepted the invitation and dined with the old woman that day on ox cheek All that she would take in return was a pot of ale six Franklin had supposed himself fixed till the next Tuesday but as he was walking in the evening by the side of the river a boat passed by with several people going to Philadelphia They took him in and proceeded on their voyage The weather was very calm without a breath of wind stirring They were obliged to row all the way Reaching Philadelphia about eight or nine o clock on Sunday morning they landed at Market street wharf seven Our young traveller had sent his best clothes by another conveyance from New York and he was in his old working dress His pockets were stuffed out with shirts and stockings and he knew not where to look for lodgings He was tired with walking rowing and want of sleep and was besides very hungry His whole stock of cash was a single silver dollar and about a shilling in copper coin The copper he gave to the boatmen for his passage eight As he walked along the street gazing at the new things he saw and wondering what would be the end of his trouble he met a boy with some bread Inquiring where he had bought it Franklin went immediately to the place where he was directed and asked for three pence worth of bread He received three large puffy rolls and having no room in his pockets walked off with a roll under each arm and eating the third Illustration Franklin walking in the streets of Philadelphia nine In this manner he walked up Market street as far as Fourth street passing by the house of mister Read whose daughter he afterwards married This young lady was standing at the door as he went by and probably thought he made rather an awkward appearance After walking about the streets some time eating his roll he found himself again in the neighborhood of the wharf where he had landed He went on board of the boat and gave his two remaining rolls to a woman and child that had been his fellow passengers down the river ten He again walked up the street which was by that time filled with a large number of neat well dressed people who were all walking the same way He joined them and was led into the great meeting house of the Quakers near the market Sitting down among them he looked round awhile and as nothing was said fell fast asleep from drowsiness His nap continued till the meeting broke up when some one was kind enough to awake him eleven He then walked down towards the river and meeting a young Quaker whose countenance pleased him he asked where a stranger could get lodgings They were then near a house with the sign of the Three Mariners Here said the Quaker is a house where they receive strangers but it is not a reputable one if thou wilt walk with me I ll show thee a better He conducted Franklin to the Crooked Billet in Water street twelve There he dined and during the dinner several questions were put to him by persons who supposed him to be a runaway On the next morning he dressed himself as neatly as he could and went to see Andrew Bradford the printer Here he found the old gentleman whom he had met in New York and who travelling on horseback had got to Philadelphia before him thirteen mister Bradford received him very kindly but as he was not at that time in want of a hand could only recommend him to a printer who had lately set up in town by the name of Keimer This man had then nothing for him to do but promised him employment soon Meanwhile he was invited to lodge with mister Bradford and to assist when there was any extra work in the printing office fourteen Franklin soon found that neither of the printers knew any thing about their business Keimer was before long able to give him constant employment He did not like however that any one should live with his rival Bradford while he worked for him Lodgings were therefore procured for Franklin with mister Read whose house he had passed on his first arrival while eating his roll fifteen He had now made some acquaintances about town and passed his time very pleasantly By industry and frugality he gained money and gave up all thoughts of returning to Boston The governor of the province Sir William Keith had accidentally become acquainted with him and was desirous that he should set up in business for himself in Philadelphia He promised to procure for him the public printing of the government and to assist him as much as possible by his influence and patronage sixteen It was concluded that Franklin should return to Boston with a letter from the governor to prevail upon his father to assist him in the establishment Towards the end of April in seventeen twenty four he left Philadelphia for this purpose seventeen He sailed in a little vessel that was bound for Boston and in about a fortnight was safe in his father s house His sudden appearance surprised the family very much but they were all delighted to see him and treated him with great kindness eighteen Soon after his arrival he paid a visit to his brother at the printing office He had on a new suit of clothes wore a watch and had about five pounds in silver in his pockets Feeling rather elated by the success he had met with he made quite a display of all his good fortune before his brother s apprentices and journeymen and ended by giving them a dollar to drink his health with This visit offended his brother very much for he thought it was intended to mortify him nineteen The letter of the governor was without any effect His father was very glad that Benjamin had been able to gain the confidence of so eminent a man but would not consent to his request He wrote a civil letter thanking Sir William for his promise of patronage but saying that his son was altogether too young to be intrusted with the management of so important and expensive an undertaking twenty Franklin gave so pleasant an account of Philadelphia that his old friend Collins determined to go on and try his fortune there Seeing no prospect of restoring harmony between the two brothers his father consented that Benjamin should return to Philadelphia He advised him to steady industry and frugality and promised to assist in setting him up in business when he should reach the age of twenty one With the approbation and blessing of his parents to follow him he embarked for New York on the way to his future home one What was the situation of the crew on the water two How did

What were his advice and promise to Benjamin CHAPTER IV Finds his Friend Collins in New York Visit to the Governor Promises from Governor Keith Project of a new religious Sect Anecdote of Keimer and the roast Pig His principal Acquaintance A literary Trick Prepares to go to London The Governor s Deception Arrival in London one At New York Franklin found his friend Collins who had arrived there some time before him They had been intimate from childhood and he had been sober and industrious But during Franklin s absence in Philadelphia Collins had fallen into bad habits and become a drunkard He gamed and lost his money and borrowed of his friend to pay his expenses on the road two The governor of New York hearing from the captain that one of his passengers had a great many books on board requested that he might be brought to see him Franklin accordingly waited upon him He was received with great civility The governor showed him his library which was a considerable one and they had a good deal of conversation about books and authors This attention was very pleasing to Franklin three When they arrived at Philadelphia Collins continued to drink and was consequently unable to procure any business He continued to borrow money of Franklin and finally quarrelled with him and went to the West Indies Franklin never heard of him afterwards four Sir William Keith received the young printer on his return with a great show of kindness and large promises Since your father will not set you up he said to him I will do it myself Give me a list of the things necessary to be had from England and I will send for them You shall repay me when you are able I am resolved to have a good printer here and I am sure you must succeed This was spoken with an air of perfect sincerity and Franklin had not the least doubt but that he meant what he said five He accordingly made a list of all the articles that would be wanted for a printing house the cost of which was about one hundred pounds The governor liked it and asked whether it would not be well for him to go to England himself in order to select the types and see that every thing was of the best kind When there he added you may make acquaintance and establish correspondence in the bookselling and stationery way six Franklin thought that it might be advantageous Then said he get yourself ready to go in the Annis which was the annual ship and at that time the only one passing between London and Philadelphia But as it would be some months before the Annis sailed Franklin continued to work with Keimer seven They agreed together very well and lived on quite a familiar footing Franklin used sometimes to argue with his master and would most frequently beat him This gave him so great an idea of Franklin s ability in disputation that he proposed to him to become his assistant in a new religious sect which he proposed to establish One was to preach the doctrines and the other to confound all opponents eight When they came to explain with each other upon their doctrines Keimer was desirous of introducing certain customs which did not entirely meet the wishes of his colleague Among other things he wore his beard at full length because somewhere in the Mosaic law it is said Thou shalt not mar the corners of thy beard He likewise kept the seventh day sabbath instead of the first and both of these points he considered essential nine Franklin disliked both but agreed to them on condition of his adopting the doctrine not to use animal food Keimer was a great eater and was not much pleased with the idea of being starved but he consented to try the practice a few weeks and see how it agreed with his constitution ten They held to this plan for three months Their provisions were purchased cooked and brought to them regularly by a woman in the neighborhood who prepared at different times forty dishes in which there were neither fish flesh nor fowl Franklin went on well enough but poor Keimer suffered grievously grew tired of the project and ordered a roast pig He invited some friends to dine with him upon the occasion but the pig being brought too soon upon the table he could not resist the temptation but ate the whole before his company came eleven During this time Franklin had contracted an affection for Miss Read and believed that she was not altogether indifferent in her feelings towards him As he was about to take a long voyage however and as they were both very young her mother thought it most prudent to defer the matter till his return from England twelve His chief acquaintance at this period were Charles Osborne Joseph Watson and James Ralph all lovers of reading In one of their meetings it was proposed that at a certain time each of them should produce a piece of his own composition in order to improve by mutual observations and corrections They agreed that this task should be to turn the eighteenth psalm into verse thirteen When the time of the meeting drew nigh Ralph called upon Franklin and told him that his piece was ready Now said he Osborne never will allow the least merit in any thing of mine but makes a thousand criticisms out of mere envy I wish therefore you would take this piece and produce it as yours we shall then hear what he will say to it fourteen It was agreed At the meeting Watson s performance was read first there were some beauties in it and many defects Osborne s piece was then read and was much better Ralph had nothing to produce It was now Franklin s turn He was backward wished to be excused but no excuse would be received The piece he brought with him was read and repeated Osborne was delighted with it and praised it in the highest terms fifteen As he was returning home with Ralph he expressed himself still more strongly Who would have imagined said he that Franklin was capable of such a performance such painting such force such fire He has even improved on the original In common conversation he seems to have no choice of words he hesitates and blunders and yet how he writes When they next met the trick was discovered and Osborne was laughed at for praising Ralph by mistake sixteen The governor sent for Franklin frequently to his house and always spoke of setting him up in business as a settled thing He was to be furnished with letters to the governor s friends in England and with an order for the money to purchase a press types and paper For these letters he was to call at a certain time when they would be ready They were delayed however again and again till the ship was on the point of sailing seventeen When Franklin went to take leave and receive the letters the secretary came out and said that the governor was very busy on business of importance but that he would send the letters on board wishing him a good voyage and a speedy return eighteen Understanding that despatches had been brought on board from the governor Franklin asked the captain for the letters that were to be under his care The captain told him that they had all been put into the bag together and he could not then come at them but that before they landed in England he should have an opportunity of picking them out This satisfied him for the present and he thought nothing more of it during the voyage nineteen When they arrived in the Channel the captain kept his word and permitted him to examine the bag for the governor s letters He found some upon which his name was put and picked out six or seven which he thought might be the promised letters One of these was addressed to Basket the king s printer and another to some stationer twenty They reached London on the twenty fourth of December seventeen twenty four Franklin waited upon the stationer who came first in his way and delivered the letter as from Governor Keith I don t know such a person said he but opening the letter O this is from Riddlesden I have lately found him to be a complete rascal and I will have nothing to do with him nor receive any letters from him Returning the letter he turned upon his heel and went to wait upon some customer twenty one It turned out that the governor had sent no letters by Franklin but had completely deceived him With no intention of giving him any assistance he had blinded him with brilliant promises and false hopes But Franklin was able to assist himself He determined to procure employment among the printers in London and acquire a thorough knowledge of his profession before he returned to America one What happened to his friend Collins two What attention did Franklin receive from the governor of New York four What was Sir William Keith s conduct five What was the proposed visit to England seven What started the scheme of a new sect eight Why did it fail ten Relate the anecdote of Keimer and the roast pig twelve Who were his chief acquaintance at this period What was the task proposed among them fourteen What was the trick played upon Osborne seventeen What was the conduct of the governor eighteen Did Franklin receive the letters promised by the governor twenty What was the fate of Franklin s first letter of introduction twenty one What course did Franklin determine to pursue Illustration Franklin delivering his letter to the Stationer in London CHAPTER V Troubled by his Friend Ralph Obtains Employment Ralph turns Schoolmaster and begins an Epic Poem Franklin teaches some of his Friends to swim Anecdote of mister Denham Return to Philadelphia Story of George Webb Franklin quarrels with Keimer Returns to work for him Employed at Burlington Leaves Keimer one His friend Ralph had accompanied Franklin to London and they were now inseparable companions They took lodgings together at three shillings and sixpence a week Ralph appears to have been a conceited and helpless character and made several attempts to get in the way of procuring a livelihood But all his plans were unsuccessful two Franklin immediately procured employment at an extensive printing house where he remained nearly a year He was diligent in work but his shiftless companion consumed a good share of his earnings His engagements with Miss Read he was thoughtless and heartless enough to forget and never wrote to her but once during his absence This conduct he afterwards considered among the greatest faults of his life three Ralph finally determined to leave London and take a school in the country As he was very vain and confident of rising to literary eminence he was rather ashamed of what he was silly enough to consider a mean occupation He accordingly changed his name and took that of his companion desiring him to address his letters to mister Franklin school master four Ralph continued to write and from time to time troubled his friend with long extracts from an epic poem which he was then composing requesting his remarks and corrections Franklin endeavored to discourage him from this undertaking but in vain Sheet after sheet continued to come by every post Some difficulties at length broke out between the two friends and Franklin was fortunately relieved of a burdensome dependent five He now began to think of laying up a little money and in expectation of better employment entered a still larger printing house near Lincoln s Inn Fields His new employer was named Watts At this place he became acquainted with a man by the name of Wygate who had been well educated read French and Latin and loved reading six This man and a friend of his were desirous of learning to swim Franklin had been an expert swimmer from his childhood and was very fond of displaying his feats of activity in the water He taught them to swim after twice going into the river and they soon became quite skilful Wygate soon became attached to Franklin and at length proposed that they should travel all over Europe together supporting themselves on the way by working at their trade Franklin was inclined to this plan but was dissuaded from it by his friend mister Denham who advised him to think of returning to Philadelphia seven mister Denham was an excellent man and very kindly disposed towards Franklin He had formerly been in business in Bristol a city of England but failing and making a settlement with his creditors he went to America He had obtained a discharge from all his debts by giving up all his property By great industry and economy he was able to acquire a large fortune in a few years eight He had returned to England in the same ship with Franklin and immediately visited his old place of business While here he invited all his old creditors to an entertainment He then thanked them for the easy settlement they had favored him with and when they expected nothing but the dinner every man found under his plate an order on the banker for the full amount of the unpaid remainder with interest nine mister Denham was now about to return to Philadelphia and proposed to take Franklin over as his clerk He promised him as soon as he became acquainted with mercantile business to promote him and finally establish him in some profitable situation The plan pleased Franklin for he had become heartily tired of London and was anxious to return home A satisfactory arrangement was made and Franklin took leave of printing as he thought forever ten He had thus spent about eighteen months in London and during this time had increased his knowledge though he had not improved his fortune They sailed from Gravesend near the mouth of the river Thames on the twenty threed of July and arrived in Philadelphia early in October Franklin here found several alterations Keith was no longer governor and his place had been supplied by Major Gordon Miss Read despairing of his return had been persuaded by her friends to marry a man by the name of Rogers a worthless fellow who left her and ran away to the West Indies eleven mister Denham took a store and Franklin attended diligently to the business Affairs were going on prosperously when they were both taken violently ill in the beginning of the year seventeen twenty seven mister Denham died after a long sickness and Franklin was again thrown upon the world He tried for some time to obtain a situation as a merchant s clerk but failing in this attempt he again made an engagement with his old master Keimer twelve Keimer was anxious to obtain Franklin s services as most of his hands were ignorant and needed his instruction Among these workmen was George Webb who had been an Oxford scholar and whose story was an uncommon instance of opportunities neglected and thrown away thirteen He was about eighteen years of age His birthplace was Gloucester in England where he was educated at a grammar school and had been distinguished when they exhibited plays From here he was sent to Oxford where he continued about a year but not contentedly wishing of all things to see London and become a player fourteen At length receiving his quarterly allowance of fifteen guineas instead of discharging his debts he went out of town hid his gown in a bush and walked to London When here having no friend to advise him he fell into bad company soon spent his guineas found no means of being introduced among the players grew poor pawned his clothes and wanted bread fifteen Walking about the streets very hungry and not knowing what to do a bill was put into his hands offering immediate entertainment and encouragement to such as would bind themselves to serve in America He went directly to sign the indentures was put into the ship and sailed without writing a line to his friends to tell them what had become of him As a companion he was lively witty and good natured but idle thoughtless and imprudent to the last degree sixteen After continuing a while with Keimer Franklin found that his services became every day of less importance At length a trifle snapped their connection A great noise happening near the printing office Franklin put his head out of the window to see what was the matter Keimer being in the street looked up and called out to him in a loud and angry tone to mind his business A number of neighbors who were standing by saw the insolent manner in which he was treated and it vexed him exceedingly An open quarrel ensued and Franklin left the printing house seventeen Keimer was very desirous of persuading him to return and as it was for the interest of both that harmony should be restored the quarrel was soon forgotten A job was now obtained in New Jersey to print some paper money Franklin contrived a copperplate press for the purpose the first that had been seen in the country he also cut several ornaments and checks for the bills eighteen To execute this job Franklin and his employer went to Burlington They performed it to the satisfaction of the government and received a large compensation During his short residence here Franklin made many acquaintance and friends One of them was Isaac Decon the surveyor general a shrewd sagacious old man who began when young by wheeling clay for the brick makers He learned to write after he was twenty one years of age afterwards learned surveying and had now acquired by his industry a considerable property nineteen What had chiefly induced Franklin to return to Keimer after his quarrel was the persuasion of a fellow workman by the name of Meredith The father of this young man had promised to advance money to establish him in business in the ensuing spring and he was desirous to set Franklin s skill against his own capital and form a copartnership The proposal was a fair one and acceptable upon both sides twenty A short time after their return from Burlington the types that Meredith had ordered arrived from London They settled with Keimer and left him by his consent before he knew any thing about their project two Where did Franklin procure employment three What was the course of his friend Ralph five What new friend did Franklin make six What proposition did he make to Franklin Why was not the plan carried into execution seven Who was mister Denham eight Describe his honorable conduct towards his old creditors nine What proposal did he make to Franklin ten How long was Franklin in London What changes had taken place during his absence eleven How was Franklin again thrown upon the world What employment did he obtain twelve Who was George Webb thirteen fourteen fifteen What was his story sixteen How did Franklin quarrel with Keimer seventeen Who contrived the first copperplate press ever seen in this country eighteen For what purpose did Franklin visit Burlington nineteen What induced Franklin to return to Keimer after the separation What was the proposal of Meredith twenty When did they leave Keimer CHAPTER VI The Junto A new Paper started by Keimer Franklin purchases it Difficulties in their Business A Dissolution of the Partnership Franklin assisted by his Friends David Harry Match making Marriage with Miss Read one In the autumn of the preceding year Franklin had formed among his acquaintance a small club for mutual improvement which they termed the Junto They met on Friday evenings The rules required that each member in his turn should produce one or more questions on any point of politics morals or natural philosophy to be discussed by the company and once in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing on any subject he pleased two This club answered many good purposes for a great length of time It introduced better habits of conversation and drew attention to the most interesting subjects of general inquiry The members of the club now assisted in bringing business to the young printers Their industry was unwearied and soon began to be noticed by their neighbors This gave them character and credit three George Webb now came to offer them his services as a journeyman They were not then able to give him employment but Franklin let him know as a secret that he soon intended to begin a newspaper and would then probably have work for him He told him his plan and expectations His hopes of success were founded on this that the only newspaper at that time printed there by Bradford was a miserable affair badly managed not entertaining and yet profitable four Franklin requested Webb not to mention the project but he told it to Keimer who immediately issued proposals for publishing one himself This vexed Franklin and as he was at that time unable to commence his paper he wrote several amusing pieces for Bradford under the title of the Busy Body which were continued by one of his friends for several months By this means the attention of the public was fixed on that paper and Keimer s proposals were neglected He began his paper however and carried it on about nine months with only ninety subscribers At this time he offered it at a very low price to Franklin who purchased it and in a few years made it very profitable five The partnership still continued though the whole management of the business was confided to Franklin Meredith knew very little about setting types or working at the press and was seldom sober The connection between them was to be regretted on many accounts but Meredith had established the business and it was now necessary to make the best of it six Their first papers made a better appearance than any that had been before printed in the province The number of subscribers continually increased and the leading men found it convenient to oblige and encourage the printers Bradford still printed the votes and laws and public documents but this business soon fell into the hands of Franklin seven A difficulty now occurred which had been little expected mister Meredith s father who was to have paid for the printing house was able to advance only one hundred pounds and one hundred more were due to the merchant who became impatient and sued them all They gave bail but unless the money could have been raised in season they must have sold their press and types for payment eight In this distress two friends came forward to Franklin and offered to advance the money if he would discontinue the partnership with Meredith Each made the proposition separately and without the knowledge of the other These friends were William Coleman and Robert Grace Franklin told them that he considered himself under obligations to the Merediths and if they should be able to fulfil their part of the agreement he could not think of proposing a separation If they should finally fail in their performance and the partnership should be dissolved he would then think himself at liberty to accept the assistance of his friends nine Meredith finally proposed a dissolution of the partnership Franklin consented and the whole business was left in his hands He then recurred to his friends and took half of what he wanted from one and half from the other The separation was then publicly advertised the old debts were paid off and the business went on in the name of Franklin This was in or about the year seventeen twenty nine ten He now obtained several jobs from the government and was employed in printing the paper money A stationer s shop was soon added to his establishment and he began to pay off gradually the debt he was under for the printing house In order to secure his character and credit as a trades man he was not only industrious and frugal in reality but avoided any appearance to the contrary He dressed plainly and was seen at no places of amusement To show that he was not above his business he himself sometimes brought home on a wheel barrow the paper he purchased at the stores eleven Being thus considered an industrious and thriving young man the merchants who imported stationery were desirous of his custom Others proposed supplying him with books and he went on prosperously In the mean time Keimer s business and credit declined daily and he was at last obliged to sell his printing house to satisfy his creditors He went to Barbadoes and there lived some years in great poverty Illustration Franklin taking home his paper twelve An apprentice of Keimer s David Harry bought his materials and set up in his place in Philadelphia His friends were rich and possessed considerable influence and Franklin was afraid that he would find Harry a powerful rival He therefore proposed a partnership which was fortunately rejected Harry was proud dressed and lived expensively neglected his business and ran in debt Losing credit and finding nothing to do he followed Keimer to Barbadoes taking his printing materials with him Here he employed his old master as a journeyman and was at last obliged to sell his types and return to work in Philadelphia thirteen There now remained no other printer in the place but Bradford He however was rich and easy and was not anxious about doing much business His situation as post master at that time was supposed to give him some advantages in obtaining news and distributing the papers and he was on that account able to procure a great many more advertisements than Franklin This was of great service to Bradford and prevented his rival from gaining upon him so rapidly as he otherwise would have done fourteen Franklin had hitherto boarded with mister Godfrey a glazier who was very much distinguished for his knowledge of mathematics The wife of mister Godfrey was desirous of making a match for the young printer and fixed upon the daughter of a neighbor as a suitable person She contrived in several ways to bring them together and at length Franklin made proposals of marriage fifteen Franklin appears to have been equally prudent and cautious in this affair as in every thing else He gave missus Godfrey to understand and carry to the parents that he expected one hundred pounds with their daughter She brought him word that they had no such sum to spare Franklin sent back in reply that they might mortgage their house sixteen The answer to this after a few days was that they did not approve the match that on inquiry of mister Bradford they had been informed the printing business was not a profitable one that Keimer and Harry had failed and that he would probably soon follow them The daughter was accordingly shut up and Franklin was forbidden the house seventeen He suspected that this was merely a trick of the parents to induce him to run away with the young lady and leave them at liberty to make what terms they pleased He immediately broke off the connection The Godfreys were angry quarrelled with him and he left the house eighteen He had always continued on friendly terms with the family of the young lady to whom he had been engaged before his visit to London Her unfortunate marriage made her very dejected and miserable Franklin saw her and could not help attributing her unhappiness in a great measure to his own misconduct nineteen Their mutual affection was revived but there were now great objections to the union Her former husband had not been heard of and was supposed to be dead All difficulties were finally surmounted and he married Miss Read on the first of September seventeen thirty one What was the Junto What did the rules of this club require two What good purposes did it answer three What project did Franklin communicate to George Webb four What was the consequence of this communication What course did Franklin pursue six How did the paper succeed under Franklin s management seven What difficulty arose at this time eight Who offered Franklin their assistance nine What did Meredith propose How was Franklin relieved ten Describe the increase of his business and his character and conduct as a tradesman eleven What became of Keimer twelve Who was David Harry What became of him thirteen Who was now the only rival of Franklin fourteen Describe missus Godfrey s desire of match making fifteen Did Franklin show his usual prudence sixteen What was the result nineteen Whom did Franklin marry When CHAPTER VII Library of the Junto A public Library established Franklin studies His Frugality Anecdote of the Bowl and Spoon His Scheme of arriving at Moral Perfection Table of Precepts Franklin s Remarks upon it Poor Richard s Almanac one At the time Franklin first established himself in Pennsylvania there was not a good bookseller s shop any where to the south of Boston In New York and Philadelphia the printers were stationers but they kept only paper almanacs ballads and a few common school books Those who loved reading were obliged to send for their books from England two The members of the Junto had each of them a few volumes They had hired a room in which to hold their meetings and Franklin proposed that they should all bring their books to that room In this manner they would not only be ready for them to consult and refer to but would become a common benefit by allowing each one to borrow such as he wished to read at home three This was accordingly done and for a while answered their purpose very well Finding the advantage and convenience of this little collection Franklin proposed to render the benefit more general by commencing a public subscription library He drew a sketch of the plan and rules that would be necessary and had them put into the form of articles to be subscribed By these articles each subscriber agreed to pay a certain sum for the first purchase of the books and a yearly contribution for increasing them four The number of readers at that time in Philadelphia was so small that it was with great difficulty Franklin was able to procure fifty subscribers willing to pay forty shillings to begin with and ten shillings a year for a contribution With this number the library was commenced The books were imported and lent out to subscribers Great advantages were derived from the institution and it was soon imitated in other places five In this library Franklin found means of continual improvement He set apart an hour or two in each day for study and in this way in some degree made up for the loss of a learned education Reading was his only amusement His attention to business was as strict as it was necessary He was in debt for his printing house and had an increasing family with two rivals in his business who had been established before him Notwithstanding all this however he grew more easy in his circumstances every day six His early habits of frugality continued He often thought of the proverb of Solomon which his father had impressed on him while a boy Seest thou a man diligent in his calling he shall stand before kings he shall not stand before mean men Industry appeared a means of obtaining wealth and distinction and the thought encouraged him to new exertions We shall see by and by that little as his father expected it the son really came to stand with honor in the presence of monarchs seven His wife was fortunately as well inclined to industry and frugality as he was himself She assisted him in his business folding and stitching pamphlets tending shop and purchasing old linen rags for the paper makers They kept no idle servants their table was simply furnished and their furniture was plain and cheap eight My breakfast says Franklin was for a long time bread and milk no tea and I ate it out of a twopenny earthen porringer with a pewter spoon but mark how luxury will enter families and make a progress in spite of principle being called one morning to breakfast I found it in a china bowl with a spoon of silver They had been bought for me without my knowledge by my wife and had cost her the enormous sum of three and twenty shillings for which she had no other excuse or apology to make but that she thought her husband deserved a silver spoon and china bowl as well as any of his neighbors This was the first appearance of plate and china in our house which afterwards in a course of years as our wealth increased augmented gradually to several hundred pounds in value nine It was about this time that Franklin formed the bold and difficult project of arriving at moral perfection As he knew or thought he knew what was right and wrong he did not see why he might not always do the one and avoid the other For this purpose he made a table of the different virtues with certain rules and precepts annexed to them Some of these were as follows one Temperance Eat not to dulness drink not to elevation two Silence Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself avoid trifling conversation three Order Let all your things have their places let each part of your business have its time four Resolution Resolve to perform what you ought perform without fail what you resolve five Frugality Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself that is waste nothing six Industry Lose no time be always employed in something useful cut off all unnecessary actions seven Sincerity Use no hurtful deceit think innocently and justly and if you speak speak accordingly eight Justice Wrong none by doing injuries or omitting the benefits that are your duty nine Moderation Avoid extremes forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve ten Cleanliness Tolerate no uncleanliness in body clothes or habitation eleven Tranquility Be not disturbed at trifles nor at accidents common or unavoidable ten To acquire a habit of practising these virtues he determined to give a week s strict attention to each of them in succession Thus in the first week he took care to avoid even the slightest offence against temperance and strictly marked every fault in a little book he kept for that purpose This book he continued to keep for a great number of years till in the pressure of public business he was obliged to give it up entirely eleven It is well he wrote in his old age my posterity should be informed that to this little artifice their ancestor owed the constant felicity of his life down to his seventy ninth year in which this is written What reverses may attend the remainder is in the hand of Providence but if they arrive the reflection on past happiness enjoyed ought to help his bearing them with more resignation twelve To Temperance he ascribes his long continued health and what is still left to him of a good constitution To Industry and Frugality the early easiness of his circumstances and acquisition of his fortune with all that knowledge that enabled him to be an useful citizen and obtained for him some degree of reputation among the learned To Sincerity and Justice the confidence of his country and the honorable employs it conferred upon him and to the joint influence of the whole mass of the virtues even in the imperfect state he was able to acquire them all that evenness of temper and that cheerfulness in conversation which makes his company still sought for and agreeable even to his young acquaintance I hope therefore that some of my descendants may follow the example and reap the benefit thirteen In seventeen thirty two Franklin first published his almanac under the name of Richard Saunders It was continued by him about twenty five years and was commonly called Poor Richard s Almanac He endeavored to make it both entertaining and useful and it accordingly came to be in great demand As it was generally read and as the poor people bought hardly any other books Franklin thought it would be a good means to circulate instruction among them He therefore filled all the odd spaces with proverbs and wise sayings fourteen These proverbs contained the experience and wisdom of many nations and ages In seventeen fifty seven Franklin collected them into a discourse prefixed to the almanac for that year In this discourse he represented an old man talking to a number of people who were attending a sale at auction The hour for the sale not having come the company were conversing on the badness of the times fifteen One of them called out to a plain clean old man with white locks Pray father Abraham what think ye of the times Won t these heavy taxes quite ruin the country How shall we be ever able to pay them What would you advise us to do Father Abraham stood up and replied If you d have my advice I ll give it to you in short for a word to the wise is enough and many words won t fill a bushel as Poor Richard says sixteen The old man then went on to advise them to be industrious and economical and in the course of his advice repeated all of the wise sayings of Poor Richard In this manner they were all collected into a single paper called The Way to Wealth This piece was very much approved copied into all the American newspapers reprinted in Great Britain and translated into the French language Large numbers of it were in this manner distributed and undoubtedly did a good deal of service two What plan did Franklin propose for the formation of a library three How did it succeed How did Franklin propose to extend its advantages four How many subscribers were obtained five Did Franklin still pursue his studies and how Did his early habits continue What was the proverb so often repeated by his father seven What was the conduct of his wife eight Describe Franklin s breakfast and give his humorous account of the first appearance of luxury in his house nine What was Franklin s favorite project at this time Repeat the table of virtues and the precepts annexed to them ten How did he attempt to acquire a habit of these virtues twelve To what does Franklin ascribe his long continued health the ease of his circumstances the confidence and honor he received from his country thirteen When did he first publish his almanac How long was it continued How did he endeavor to make it useful fourteen What was prefixed to the almanac for seventeen fifty seven sixteen How was The Way to Wealth approved CHAPTER VIII Management of his Newspaper Study of the Languages Chess playing The Preacher Hemphill Stealing Sermons Visit to Boston Visits his Brother James at Newport Usefulness of the Junto Formation of new Clubs Franklin chosen Clerk of the General Assembly Anecdote one Besides his almanac Franklin considered his newspaper as a very valuable means of circulating instruction and good advice among the people For this purpose he frequently reprinted in it extracts from the Spectator a work written a good many years ago by several distinguished English authors It is a collection of pieces on moral and popular subjects in a very pleasant style and first published in single numbers of a few pages each two In conducting his paper Franklin was very careful to avoid all abuse of particular persons Whenever he was requested to publish any thing of the kind his answer was that he would print the piece by itself and give the author as many copies for his own use as he desired He very wisely considered that his subscribers expected him to furnish them with useful and entertaining pieces and not with abuse and violent discussions about things with which they had nothing to do three In seventeen thirty three Franklin sent one of his apprentices to Charleston South Carolina where a printer was wanted He furnished him with a press and types and was to receive one third of the profits of the business After the death of this man who was very irregular in settling his affairs with Franklin the business was continued by his widow This woman had been born and educated in Holland where females were taught a knowledge of accounts She managed the establishment with a great deal of prudence and success and was in time able to purchase the printing office and establish her son in it four In seventeen thirty three Franklin began the study of foreign languages He soon obtained such a knowledge of the French as to read books in that language with perfect ease After this he undertook the Italian An acquaintance who was also learning it often tempted him to play chess Finding this took up too much time Franklin refused to play any more except upon one condition This was that whichever of them should beat should have a right to impose a task upon the other either of part of the grammar to be got by heart or in translations five These tasks they were bound in honor to perform before the next meeting The two friends played with about equal skill and success and in this way soon beat each other into a pretty good knowledge of the Italian Franklin next undertook Spanish and learned enough to read books in that language with considerable ease six About the year seventeen thirty four a young preacher arrived in Philadelphia by the name of Hemphill He had a good voice and delivered very excellent sermons Large numbers were attracted by his eloquence of different doctrines and belief Among the rest Franklin became a very constant hearer He was pleased with his sermons because they impressed the love and the practice of virtue and goodness without quarrelling about hard questions of doctrinal religion seven Some of the congregation however disapproved of his preaching and united with the old ministers to attempt to put him down Franklin took sides with him very warmly and did all he could to raise a party in his favor He wrote two or three pamphlets in his defence eight During this contest the unlucky preacher hurt his own cause by a very unpardonable meanness One of his enemies heard him preach a very eloquent sermon and thought he had somewhere heard or read parts of it before On looking into the matter he found the preacher had stolen several passages from a discourse delivered by a celebrated English divine This discovery induced many of his friends to desert him and he was obliged to go in search of a congregation less inquisitive nine After ten years absence from Boston Franklin determined to make a journey there to visit his relations He was now doing very good business and was in quite easy circumstances He had seen a good many changes in his fortunes since he first ran away from his native place and his industry and good sense were to bring about still greater changes ten In returning to Philadelphia he stopped at Newport to see his brother James who was at that time settled there with his printing office Their former differences were at once forgotten and the meeting was very cordial and affectionate James was at that time in very ill health and in expectation of a speedy death He accordingly requested Benjamin when that event should happen to take home his son then but ten years of age and bring him up to the printing business eleven This he accordingly performed sending him a few years to school before he took him into the office When James died his widow carried on the business till her son was grown up At that time Benjamin assisted them with an assortment of new types and they were in this manner enabled to continue the establishment Illustration Reconciliation of Franklin with his Brother twelve The club which Franklin had founded proved to be so useful and afforded so much satisfaction to the members that they proposed to introduce their friends and increase their number They had from the beginning determined to keep the Junto a secret and the secret was kept better than such things usually are Franklin was of opinion that twelve members formed a club sufficiently large and that it would be inconvenient to increase it thirteen Instead of adding to their number he proposed that every member separately should endeavor to form another club with the same rules and on the same plan without informing them of the existence of the Junto The project was approved and every member undertook to form his club but they did not all succeed Five or six only were completed which were called by different names as the Vine the Union the Band These clubs were useful and afforded their members a good deal of amusement and information fourteen In seventeen thirty six Franklin was chosen clerk of the General Assembly The choice was made that year without any opposition but on the next a new member of that body made a long speech against him This however did not prevent his second election The place was one of some credit and by giving Franklin an opportunity to make friends among the members enabled him to secure the business of printing the public laws votes and paper money fifteen The new member who had opposed Franklin was a man of education and talents and it was desirable to gain his good opinion Franklin was too proud to pay any servile respect to him but was too prudent not to wish for his favor After some time with his usual shrewdness and knowledge of human nature he hit upon the following expedient sixteen Having heard that this gentleman had in his library a very scarce and curious book he wrote a note requesting that he would do him the favor of lending it for a few days The book was immediately sent and in about a week was returned by the borrower with a short note expressive of his sincere thanks for the favor seventeen The next time they met in the house the gentleman spoke to Franklin with a great deal of civility He ever after manifested a readiness to serve him and they became great friends This is another instance observes Franklin of the truth of an old maxim I had learned which says He that has done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another than he whom you yourself have obliged And it shows how much more profitable it is prudently to remove than to resent return and continue inimical proceedings eighteen In seventeen thirty seven Colonel Spotswood at that time postmaster general being dissatisfied with his deputy at Philadelphia took away his commission and offered it to Franklin He accepted it with readiness and found it of great advantage Though the salary was small the office gave him the means of increasing the subscribers to his paper and in this way increased his advertisements His paper now began to afford him a very considerable income one How did he make his newspaper serviceable in circulating instruction two What was he very careful to avoid three Describe the conduct of the woman whose husband Franklin had established in business four When did Franklin begin the study of foreign languages What languages did he study Relate the anecdote about chess playing six Who was Hemphill seven What did Franklin write in his behalf eight How did the preacher ruin his own cause nine How long had Franklin been absent from Boston when he determined to revisit it ten How was the interview between the brothers at Newport What request did James make respecting his son eleven How did Franklin comply with this request twelve How did the Junto flourish thirteen What new clubs were formed How fourteen To what office was Franklin elected in seventeen thirty six sixteen How did Franklin conciliate a member who was opposed to him seventeen What is the old maxim quoted by Franklin eighteen To what office was Franklin appointed in seventeen thirty seven CHAPTER IX Reform of the City Watch Fire Companies reverend mister Whitefield Effects of his Preaching His Project of building an Orphan House in Georgia Anecdotes Franklin s Opinion of him Franklin s Prosperity Military Defence of the Province Formation of Companies one Franklin now began to turn his attention to public affairs One of his first efforts in this way was to reform the city watch This was managed in the different wards by the constables who assembled a certain number of housekeepers to attend them for the night Those who did not choose to attend paid six shillings a year to be excused This made the constableship an office of profit for instead of spending the money thus received in hiring other watchmen it was spent in liquors by which the constables were able to get a parcel of ragamuffins about them instead of decent and orderly men two These fellows seldom went the rounds of the watch but spent most of the night in tippling In the course of a few years by the exertions of Franklin and his friends an entire alteration was produced in the laws upon this subject About the same time that he began to converse at the Junto on the abuses of the watch he wrote a paper on the different accidents by which houses were set on fire and means proposed of avoiding them three This gave rise to a project which soon followed of forming a company to assist with readiness at fires Thirty persons were immediately found willing to join in the scheme Their articles of agreement obliged every member to keep always in order and fit for use a certain number of leathern buckets with strong bags and baskets for packing and carrying goods which were to be brought at every fire They also held a monthly meeting to converse upon the subject of fires and communicate such ideas as might be useful in their conduct on such occasions four This company proved so useful that another was soon formed and thus went on one new company after another till they included most of the inhabitants who were men of property The club first formed was called the UNION FIRE COMPANY and we believe still exists These institutions have been exceedingly useful in extinguishing fires and preserving property five In seventeen thirty nine the Reverend mister Whitefield arrived in Philadelphia from Ireland This man had made himself very remarkable as a preacher going about the country and discoursing sometimes in churches sometimes in the fields to crowds of people with great effect He was at first permitted to preach in some of the churches in Philadelphia but the clergy soon took a dislike to him and refused him their pulpits This obliged him again to discourse in the streets and open fields six Large multitudes collected to hear his sermons It was wonderful says Franklin to see the change soon made in the manners of our inhabitants 
8033-284028-0000	train-other-500	From being thoughtless or indifferent about religion it seemed as if all the world were growing religious so that one could not walk through the town in an evening without hearing psalms sung in different families of every street
8033-284028-0001	train-other-500	And it being found inconvenient to assemble in the open air subject to its inclemencies the building of a house to meet in was no sooner proposed and persons appointed to receive contributions but sufficient sums
none	none	 were soon received to procure the ground and erect the building which was one hundred feet long and seventy broad and the work was carried on with such spirit as to be finished in a much shorter time than could be expected seven On leaving Philadelphia mister Whitefield went preaching 
8033-284028-0002	train-other-500	all the way through the colonies to Georgia The settlement of that province had then been recently commenced
none	none	 and was made with people entirely unfit for such a service 
8033-284028-0003	train-other-500	They were unable to endure hardships and perished in great numbers leaving many helpless children
none	none	 with nothing to feed or shelter them eight The sight of their miserable situation says Franklin 
8033-284028-0004	train-other-500	inspired the benevolent heart of mister Whitefield with the idea of building an orphan house there in which they might be supported and educated
none	none	 Returning northward he preached up this charity and made large collections 
8033-284028-0005	train-other-500	for his eloquence had a wonderful power over the hearts and purses of his hearers
none	none	 of which I myself was an instance nine I did not disapprove of the design 
8033-284028-0006	train-other-500	but as Georgia was then destitute of materials and workmen and it was proposed to send them from Philadelphia at a great expense I thought it would have been better to have built the house at Philadelphia
8033-284028-0007	train-other-500	and brought the children to it This I advised but he was resolute in his first project rejected my counsel and I
none	none	 therefore refused to contribute ten I happened soon after to attend one of his sermons in the course of which I perceived he intended to finish with a collection and I silently resolved he should get nothing from me I had in my pocket a handful of copper money three or four silver dollars and five pistoles in gold as he proceeded I began to soften and concluded to give the copper Another stroke of his oratory made me ashamed of that 
8033-284028-0008	train-other-500	and determined me to give the silver and he finished so admirably that I emptied my pocket wholly into the collector s dish
none	none	 gold and all eleven At this sermon there was also one of our club who 
8033-284028-0009	train-other-500	being of my sentiments respecting the building in Georgia and suspecting a collection might be intended had by precaution emptied his pockets before he came from home towards the conclusion of the discourse however he felt a strong inclination to give
8033-284028-0010	train-other-500	and applied to a neighbor who stood near him to lend him some money for the purpose The request was fortunately made to perhaps the only man in the company
8033-284028-0011	train-other-500	who had the firmness not to be affected by the preacher His answer was At any other time friend Hopkinson I would lend to thee freely but not now
none	none	 for thee seems to me to be out of thy right senses twelve Some of mister Whitefield s enemies affected to suppose that he would apply these collections to his own private emolument but I who was intimately acquainted with him being employed in printing his sermons journals c never had the least suspicion of his integrity but am to this day decidedly of opinion 
8033-284028-0012	train-other-500	that he was in all his conduct a perfectly honest man and methinks my testimony in his favor ought to have the more weight as we had no religious connection Ours was a mere civil friendship sincere on both sides and lasted
none	none	 to his death thirteen The last time I saw mister Whitefield was in London 
8033-284028-0013	train-other-500	when he consulted me about his orphan house concern
none	none	 and his purpose of appropriating it to the establishment of a college fourteen He had a loud and clear voice and articulated his words so perfectly 
8033-284028-0014	train-other-500	that he might be heard and understood at a great distance especially as his auditories observed the most perfect silence He preached one evening from the top of the court house steps which are in the middle of Market street and on the west side of Second street
8033-284028-0015	train-other-500	which crosses it at right angles Both streets were filled with hearers to a considerable distance being among the hindmost in Market street
8033-284028-0016	train-other-500	I had the curiosity to learn how far he could be heard by retiring backwards down the street towards the river and I found his voice distinct till I came near Front street when some noise in that street obscured it
8033-284028-0017	train-other-500	I computed that he might well be heard by more than thirty thousand This reconciled me to the newspaper accounts of his having preached to twenty five thousand people in the fields
none	none	 and to the history of generals haranguing whole armies of which I had sometimes doubted fifteen Franklin s business was now constantly increasing 
8033-284028-0018	train-other-500	and his newspaper had become very profitable He began to feel the truth of the old proverb that after getting the first hundred pounds it is more easy to get the second Those of his workmen who behaved well he established in printing houses in different colonies on easy terms
none	none	 Most of them did well and were able to repay him what he had advanced and go on working for themselves sixteen At this period there were no preparations for military defence in Pennsylvania The inhabitants were mostly Quakers 
8033-284028-0019	train-other-500	and had neglected to take any suitable measures against the enemies to whom they might be exposed There was also no college in the state nor any proper provision for the complete education of youth Franklin accordingly turned his attention
none	none	 to these very important subjects seventeen Spain had been several years at war with Great Britain 
8033-284028-0020	train-other-500	and had now been recently joined by France From the French possessions in Canada Pennsylvania was exposed to continual danger The governor of the province had been some time trying to prevail upon the Quaker assembly to pass
8033-284028-0021	train-other-500	a militia law and take other necessary steps for their security He tried however
none	none	 in vain eighteen Franklin thought something might be done by a subscription among the people 
8033-284028-0022	train-other-500	To promote this plan he wrote and published a pamphlet called PLAIN TRUTH In this he stated their exposed and helpless situation and represented the necessity of union for their defence
none	none	 The pamphlet had a sudden and surprising effect A meeting of the citizens was appointed and attended by a considerable number Proposals of the intended union 
8033-284028-0023	train-other-500	had been printed and distributed about the room to be signed by those who approved them
none	none	 When the company separated the papers were collected and found to contain above twelve hundred signatures nineteen Other copies were scattered about the country and the subscribers at length amounted to upwards of ten thousand All these furnished themselves as soon as they could with arms formed themselves into companies and regiments chose their own officers and met every week to be instructed in military exercises 
8033-284028-0024	train-other-500	The women made subscriptions among themselves and provided silk colors which they presented to the companies painted with different ornaments and mottoes
none	none	 supplied by Franklin twenty The officers of the companies that formed the Philadelphia regiment chose Franklin for their colonel 
8033-284028-0025	train-other-500	Not considering himself fit for the office he declined and recommended that mister Lawrence a man of influence and of a fine person should be chosen in his place
none	none	 This gentleman was accordingly elected twenty one Franklin now proposed a lottery to pay the expenses of building a battery below the town 
8033-284028-0026	train-other-500	and of furnishing it with cannon The lottery was rapidly filled and the battery soon erected They brought some old cannon from Boston and these not proving sufficient they sent to London for more The associates kept a nightly guard at the battery
none	none	 and Franklin regularly took his turn of duty as a common soldier twenty two His activity in these measures was agreeable to the governor and council 
8033-284028-0027	train-other-500	and secured their favor They took him into their confidence and consulted him on all operations in respect to the military Franklin took the opportunity to propose a public fast to promote reformation and implore the blessing of Heaven on their undertaking
none	none	 They embraced the motion 
8033-284028-0028	train-other-500	but as this was the first fast ever thought of in the province there was no form for the proclamation Franklin drew it up in the style of the New England proclamation
none	none	 it was translated into German printed in both languages and circulated through the province This gave the clergy of the different sects an opportunity of influencing their hearers to join the association and it would probably have been general among all but the Quakers if it had not been for the news of peace one What reform did Franklin introduce when he first turned his attention to public affairs two On what subject did he write a paper for the Junto three To what project did this give rise How did it succeed four Was it useful What was it called five What is stated of the Reverend mister Whitefield six What does Franklin say of the change in the manners of the inhabitants seven Where did mister Whitefield go on leaving Philadelphia eight What charitable design did he form at this period nine What was Franklin s opinion upon the subject ten What anecdote does Franklin relate of the collection eleven What anecdote of a member of the club twelve What does Franklin say of mister Whitefield s character thirteen Where did Franklin see him for the last time fourteen What does he say of his eloquence By how many did he compute that he might be heard at a time fifteen How were Franklin s affairs succeeding at this time sixteen To what very important subjects did Franklin now turn his attention seventeen How was Pennsylvania exposed to danger What obstacle was there to the passage of a militia law eighteen What did Franklin write on the subject What did he propose for their defence nineteen How many subscribers were obtained to these proposals What measures did they take twenty To what office was Franklin now chosen and why did he decline twenty one By what means was the battery erected and furnished twenty two What did Franklin propose How was the proclamation for fast drawn up and circulated What news was brought at this time CHAPTER X Anecdote William Penn Education of Youth Subscription for an Academy Franklin overloaded with public Offices Member of the Assembly Treaty with the Indians at Carlisle Public Hospital Anecdote one It was thought by some of the friends of Franklin 
8033-284029-0001	train-other-500	that he would offend the peace loving sect of Quakers by his activity in these warlike preparations A young man who had some friends in the assembly and wished to succeed him as their clerk told him in a quiet way that it was intended to displace him
8033-284029-0002	train-other-500	at the next election and that as a friend
none	none	 he should advise him to resign two The answer which Franklin made to this obliging young man was in the following words 
8033-284029-0003	train-other-500	I have heard or read of some public man who made it a rule never to ask for an office and never to refuse one when offered to him I approve of this rule and shall practise it with a small addition I shall never ask never refuse
8033-284029-0004	train-other-500	nor ever RESIGN an office If they will have my office of clerk to dispose of it to another
none	none	 they shall take it from me I will not give it up At the next election Franklin was unanimously elected clerk three Notwithstanding the general sentiments of the Quakers Franklin thought the military defence of the country not disagreeable to any of them 
8033-284029-0005	train-other-500	One of their number the learned and honorable mister Logan wrote an address to them declaring his approbation of defensive war and supporting his opinion by very strong arguments This gentleman related an anecdote of his old master William Penn
8033-284029-0006	train-other-500	in respect to the subject of defence
none	none	 which is quite amusing four He came over from England when a young man 
8033-284029-0007	train-other-500	as secretary to this distinguished Quaker
none	none	 It was war time and their ship was chased by an armed vessel 
8033-284029-0008	train-other-500	supposed to be an enemy Their captain prepared for defence but told William Penn and his company of Quakers that he did not expect their assistance and they might retire into the cabin They all retired except James Logan
none	none	 who chose to stay upon deck and was quartered to a gun five The supposed enemy proved a friend so there was no fighting When the secretary went to carry the information to his friends in the cabin William Penn spoke to him in severe language for staying upon deck and undertaking to assist in the defence of the vessel contrary to the principles of the Friends 
8033-284029-0009	train-other-500	This reproof being before all the company
none	none	 vexed the secretary who replied I being thy servant why did thee not order me to come down but thee was willing enough that I should stay and help to fight the ship when thee thought there was danger six Peace being concluded and the business of defence at an end Franklin next turned his thoughts to the affair of establishing an academy 
8033-284029-0010	train-other-500	The first step he took was to associate in the design a number of his active friends the next was to write and publish a pamphlet entitled Proposals relating to the Education of Youth in Philadelphia
8033-284029-0011	train-other-500	This he distributed among the principal inhabitants and in a short time opened a subscription for supporting an academy The subscribers were desirous of carrying the plan into immediate execution
8033-284029-0012	train-other-500	The constitutions for the government of the academy were soon drawn up and signed a house was hired masters engaged and the school opened
none	none	 This was in the year seventeen forty nine seven The scholars increased rapidly 
8033-284029-0013	train-other-500	the house was soon found too small when accident threw in their way a large house ready built which with a few alterations would exactly answer their purpose This was the building erected by the hearers of mister Whitefield
8033-284029-0014	train-other-500	Some difficulty had been found by the trustees in paying the expenses of this church and they were prevailed upon to give it up for the academy It was soon made fit for that purpose and the scholars were removed into the building
none	none	 The whole care and trouble of superintending this work fell upon Franklin who found sufficient leisure to attend to it from having taken a very able and industrious partner in his printing business eight Franklin now thought that he should find leisure 
8033-284029-0015	train-other-500	during the rest of his life to pursue his philosophical studies and amusements He purchased all the instruments and apparatus of doctor Spence who had come from England to lecture on philosophy in Philadelphia
8033-284029-0016	train-other-500	His intention was to proceed with diligence in his experiments in electricity But the public now considered him a man of leisure
none	none	 and laid hold of him for their purposes nine He seems to have been quite overloaded with offices 
8033-284029-0017	train-other-500	The governor made him a justice of the peace The city corporation chose him a member of the common council and shortly after alderman The citizens elected him to represent them in the assembly
none	none	 of which he had so long been clerk All these offices were signs of the esteem and respect in which he was held among his fellow citizens ten Franklin tried the office of justice of the peace a little while by attending a few courts and sitting on the bench to hear causes Finding however that it required more knowledge of the law than he possessed he gradually withdrew from it 
8033-284029-0018	train-other-500	excusing himself by being obliged to attend his duties as member of the assembly To this office he was chosen for ten years in succession without ever asking any elector for his vote or signifying directly or indirectly any desire of the honor
none	none	 On taking his seat in the house his son was appointed their clerk eleven During the next year a treaty was to be held with the Indians at Carlisle The governor sent a message to the house requesting that they should nominate some of their members to be joined with some members of council for that purpose The house named the speaker mister Norris and doctor Franklin and being commissioned they went to Carlisle to treat with the Indians twelve As the Indians were very apt to drink to excess and when drunk were very quarrelsome and disorderly the commissioners strictly forbade the sale of any liquor to them 
8033-284029-0019	train-other-500	When they complained of this they were told that on condition of their remaining perfectly sober during the treaty they should have plenty of rum when the business was over They accordingly promised this
none	none	 and kept their promise for the very best reason in the world because they were unable to break it The treaty was conducted with perfect order and concluded to the satisfaction of both parties thirteen They then claimed and received the rum This was in the afternoon The Indians were about one hundred in number men women and children and were lodged in cabins built in the form of a square just without the town 
8033-284029-0020	train-other-500	In the evening there was a great noise among them and the commissioners walked out to see what was the matter They found a great bonfire built in the middle of the square and the men and women in a state of intoxication fighting and quarrelling around it The tumult could not be stilled
none	none	 and the commissioners retired to their lodgings fourteen At midnight a number of the Indians came thundering at their door demanding more rum but the commissioners took no notice of them 
8033-284029-0021	train-other-500	The next day they were sensible of their misbehavior and sent three of their old counsellors to make an excuse The orator acknowledged the fault but laid it upon the rum and then endeavored to excuse the rum by saying
8033-284029-0022	train-other-500	The Great Spirit who made all things made every thing for some use and whatever use he designed any thing for that use it should always be put to now when he made rum he said Let this be for the Indians to get drunk with and it must be so
none	none	 It is a sad truth that among all savage nations the introduction of spirituous liquor has been the most severe curse that ever fell upon them fifteen In seventeen fifty one doctor Thomas Bond formed a plan to establish an hospital in Philadelphia for the reception and cure of poor sick persons 
8033-284029-0023	train-other-500	whether inhabitants of the province or strangers
none	none	 He was very active in endeavoring to procure subscriptions for it but the proposal being new in America and at first not well understood he met with but little success At length he came to Franklin with the compliment that there was no such a thing as carrying a public spirited thing through without his being concerned in it 
8033-284029-0024	train-other-500	For said he I am often asked
none	none	 by those to whom I propose subscribing Have you consulted Franklin on this business And what does he think of it And when I tell them I have not they do not subscribe but say they will consider it sixteen Franklin inquired into the nature and probable usefulness of the scheme 
8033-284029-0025	train-other-500	and being satisfied in respect to it not only subscribed himself but was active in procuring subscriptions from others Some aid was obtained from the assembly of the province
none	none	 A convenient and handsome building was soon erected the institution was found useful and flourishes to the present day seventeen It was about this time that another projector the reverend Gilbert Tennent 
8033-284029-0026	train-other-500	came to Franklin with a request that he would assist him in procuring subscriptions to erect a new meeting house It was to be devoted to the use of a congregation
8033-284029-0027	train-other-500	he had gathered among the original disciples of mister Whitefield Franklin was too wise to make himself disagreeable to his fellow citizens by such frequent calls upon their generosity and absolutely refused
none	none	 The gentleman then desired he would furnish him with a list of the names of persons he knew by experience to be generous and public spirited This also was refused for it was hard that their kind compliance with a request of charity should mark them out to be worried by all who chose to call upon them eighteen Franklin was then asked to give his advice That I will do he replied and in the first place I advise you to apply to all those who you know will give something next to those of whom you are uncertain whether they will give any thing or not 
8033-284029-0028	train-other-500	and show them the list of those who have given and lastly do not neglect those who you are sure will give nothing for in some of them you may be mistaken The clergyman laughed
8033-284029-0029	train-other-500	and promised to take his advice He did so for he asked of every body and soon obtained money enough to erect a spacious
none	none	 and elegant meeting house nineteen Franklin now exerted himself in several matters that however small they may seem affected the convenience and comfort of his fellow citizens in a great degree This was in respect to cleaning paving and lighting the streets By talking and writing in the papers 
8033-284029-0030	train-other-500	he was able to introduce great changes in these matters which were very important to the cleanliness and good appearance of the

what smaller matters of public interest did Franklin now attend CHAPTER XI Spence s Experiments in Electricity Franklin repeats them Makes important Discoveries Letters to Collinson Experiment with the Kite Publication of his Letters Anecdote of the Abbe Nollet Fame of Franklin Elected a Member of the Royal Society one It was in the year seventeen forty six that Franklin first attended to the branch of philosophy in which he afterwards became so distinguished During that year he was in Boston and there met with a doctor Spence who showed him some experiments in electricity It was a subject altogether new to him and though the experiments were not very well performed they surprised and pleased him two If you take a stick of sealing wax or a glass tube or a piece of amber which has been a long time untouched and bring it near some small pieces of paper chaff or other light substance it produces no impression upon them But if you first rub lightly and briskly the wax the tube or the amber with a piece of dry woollen cloth or cat skin and then bring it near any of these light substances you will find that they fly to it and remain upon it The power which attracts these substances and which is excited by the rubbing is called electricity three It is so called from a Greek word which signifies amber the substance in which this power was first observed Amber is a brittle mineral substance of a yellow and sometimes a reddish brown color It is found in several countries in Europe and has recently been found in the United States at Cape Sable in Maryland This is the substance with which the first electrical experiment was performed ages ago by a Greek philosopher of the name of Thales four Several centuries passed without any thing being known upon this subject beyond the fact that these substances possessed this power At length it began to attract the attention of modern philosophers In seventeen forty two several ingenious Germans engaged in the subject and the results of their researches astonished all Europe They obtained large apparatus by means of which they were enabled to collect large quantities of the electric fluid and produce several wonders which had been before unobserved five These experiments excited the curiosity of other philosophers mister Peter Collinson fellow of the Royal Society of London about the year seventeen forty five sent to the library company of Philadelphia a glass tube with some account of its use in making such experiments Franklin eagerly seized the opportunity of repeating those which he had seen at Boston and by much practice acquired great readiness in performing those of which they had an account from England six He was soon enabled to make a number of important discoveries and his house was for some time continually full of people who came to see the new wonders His observations upon the subject were from time to time communicated to his friend Collinson in a series of letters the first of which is dated March twenty eight seventeen forty seven These were read before the Royal Society where they were not at first thought worthy of much attention seven In the year seventeen forty nine Franklin first suggested the idea of explaining the sameness of electricity with lightning A paper upon this subject which he wrote for mister Kinnersly was read before the members of the Royal Society and excited a hearty laugh But it was the lot of this neglected theory to be generally adopted by philosophers and to bid fair to endure for ages eight It was in the same year that Franklin started the plan of proving the truth of his doctrine by actually drawing down the lightning by means of sharp pointed iron rods raised high into the clouds It was not until the summer of seventeen fifty two that he was enabled to complete his grand discovery by actual experiment nine The plan which he had first proposed was to erect a box on some high tower or other elevated place from which should rise a pointed iron rod He thought that electrified clouds passing over it would impart a portion of their electricity which would be made evident by presenting a key or the knuckle to it There was at this time in Philadelphia no opportunity of trying an experiment of the kind But while Franklin was waiting for the erection of a spire it occurred to him that he might have a more ready access to the clouds by means of a common kite ten He prepared a kite by fastening two cross sticks to a silk handkerchief which would not suffer from the rain so much as paper To the upright stick he affixed an iron point The string was as usual of hemp excepting the lower end which was made of silk because this substance does not give a free passage to the electricity eleven With this kite on the appearance of a thunder storm he went out into the commons with his son to whom alone he had communicated his intentions He placed himself under a shed to avoid the rain his kite was raised a thunder cloud passed over it but no sign of electricity appeared The experiment had almost been given up in despair when he perceived in the loose fibres of the string evident appearances of electricity By continued observation the fact was most clearly proved and the honor of establishing the sameness of electricity and lightning was won by Franklin twelve The letters which Franklin had sent to mister Collinson were published by that gentleman in a separate volume under the title of New Experiments and Observations on Electricity made at Philadelphia in America They were read with great eagerness and soon translated into different languages A very incorrect French translation fell into the hands of the celebrated Buffon who was much pleased with it and performed the experiments with success A more correct translation was undertaken at his request and contributed much towards spreading a knowledge of Franklin s principles in France His experiments were repeated by most of the distinguished philosophers throughout Europe thirteen By these experiments the truth of Franklin s doctrine was established in the firmest manner When it could no longer be doubted some men were anxious to take away from its merit It was considered at that time rather mortifying to the European philosophers to admit that an American could make important discoveries which had escaped their notice fourteen The Abbe Nollet preceptor in natural philosophy to the royal family of France was exceedingly offended at the publication of Franklin s letters He had himself written about electricity and could not at first believe that such a work had really come from America He said it must have been composed by his enemies in Paris to oppose his system Afterwards having been assured that there really existed such a person as Franklin at Philadelphia he published a volume of letters in defence of his own ideas upon the subject and denying the propositions of the American philosopher fifteen Franklin thought at one time of writing a letter in reply to the abbe and actually began one But on considering that any one might repeat his experiments and ascertain for himself whether or not they were true he concluded to let his papers shift for themselves believing it was better to spend what time he could spare in making new experiments than in disputing about those already made sixteen The event gave him no cause to repent of his silence His friend Monsieur Le Roy of the Royal Academy of Sciences took up his cause and refuted the abbe Franklin s volume was translated into the Italian German and Latin languages and the doctrine it contained was by degrees generally adopted by the philosophers of Europe in preference to that of Nollet seventeen What gave his book the more sudden and general celebrity was the success of one of its proposed experiments made at Marly for drawing lightning from the clouds This engaged the public attention every where The Philadelphia experiments as they were called were performed before the king and court and all the curious of Paris flocked to see them eighteen doctor Wright an English physician was at Paris when they were the talk and wonder of the day He wrote to a member of the Royal Society an account of the high esteem in which the experiments of Franklin were held by learned men abroad and of their surprise that his writings had been so little noticed in England The society on this resumed the consideration of the letters that had been read to them and a summary account of their doctrines was drawn up and published among their philosophical essays and transactions nineteen To make Franklin some amends for the slight with which they had before treated him the society chose him a member without his having made the usual application They also presented him with the gold medal of Sir Godfrey Copley for the year seventeen fifty three the delivery of which was accompanied by a very complimentary speech from the president Lord Macclesfield one When did Franklin first attend to electricity two Relate the substance of the second paragraph three From what is the word electricity derived What is amber Where is it found four When was the subject first examined by modern philosophers five What did mister Collinson send to Philadelphia seven When did Franklin first suggest that electricity and lightning were the same eight How did he propose to prove the truth of his doctrine When did he prove it by actual experiment nine What plans had he at first proposed What occurred to him afterwards ten How did he prepare the kite eleven Relate the progress of the experiment twelve Under what title were Franklin s letters on the subject printed How were they received By whose request was a correct French translation made thirteen What was the result of the establishment of Franklin s doctrine fourteen What was the conduct of the Abbe Nollet fifteen What course did Franklin pursue on the subject sixteen Did he regret his silence State the substance of this paragraph seventeen What gave the book the more general celebrity eighteen Who was doctor Wright What communication did he make to the Royal Society nineteen What honors did the society confer upon him CHAPTER XII Appointed Postmaster General Journey to New England Receives Degrees from two Colleges Story of the Visit to his Mother one Having been some time employed by the postmaster general of America in regulating the several offices and bringing the officers to account upon his death in seventeen fifty three Franklin was appointed jointly with another gentleman to succeed him The American office had before this time never paid any thing to that of Great Britain and the new postmasters were to have six hundred pounds between them if they could make that sum out of the profits of the office two To do this a variety of improvements were necessary some of which were at first very expensive so that for the first four years the office became more than nine hundred pounds in debt to them Afterwards they began to be repaid and before Franklin was displaced they had brought it to yield three times as much clear profit to the crown as the post office of Ireland After Franklin s dismission they never received a farthing from it three The business of the post office occasioned his taking a journey to New England where the College of Cambridge presented him with the degree of Master of Arts Yale College in Connecticut had before paid him a similar compliment Thus without studying in any college he came to partake of their honors They were conferred in consideration of his discoveries and improvements in natural philosophy four It was either during this or his former journey that the story of the visit to his mother originated He had been some years absent from his native city and was at that period of life when the greatest and most rapid alteration is made in the human appearance Franklin was sensible that his person had been so much changed that his mother would not know him unless there were some instinct to point out at a single glance the child to its parent five To discover the existence of this instinct by actual experiment Franklin determined to introduce himself to his mother as a stranger and to watch narrowly for the moment in which she should discover her son On the afternoon of a sullen cold day in the month of January he knocked at his mother s door and asked to speak with missus Franklin He found the old lady knitting before the parlor fire introduced himself by observing that he had been informed she entertained travellers and requested a night s lodging six She eyed him with coldness and assured him that he had been misinformed that she did not keep a tavern though to oblige some members of the legislature she took a number of them into her family during the session and at that time had four members of the council and six of the house of representatives who boarded with her She added that all her beds were full and went on knitting with a great deal of vehemence seven Franklin wrapped his coat around him pretending to shiver with the cold and observing that it was very chilly weather It was of course nothing more than civil for the old lady to ask him to stop and warm himself She pointed to a chair and he drew himself up to the fire eight The entrance of her boarders prevented any further conversation Coffee was soon served and the stranger partook with the rest of the family To the coffee according to the custom of the times succeeded a plate of apples pipes and a paper of tobacco A pleasant circle of smokers was then formed about the fire Agreeable conversation followed Jokes were cracked stories told and Franklin was so sensible and entertaining as to attract the attention of the whole company nine In this manner the moments passed pleasantly and swiftly along and it was eight o clock before any of them expected it This was the hour of supper and missus Franklin was always as punctual as the clock Busied with family affairs she supposed the stranger had quitted the house immediately after coffee Imagine her surprise when she saw him with the utmost coolness and impudence taking his seat with the family at the supper table ten Immediately after supper she called an elderly gentleman a member of the council with whom she was in the habit of consulting into another room complained of the rudeness of the stranger told the manner of his coming into the house observed that he appeared like a foreigner and she thought had something about him very suspicious The old gentleman assured her that she need not be under any alarm that the stranger was a man of education and agreeable manners and was probably unaware of the lateness of the hour He added that it would be well to call him aside and repeat to him that she was unable to give him lodgings eleven She accordingly sent her maid to him and then repeated the account of their situation observed that it grew late and gently hinted that he would do well to seek out other accommodations The stranger replied that he should be very sorry to put her to any inconvenience and would retire after smoking one more pipe with her boarders He returned to the company filled his pipe and began talking as pleasantly and forcibly as ever He recounted the hardships and praised the piety and wisdom of their ancestors twelve A gentleman present mentioned the subject of the day s debate in the house of representatives A bill had been introduced to extend the powers of the royal governor The stranger immediately entered upon the subject supported the rights of the colonies with many arguments and much eloquence and showed a great familiarity with the names of influential members of the house in the time of Governor Dudley thirteen The conversation was so animated and interesting that the clock struck eleven unnoticed by the delighted circle The patience of missus Franklin was by this time completely exhausted She now entered the room and before the whole company addressed the stranger with much anger told him plainly that she thought herself imposed upon that she was a lone woman but had friends who would protect her and concluded by telling him to leave the house Franklin made a slight apology put on his great coat and hat took a polite leave of the company and approached the street door lighted by the maid and attended by the mistress fourteen While the company had been enjoying themselves within a most tremendous snow storm had filled the streets knee deep and no sooner had the maid lifted the latch than a roaring wind forced open the door put out the light and almost filled the entry with drifted snow and hail As soon as the candle was relighted the stranger cast a mournful look on the lady of the mansion and said My dear madam if you turn me out of your house in this dreadful storm I am a stranger in the town and shall certainly perish in the streets You look like a charitable lady I should not think you could refuse shelter to a dog on such a night fifteen Don t tell me of charity said the offended matron charity begins at home It is your own fault that you staid so long In short sir I do not like your looks or your conduct in thus forcing yourself upon my family and I fear you have some bad designs sixteen The good lady had grown so angry as to raise her voice much above its ordinary pitch and the noise drew all the company into the entry They did not agree with missus Franklin in respect to the stranger at all He seemed to them to be a very honest clever looking fellow and so far from wishing to turn him out of the house there was not one of them but would have been glad to have him for a fellow boarder They thought him very sensible and pleasant and could not account for their landlady s aversion seventeen At length by their united interference the stranger was permitted to remain in the house There was no bed or part of a bed unoccupied and he was obliged to sleep all night in an easy chair before the parlor fire Although her boarders appeared to have perfect confidence in his honesty it was not so with missus Franklin She very carefully collected her silver spoons pepper box and porringer from her closet and after securing the parlor door by sticking a fork over the latch carried them to her chamber She charged the negro man to sleep with his clothes on to take the great cleaver to bed with him and to wake up and seize the vagrant at the first noise he made in plundering the house The good lady then retired to bed with her maid whom she compelled to sleep in the same room eighteen After a very restless night missus Franklin rose before the sun She called her domestics proceeded with them in a body to unfasten the parlor door To her great astonishment she found her guest quietly sleeping in his chair She now began to feel sorry for her suspicions Awaking him with a cheerful good morning she inquired how he had rested and invited him to partake of her breakfast which was always served before that of the boarders nineteen Pray sir said the old lady as they were sipping their chocolate at the breakfast table as you appear to be a stranger here to what distant country do you belong twenty Franklin put a little more sugar into his chocolate and helping himself to a slice of toast replied that he belonged to the city of Philadelphia At the mention of this word the old lady for the first time exhibited emotion Philadelphia said she if you live in Philadelphia perhaps you know our Ben twenty one Who madam replied Franklin in the same cool and undisturbed manner that he had put on ever since he entered the house Why Ben Franklin said the mother my Ben oh he is the dearest child that ever blessed a mother twenty two What said the stranger is Ben Franklin the printer your son Why he is my most intimate friend he and I lodge in the same room O Heaven forgive me exclaimed the old lady and have I suffered an acquaintance of my Benny to sleep on this hard chair while I myself rested on a good bed twenty three We can well imagine that the mother was very much astonished when she found that it was not an acquaintance of her son but her son himself whose countenance and person had been so much changed that she had even been on the point of turning him out of doors She was delighted to embrace him once more before she died and was quite pleased that the members of the council had found him so agreeable a fellow as to insist that he should remain all night in the house one What appointment did Franklin receive at this time two Was the post office under Franklin a source of revenue to the crown three What honors did Franklin receive from the colleges five Why did Franklin introduce himself to his mother as a stranger In what situation did he find her six How did she receive him eight What was the evening custom at that time CHAPTER XIII Congress at Albany Plan for a Union of the Colonies Arrival of General Braddock Franklin sent to him by the Assembly Want of Wagons Franklin undertakes to procure them His Advertisement Anecdote of Braddock Battle with the Indians Retreat one In seventeen fifty four there was again a prospect of war with France A congress of commissioners from the different colonies was ordered to be assembled at Albany to confer with the chiefs of the Six Nations of Indians in respect to the defence of the country The governor of Pennsylvania communicated this order to the assembly and nominated Franklin with mister Norris mister Penn and mister Peters to act as commissioners Presents were provided for the Indians and they all met at Albany about the middle of June two On his way thither Franklin projected and drew up a plan for the union of all the colonies under one government so far as might be necessary for defence and other important services This plan was shown to two or three of his friends and having met with their approbation was submitted to congress It then appeared that several of the commissioners had formed projects of the same kind A committee was appointed to consider the several plans and report That proposed by Franklin was finally adopted with a few alterations copies of it were sent to the British government and to the assemblies of the several provinces three The British government were unwilling to permit the union proposed at Albany from a fear that the colonies would become too military and feel their own strength They accordingly sent over General Braddock with two regiments of regular English troops for the purpose of protecting them This officer with his forces landed at Alexandria and marched thence to Fredericktown in Maryland where he halted for carriages Franklin was sent by the assembly to wait upon him at this place in order to arrange some matters which had occurred to excite serious misunderstanding four His son accompanied him upon this journey They found the general at Fredericktown waiting impatiently for the return of those whom he had sent through the back parts of Maryland and Virginia to collect wagons Franklin staid with him several days dined with him daily and had full opportunity of removing his prejudices When he was about to depart it had been ascertained that only twenty five wagons could be procured and not all of them fit for use five The general and all the officers were very much surprised and declared that the expedition was entirely at an end They exclaimed bitterly against their government for sending them into a country destitute of the means of carrying their stores and baggage for which no less than one hundred and fifty wagons were necessary Franklin remarked that it was a pity they had not been landed in Pennsylvania as in that country almost every farmer had his wagon The general caught at his words and eagerly said Then you sir who are a man of interest there can possibly procure them for us and I beg you will undertake it six Franklin asked what terms were to be offered to the owners of the wagons and he was desired to put on paper the terms that appeared to him necessary This he did and they were accepted He soon after published an advertisement offering to contract for certain wagons and horses on specified terms and to this added an address to the inhabitants of the counties of York Lancaster and Cumberland The address was in the following words seven Friends and Countrymen Being occasionally at the camp at Frederick a few days since I found the general and officers exceedingly exasperated on account of their not being supplied with horses and carriages which had been expected from this province as most able to furnish them but through the dissensions between our governor and assembly money had not been provided nor any steps taken for that purpose eight It was proposed to send an armed force immediately into these counties to seize as many of the best carriages and horses as should be wanted and compel as many persons into the service as would be necessary to drive and take care of them nine If you are really as I believe you are good and loyal subjects to his majesty you may now do a most acceptable service and make it easy to yourselves for three or four of such as cannot separately spare from the business of their plantations a wagon and four horses and a driver may do it together one furnishing the wagon another one or two horses and another the driver and divide the pay proportionably between you ten But if you do not this service to your king and country voluntarily when such good pay and reasonable terms are offered to you your loyalty will be strongly suspected The king s business must be done So many brave troops come so far for your defence must not stand idle through your backwardness to do what may be reasonably expected from you Wagons and horses must be had violent measures will probably be used and you will be left to seek for recompense where you can find it and your case perhaps be little pitied or regarded eleven I have no particular interest in this affair as except the satisfaction of endeavoring to do good I shall have only my labor for my pains If this method of obtaining the wagons and horses is not likely to succeed I am obliged to send word to the general in fourteen days and I suppose Sir John saint Clair the hussar with a body of soldiers will immediately enter the province for the purpose which I shall be very sorry to hear because I am very sincerely and truly Your friend and well wisher B FRANKLIN twelve Eight hundred pounds were furnished by the general to be paid out as advance money to the owners of the wagons and horses This sum not being large enough Franklin advanced upwards of two hundred pounds more In two weeks the one hundred and fifty wagons with two hundred and fifty nine carrying horses were on their way to the camp The advertisement promised payment in case any wagons or horses should be lost and as the owners knew nothing about the dependence to be placed on General Braddock they insisted on Franklin s bond for the performance This he accordingly gave them thirteen General Braddock was a brave man but had too much self confidence too high an opinion of the power of regular troops and too mean an idea of both Americans and Indians About one hundred Indians joined him on his march who might have been of great use to him as guides and scouts if he had treated them kindly He neglected and slighted them however and they gradually left him fourteen In conversation one day with Franklin he gave an account of his intended progress After taking Fort Duquesne said he I am to proceed to Niagara and having taken that to Frontenac if the season will allow time and I suppose it will for Duquesne can hardly detain me above three or four days and then I see nothing that can obstruct my march to Niagara fifteen Franklin knew something about marches through the woods and the tricks of the Indians and entertained serious doubts in respect to the success of the campaign He only ventured however to say To be sure sir if you arrive well before Duquesne with the fine troops so well provided with artillery the fort though completely fortified and assisted with a very strong garrison can probably make but a short resistance The only danger I apprehend of obstruction to your march is from the ambuscades of the Indians who by constant practice are dexterous in laying and executing them and the slender line near four miles long which your army must make may expose it to be attacked by surprise in its flanks and to be cut like a thread into several pieces which from their distance cannot come up in time to support each other sixteen Braddock smiled at his ignorance and replied These savages may indeed be a formidable enemy to your raw American militia but upon the king s regular and disciplined troops sir it is impossible they should make any impression seventeen The enemy did not take that advantage of the army under Braddock which Franklin anticipated They suffered it to approach without interruption till within nine miles of Fort Duquesne The troops had just crossed a river were in a more open part of the woods than any they passed and moving forward in a compact form Their advanced guard was suddenly attacked by a heavy fire from behind trees and bushes This was the first intelligence which the general had of the approach of an enemy eighteen The guard being disordered the general hurried the troops up to their assistance This was done in great confusion through wagons baggage and cattle They were now attacked also from behind The officers were on horseback and easily distinguished and picked out as marks by the enemy The soldiers were thrown together in great disorder having or hearing no orders and standing to be shot at till two thirds of them were killed then being seized with a panic the remainder fled in precipitation nineteen The wagoners took each a horse out of his team and scampered Their example was immediately followed by others so that all the wagons provisions artillery and stores were left to the enemy The general being wounded was brought off with difficulty out of eighty six officers sixty three were killed or wounded and seven hundred and fourteen men killed of eleven hundred twenty These men had been picked from the whole army the rest had been left behind with Colonel Dunbar who was to follow with the heavier parts of the baggage The fugitives arrived at Dunbar s camp and communicated their own panic to him and all his people Though he had now above a thousand men he determined not to meddle with the enemy but to make the best of his way to the settlements Notwithstanding requests from the governor of Virginia Maryland and Pennsylvania that he would post his troops on the frontiers to protect the inhabitants he continued his hasty and disgraceful march till he had arrived at snug quarters in Philadelphia one Why were commissioners from the colonies ordered to assemble at Albany Who were sent from Pennsylvania two What plan did Franklin draw up three Why did the British government disapprove of the proposed union What course did they pursue Why was Franklin sent to Fredericktown five What impeded the progress of the expedition How did General Braddock obviate this difficulty six What step did Franklin take to procure the wagons twelve How much was furnished by the British general to be paid in advance to the owners of the wagons and horses How much did Franklin furnish thirteen What was the character of General Braddock How did he treat the Indians who joined him on his march fourteen What were the general s plans fifteen What did Franklin tell him sixteen What was Braddock s reply seventeen Where were the British troops first attacked eighteen What was the progress of the battle nineteen What became of the wagons and artillery twenty Where did the fugitives resort What was Colonel Dunbar s conduct CHAPTER XIV Settlement for the Loss of Wagons Anecdote Preparations for Defence Franklin appointed to a military Command Assembles the Troops at Bethlehem Farmers killed by Indians Building Forts Extracts from Franklin s Journal Indian Cunning Anecdotes of the Moravians one As soon as the loss of the wagons and horses was generally known all the owners came upon Franklin for the valuation which he had given bond to pay Their demands troubled him exceedingly He informed them that the money was ready in the paymaster s hands but the order for paying it must first be obtained from General Shirley that he had applied for it and they must have patience till he could receive it All this however was not sufficient and some began to sue him General Shirley at length released him from this disagreeable situation by appointing commissioners to examine the claims and order payment They amounted to nearly twenty thousand pounds two Before receiving news of the defeat two gentlemen came to Franklin with a subscription paper for raising money to pay the expense of a grand firework which it was intended to exhibit on receiving the news of taking Fort Duquesne Franklin told them gravely that he thought it would be time enough to prepare for rejoicing when they knew they should have occasion to rejoice They seemed surprised that he did not immediately comply with their proposal Why said one of them you surely do not suppose that the fort will not be taken I don t know replied Franklin that it will not be taken but I know that the events of war are subject to great uncertainty The plan was fortunately abandoned three The assembly now laid a tax to raise money for the defence of the province and Franklin was appointed one of the commissioners to dispose of it He had also carried a bill through the house for establishing and disciplining a voluntary militia To promote the association necessary to form the militia he wrote a dialogue upon the subject which was extensively circulated and thought to have great effect four While the several companies in the city and country were forming and learning their exercise the governor prevailed upon Franklin to take charge of the north western frontier which was infested by the enemy and provide for the defence of the inhabitants by raising troops and building a line of forts Franklin did not think himself very well qualified for the military but was willing to be of all the service in his power He received a commission from the governor with full authority and a parcel of blank commissions for officers to be given to whom he thought fit Five hundred and sixty men were soon raised and placed under his command five The place first selected for a fort was Gnadenhutten a village settled by the Moravians and which had recently been the scene of terrible destruction and death In order to march thither Franklin assembled the companies at Bethlehem the chief establishment of those people He was surprised to find this place in a good state of defence The destruction of Gnadenhutten had made them apprehensive of danger six They had purchased a quantity of arms and ammunition from New York and had even placed quantities of small paving stones between the windows of their high houses to be thrown down upon the heads of any Indians that should attempt to force into them The armed brethren kept watch and relieved each other as regularly as in any garrison town seven In conversation with their bishop Spangenberg Franklin mentioned his surprise for knowing they had obtained an act of parliament excusing them from military duties in the colonies he supposed they had motives of conscience which forbade their bearing arms The bishop answered That it was not one of their established principles but that at the time of their obtaining that act it was thought to be a principle with many of their people On this occasion however to their surprise they found it adopted but by a few A strong sense of danger very soon overcomes such notions eight It was the beginning of January when they set out upon the business of building forts One detachment was sent towards the Minisink with directions to erect one for the upper part of the country and another to the lower part with similar directions Franklin went in person with the remaining troops to Gnadenhutten where a force was thought more immediately necessary The Moravians procured him five wagons for their tools stores and baggage nine Just before they left Bethlehem eleven farmers who had been driven from their homes by the Indians came to Franklin requesting a supply of fire arms that they might go back and bring off their cattle He gave them each a gun with suitable ammunition ten They had not marched many miles when it began to rain and it continued raining all day There were no habitations on the road to shelter them till they reached about night the house of a German Here in the barn and shed they were all huddled together as wet as water could make them It was well for them that they were not attacked upon the march for their arms were of the poorest sort and it was impossible to keep the locks of their guns dry The poor farmers before mentioned suffered on this account They met with the Indians and the primings being wet with rain their guns would not go off so that only one of them escaped with his life eleven The next day was fair The companies continued their march and arrived at the desolate Gnadenhutten There was a mill in the neighborhood round which several pine boards had been left With these they soon built themselves huts Their next work was to bury the dead they found there On the following morning their fort was planned and marked out with a circumference measuring four hundred and fifty five feet Their axes of which they had seventy were immediately set to work to cut down trees for palisades and as the men were very skilful in the use of them they made great despatch twelve Seeing the trees fall so fast Franklin had the curiosity to look at his watch when two men began to cut at a pine In six minutes they had it upon the ground and it was fourteen inches in diameter Each pine made three palisades of eighteen feet long pointed at one end While these were preparing other men dug a trench all round of three feet deep in which the palisades were to be planted When these were set up the carpenters built within them a platform of boards all round about six feet high for the men to stand on and fire through the loopholes They had one swivel gun which they mounted and fired as soon as it was fixed that the Indians might know they had such pieces Thus their fort such as it was was finished in a week though it rained so hard every other day that the men were almost unable to work thirteen This gave me occasion to observe says Franklin that when men are employed they are best contented For on the days they worked they were good natured and cheerful and with the consciousness of having done a good day s work they spent the evening jollily But on our idle days they were mutinous and quarrelsome finding fault with the pork and the bread and were continually in bad humor which put me in mind of a sea captain whose rule it was to keep his men constantly at work and when his mate once told him that they had done every thing and there was nothing further to employ them about O said he make them scour the anchor fourteen This kind of fort he continues however contemptible is a sufficient defence against Indians who have no cannon Finding ourselves now posted securely and having a place to retreat to on occasion we ventured out in parties to scour the adjacent country We met with no Indians but we found the places on the neighboring hills where they had lain to watch our proceedings There was an art in their contrivance of those places that seems worth mentioning fifteen It being winter a fire was necessary for them but a common fire on the surface of the ground would by its light have discovered their position at a distance they had therefore dug holes in the ground about three feet in diameter and somewhat deeper we found where they had with their hatchets cut off the charcoal from the side of burnt logs lying in the woods With these coals they had made small fires in the bottom of the holes and we observed among the weeds and grass the prints of their bodies made by their lying all round with their legs hanging down in the holes to keep their feet warm which with them is an essential point This kind of fire so managed could not discover them either by its light flame sparks or even smoke it appeared that the number was not great and it seems they saw we were too many to be attacked by them with prospect of advantage sixteen We had for our chaplain a zealous Presbyterian minister mister Beatty who complained to me that the men did not generally attend his prayers and exhortations When they enlisted they were promised besides pay and provisions a gill of rum a day which was punctually served out to them half in the morning and half in the evening and I observed they were punctual in attending to receive it seventeen Upon which I said to mister Beatty It is perhaps below the dignity of your profession to act as steward of the rum but if you were to distribute it out only just after prayers you would have them all about you He liked the thought undertook the task and with the help of a few hands to measure out the liquor executed it to satisfaction and never were prayers more generally and more punctually attended So that I think this method preferable to the punishment inflicted by some military laws for non attendance on divine service eighteen I had hardly finished this business and got my fort well stored with provisions when I received a letter from the governor acquainting me that he had called the assembly and wished my attendance there if the posture of affairs on the frontiers was such that my remaining there was no longer necessary My friends too of the assembly pressing me by their letters to be if possible at the meeting and my three intended forts being now completed and the inhabitants contented to remain on their farms under that protection I resolved to return the more willingly as a New England officer Colonel Clapham experienced in Indian war being on a visit to our establishment consented to accept the command nineteen I gave him a commission and parading the garrison had it read before them and introduced him to them as an officer who from his skill in military affairs was much more fit to command them than myself and giving them a little exhortation took my leave I was escorted as far as Bethlehem where I rested a few days to recover from the fatigue I had undergone The first night lying on a good bed I could hardly sleep it was so different from my hard lodging on the floor of a hut at Gnadenhutten with only a blanket or two twenty While at Bethlehem I inquired a little into the practices of the Moravians some of them had accompanied me and all were very kind to me I found they worked for a common stock ate at common tables and slept in common dormitories great numbers together In the dormitories I observed loop holes at certain distances all along just under the ceiling which I thought judiciously placed for change of air I went to their church where I was entertained with good music the organ being accompanied with violins hautboys flutes and clarionets twenty one I understood their sermons were not usually preached to mixed congregations of men women and children as is our common practice but that they assembled sometimes the married men at other times their wives then the young men the young women and the little children each division by itself The sermon I heard was to the latter who came in and were placed in rows on benches the boys under the conduct of a young man their tutor and the girls conducted by a young woman The discourse seemed well adapted to their capacities and was delivered in a pleasing familiar manner coaxing them as it were to be good They behaved very orderly but looked pale and unhealthy which made me suspect they were kept too much within doors or not allowed sufficient exercise twenty two I inquired concerning the Moravian marriages whether the report was true that they were by lot I was told that lots were used only in particular cases that generally when a young man found himself disposed to marry he informed the elders of his class who consulted the elder ladies that governed the young women As these elders of the different sexes were well acquainted with the tempers and dispositions of their respective pupils they could best judge what matches were suitable and their judgments were generally acquiesced in twenty three But if for example it should happen that two or three young women were found to be equally proper for the young man the lot was then

succeeded him twenty What does Franklin say of the practice of the Moravians Of their dormitories Of their church twenty one What is said of their congregation twenty two How are the Moravian marriages conducted twenty three What did Franklin suggest on this subject What was the reply CHAPTER XV Disputes with the Proprietaries Franklin sent by the Assembly to London Appointed general Agent for the Colonies University Honors The Armonica Murder of the friendly Indians one Soon after his return to Philadelphia Franklin was appointed by the assembly upon a very important mission From the earliest establishment of Pennsylvania there seems to have been a spirit of dispute among its inhabitants During the lifetime of William Penn the constitution had been three times altered After this time quarrels were continually arising between the proprietaries or their governors and the assembly two The proprietaries were the descendants of those to whom the lands were originally granted by the king They claimed particular privileges for their estates and among other things that they should be free from taxes To this the assembly would by no means consent This subject of dispute interfered in almost every question and prevented the passage of the most necessary laws three The assembly at length resolved to appeal to the king against the unjust claims of the proprietaries and appointed Franklin as their agent to go over to England and present their petition After some delay and detention by the governor under the pretence of bringing about an accommodation Franklin sailed from New York towards the end of June and arrived in London on the twenty seventh of July seventeen fifty seven four According to the instructions which he had received from the legislature Franklin had a meeting with the proprietaries who then resided in England and endeavored to prevail on them to give up their pretensions Finding it impossible to derive any satisfaction from them he laid his petition before the council During this time the governor of Pennsylvania had consented to a law imposing a tax in which no distinction was made in favor of the estates of the Penn family five Alarmed at this intelligence and by Franklin s exertions they used their utmost endeavors to prevent this law from receiving the royal approbation They represented it as highly unjust designed to throw the burden of supporting government upon them and tending to produce the most ruinous consequences to them and their posterity six The cause was very fully examined before the king s privy council The Penn family here found some very earnest advocates while those were not wanting ready to espouse the side of the people After some time spent in debate a proposal was made that Franklin should solemnly engage that the tax should be so made that the proprietary estates should pay no more than a fair proportion This he agreed to perform and the Penn family withdrew their opposition to the passage of the law seven After this business was thus happily concluded Franklin remained at the court of Great Britain as agent for the province of Pennsylvania The extensive knowledge which he possessed of the situation of the colonies and the regard which he had always shown for their interests occasioned his appointment to the same office by the colonies of Massachusetts Maryland and Georgia His conduct in this situation increased the reputation and esteem in which he was held among his countrymen eight Franklin was now in the midst of those friends whom he had acquired by his fame as a philosopher He was very much sought after by them Honors from learned societies and colleges were continually heaped upon him The university of saint Andrew s in Scotland conferred on him the degree of doctor of laws Its example was followed by the universities of Edinburgh and Oxford His correspondence was sought by the most distinguished philosophers of Europe nine Although Franklin was now principally occupied with political pursuits he found time for his favorite studies He extended his researches in electricity and in other interesting subjects of natural philosophy ten The tone produced by rubbing the brim of a drinking glass with a wet finger is familiar to every one An Irish gentleman by the name of Puckeridge by placing on a table a number of glasses of different sizes and tuning them by partly filling them with water endeavored to form an instrument upon which he could play tunes He died before he had completed his invention Some improvements were afterwards made upon his plan The sweetness of the tones induced Franklin to try a number of experiments and he at length formed the instrument which he has called the Armonica eleven In the summer of seventeen sixty two he returned to America He received the thanks of the assembly of Pennsylvania as well for the faithful discharge of his duty to that province in particular as for the many and important services done to America in general during his residence in Great Britain A compensation of five thousand pounds Pennsylvania currency was decreed him for his services during six years twelve During his absence Franklin had been annually elected member of the assembly On his return to Philadelphia he again took his seat in that body and continued steadily to protect the rights and interests of the people thirteen In December seventeen sixty two great alarm was excited in the province by the following circumstance Several Indians resided in the county of Lancaster who had always conducted themselves as friends to the white men A number of inhabitants upon the frontiers who had been irritated by repeated injuries determined to seek revenge on all the Indians who fell in their way fourteen About a hundred and twenty persons assembled and proceeded on horseback to the settlements of the defenceless Indians These were now reduced in number to about twenty They had received information of the intended attack but did not believe it As the white people had always been their friends they feared no danger from them When the party arrived at the Indian settlement they found only some women and children and a few old men The rest were absent at work The wretches murdered all whom they found and among others the chief Shahehas who had been always distinguished for his friendship to the whites fifteen The remainder of these unfortunate Indians who by their absence had escaped the massacre were conducted to Lancaster and lodged in the jail as a place of security Large rewards were offered by the governor for the discovery of the murderers But notwithstanding this a party of the same men marched to Lancaster broke open the jail and inhumanly butchered the innocent Indians who had been placed there for protection sixteen Another proclamation was issued by the governor but in vain A party even marched down to Philadelphia for the purpose of murdering some friendly Indians who had been removed to the city for safety The citizens armed to protect them The Quakers notwithstanding they are opposed to fighting even in their own defence were most active upon the occasion The rioters advanced to Germantown and the governor fled for safety to the house of doctor Franklin It was by his assistance and influence that the disturbance was quelled and the rioters prevailed upon to return to their homes two Who were the proprietaries What did they claim How did the assembly treat their claim three What course did the assembly pursue Why was Franklin sent to England When did he arrive in London four What course did Franklin pursue in respect to the petition What law had been passed in Pennsylvania five How did the Penn family represent this law six Where was the cause examined How was it settled seven In what capacity did Franklin remain in London after the conclusion of this business eight How was Franklin received What honors were conferred upon him nine How was Franklin chiefly occupied at this time ten What was the musical instrument which Franklin formed eleven When did he return to America How was he received by the assembly What compensation did they allow him thirteen What alarm was excited in the province in seventeen sixty two fourteen Relate the substance of this paragraph fifteen What became of the remaining Indians sixteen Was the governor s proclamation of any effect How were the rioters persuaded to return home CHAPTER XVI Franklin reappointed Agent at the Court of Great Britain Visits Germany and France Returns to Philadelphia Appointed Delegate to Congress Interview with Lord Howe Sent as Ambassador to France Asks to be recalled Chosen President of the Supreme Council of Philadelphia Death Character one The disputes between the proprietaries and the assembly which had for a long time subsided again revived At the election for a new assembly in seventeen sixty four the friends of the proprietaries made great exertions to keep out all those of the opposite party They obtained a small majority in the city of Philadelphia and Franklin lost the seat which he had now held for fourteen years two On the meeting of the assembly it appeared that there was still a majority of Franklin s friends He was again appointed agent of the provinces at the court of Great Britain His enemies were sadly vexed at this appointment and made a solemn protest against it which they wished to have entered upon the journals This however was refused and it was consequently published in the newspapers It drew from him a spirited reply three The opposition to his reappointment seems to have greatly affected his feelings as it came from men with whom he had long been connected both in public and private life In his last publication he took a pathetic leave of Pennsylvania I am now he says to take leave perhaps a last leave of the country I love and in which I have spent the greatest part of my life Esto perpetua one I wish every kind of prosperity to my friends and I forgive my enemies one May it exist for ever four During his residence in England he consulted with unremitting industry the best interests of his native country He was every where received with respect on account of his reputation as a writer and philosopher In seventeen sixty six he made a visit to Holland and Germany and received the greatest marks of attention from men of science In the following year he travelled into France where he was received with much kindness and favor He became acquainted with a number of literary men and was introduced to the king Louis XV five Difficulties had now commenced between Great Britain and her provinces in America Franklin was unwearied in his efforts to bring about a reconciliation He had frequent interviews with Lord Howe and Lord Chatham and other distinguished English statesmen who entertained for him the highest respect and esteem Most of the time during his present residence in England was occupied in these vain efforts The violent conduct of the parent state drove the colonies to war and Franklin returned to America in the year seventeen seventy five six The day after his return he was elected by the legislature of Pennsylvania a delegate to congress Not long after his election a committee was appointed consisting of mister Lynch mister Harrison and himself to visit the camp at Cambridge They here united their efforts with those of the commander in chief to convince the soldiers of the necessity of remaining in the field and persevering in the cause of their country seven When Lord Howe came to America in seventeen seventy six with powers to effect an accommodation with the colonists a correspondence on the subject took place between him and doctor Franklin John Adams Edward Rutledge and doctor Franklin were afterwards appointed to wait upon Lord Howe and learn the extent of his powers These were found to be confined to the liberty of granting pardons on submission The Americans at that time would not thank the king for a thousand pardons and the interview terminated without effecting any thing towards a reconciliation eight doctor Franklin was an earnest advocate for the entire separation of the colonies from Great Britain and his writings upon the subject had great influence on the public mind In seventeen seventy six he was president of a convention which assembled for the purpose of establishing a new form of government for the state of Pennsylvania In the latter part of this year he was appointed to assist mister Silas Deane in managing the affairs of the colonies at the court of France nine No one could have rendered more service to the United States in this situation than doctor Franklin His character was much honored in France and as a philosopher he was held in very high esteem He was received with respect by all the celebrated literary men of the day and this respect naturally extended itself to all classes His political negotiations were of the greatest importance to his native country ten When the independence of the United States was acknowledged by Great Britain Franklin became desirous of returning home The infirmities of age and disease had fallen upon him and the situation of his country rendered his services no longer indispensably necessary He applied to congress to be recalled and mister Jefferson was appointed to succeed him in seventeen eighty five In September of the same year Franklin arrived in Philadelphia He was shortly after chosen a member of the supreme council for the city and was soon elected president of the same body eleven For the next three years Franklin still devoted himself to public business and to his political and philosophical studies He retained his desire of being useful to the last of his life In seventeen eighty eight his increasing infirmities compelled him to retire from public office His complaints continued and he suffered very severely from his sickness He still however remained good natured and cheerful was perfectly resigned to his situation acknowledging the justice and kindness of that Being who had seen fit that he should be thus afflicted twelve On the seventeenth of April seventeen ninety about eleven o clock at night doctor Franklin quietly expired He had reached an honored and a happy old age From small beginnings by a uniform course of prudence and honesty he had raised himself to high station wealth and distinction thirteen In considering the character of Franklin we perceive that the most marked trait was his habit of economy By economy we do not mean merely care in gaining and keeping of his money We mean care of time of labor frugality industry system method in all his business To this we may add economy of his health avoiding all excess and unnecessary exposure fourteen His cheerfulness and good nature were also remarkable He was ever happy and entertaining His anecdotes and jests were always to the point and his manner of conversing and writing was at once pleasing and effective fifteen For his public services his country owes him her respect and gratitude while his philosophical discoveries have excited the admiration of the world His name will live with the names of the few great men who have conferred enduring benefits on mankind The following epitaph on himself was written by him many years previous to his death The Body of BENJAMIN FRANKLIN Printer like the cover of an old book its contents torn out and stript of its lettering and gilding lies here food for worms yet the work itself shall not be lost for it will as he believed appear once more in a new and more beautiful edition corrected and amended by THE AUTHOR one How

fourteen What other traits were conspicuous ESSAYS OF doctor FRANKLIN We are acquainted with no writer who inculcates lessons of practical wisdom in a more agreeable and popular manner than doctor Franklin His writings abound with infinite good sense and a singular shrewdness not at all inconsistent with the highest integrity and purity We have selected a few of his lighter essays as a sequel to the Biography desirable both as displaying somewhat of the character of their author and conveying common sense maxims likely to be of much service to the young THE WHISTLE A True Story Written to his Nephew When I was a child at seven years old my friends on a holyday filled my pockets with coppers I went directly to a shop where they sold toys for children and being charmed with the sound of a whistle that I met by the way in the hands of another boy I voluntarily offered him all my money for one I then came home and went whistling all over the house much pleased with my whistle but disturbing all the family My brothers and sisters and cousins understanding the bargain I had made told me I had given four times as much for it as it was worth This put me in mind what good things I might have bought with the rest of the money and they laughed at me so much for my folly that I cried with vexation and the reflection gave me more chagrin than the whistle gave me pleasure This however was afterwards of use to me the impression continuing on my mind so that often when I was tempted to buy some unnecessary thing I said to myself Don t give too much for the whistle and so I saved my money As I grew up came into the world and observed the actions of men I thought I met with many very many who gave too much for their whistle When I saw any one too ambitious of court favor sacrificing his time in attendance on levees his repose his liberty his virtue and perhaps his friends to attain it I have said to myself This man gives too much for his whistle When I saw another fond of popularity constantly employing himself in political bustles neglecting his own affairs and ruining them by that neglect He pays indeed says I too much for his whistle If I knew a miser who gave up every kind of comfortable living all the pleasure of doing good to others all the esteem of his fellow citizens and the joys of benevolent friendship for the sake of accumulating wealth Poor man says I you do indeed pay too much for your whistle When I meet a man of pleasure sacrificing every laudable improvement of the mind or of his fortune to mere corporeal sensations Mistaken man says I you are providing pain for yourself instead of pleasure you give too much for your whistle If I see one fond of fine clothes fine furniture fine equipages all above his fortune for which he contracts debts and ends his career in prison Alas says I he has paid dear very dear for his whistle When I see a beautiful sweet tempered girl married to an ill natured brute of a husband What a pity it is says I that she has paid so much for a whistle In short I conceived that great part of the miseries of mankind were brought upon them by the false estimates they had made of the value of things and by their giving too much for their whistles HANDSOME AND DEFORMED LEG There are two sorts of people in the world who with equal degrees of health and wealth and the other comforts of life become the one happy and the other miserable This arises very much from the different views in which they consider things persons and events and the effect of those different views upon their own minds In whatever situation men can be placed they may find conveniences and inconveniences in whatever company they may find persons and conversation more or less pleasing at whatever table they may meet with meats and drinks of better and worse taste dishes better and worse dressed in whatever climate they will find good and bad weather under whatever government they may find good and bad laws and good and bad administration of those laws in whatever poem or work of genius they may see faults and beauties in almost every face and every person they may discover fine features and defects good and bad qualities Under these circumstances the two sorts of people above mentioned fix their attention those who are disposed to be happy on the conveniences of things the pleasant parts of conversation the well dressed dishes the goodness of the wines the fine weather c and enjoy all with cheerfulness Those who are to be unhappy think and speak only of the contrarieties Hence they are continually discontented themselves and by their remarks sour the pleasures of society offend personally many people and make themselves every where disagreeable If this turn of mind was founded in nature such unhappy persons would be the more to be pitied But as the disposition to criticise and to be disgusted is perhaps taken up originally by imitation and is unawares grown into a habit which though at present strong may nevertheless be cured when those who have it are convinced of its bad effect on their felicity I hope this little admonition may be of service to them and put them on changing a habit which though in the exercise it is chiefly an act of imagination yet has serious consequences in life as it brings on real griefs and misfortunes For as many are offended by and nobody loves this sort of people no one shows them more than the most common civility and respect and scarcely that and this frequently puts them out of humor and draws them into disputes and contentions If they aim at obtaining some advantage in rank or fortune nobody wishes them success or will stir a step or speak a word to favor their pretensions If they incur public censure or disgrace no one will defend or excuse and many join to aggravate their misconduct and render them completely odious If these people will not change this bad habit and condescend to be pleased with what is pleasing without fretting themselves or others about the contrarieties it is good for others to avoid an acquaintance with them which is always disagreeable and sometimes very inconvenient especially when one finds one s self entangled in their quarrels An old philosophical friend of mine was grown from experience very cautious in this particular and carefully avoided any intimacy with such people He had like other philosophers a thermometer to show him the heat of the weather and a barometer to mark when it was likely to prove good or bad but there being no instrument invented to discover at first sight this unpleasing disposition in a person he for that purpose made use of his legs one of which was remarkably handsome the other by some accident crooked and deformed If a stranger at first interview regarded his ugly leg more than his handsome one he doubted him If he spoke of it and took no notice of the handsome leg that was sufficient to determine my philosopher to have no further acquaintance with him Every body has not this two legged instrument but every one with a little attention may observe signs of that carping fault finding disposition and take the same resolution of avoiding the acquaintance of those infected with it I therefore advise those critical querulous discontented unhappy people if they wish to be respected and beloved by others and happy in themselves they should leave off looking at the ugly leg ADVICE TO A YOUNG TRADESMAN Written Anno seventeen forty eight TO MY FRIEND A B As you have desired it of me I write the following hints which have been of service to me and may if observed be so to you Remember that time is money He that can earn ten shillings a day by his labor and goes abroad or sits idle one half of that day though he spends but six pence during his diversion or idleness ought not to reckon that the only expense he has really spent or rather thrown away five shillings besides Remember that credit is money If a man lets his money lie in my hands after it is due he gives me the interest or so much as I can make of it during that time This amounts to a considerable sum where a man has good and large credit and makes good use of it Remember that money is of a prolific generating nature Money can beget money and its offspring can beget more and so on Five shillings turned is six turned again is seven and three pence and so on till it becomes a hundred pounds The more there is of it the more it produces every turning so that the profits rise quicker and quicker He that kills a breeding sow destroys all her offspring to the thousandth generation He that murders a crown destroys all that it might have produced even scores of pounds Remember that six pounds a year is but a groat a day For this little sum which may be daily wasted either in time or expense unperceived a man of credit may on his own security have the constant possession and use of a hundred pounds So much in stock briskly turned by an industrious man produces great advantage Remember this saying The good paymaster is lord of another man s purse He that is known to pay punctually and exactly to the time he promises may at any time and on any occasion raise all the money his friends can spare This is sometimes of great use After industry and frugality nothing contributes more to the raising of a young man in the world than punctuality and justice in all his dealings therefore never keep borrowed money an hour beyond the time you promised lest a disappointment shut up your friend s purse for ever The most trifling actions that affect a man s credit are to be regarded The sound of your hammer at five in the morning or nine at night heard by a creditor makes him easy six months longer but if he sees you at a billiard table or hears your voice at a tavern when you should be at work he sends for his money the next day demands it before he can receive it in a lump It shows besides that you are mindful of what you owe it makes you appear a careful as well as an honest man and that still increases your credit Beware of thinking all your own that you possess and of living accordingly It is a mistake that many people who have credit fall into To prevent this keep an exact account for some time both of your expenses and your income If you take the pains at first to mention particulars it will have this good effect you will discover how wonderfully small trifling expenses mount up to large sums and will discern what might have been and may for the future be saved without occasioning any great inconvenience In short the way to wealth if you desire it is as plain as the way to market It depends chiefly on two words industry and frugality that is waste neither time nor money but make the best use of both Without industry and frugality nothing will do and with them every thing He that gets all he can honestly and saves all he gets necessary expenses excepted will certainly become rich if that Being who governs the world to whom all should look for a blessing on their honest endeavors doth not in his wise providence otherwise determine AN OLD TRADESMAN NECESSARY HINTS TO THOSE THAT WOULD BE RICH Written Anno seventeen eighty six The use of money is all the advantage there is in having money For six pounds a year you may have the use of one hundred pounds provided you are a man of known prudence and honesty He that spends a groat a day idly spends idly above six pounds a year which is the price for the use of one hundred pounds He that wastes idly a groat s worth of his time per day one day with another wastes the privilege of using one hundred pounds each year He that idly loses five shillings worth of time loses five shillings and might as prudently throw five shillings into the sea He that loses five shillings not only loses that sum but all the advantages that might be made by turning it in dealing which by the time that a young man becomes old will amount to a considerable sum of money Again he that sells upon credit asks a price for what he sells equivalent to the principal and interest of his money for the time he is to be kept out of it therefore he that buys upon credit pays interest for what he buys and he that pays ready money might let that money out to use so that he that possesses any thing he has bought pays interest for the use of it Yet in buying goods it is best to pay ready money because he that sells upon credit expects to lose five per cent by bad debts therefore he charges on all he sells upon credit an advance that shall make up that deficiency Those who pay for what they buy upon credit pay their share of this advance He that pays ready money escapes or may escape that charge A penny saved is twopence clear A pin a day s a groat a year

two Translator of doctor Franklin s works into French I am apprehensive that I shall not be able to find leisure for making all the disquisitions and experiments which would be desirable on this subject I must therefore content myself with a few remarks The specific gravity of some human bodies in comparison to that of water has been examined by M Robinson in our Philosophical Transactions volume fifty page thirty for the year seventeen fifty seven He asserts that fat persons with small bones float most easily upon water The diving bell is accurately described in our Transactions When I was a boy I made two oval pallets each about ten inches long and six broad with a hole for the thumb in order to retain it fast in the palm of my hand They much resembled a painter s pallets In swimming I pushed the edges of these forward and I struck the water with their flat surfaces as I drew them back I remember I swam faster by means of these pallets but they fatigued my wrists I also fitted to the soles of my feet a kind of sandals but I was not satisfied with them because I observed that the stroke is partly given by the inside of the feet and the ankles and not entirely with the soles of the feet We have here waistcoats for swimming which are made of double sail cloth with small pieces of cork quilted in between them I know by experience that it is a great comfort to a swimmer who has a considerable distance to go to turn himself sometimes on his back and to vary in other respects the means of procuring a progressive motion When he is seized with the cramp in the leg the method of driving it away is to give to the parts affected a sudden vigorous and violent shock which he may do in the air as he swims on his back During the great heats of summer there is no danger in bathing however warm we may be in rivers which have been thoroughly warmed by the sun But to throw one s self into cold spring water when the body has been heated by exercise in the sun is an imprudence which may prove fatal I once knew an instance of four young men who having worked at harvest in the heat of the day with a view of refreshing themselves plunged into a spring of cold water two died upon the spot a third the next morning and the fourth recovered with great difficulty A copious draught of cold water in similar circumstances is frequently attended with the same effect in North America The exercise of swimming is one of the most healthy and agreeable in the world After having swam for an hour or two in the evening one sleeps coolly the whole night even during the most ardent heat of summer Perhaps the pores being cleansed the insensible perspiration increases and occasions this coolness It is certain that much swimming is the means of stopping a diarrhoea and even of producing a constipation With respect to those who do not know how to swim or who are affected with a diarrhoea at a season which does not permit them to use that exercise a warm bath by cleansing and purifying the skin is found very salutary and often effects a radical cure I speak from my own experience frequently repeated and that of others to whom I have recommended this You will not be displeased if I conclude these hasty remarks by informing you that as the ordinary method of swimming is reduced to the act of rowing with the arms and legs and is consequently a laborious and fatiguing operation when the space of water to be crossed is considerable there is a method in which a swimmer may pass to great distances with much facility by means of a sail This discovery I fortunately made by accident and in the following manner When I was a boy I amused myself one day with flying a paper kite and approaching the back of a pond which was near a mile broad I tied the string to a stake and the kite ascended to a very considerable height above the pond while I was swimming In a little time being desirous of amusing myself with my kite and enjoying at the same time the pleasure of swimming I returned and loosing from the stake the string with the little stick which was fastened to it went again into the water where I found that lying on my back and holding the stick in my hands I was drawn along the surface of the water in a very agreeable manner Having then engaged another boy to carry my clothes round the pond to a place which I pointed out to him on the other side I began to cross the pond with my kite which carried me quite over without the least fatigue and with the greatest pleasure imaginable I was only obliged occasionally to halt a little in my course and resist its progress when it appeared that by following too quick I lowered the kite too much by doing which occasionally I made it rise again I have never since that time practised this singular mode of swimming though I think it not impossible to cross in this manner from Dover to Calais The packet boat however is still preferable PRELIMINARY ADDRESS TO THE PENNSYLVANIA ALMANAC ENTITLED POOR RICHARD S ALMANAC FOR THE YEAR seventeen fifty eight I have heard that nothing gives an author so great pleasure as to find his works respectfully quoted by other learned authors This pleasure I have seldom enjoyed for though I have been if I may say it without vanity an eminent author of almanacs annually now a full quarter of a century my brother authors in the same way for what reason I know not have ever been very sparing in their applauses and no other author has taken the least notice of me so that did not my writings produce me some solid pudding the great deficiency of praise would have quite discouraged me I concluded at length that the people were the best judges of my merit for they buy my works and besides in my rambles where I am not personally known I have frequently heard one or other of my adages repeated with as poor Richard says at the end on t This gave me some satisfaction as it showed not only that my instructions were regarded but discovered likewise some respect for my authority and I own that to encourage the practice of remembering and repeating those wise sentences I have sometimes quoted myself with great gravity Judge then how much I have been gratified by an incident which I am going to relate to you I stopped my horse lately where a great number of people were collected at an auction of merchants goods The hour of sale not being come they were conversing on the badness of the times and one of the company called to a plain clean old man with white locks Pray father Abraham what think ye of the times Won t these heavy taxes quite ruin the country How shall we ever be able to pay them What would you advise us to Father Abraham stood up and replied If you have my advice I ll give it to you in short for a word to the wise is enough and many words won t fill a bushel as poor Richard says They joined in desiring him to speak his mind and gathering round him he proceeded as follows Friends says he and neighbors the taxes are indeed very heavy and if those laid on by the government were the only ones we had to pay we might more easily discharge them but we have many others and much more grievous to some of us We are taxed twice as much by our idleness three times as much by our pride and four times as much by our folly and from these taxes the commissioners cannot ease or deliver us by allowing an abatement However let us hearken to good advice and something may be done for us God helps them that help themselves as poor Richard says in his Almanac It would be thought a hard government that should tax its people one tenth part of their time to be employed in its service but idleness taxes many of us much more if we reckon all that is spent in absolute sloth or doing of nothing with that which is spent in idle employments or amusements that amount to nothing Sloth by bringing on diseases absolutely shortens life Sloth like rust consumes faster than labor wears while the key often used is always bright as poor Richard says But dost thou love life then do not squander time for that s the stuff life is made of as poor Richard says How much more than is necessary do we spend in sleep forgetting that the sleeping fox catches no poultry and that there will be sleeping enough in the grave as poor Richard says If time be of all things the most precious wasting time must be as poor Richard says the greatest prodigality since as he elsewhere tells us Lost time is never found again and what we call time enough always proves little enough Let us then up and be doing and doing to the purpose so by diligence shall we do more with less perplexity Sloth makes all things difficult but industry all easy as poor Richard says and He that riseth late must trot all day and shall scarce overtake his business at night while laziness travels so slowly that poverty soon overtakes him as we read in poor Richard who adds Drive thy business let not that drive thee and Early to bed and early to rise Makes a man healthy wealthy and wise So what signifies wishing and hoping for better times We make these times better if we bestir ourselves Industry needs not wish as poor Richard says He that lives upon hope will die fasting There are no gains without pains then help hands for I have no lands or if I have they are smartly taxed and as poor Richard likewise observes He that hath a trade hath an estate and he that hath a calling hath an office of profit and honor but then the trade must be worked at and the calling well followed or neither the estate nor the office will enable us to pay our taxes If we are industrious we shall never starve for as poor Richard says At the working man s house hunger looks in but dares not enter Nor will the bailiff or the constable enter for Industry pays debts but despair increaseth them says poor Richard What though you have found no treasure nor has any rich relation left you a legacy Diligence is the mother of good luck as poor Richard says and God gives all things to industry then plough deep while sluggards sleep and you will have corn to sell and to keep says poor Dick Work while it is called to day for you know not how much you may be hindered to morrow which makes poor Richard say One to day is worth two to morrows and further Have you somewhat to do to morrow do it to day If you were a servant would you not be ashamed that a good master should catch you idle Are you then your own master be ashamed to catch yourself idle as poor Dick says When there is so much to be done for yourself your family and your gracious king be up by peep of day Let not the sun look down and say Inglorious here he lies Handle your tools without mittens remember that the cat in gloves catches no mice as poor Richard says It is true there is much to be done and perhaps you are weak handed but stick to it steadily and you will see great effects for continual dropping wears away stones and by diligence and patience the mouse ate into the cable and light strokes fell great oaks as poor Richard says in his Almanac the year I cannot just now remember Methinks I hear some of you say Must a man afford himself no leisure I will tell thee my friend what poor Richard says Employ thy time well if thou meanest to gain leisure and since thou art not sure of a minute throw not away an hour Leisure is time for doing something useful this leisure the diligent man will obtain but the lazy man never so that as poor Richard says A life of leisure and a life of laziness are two things Do you imagine that sloth will afford you more comfort than labor No for as poor Richard says Troubles spring from idleness and grievous toils from needless ease many without labor would live by their own wits only but they break for want of stock Whereas industry gives comfort and plenty and respect Fly pleasures and they ll follow you the diligent spinner has a large shift and now I have a sheep and a cow every body bids me good morrow all which is well said by poor Richard But with our industry we must likewise be steady and settled and careful and oversee our own affairs with our own eyes and not trust too much to others for as poor Richard says I never saw an oft removed tree Nor yet an oft removed family That throve so well as one that settled be And again Three removes are as bad as a fire and again Keep thy shop and thy shop will keep thee and again If you would have your business done go if not send And again He that by the plough would thrive Himself must either hold or drive And again The eye of the master will do more work than both his hands and again Want of care does us more damage than want of knowledge and again Not to oversee workmen is to leave them your purse open Trusting too much to others care is the ruin of many for as the Almanac says In the affairs of the world men are saved not by faith but by the want of it but a man s own care is profitable for saith poor Dick Learning is to the studious and riches to the careful as well as power to the bold and heaven to the virtuous And further If you would have a faithful servant and one that you like serve yourself And again he adviseth to circumspection and care even in the smallest matters because sometimes A little neglect may breed great mischief adding For want of a nail the shoe was lost for want of a shoe the horse was lost and for want of a horse the rider was lost being overtaken and slain by the enemy all for want of care about a horse shoe nail So much for industry my friends and attention to one s own business but to these we must add frugality if we would make our industry more certainly successful A man may if he knows not how to save as he gets keep his nose all his life to the grindstone and die not worth a groat at last A fat kitchen makes a lean will as poor Richard says and Many estates are spent in the getting Since women for tea forsook spinning and knitting And men for punch forsook hewing and splitting If you would be wealthy says he in another Almanac think of saving as well as of getting the Indies have not made Spain rich because her outgoes are greater than her incomes Away then with your expensive follies and you will not have much cause to complain of hard times heavy taxes and chargeable families for as poor Dick says Women and wine game and deceit Make the wealth small and the want great And further What maintains one vice would bring up two children You may think perhaps that a little tea or a little punch now and then diet a little more costly clothes a little finer and a little entertainment now and then can be no great matter but remember what poor Richard says Many a little makes a mickle and further Beware of little expenses a small leak will sink a great ship and again Who dainties love shall beggars prove and moreover Fools make feasts and wise men eat them Here you are all got together at this sale of fineries and nick nacks You call them goods but if you do not take care they will prove evils to some of you You expect they will be sold cheap and perhaps they may for less than they cost but if you have no occasion for them they must be dear to you Remember what poor Richard says Buy what thou hast no need of and ere long thou shalt sell thy necessaries And again At a great pennyworth pause awhile He means that perhaps the cheapness is apparent only or not real or the bargain by straitening thee in thy business may do thee more harm than good For in another place he says Many have been ruined by buying good pennyworths Again as poor Richard says It is foolish to lay out money in a purchase of repentance and yet this folly is practised every day at auctions for want of minding the Almanac Wise men as poor Dick says learn by others harms fools scarcely by their own but Felix quem faciunt aliena pericula cautum Many a one for the sake of finery on the back have gone with a hungry belly and half starved their families Silk and satins scarlet and velvets as poor Richard says put out the kitchen fire These are not the necessaries of life they can scarcely be called the conveniences and yet only because they look pretty how many want to have them The artificial wants of mankind thus become more numerous than the natural and as poor Dick says For one poor person there are a hundred indigent By these and other extravagances the genteel are reduced to poverty and forced to borrow of those whom they formerly despised but who through industry and frugality have maintained their standing in which case it appears plainly A ploughman on his legs is higher than a gentleman on his knees as poor Richard says Perhaps they have had a small estate left them which they knew not the getting of they think It is day and will never be night that a little to be spent out of so much is not worth minding A child and a fool as poor Richard says imagine twenty shillings and twenty years can never be spent but always be taking out of the meal tub and never putting in soon comes to the bottom then as poor Dick says When the well is dry they know the worth of water But this they might have known before if they had taken his advice if you would know the value of money go and try to borrow some for he that goes a borrowing goes a sorrowing and indeed so does he that lends to such people when he goes to get it in again Poor Dick further advises and says Fond pride of dress is sure a very curse Ere fancy you consult consult your purse And again Pride is as loud a beggar as Want and a great deal more saucy When you have bought one fine thing you must buy ten more that your appearance may be all of a piece but poor Dick says It is easier to suppress the first desire than to satisfy all that follow it And it is as truly folly for the poor to ape the rich as the frog to swell in order to equal the ox Vessels large may venture more But little boats should keep near shore Tis however a folly soon punished for Pride that dines on vanity sups on contempt as poor Richard says And in another place Pride breakfasted with Plenty dined with Poverty and supped with Infamy And after all of what use is this pride of appearance for which so much is risked so much is suffered It cannot promote health or ease pain it makes no increase of merit in the person it hastens misfortune What is a butterfly At best He s but a caterpillar drest The gaudy fop s his picture just as poor Richard says But what madness must it be to run in debt for these superfluities We are offered by the terms of this sale six months credit and that perhaps has induced some of us to attend it because we cannot spare the ready money and hope now to be fine without it But ah think what you do when you run in debt You give to another power over your liberty If you cannot pay at the time you will be ashamed to see your creditor you will be in fear when you speak to him you will make poor pitiful sneaking excuses and by degrees come to lose your veracity and sink into base downright lying for as poor Richard says The second vice is lying the first is running in debt And again to the same purpose Lying rides upon debt s back whereas a free born Englishman ought not to be ashamed nor afraid to speak to any man living But poverty often deprives a man of all spirit and virtue It is hard for an empty bag to stand upright as poor Richard truly says What would you think of that prince or that government who would issue an edict forbidding you to dress like a gentleman or gentlewoman on pain of imprisonment or servitude Would you not say that you were free have a right to dress as you please and that such an edict would be a breach of your privileges and such a government tyrannical And yet you are about to put yourself under that tyranny when you run in debt for such dress Your creditor has authority at his pleasure to deprive you of your liberty by confining you in jail for life or by selling you for a servant if you should not be able to pay him When you have got your bargain you may perhaps think little of payment but Creditors poor Richard tells us have better memories than debtors and in another place he says Creditors are a superstitious sect great observers of set days and times The day comes round before you are aware and the demand is made before you are prepared to satisfy it or if you bear your debt in mind the term which at first seemed so long will as it lessens appear extremely short Time will seem to have added wings to his heels as well as at his shoulders Those have a short Lent saith poor Richard who owe money to be paid at Easter Then since as he says The borrower is a slave to the lender and the debtor to the creditor disdain the chain preserve your freedom and maintain your independency be industrious and free be frugal and free At present perhaps you may think yourselves in thriving circumstances and that you can bear a little extravagance without injury but For age and want save while you may No morning sun lasts a whole day as poor Richard says Gain may be temporary and uncertain but ever while you live expense is constant and certain and It is easier to build two chimneys than to keep one in fuel as poor Richard says So Rather go to bed supperless than rise in debt Get what you can and what you get hold Tis the stone that will turn all your lead into gold as poor Richard says And when you have got the philosopher s stone sure you will no longer complain of bad times or the difficulty of paying taxes This doctrine my friends is reason and wisdom but after all do not depend too much upon your own industry and frugality and prudence though excellent things for they may be blasted without the blessing of Heaven and therefore ask that blessing humbly and be not uncharitable to those that at present seem to want it but comfort and help them Remember Job suffered and was afterwards prosperous And now to conclude Experience keeps a dear school but fools will learn in no other and scarce in that for it is true we may give advice but we cannot give conduct as poor Richard says However remember this They that will not be counseled cannot be helped as poor Richard says and further that If you will not hear Reason she will surely rap your knuckles Thus the old gentleman ended his harangue The people heard it and approved the doctrine and immediately practised the contrary just as if it had been a common sermon for the auction opened and they began to buy extravagantly notwithstanding all his cautions and their own fear of taxes I found the good man had thoroughly studied my Almanacs and digested all I had dropped on those topics during the course of twenty five years The frequent mention he made of me must have tired every one else but my vanity was wonderfully delighted with it though I was conscious that not a tenth part of the wisdom was my own which he ascribed to me but rather the gleanings that I had made of the sense of all ages and nations However I resolved to be the better for the echo of it and though I had at first determined to buy stuff for a new coat I went away resolved to wear my old one a little longer Reader if thou wilt do the same thy profit will be as great as mine I am as ever thine to serve thee RICHARD SAUNDERS OBSERVATIONS ON WAR By the original laws of nations war and extirpation were the punishment of injury Humanizing by degrees it admitted slavery instead of death a further step was the exchange of prisoners instead of slavery another to respect more the property of private persons under conquest and be content with acquired dominion Why should not this law of nations go on improving Ages have intervened between its several steps but as knowledge of late increases rapidly why should not those steps be quickened Why should it not be agreed to as the future law of nations that in any war hereafter the following description of men should be undisturbed have the protection of both sides and be permitted to follow their employments in security viz one Cultivators of the earth because they labor for the subsistence of mankind two Fishermen for the same reason three Merchants and traders in unarmed ships who accommodate different nations by communicating and exchanging the necessaries and conveniences of life four Artists and mechanics inhabiting and working in open towns It is hardly necessary to add that the hospitals of enemies should be unmolested they ought to be assisted It is for the interest of humanity in general that the occasions of war and the inducements to it should be diminished If rapine be abolished one of the encouragements to war is taken away and peace therefore more likely to continue and be lasting The practice of robbing merchants on the high seas a remnant of the ancient piracy though it may be accidentally beneficial to particular persons is far from being profitable to all engaged in it or to the nation that authorizes it In the beginning of a war some rich ships are surprised and taken This encourages the first adventurers to fit out more armed vessels and many others to do the same But the enemy at the same time become more careful arm their merchant ships better and render them not so easy to be taken they go also more under the protection of convoys Thus while the privateers to take them are multiplied the vessels subjected to be taken and the chances of profit are diminished so that many cruises are made wherein the expenses overgo the gains and as is the case in other lotteries though particulars have got prizes the mass of adventurers are losers the whole expense of fitting out all the privateers during a war being much greater than the whole amount of goods taken Then there is the national loss of all the labor of so many men during the time they have been employed in robbing who besides spend what they get in riot drunkenness and debauchery lose their habits of industry are rarely fit for any sober business after a peace and serve only to increase the number of highwaymen and house breakers Even the undertakers who have been fortunate are by sudden wealth led into expensive living the habit of which continues when the means of supporting it cease and finally ruins them a just punishment for their having wantonly and unfeelingly ruined many honest innocent traders and their families whose substance was employed in serving the common interests of mankind THE WAY TO MAKE MONEY PLENTY IN EVERY MAN S POCKET At this time when the general complaint is that money is scarce it will be an act of kindness to inform the moneyless how they may reinforce their pockets I will acquaint them with the true secret of money catching the certain way to fill empty purses and how to keep them always full Two simple rules well observed will do the business First Let honesty and industry be thy constant companions and Secondly Spend one penny less than thy clear gains Then shall thy hide bound pocket soon begin to thrive and will never again cry with the empty belly ache neither will creditors insult thee nor want oppress nor hunger bite nor nakedness freeze thee The whole hemisphere will shine brighter and pleasure spring up in every corner of thy heart Now therefore embrace these rules and be happy Banish the bleak winds of sorrow from thy mind and live independent Then shalt thou be a man and not hide thy face at the approach of the rich nor suffer the pain of feeling little when the sons of fortune walk at thy right hand for independency whether with little or much is good fortune and placeth thee on even ground with the proudest of the golden fleece Oh then be wise and let industry walk with thee in the morning and attend thee until thou reachest the evening hour for rest Let honesty be as the breath of thy soul and never forget to have a penny when all thy expenses are enumerated and paid then shalt thou reach the point of happiness and independence shall be thy shield and buckler thy helmet and crown then shall thy soul walk upright nor stoop to the silken wretch because he hath riches nor pocket an abuse because the hand which offers it wears a ring set with diamonds MORALS OF CHESS Playing at chess is the most ancient and universal game known among men for its original is beyond the memory of history and it has for numberless ages been the amusement of all the civilized nations of Asia the Persians the Indians and the Chinese Europe has had it above a thousand years the Spaniards have spread it over their parts of America and it begins to make its appearance in these States It is so interesting in itself as not to need the view of gain to induce engaging in it and thence it is never played for money Those therefore who have leisure for such diversions cannot find one that is more innocent and the following piece written with a view to correct among a few young friends some little improprieties in the practice of it shows at the same time that it may in its effects on the mind be not merely innocent but advantageous to the vanquished as well as the victor The game of chess is not merely an idle amusement Several very valuable qualities of the mind useful in the course of human life are to be acquired or strengthened by it so as to become habits ready on all occasions For life is a kind of chess in which we have points to gain and competitors or adversaries to contend with and in which there is a vast variety of good and ill events that are in some degree the effects of prudence or the want of it By playing at chess then we learn I Foresight which looks a little into futurity considers the consequences that may attend an action for it is continually occurring to the player If I move this piece what will be the advantage of my new situation What use can my adversary make of it to annoy me What other moves can I make to support it and to defend myself from his attacks II Circumspection which surveys the whole chessboard or scene of action the relations of the several pieces and situation the dangers they are respectively exposed to the several possibilities of their aiding each other the probabilities that the adversary may take this or that move and attack this or the other piece and what different means can be used to avoid his stroke or turn its consequences against him III Caution not to make your moves too hastily This habit is best acquired by observing strictly the laws of the game such as If you touch a piece you must move it somewhere if you set it down you must let it stand and it is therefore best that these rules should be observed as the game thereby becomes more the image of human life and particularly of war in which if you have incautiously put yourself into a bad and dangerous position you cannot obtain your enemy s leave to withdraw your troops and place them more securely but you must abide all the consequences of your rashness And lastly we learn by chess the habit of not being discouraged by present bad appearances in the state of our affairs the habit of hoping for a favorable change and that of persevering in the search of resources The game is so full of events there is such a variety of turns in it the fortune of it is so subject to sudden vicissitudes and one so frequently after long contemplation discovers the means of extricating one s self from a supposed insurmountable difficulty that one is encouraged to continue the contest to the last in hope of victory by our own skill or at least of giving a stale mate by the negligence of our adversary And whoever considers what in chess he often sees instances of that particular pieces of success are apt to produce presumption and its consequent inattention by which the loss may be recovered will learn not to be too much discouraged by the present success of his adversary nor to despair of final good fortune upon every little check he receives in the pursuit of it That we may therefore be induced more frequently to choose this beneficial amusement in preference to others which are not attended with the same advantages every circumstance which may increase the pleasure of it should be regarded and every action or word that is unfair disrespectful or that in any way may give uneasiness should be avoided as contrary to the immediate intention of both the players which is to pass the time agreeably Therefore first If it is agreed to play according to the strictest rules then those rules are to be exactly observed by both parties and should not be insisted on for one side while deviated from by the other for this is not equitable Secondly If it is agreed not to observe the rules exactly but one party demands indulgences he should then be as willing to allow them to the other Thirdly No false move should ever be made to extricate yourself out of a difficulty or to gain an advantage There can be no pleasure in playing with a person once detected in such unfair practices Fourthly If your adversary is long in playing you ought not to hurry him or to express any uneasiness at his delay You should not sing nor whistle nor look at your watch nor take up a book to read nor make a tapping with your feet on the floor or with your fingers on the table nor do any thing that may disturb his attention For all these things displease and they do not show your skill in playing but your craftiness or your rudeness Fifthly You ought not to endeavor to amuse and deceive your adversary by pretending to have made bad moves and saying that you have now lost the game in order to make him secure and careless and inattentive to your schemes for this is fraud and deceit not skill in the game Sixthly You must not when you have gained a victory use any triumphing or insulting expression nor show too much pleasure but endeavor to console your adversary and make him less dissatisfied with himself by every kind of civil expression that may be used with truth such as You understand the game better then I but you are a little inattentive or You play too fast or You had the best of the game but something happened to divert your thoughts and that turned it in my favor Seventhly If you are a spectator while others play observe the most perfect silence For if you give advice you offend both parties him against whom you give it because it may cause the loss of his game and him in whose favor you gave it because though it be good and he follows it he loses the pleasure he might have had if you had permitted him to think until it had occurred to himself Even after a move or moves you must not by replacing the pieces show how it might have been placed better for that displeases and may occasion disputes and doubts about their true situation All talking to the players lessens or diverts their attention and is therefore unpleasing Nor should you give the least hint to either party by any kind of noise or motion If you do you are unworthy to be a spectator If you have a mind to exercise or show your judgment do it in playing your own game when you have an opportunity not in criticising or meddling with or counseling the play of others Lastly If the game is not to be played rigorously according to the rules above mentioned then moderate your desire of victory over your adversary and be pleased with one over yourself Snatch not eagerly at every advantage offered by his unskilfulness or inattention but point out to him kindly that by such a move he places or leaves a piece in danger and unsupported that by another he will put his king in a perilous situation c By this generous civility so opposite to the unfairness above forbidden you may indeed happen to lose the game to your own opponent but you will win what is better his esteem his respect and his affection together with the silent approbation and good will of impartial spectators CONVERSATION OF A COMPANY OF EPHEMERAE WITH THE SOLILOQUY OF ONE ADVANCED IN AGE TO MADAME BRILLIANT You may remember my dear friend that when we lately spent that happy day in the delightful garden and sweet society of the Moulin Joly I stopped a little in one of our walks and staid some time behind the company We had been shown numberless skeletons of a kind of little fly called an ephemera whose successive generations we were told were bred and expired within the day I happened to see a living company of them on a leaf who appeared to be engaged in conversation You know I understand all the inferior animal tongues my too great application to the study of them is the best excuse I can give for the little progress I have made in your charming language I listened through curiosity to the discourse of these little creatures but as they in their national vivacity spoke three or four together I could make but little of their conversation I found however by some broken expressions that I heard now and then they were disputing warmly on the merit of two foreign musicians one a cousin the other a moscheto in which dispute they spent their time seeming as regardless of the shortness of their life as if they had been sure of living a month Happy people thought I you live certainly under a wise just and mild government since you have no public grievances to complain of nor any other subject of contention but the perfections or imperfections of foreign music I turned my head from them to an old gray headed one who was single on another leaf and talking to himself Being amused with his soliloquy I put it down in writing in hopes it will likewise amuse her to whom I am so much indebted for the most pleasing of all amusements her delicious company and heavenly harmony It was says he the opinion of learned philosophers of our race who lived and flourished long before my time that this vast world the Moulin Joly could not itself subsist more than eighteen hours and I think there was some foundation for that opinion since by the apparent motion of the great luminary that gives life to all nature and which in my time has evidently declined considerably towards the ocean at the end of the earth it must then finish its course be extinguished in the waters that surround us and leave the world in cold and darkness necessarily producing universal death and destruction I have lived seven of those hours a great age being no less than four hundred twenty minutes of time How very few of us continue so long I have seen generations born flourish and expire My present friends are children and grand children of the friends of my youth who are now alas no more And I must soon follow them for by the common course of nature though still in health I cannot expect to live above seven or eight minutes longer What now avails all my toil and labor in amassing the honey dew on this leaf which I cannot live to enjoy What my political struggles I have been engaged in for the good of my compatriot inhabitants of this bush or my philosophical studies for the benefit of our race in general for in politics what can laws do without morals our present race of ephemerae will in a course of minutes become corrupt like those of other and older bushes and consequently as wretched And in philosophy how small our progress Alas art is long and life is short My friends would comfort me with the idea of a name they say I shall leave behind me and they tell me I have lived long enough to nature and to glory But what will fame be to an ephemera who no longer exists and what will become of all history in the eighteenth hour when the world itself even the whole Moulin Joly shall come to its end and be buried in a universal ruin To me after all my eager pursuits no solid pleasures now remain but the reflection of a long life spent in meaning well the sensible conversation of a few good lady ephemerae and now and then a kind smile and a tune from the ever amiable Brilliant B FRANKLIN END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE LIFE OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN This file should be named thirty eight thousand four
