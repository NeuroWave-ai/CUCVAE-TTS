3816_290923_000018_000000	train-clean-360	To produce a good balance staff requires more skill than to produce any other turned portion of a watch and your success will depend not alone on your knowledge of its proper shape and measurements nor the tools at your command but rather upon your skill with the graver and your success in hardening and tempering 
3816_290923_000018_000001	train-clean-360	There are many points worthy of consideration in the making of a balance staff that are too often neglected 
3816_290923_000018_000002	train-clean-360	I have seen staffs that were models as regards execution and finish that were nearly worthless from a practical standpoint simply because the maker had devoted all his time and energy to the execution of a beautiful piece of lathe work and had given no thought or study to the form and size of the pivots 
none	none	On the other hand one often sees staffs whose pivots are faultless in shape but the execution and finish so bungling as to offset all the good qualities as regards shape 
3816_290923_000018_000004	train-clean-360	To have good tools and the right ideas is one thing and to use these tools properly and make a practical demonstration of your theory is another 
none	none	I shall endeavor to take up every point in connection with the balance staff from the steel to the jewels and their relation to the pivots and I believe this will then convey to the reader all the necessary points not only as regards staffs but pivots also whether applied to a balance or a pinion staff It may be argued and we often do hear material dealers advance the theory that to day with our interchangeable parts and the cheapness of all material it is a waste of time to make a balance staff 
3816_290923_000020_000001	train-clean-360	To the reader who takes this view of the situation I simply want to say kindly follow me to the end of this paragraph and if you are still of the same opinion then you are wasting your time in following me farther 
none	none	For a material dealer to advance this theory I can find some excuse he is an interested party and the selling of material is his bread and butter but the other fellow well I never could understand him and possibly never shall When we seriously consider the various styles and series in old model and new model of only one of the leading manufacturers of watches in this country to say nothing of the legion of small and large concerns who are manufacturing or have manufactured in the past and then think of carrying these staffs in stock all ready for use we then begin to realize how utterly absurd the idea is to say nothing of how expensive On the other hand if you reside in a large city and propose to rely on the stock of your material dealer you will find yourself in an embarrasing situation very often for as likely as not the movement requiring a new staff was made by a company that went out of business back in the eightys or it is a new movement the material for which has not yet been placed on the market 
3816_290923_000020_000005	train-clean-360	This state of affairs leads to makeshifts and they in turn lead to botch work 
3816_290923_000020_000006	train-clean-360	The watchmaker who does not possess the experience or necessary qualifications to make a new balance staff and make it in a neat and workmanlike manner is never certain of having exactly what is needed and cannot hope to long retain the confidence of his customers 
3816_290923_000020_000007	train-clean-360	In fact he is not a watchmaker at all but simply an apprentice or student even though he be working for a salary or be his own master 
3816_290923_000020_000008	train-clean-360	There are undoubtedly many worthy members of the trade who are not familiar with the making of a balance staff who will take exceptions to this statement but it is nevertheless true 
3816_290923_000020_000009	train-clean-360	They may be good workmen as far as they go they may be painstaking but they cannot be classed as watchmakers 
none	none	This article is intended for the benefit of that large class whose opportunities for obtaining instruction are limited and who are ready and willing to learn and for that still larger class of practical workmen who can make a new staff in a creditable manner but who are always glad to read others people s ideas on any subject connected with the trade and who are not yet too old to learn new tricks should they find any such Illustration Fig one 
3816_290923_000023_000000	train-clean-360	Good tools in good condition are the most essential requisites in making a new staff 
none	none	I would not advise any particular make of lathe as the most expensive lathe in the world will not produce a true staff if the workman cannot center his work accurately and does not know how to handle his graver while on the other hand fine work can be done on the simplest and cheapest lathe by a workman possessing the requisite skill I will take it for granted that you use an American made lathe of some kind or a foreign made lathe manufactured on American lines It is advisable though not absolutely necessary to have three gravers similar to those illustrated in Fig one A being used for turning the staff down in the rough B for the conical pivots and square shoulders and C for the under cutting The other tools and attachments needed will be described as I come to them in use 
3816_290923_000024_000000	train-clean-360	The balance staff should be made of the best steel tempered to such a degree as to give the longest service and yet not so hard as to endanger the breakage of the pivots 
none	none	Select a piece of Stubb s steel wire say No forty six or a little larger than the largest part of the finished staff is to be and center it in a split chuck of your lathe 
3816_290923_000024_000002	train-clean-360	Be careful in selecting your chuck that you pick one that fits the wire fairly close 
3816_290923_000024_000003	train-clean-360	The chuck holds the work truest that comes the nearest to fitting it 
3816_290923_000024_000004	train-clean-360	If you try to use a chuck that is too large or too small for the work you will only ruin the chuck for truth 
none	none	Turn the wire to the form of a rough staff as shown in Fig two leaving on a small part of the original wire as shown at A After the wire is roughed out to this general form remove from the chuck and get ready to harden and temper it 
3816_290923_000024_000006	train-clean-360	The hardening and tempering may be effected in various ways and I am scarcely prepared to say which method is the best as there are several which give about the same general results 
3816_290923_000024_000007	train-clean-360	One method of hardening is to smear the blank with common yellow soap heat it to a cherry red and drop endwise into linseed oil 
3816_290923_000024_000008	train-clean-360	Petroleum is preferred by some to linseed oil but to tell the truth I can see no difference in the action of linseed petroleum or olive oil 
none	none	Be sure and have enough oil to thoroughly cool the blank and a deep vessel such as a large mouthed vial is preferable to a saucer The blank will now be found too hard to work easily with the graver and we must therefore draw the temper down to that of fine spring steel Before doing this the blank should be brightened in order that we may see to just what color we are drawing it 
3816_290923_000024_000010	train-clean-360	The main object in using the soap in hardening is that it may form a scale upon the blank and if the heating is effected gradually the soap will melt and form a practically air tight case around the blank 
3816_290923_000024_000011	train-clean-360	This scale if the hardening is carefully and properly done will generally chip and fall off when the blank is plunged in the oil particularly if the oil is cool and if it does not fall off of its own accord it can easily be removed by rolling the blank upon the bench 
3816_290923_000024_000012	train-clean-360	If it does not come out clean or if soap is not used it may be brightened by again inserting in the lathe and bringing it in contact with a piece of fine emery paper or cloth 
none	none	Illustration Fig two I draw the temper in the following manner Place some fine brass filings in a boiling out cup or bluing pan and lay the blank upon these filings holding the pan over the flame of an alcohol lamp until the blank assumes a dark purple color which it will reach when the heat gets to about five hundred deg F This I consider the right hardness for a balance staff as it is not too hard to work well under the graver nor too soft for the pivots At this degree of hardness steel will assume an exquisite polish if properly treated Another method of tempering is to place the staff on a piece of sheet iron or copper say one inch wide by four long having previously bent it into a small angle for the reception of the staff as shown in Fig three 
3816_290923_000026_000003	train-clean-360	This piece of metal when nicely fitted into a file handle will answer all the purposes of the bluing pan and presents quite a neat appearance 
3816_290923_000026_000004	train-clean-360	Having placed the blank in the angle lay on it a piece of yellow wax about the size of a bean and heat it over your lamp until the wax takes fire and burns 
3816_290923_000026_000005	train-clean-360	Blow out the flame and allow the staff to cool and it will be found to be of about the right hardness 
none	none	Illustration Fig three 
3816_290923_000028_000000	train-clean-360	We have now arrived at an important station in staff making a junction we may term it where many lines branch off from the main road 
3816_290923_000028_000001	train-clean-360	At this particular spot is where authorities differ 
3816_290923_000028_000002	train-clean-360	I have no hesitation in saying that at this particular point the split chuck should be removed from the lathe head and carefully placed in the chuck box and the cement chuck put in its place 
3816_290923_000028_000003	train-clean-360	I believe that all of the remaining work upon a staff should be executed while it is held in a cement chuck 
none	none	On the other hand I have seen good workmen who turned and finished all the lower part of a staff while in a split chuck cut it off and turned and finished the upper part in a cement chuck 
3816_290923_000028_000005	train-clean-360	All I have got to say is that they had more confidence in the truth of their chucks than I have in mine 
3816_290923_000028_000006	train-clean-360	I have even read of watchmakers who made the entire staff in a split chuck but I must confess I am somewhat curious to examine a staff made in that way and must have the privilege of examining it before I will admit that a true staff can be so made 
3816_290923_000029_000000	train-clean-360	We will suppose that the workman has a moderately true chuck and that he prefers to turn and finish all the lower portions in this way 
3816_290923_000029_000001	train-clean-360	Of course the directions for using a cement chuck on the upper part of a staff are equally applicable to the lower 
none	none	Before going further I think it advisable to consider the requirements of a pivot but will reserve this for another chapter CHAPTER II The chief requirements of a pivot are that it shall be round and well polished Avoid the burnish file at all hazards it will not leave the pivot round for the pressure is unequal at various points in the revolution A pivot that was not perfectly round might act fairly well in a jewel hole that was round but unfortunately the greater proportion of jewel holes are not as they should be and we must therefore take every precaution to guard against untrue pivots Let us examine just what the effect will be if an imperfect pivot is fitted into an unround hole jewel and to demonstrate its action more clearly let us exaggerate the defects Suppose we pick a perfectly round jewel and insert into the opening a three cornered piece of steel wire in shape somewhat resembling the taper of a triangular file We find that this triangular piece of steel will turn in the jewel with the same ease that the most perfect cylindrical pivot will Now suppose we change the jewel for one that is out of round and repeat the experiment We now find that the triangular steel soon finds the hollow spots in the jewel hole and comes to a stand still as it is inserted in the hole The action of a pivot that is not true when in contact with a jewel whose hole is out of round is very similar though in a less marked degree If the pivot inclines toward the elliptical and the jewel hole has a like failing which is often the case it is very evident that this want of truth in both the pivot and hole is very detrimental to the good going of a watch Illustration Fig four Illustration Fig five There are two kinds of pivots known respectively as straight and conical pivots but for the balance staff there is but one kind and that is the conical which is illustrated in Fig four The conical pivot has at least one advantage over the straight one i e it can be made much smaller than a straight pivot as it is much stronger in proportion owing to its shape All pivots have a tendency to draw the oil away from the jewels and particularly the conically formed variety which develops a strong capillary attraction To prevent this capillary attraction of the oil the back slope is formed next to the shoulder although many persons seem to think that this back slope is merely added by way of ornament to make the pivot more graceful in appearance It is very essential however for if too much oil is applied the staff would certainly draw it away if its thickness were not reduced by means of the back slope Before leaving the subject of capillarity let us examine the enlarged jewel in Fig five c is an enlarged pivot b is the hole jewel and a is the end stone We observe that the hole jewel on the side towards the end stone is convex It is so made that through capillarity the oil is retained at the end of the pivot where it is most wanted It is in my opinion very necessary that the young watchmaker should have at least a fair understanding of capillarity and should understand why the end stone is made convex and the pivot with a back slope For this reason I will try and make clear this point before proceeding further We all know that it is essential to apply oil to all surfaces coming in contact in order to reduce the friction as much as possible and if the application of oil is necessary to any part of the mechanism of a watch that part is the pivot Saunier very aptly puts it thus A liquid is subject to the action of three forces gravity adhesion the mutual attraction between the liquid and the substance of the vessel containing it and cohesion the attractive force existing among the molecules of the liquid and opposing the subdivision of the mass We all know that if we place a small drop of oil upon a piece of flat glass or steel and then invert the same the oil will cling to the glass owing to the adhesion of the particles if we then add a little more to the drop and again invert it will still cling although the drop may be elongated to a certain degree This is owing to the cohesion of the molecules of the oil which refuse to be separated from one another If however we again add to the drop of oil and invert the plate the drop will elongate and finally part one portion dropping while the other portion clings to the main body of the liquid The fall of the drop is occasioned by gravity overcoming the cohesion of the molecules Now take a perfectly clean and polished needle and place a drop of oil upon its point and we will see that the oil very rapidly ascends towards the thicker portion of the needle Now if we heat and hammer out the point of the needle into the form of a small drill and repeat the operation we find that the oil no longer ascends It rises from the point to the extreme width of the drill portion but refuses to go beyond It clings to that portion of the needle which would correspond to the ridge just back of the slope in a conical pivot Water oil et cetera when placed in a clean wine glass do not exhibit a perfectly level surface but raise at the edges as shown at a in Fig six If a tube is now inserted we find that the liquid not only rises around the outside of the tube and the edges of the vessel but also rises in the tube far beyond its mean level as shown at b These various effects are caused by one of the forces above described i e the adhesion or mutual attraction existing between the liquid and the substance of the vessel and rod The word capillarity is of Latin derivation and signifies hair like slenderness The smaller the tube or the nearer the edges of a vessel are brought together the higher in proportion will the liquid rise above the level An ascent of a liquid due to capillarity also takes place where the liquid is placed between two separate bodies as oil placed between two pieces of flat glass If the plates are parallel to one another and perpendicular to the surface of the liquid it will ascend to the same height between the plates as shown at c in Fig six If the plates were united at the back like a book and spread somewhat at the front the oil would ascend the higher as the two sides approach one another as shown at d Fig six If a drop is placed somewhat away from the intersecting point of the glasses as shown at m it will if not too far away gradually work its way to the junction providing the glasses are level If however the glasses are inclined to a certain extent the drop will remain stationary since it is drawn in one direction by gravity and in the other by capillarity When a drop of oil is placed between two surfaces both of which are convex or one convex and the other plain as shown at g it will collect at the point n at which the surfaces nearest approach one another We now see very clearly why the hole jewel is made convex on the side towards the end stone and concave on the side towards the pivot Illustration Fig six Particular pains should be taken to polish those portions of the pivots which actually enter the jewel hole and to see that all marks of the graver be thoroughly removed because if any grooves no matter how small are left they act as minute capillary tubes to convey the oil If the hole jewel be of the proper shape the end stone not too far from the hole jewel and too much oil is not applied at one time the oil will not spread nor run down the staff but a small portion will be retained at the acting surface of pivot and jewel and this supply will be gradually fed to these parts from the reservoir between the jewel and end stone by the action of capillarity Having examined into the requirements of the pivot and its jewel and having gained an insight into what their forms should be we are the better able to perform that portion of the work in an intelligent manner CHAPTER III Our wire has been roughed out into the form of a staff has been hardened and the temper drawn down to the requisite hardness and we are now ready to proceed with our work As I said before we have now arrived at a point where many authorities differ i e as to whether the finishing of the staff proper should be performed while the work is held in the chuck or whether a wax chuck be substituted We will take it for granted that you have a true chuck and that you prefer to finish all the lower portion of the staff while held in the chuck Before we proceed with our work it will be necessary for us to make some accurate measurements as we cannot afford to do any guess work by measuring by means of the old staff I have used a number of different kinds of calipers and measuring instruments for determining the various measurements for a balance staff but have met with more success with a very simple little tool which I made myself from drawings and description published some years ago in THE AMERICAN JEWELER This simple little tool is shown in Fig seven and has been of great service to me It consists of a brass sleeve A with a projection at one end as shown at B This sleeve is threaded and into it is fitted the screw part C which terminates in a pivot D which is small enough to enter the smallest jewel The sleeve I made from a solid piece of brass turning it down in my lathe and finishing the projection by means of a file The hole was then drilled and threaded with a standard thread The screw part C I made of steel and polished carefully Illustration Fig seven To ascertain the proper height for the roller place it upon the tool allowing it to rest upon the leg B and set the pivot D in the foot jewel Now adjust by means of the screw C until the roller is in its proper position in relation to the lever fork This may be understood better by consulting Fig eight where A is the gauge C is the roller E is the lever F is the plate and G is the potance Illustration Fig eight Now in order to locate the proper place to cut the seat for the roller remove it from the foot of the gauge and apply the gauge to the work as shown in Fig nine The foot of the gauge resting against the end of the pivot the taper end of the gauge will locate accurately the position of the roller seat In order to locate the proper position for the seat for the balance proceed the same as for the roller except that the foot of the gauge is lowered until it is brought sufficiently below the plate to allow of the proper clearance as indicated by the dotted lines at H Now apply the gauge to the new staff as shown in Fig ten and the taper end will locate the exact position for the balance seat Illustration Fig nine Illustration Fig ten As previously stated I have taken it for granted that you preferred to finish all the lower portion of the staff while the work was held in the chuck I have assumed that you prefer to work in this way because I have noted the fact that nine watchmakers out of every ten start with and first finish up the lower portion of the staff Where this method of working originated I do not know but it always has the appearance to me of placing the cart before the horse I do not pretend to say that a true staff cannot be made in this way but it certainly is not the most convenient nor advisable We all know that the heaviest part of the staff is from the roller seat to the end of the top pivot Now it seems to me that it is the most natural thing in the world for a mechanic to desire to turn the greater bulk of his work before reversing it Now if the workman has been educated to turn indifferently with right or left hand it may make little difference as far as the actual turning is concerned whether he starts to work at the upper or lower end of the staff but unfortunately there are few among us who are so skilled as to use the graver with equal facility with either hand and it is therefore an advantage to start with the upper end as you can thus finish a greater portion of the work more readily You can readily see that when you come to reverse your staff and use the wax chuck that by starting at the top of staff your wax has a much larger surface of metal to cling to and again the shape of the balance seat is such as to secure the work firmly in the wax while if the reverse method is employed the larger portion of the balance seat is exposed and the staff is more liable to loosen from the motion of the lathe and pressure of the graver and polishers CHAPTER IV By the aid of the pinion calipers and the old staff the diameter of the roller seat and the balance and hair spring collet seats may be readily taken but it is perhaps better to gauge the holes as the old staff may not have been perfect in this respect A round broach will answer admirably for this purpose and the size may be taken from the broach by means of the calipers In fitting our pivots we can not be too exact and as yet no instrument has been placed upon the market for this purpose which is moderate in price and yet thoroughly reliable The majority of watchmakers use what is termed the pivot gauge a neat little instrument which accompanies the Jacot lathe and which may be obtained from any material house This tool which is shown in Fig eleven is however open to one objection in the measurement of pivots and that is that it may be pressed down at one time with greater force than at another and consequently will show a variation in two measurements of the same pivot Some of my readers may think that I am over particular on this point and that the difference in measurement on two occasions is too trivial to be worthy of attention but I do not think that too much care can be bestowed upon this part of the work and neglect in this particular is I think the cause of poor performance in many otherwise good timepieces The ordinarily accepted rule among watchmakers is that a pivot should be made one twenty five hundred of an inch smaller than the hole in the jewel to allow for the proper lubrication I am acquainted with watchmakers and men who are termed good workmen too who invariably allow one twenty five hundred of an inch side shake no matter whether the pivot is twelve twenty five hundred or sixteen twenty five hundred of an inch in diameter Now if one twenty five hundred of an inch is the proper side shake for a pivot measuring twelve twenty five hundred of an inch in diameter it is certainly not sufficient for a pivot which is one third larger Of course it is understood that side shakes do not increase in proportion according as the pivot increases in size for if they did a six inch shaft would require at this rate a side shake of one two inch or one four inch on each side which would be ridiculously out of all proportion as the one sixty four of an inch would be ample under any circumstances Neither can we arrive at the proper end shake for a pivot by reducing in proportion from the end shake allowed on a six inch shaft because if we followed out the same course of reasoning we would arrive at a point where a pivot measuring twelve twenty five hundred of an inch would require an end shake so infinitely small that it would require six figures to express the denominator of the fraction and the most minute measuring instrument yet invented would be incapable of recording the measurement We must leave sufficient side shake however on the smallest pivot and jewel for the globules of the oil to move freely and experiments have shown conclusively that one twenty five hundred of an inch or one five thousand on each side of the pivot is as little space as it is desirable to leave for that purpose as the globules of the best chronometer oil will refuse to enter spaces that are very much more minute But to return to our pivot gauge Illustration Fig eleven Illustration Fig twelve Each division on the gauge represents one twenty five hundred of an inch which is all that we require The diameter that the pivot should be can be ascertained by inserting a round pivot broach into the jewel and taking the measurement with the pivot gauge and then making the necessary deduction for side shake Slip the jewel on the broach as far as it will go as shown in Fig twelve and then with the pivot gauge take the size of the broach as close up to the jewel as you can measure and the taper of the broach will be about right for the side shake of the pivot If however you prefer to make the measurement still more accurate you can do so by dipping the broach into rouge before slipping on the jewel and then remove the jewel and the place which is occupied on the broach can be plainly discerned and the exact measurement taken and an allowance of one twenty five hundred of an inch made for the side shake Another method and one which is particularly applicable to Swiss watches where the jewel is burnished into the cock or plate is to first slip on to the broach a small flat piece of cork and as the broach enters the jewel the cork is forced farther on to the broach and when the jewel is removed it marks the place on the broach which its inner side occupied and the measurement can then be taken with the gauge If care is used in the selection of a broach that it be as nearly perfect in round and taper as possible by a little experiment you can soon ascertain just what part of the length of the broach corresponds to one degree on the gauge and by a repetition of the experiment the broach can then be divided accurately by very minute rings turned with a fine pointed graver into sections each representing one degree or one twenty five hundred of an inch and the measurement will thus be simplified greatly Illustration Fig thirteen As before stated much depends upon the condition of your gravers and the manner of using them It is of the utmost importance that they be kept sharp and as soon as they begin to show the slightest sign of losing their keenness you should sharpen them The proper shape for balance pivots was shown in Fig four Now let us examine into the best positions for holding the gravers In Fig thirteen two ways of holding the graver are shown A representing the right and B representing the wrong way If the graver is applied to the work as shown at A it will cut a clean shaving while if applied as shown at B it will simply scrape the side of the pivot and ruin the point of the graver without materially forwarding the work Again the holding of the graver as indicated at A has its advantages because the force of the cut is towards the hand holding it and should it catch from any cause the jar of the obstruction will be conveyed immediately to the hand and it will naturally give and no harm will be done If on the other hand the graver should meet with an obstruction while held in the position indicated at B the force of the cut will be in the direction of the arrow downward and toward the rest and the rest being unlike the hand or rather being rigid it cannot give and the result is that the work or graver or both are ruined In Fig fourteen two other methods of holding the graver are shown The general roughing out of a staff should be done with the graver held about as shown at A Fig thirteen but in finishing the graver should be held so that the cut is made diagonally as indicated at A Fig fourteen It is rather dificult to explain in print just how the graver should be held but a little experiment will suffice to teach the proper position The best indication that a graver is doing its work properly is the fact that the chips come away in long spiral coils Aim to see how light a cut you can make rather than how heavy Never use force in removing the material but depend entirely upon the keenness of the cutting edges Never use the point of the graver except where you are compelled to but rather use the right or left hand cutting edges By following out this rule you will find that your work when left by the graver requires little or no finishing up except at the pivots At B Fig fourteen is shown the correct manner of applying the graver when turning a pivot Hold the graver nearly on a line with the axis of the lathe and catching a chip at the extreme end of the pivot with the back edge of the graver push slightly forward and at the same time roll the graver towards you and it will give the pivot the desired conical form By keeping the graver on a line with the length of the pivot all the force applied is simply exerted in the direction of the chuck and does not tend to spring the pivot as it would were the extreme point applied as in Fig thirteen When we come to such places as the shoulder of the back slope the seat for the roller balance et cetera we must necessarily use the point of the graver Illustration Fig fourteen CHAPTER V In chapter IV I called attention to the right and wrong way of holding the graver while using the extreme point and also the correct manner of applying the graver in turning conical pivots I also called attention to the fact that it was well to only use the point of the graver where positively necessary as in the back slope of the pivot et cetera In turning the seat for the balance as indicated at A Fig fifteen the graver A Fig one or a similar one as shown at B Fig fifteen should be used The slope at C should now be turned In turning the pivot and seat for the roller you should leave them slightly larger than required to allow for the grinding and polishing which is to follow No definite amount can be left for this purpose because the amount left for polishing depends entirely on how smoothly your turning has been done If it has been done indifferently you may have to allow considerable for grinding and polishing before all the graver marks are removed while on the contrary if the work has been performed with care very little will have to be removed Avoid the use of the pivot file by performing your work properly to start with Illustration Fig fifteen Illustration Fig sixteen For grinding bell metal or soft iron slips are desirable and the grinding is effected by means of oil stone powder and oil Two slips of metal similar in shape to A and B Fig sixteen are easily made and will be found very useful A is for square pivots et cetera while B is used for conical pivots These slips should be dressed with a dead smooth file the filing to be done crosswise to hold the oil stone powder and oil During the operation of grinding the lathe should be run at a high speed and the slips applied to the work lightly squarely and carefully The polishing is effected by means of diamantine and alcohol After the work is brought to a smooth gray surface slips of boxwood of the shape shown in Fig sixteen should be substituted for the metal slips Oil stone slips are sometimes used in lieu of metal ones but they soon get out of shape and are troublesome to care for on this account All things considered there is nothing better for polishing than a slip or file made of agate say one inch long one quarter inch wide and one eighth inch thick A slip of this kind can be obtained from any lapidary and after grinding with emery and water until the surface has a very fine grain it should be mounted by fastening with cement into a brass socket and this is then inserted into a small wooden handle as shown in Fig seventeen The agate slip should be ground to about the shape of B Fig sixteen so that one side can be used for square corners and the other for conical pivots The final polish can soon be imparted by means of a small boxwood slip or flattened peg wood and diamantine and alcohol Never try to bring out the final polish until you are satisfied that all graver marks have been ground out otherwise you will simply have to go all over the work again Illustration Fig seventeen When the staff is finished from the lower pivot to the seat of the balance the upper part should be roughed out nearly to size and then cut off preparatory to finishing the top part Attention was previously called to the fact that the majority of watchmakers prefer to finish all the lower portion of the staff first notwithstanding the fact that there are numerous advantages to be gained by proceeding to first finish up the upper portion We have now reached the point where the wax chuck must be used and perhaps these advantages may be now more clearly defined In order that the two procedures may be more distinctly shown illustrations of both methods are here given Fig eighteen shows the popular method the lower portion of the staff being all completed and fastened by means of wax in the wax chuck Fig nineteen shows the opposite course of procedure In both illustrations the lines indicate the amount of wax applied to hold the work It will be noted that in Fig eighteen the hub of the staff is enclosed in the wax very much as a cork is fitted into a bottle while in Fig nineteen the hub is reversed just as a cork would appear were the larger portion within the bottle and the smaller portion protruding through the neck A study of the diagram will readily show that in Fig nineteen the staff is held more rigidly in place and that a greater bulk of the work is enclosed in the wax than in Fig eighteen although there is less wax used in the former than in the latter Illustration Fig eighteen Illustration Fig nineteen Before proceeding to set the staff in the wax it is necessary to make some measurements to determine its full length Remove both cap jewels and screw the balance cock in place Examine the cock and see if it has at any time been bent up or down or punched to raise or lower it If so rectify the error by straightening it and then put it in place Now with a degree gauge or calipers proceed to take the distance between the outer surfaces of the hole jewels and shorten the staff to the required length Do not remove too much but leave the staff a little long rather than cut it too short as the length can be shortened later Illustration Fig twenty Illustration Fig twenty one A very handy tool for the purpose of making these length measurements can be constructed by adding a stop screw to the common double calipers as shown in Fig twenty The improvement consists in the fact that they can be opened to remove from the work and closed again at exactly the same place so that an accurate measurement can be made The all important point in the use of wax chucks is to get a perfect center If you are not careful you are liable to leave a small projection in the center as shown at A Fig twenty one The ordinary wax chuck cannot be unscrewed from the spindle and restored to its proper place again with anything like a certainty of its being exactly true and if you insist on doing this there is no remedy left but finding a new center each time It will be found more satisfactory and economical in the long run to have a permanent chuck for a wax chuck and you will then have no necessity for removing the brass chuck The center or cone for the reception of the pivot should be turned out with the graver at an angle of about sixty deg and such a graver as is shown at B Fig one will answer admirably for this purpose After you have carefully centered your wax chuck place a small alcohol lamp under the chuck and heat it until the wax will just become fluid and yet not be hot enough to burn the wax Revolve the lathe slowly and insert the staff so that the pivot rests squarely and firmly in the center Now re heat the chuck carefully in order that the wax may adhere firmly to the staff keeping the lathe revolving meanwhile but not so fast that the wax will be drawn from the center and at the same time apply the forefinger to the end of the staff as shown in Figs eighteen and nineteen and gently press it squarely into place in the wax chuck The lines in Figs eighteen and nineteen designate about the right amount of wax after the work is ready but it is well to add a little more than is shown in those figures and you should be careful to keep the wax of equal bulk all around or when it cools it will have a tendency to draw the staff to one side Now remove the lamp and keep the lathe revolving until the wax is quite cool when it should be removed by means of a graver down to the dimensions designated by the lines in Figs eighteen and nineteen When this is accomplished re heat a little but only enough to make it soft but not liquid and placing a sharpened peg wood on the tool rest proceed to the final truing up by resting the pointed end against the hub CHAPTER VI I have described above one of the methods in vogue for holding a staff by means of wax It is the common method employed by most watch repairers the popular method so to speak The method which I am now about to describe may seem awkward at first to those who have not practiced it but once you have fairly tried it you will never be contented to work in any other way The first requisite is a true taper chuck and it is well to purchase an extra one to be used solely for this purpose so that you will be prepared at all times for staff work Select a good steel taper and having placed your chuck in the lathe see if your taper fits well by inserting it in the chuck while running slowly If it fits well it will be marked almost throughout its length Insert again in the chuck and with a few light taps of the hammer set it firmly in place so that you know that there is no danger of its working loose The taper will then project about three quarters of an inch from the face of the chuck By means of a sharp graver make the face of the taper smooth and straight and cut off the taper end Now mark a point on the taper about one fourth of an inch from the end and proceed to turn down the diameter from this point to the end leaving that portion of the taper about two thirds of its original diameter and finish with a nice square shoulder Now with a long pointed sharp graver proceed to cut a nice V shaped center with an angle of about sixty deg When you have proceeded thus far you will find that you have an implement resembling that shown in Fig twenty two Illustration Fig twenty two Care must be taken that the center is quite true and that no projection is left like that illustrated in Fig twenty one no matter how minute it may be Now examine the center by the aid of a strong glass and after you are satisfied with its appearance proceed to test it Take a large sized pin with a good point and placing the point in the center maintain it in position by pressing upon the head and while revolving the lathe slowly proceed to examine by means of your glass If the center is a good one there will be no perceptible vibration of the pin Now procure a piece of small brass tubing with an internal diameter a little less than that of the turned down portion of your taper If the brass tubing cannot be procured readily you can substitute a piece of brass wire a little larger than the taper and by means of a drill a little smaller in diameter than the turned down portion you can readily make a small tube about one half inch long Now by means of a broach proceed to open the tube to a point one quarter inch from one end and carefully fit it on the turned down portion of your taper After fitting tightly to the shoulder of the taper proceed to turn out the other end until it will take in the hub of your staff easily and leave a little room to spare Now turn your tube down in length until a little of the hub is exposed either way you put the staff in Turn the outside of the tube smooth and to correspond with the outline of the taper so you will have a nice looking job when completed Just below where the hub will come drill a small hole in the tube and remove all burr both inside and out that may have been made in drilling so that the shellac or wax will not adhere to it This little hole acts as an outlet for the air in the tube and as the hot shellac enters at the end of the tube the air is expelled through this vent It also helps to hold the cement firmly in place Now try your staff in the tube again and be sure that it is quite free and that you will be able to work on the portions of it above and below the hub according as one end or the other is inserted You are now ready to insert your staff and proceed with your work Hold your shellac in the flame of your lamp a moment until it is quite liquid and then smear both the inside and outside of the tube with it Heat the shell or tube gently by means of the lamp keeping the lathe revolving slowly all the while and taking the staff in your tweezers proceed to insert it carefully into the tube Press firmly back making sure that it has reached the bottom of the V shaped center Pack the cement well in around the staff and while centering remove the lamp and allow the whole to cool keeping the whole revolving until quite cool Now remove the superfluous cement by means of the graver and heating the tube again slightly proceed to center exactly by means of a pointed peg wood resting on your T rest to steady it Turn slowly in the lathe and examine with glass to see that it is quite true Your completed instrument will resemble Fig twenty three Illustration Fig twenty three The advantage of the device is that your center is always ready and all you have to do is to insert your chuck in the lathe warm it and you are ready to insert your staff and proceed to work As I said in the first place it is well to employ a taper chuck exclusively for this work and not attempt to use it for any other for if you try to remove your taper and replace it again you will surely find that your work is out of center and you will be compelled to remove the brass shell and find a new center each time you use it You can avoid all this trouble however by purchasing an extra chuck and devoting it exclusively to wax work Of course the brass shell can be removed and placed in position again without in any way affecting the truth of the center and any number shape and size of shells can be made to fit the one taper and these shells will be found very useful for holding a variety of work aside from balance staffs CHAPTER VII The two popular methods of holding a balance staff in wax have been described and illustrated the reader may take his choice The turning and finishing of the other end of the staff is performed as previously described That portion on which the hair spring collet goes should be turned to nearly the proper size making due allowance for the grinding and polishing that is to come The balance seat should be slightly undercut so that the balance can be driven on tightly and all riveting dispensed with The size for the pivot can be determined from its jewel as previously described Finish the ends of the pivots flat and round the corners off slightly and right here comes a point worthy of consideration in all watch work Leave no absolutely square corners in any of your work but round them off very slightly This may seem a very little thing but it is one of the small things that go to make up first class work You can judge pretty accurately of a watchmaker by the corners he leaves on his work as well as by the appearance of his gravers and screw drivers When your staff is completed and nicely polished remove from the wax and boil in alcohol to clean and when dried it is ready for the balance Great care must be exercised in removing the balance from the old staff especially if it be a compensation balance that you do not distort it any way If the balance has been riveted on extra care will have to be exercised The riveting may be cut by means of a graver or a hollow drill made from Stubb s steel wire The recess in the drill should just fit over the shoulder left for the reception of the hair spring collet The edge of the hollow drill has small teeth formed upon it similar to a fine file and will cut quite rapidly After removing the balance if it appears to be sprung in the arms the result of removal or previous bad treatment proceed to bend them straight and then to true up the rim carefully and stake on with a flat end punch Now put on your roller and drive it down to the hub and see that the roller is free from the fork See that jewel pin reaches fork properly and that the guard pin also reaches the roller See that your balance is free from the plate and the bridge If the balance is true and all right you are ready to put on your hair spring See that it is in beat It is well to make a mark on the balance before taking off the old staff showing positions of hair spring stud and jewel pin Three quarter plate English lever and Swiss lever balance staffs differ only in detail except that they are sprung under balances The general operations for making however are similar to those described I have not described the method of poising the balance for two reasons first the mere poising of a balance for a cheap movement is so simple that it needs no explanation and second to describe the poising of the balance of a fine watch is a lengthy task and can hardly be included under the heading of staffing and pivoting The ground has been thoroughly and conscientiously covered by mister J L Finn in a little volume entitled Poising the Balance A and I would advise all watchmakers both young and old to read what he has to say Good pivoting is an art in itself and although there are many who undertake to do this work there are but few who can pivot a staff in such a manner that it will bear close inspection under the glass We often hear watchmakers brag of the secrets they possess for hardening pivot drills but I fancy they would be somewhat surprised if they traveled around a little to find how many watchmakers harden their drills in exactly the same way that they do The great secret so called of making good drills is to first secure good steel and then use care to see that you do not burn it in the subsequent operations The fewer times the steel is heated the better My experience teaches me that you can do no better than to select some nice pieces of Stubb s steel for your pivot drills Many watchmakers make their drills from sewing needles say No three or four sharps The steel in these needles is usually of good quality but the great drawback is that a drill made from a needle will not resist any great pressure and is liable to break just at the time that you have arrived at the most important point If your drill is made from a piece of Stubb s steel wire or an old French or Swiss graver you not only know that the material in it is first class but you can leave the base of the drill solid and substantial with enough metal in it to resist considerable pressure The part of the drill which actually enters the pivot is very short and the end can be turned down to the desired diameter Turn or reduce your wire by means of a pivot file so as to be smooth and conical as shown at A Fig twenty four The conical form is given to the drill for exactly the same reason that it is given to the balance pivots because it gives additional strength Heat to a very pale red for about one half inch from the end and then spread the point as shown at B Fig twenty four by a slight blow of the hammer We are now ready to temper our drill and we must exercise a little care that the steel is not burnt and that the drill is not bent or warped when hardening The flame of the alcohol lamp should be reduced as small as possible or otherwise the steel may become overheated and lose all its good qualities If needles are used for making drills there is a great liability of their warping when hardening but when a larger piece of wire is used there is not much danger if care is exercised in introducing the drill that it goes into the compound straight and point foremost If a needle is used it is well to construct a shield for it to be used when heating and hardening This shield can be made from a small piece of metal tubing broached out to fit loosely over the shank and point of the drill The drill is introduced into this shield as shown in Fig twenty five and a little soap may be introduced into the end a before plunging Various hardening devices are used but in my experience beeswax or sealing wax will be found as good as any Heat the drill or if a needle the drill and shield both to a pale red and plunge straight into the wax In the latter case where the shield is used the shield on striking the wax will run up the shank of the drill allowing the point to pierce the wax Some watchmakers introduce the extreme point of the drill into mercury first and then plunge into the wax This hardens the extreme point of the drill very hard so hard in fact that it will penetrate the hardest steel but care must be exercised with such a drill because the mercury makes it not only very hard but very brittle C Fig twenty four shows a drill after it has been finished on the Arkansas stone This shape of drill will withstand the pressure necessary to drill into hard steel Many watchmakers reduce the temper of every staff before drilling This I think is quite unnecessary There are very few cases in which it is necessary to reduce the temper of the staff and even then it should only be reduced as far as it is to be drilled and then not in excess of a good spring temper Illustration Fig twenty four Illustration Fig twenty five The centering of a staff in wax has been thoroughly described and in pivoting the proceeding is the same as in staffing After accurately centering your work make a small cut in the center for the reception of the drill and make this mark deep enough to take the entire cutting head of the drill Keep the drill firmly pressed into this center and kept wet constantly with turpentine Do not revolve the work all one way but give the lathe an alternating motion At first give but a third or a half revolution each way until the drill begins to bite into the staff when you can then safely give it a full revolution each way Care must be exercised however not to give the work too rapid a motion for if you do the friction is apt to draw down the temper of your drill Many watchmakers find that their drills cut well for a certain distance and then refuse to work altogether and one of the chief reasons is that they are in too great a hurry with their drilling If you find it absolutely necessary to reduce the hardness of your staff before drilling do so by drilling a hole in the end of a small piece of copper wire that will just fit over the part to be softened and apply the heat to this copper wire say one fourth of an inch from the staff The heat will run down the copper wire and heat the staff just where you wish to draw the temper Be careful and do not draw the temper too much nor let it extend down the staff too far The plug for the new pivot should be carefully made perfectly round with a very little taper and should be draw filed before being driven in Some workmen dip the plug in acid before driving in as they declare that the pivot is less liable to be loosened while turning if so treated The acid simply rusts the pivot and the hole but I cannot see that this will hold it any more firmly in place while finishing If the taper is a gradual one and the pivot a good close fit there will be little danger of it loosening while dressing to shape If too great a taper is given to the plug there is danger of splitting the end of the staff and this involves the making of an entire new staff The turning up of a new pivot does not differ in any way from the instructions given for turning pivots on a new staff With a little care both in turning and finishing a new pivot can be put in so nicely that only the initiated can tell it and then only with the aid of a strong glass In pivoting cylinders there is some danger of breaking them To avoid this select a piece of joint wire the opening of which is slightly larger than the diameter of the cylinder at the lower end and cut off a piece the length of the cylinder proper leaving the pivot projecting Now fill the cylinder with lathe wax and while the wax is warm slip on the joint wire You can now proceed to true up the pivot in the usual manner and when the wax is quite cold proceed to turn and polish the pivot before removing from the lathe If the joint wire is properly cemented on the cylinder it is almost impossible to break it After all the work is done the wax can be dissolved in alcohol In pivoting pinions to cylinder escape wheels and third wheels it is not necessary to remove the wheels but great care should be used in handling In the latter case use plenty of wax Do all your centering by the outside of the pinion Perfect centering and sharp tools are requisite to good pivoting Do not try to rush your work especially while drilling Proceed deliberately with your work and aim to restore the watch to the condition it was in originally and you will find staffing and pivoting is not half as hard as some workmen would have you believe Footnote A POISING THE BALANCE by J L Finn Geo K Hazlitt company publishers Chicago End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of A Treatise on Staff Making and
